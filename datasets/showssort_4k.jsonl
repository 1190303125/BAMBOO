I was supposed to be in milan this week, but when maxie reached out and explained that the date of the nurses ball had been moved up to sync with the hospital\u2019s 60th anniversary, well, milan had to wait. There was no way I was gonna miss this. Oh, we are so glad that you adjusted your schedule. I mean, tonight is a very special evening, and you make it even better. Ok. Let\u2019s get down to business. Who are you wearing? Cartullo. Maha cheng. Well chosen. And you both should be congratulated for your fashion and for staging this spectacular event in record time. Quite an achievement. Well, bobbie and i have followed the example set by lucy coe through many successful years of the nurses ball. It\u2019s safe to say lucy\u2019s spirit is guiding us tonight. I only hope we can make her proud. Thank you, maxie. That is so sweet. Ok. Credit where credit is due.

The best nurses ball ever without me? I don\u2019t think so. Next year, we\u2019re gonna walk down this red carpet, and you are going to be the envy of every fashionista here to manhattan.

Your mom looks gorgeous tonight.\tSo, carly, I know there\u2019s been some changes for you in the last year.\tMm, a few. Well, you seem to be weathering them in style. Well, what can I say? With my mother and my daughter by my side and the love and support of my family and friends, I\u2019m up for any challenge. Mm, well, everyone knows you\u2019re a fighter, carly. Any interest in reclaiming any of what was once yours? Well, to quote a great man, \u201csuccess is not final. \u201cFailure is not fatal. It is the courage to continue that counts.\u201d Poetic but short on details. Look, I\u2019ve always truly gotten whatever I wanted, and I don\u2019t expect that to change. Uh-huh.

I get that drew and your mom can\u2019t go public because of the whole insider trading thing, but I sure hope that she\u2019s better at hiding her feelings than he is.

Ok, so let\u2019s go look for her. I do not have time to talk to you right now. Maxie, ooh, do not hang up. Do not ignore me or else. Maxie. Call me after we wrap.\tOoh. I will not be ignored!\t[Sighs] Oh. Yeah. You know, our little girl can sleep through almost anything, that is until 2:00 A.M.

Tomorrow\u2019s a big day, and you need all your strength. I don\u2019t want to think about tomorrow and the procedure.

That\u2019s right. I am back and flying solo tonight. It is my pleasure to interview the arrivals, critique their fashion, and get a little down low on their personal lives. But first I want to pay tribute to general hospital itself, which opened its doors on april 1, 1963. That\u2019s right, ladies and gentlemen. Our beloved general hospital is 60 years old. Oh, this place has meant so much to so many over the years, myself included, and I am honored to be here to celebrate its 60th anniversary. On a more somber note, tonight is dedicated to the life of the late head nurse epiphany johnson and the late lucy coe, whose time here at the nurses ball was more than an event. It was her life\u2019s work. Oh. They love me. They really love me. So anyway, don\u2019t change that dial there, port charles. Leave it right where it is because I can promise you this.

He\u2019s very valuable to a lot of people. Understood. Mm-hmm.

I\u2019m so sorry to interrupt but, doc, you seem to have forgotten that you have plans tonight. You, me, and the nurses ball. Right. I really want to. I\u2019m not sure how to manage this. Dr. Robinson just asked me to do a consult. Oh, no, no, no. Go. Make yourself handsome. You have to walk the red carpet. You have to make a splashy entrance. Don\u2019t want to be late. She sounds like a woman with a very specific plan. It\u2019s ok. I can hold down the fort. Ok. Thanks. I\u2019ll be right back. So why aren\u2019t you ditching that lab coat and slipping into your sexiest gown? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I won\u2019t be going. Curtis will be there, and that\u2019s why I picked up a shift tonight. Curtis filed for divorce. No. No. Not that I know of. Well, then he\u2019s still your husband, isn\u2019t he?

Why thank you. I mean it. Any time. Yeah.

Well, sonny, hospitals are for sick people. Uh-huh. And lucky for me, I\u2019m not sick. Right, right. So why don\u2019t you let me buy you a drink? Michael, my son. We were j\u2013 michael. Eddie.

I mean, look. This \u2014 even if \u2014 if ned\u2019s responsible, he doesn\u2019t even know who he is. Yeah, that\u2019s convenient for ned and the worst possible outcome for drew.

You know, we\u2019re not spending his last night in port charles together, so\u2026 he told us that you insisted that he spend his last night with charlotte before he left for chechnya with kevin and me. Yeah, okay, so, apparently this is coming as a shock to all of you, but I am not very good company right now. Anna. Look. I have been enlisted to get you to come along to this club tonight. Now, the basic idea was valentin\u2019s, and you know how much I despise him. So why don\u2019t you come along and endure it? If I can do it, you can do it. That sounds like a lovely invitation.

So if he chose holly, why did she leave town? I have no idea. Well, did robert say that he chose holly? No. He just didn\u2019t call and he didn\u2019t write. Ergo, he was at home nursing a broken heart. And as you know, I am nobody\u2019s rebound. And as you know, I don\u2019t wait by the phone. Hell no, you don\u2019T. Mm-hmm.

But I imagine that you learned about his true motives from audra?\tVictoria: No, actually, i talked with tucker about it myself.\tDevon: Oh, you did? That\u2019s interesting.

I mean, I know that you\u2019re loyal to devon, and clearly he trusts you if he said it was fine for you to stay while we were chatting.\tIt\u2019s probably because I know you both so well, and he didn\u2019t think it would do any harm.\tLily: Yeah. Well, I just really felt like I found a win-win situation for us. I mean, he gets to keep the name and get paid handsomely, and we get to move forward with the ipo.

You\u2019ve been making some interesting choices lately at newman media. I hope you don\u2019t regret hiring nate and audra, since they both betrayed chancellor-winters.\tVictoria: I\u2019m sorry there\u2019s a rift between you and nate.\tDevon: Are you?\tVictoria: Yes, of course I am. I know how important family is, and I know how tricky family business can be.\t", "Lily: Yeah, well, too bad it didn\u2019t work.\tAbby: I disagree. I mean, after listening to devon, I understand his perspective. Hamilton-winters means so much to him, and it would be awful for him to lose it to some ipo that he never supported in the first place.\tLily: Yeah, but do you realize how ugly a lawsuit could become? I mean, you think there\u2019s hurt feelings and resentment now. Imagine what going to court would do.\tAbby: Honestly, I don\u2019t know why you and jill don\u2019t just accept devon\u2019s decision. Chancellor industries was huge before it ever merged with hamilton-winters. So why don\u2019t you just go back to that? And why are you willing to fight your brother for something that\u2019s dollars and cents to you, but it means everything to devon? I think it says more about your priorities than anything else.\tLily: [ Chuckles ] How dare you question my priorities? To you, it may just be an elevator.\tLily: Who are you to tell me that I care more about my business than my family?

I\u2019m not trying to get you to convince him to not fight for his company. I\u2019m trying to convince him to stay at chancellor-winters.\tAbby: Devon has made it clear \u2014 drop the ipo.\tLily: Jill is not gonna go for that. She\u2019s not. The whole reason for this merger was to have our family work together. And I\u2019ve already lost nate, and now I feel like I\u2019m losing devon. And he\u2019s saying that he wants to protect our father\u2019s legacy. Like, he\u2019s my father, too. Of course I want to protect his legacy. And he doesn\u2019t realize that if we go to court over this, it could damage hamilton-winters. And I don\u2019t think he\u2019s considering that risk.\tAbby: Have you said this to your brother?\t", "Devon: Bet you do.\tVictoria: Speaking of family, how are things going with tucker?\tDaniel: Thank you.

I\u2019m always tidy with evidence of a crime, especially when I\u2019m in on it. You are not in on a crime. Stefan was trying to drug me. All we did was turn the tables on. And what did that Astra ever do to you? Uh, it\u2019s a house plant in the Dira living room. Okay. It\u2019s been doused with poisons and mine alling drugs since it was a seedling.\tAnd it\u2019s not an Astra. Well, I like saying Astra. Mm-hmm. , you know, I\u2019ve been thinking about that unexpected call from Gabby. I\u2019ve decided it is a stroke of good fortune. So we are drugging Stefan to make him seem unfit to serve as Damira, C E o. So Gaby is actually the perfect witness to his first little episode.\tYeah, I mean, he really was excited to see her with a kid on his first date, but, If that drug works the way we think it will, it might spoil the mood. Oh, come on. Catastrophic first dates a romantic staple, down the road. Both of those kids will look back on this and laugh.\tare you sure you\u2019re okay? Fine. I\u2019m just a little dizzy. You have that effect on me.\tGabby\u2019s not at Ari\u2019s school. She lied to me. My wife lied to me.\t", "Maybe he\u2019ll think it\u2019s Gabby\u2019s perfume. I know. It gives me a headache. Oh, the lingering effects of Dr. Roll\u2019s treatment.\tEj, you don\u2019t think the drug. I don\u2019t know too permanent damage. Steve, you? No, I don\u2019t think he would risk that with me anymore than I would risk it with him. I\u2019m just going to screw with his head until he makes enough mistakes to justify Stephan being booted it out there. Did I just hear you say you\u2019re planning to boot Uncle Stephan from the company?\tBrady, my joining you and Rachel for lunch today. I\u2019m not sure. That\u2019s a good idea. Fuck on it. It is a good idea. She just, Rachel just lost her mom. She, she lost her grandmother. I think it would be nice for, to have a, a woman to talk to, you know, to turn.\tHey. Hi sweetie. I missed you last night. I missed you too, daddy. Hi Rachel. My daddy was at jail last night. It\u2019s all your fault.\tSo you\u2019re offering to be my lawyer? Yeah. Don\u2019t thank me or anything. No, I\u2019m just trying to figure out why . I take it, you haven\u2019t seen Lady Whistleblower\u2019s latest column in The Spectator? No, my subscription, it ran out. So who is this lady? Whoever you said, it\u2019s Leo Stark\u2019s gossip column. Check it out.\tAccording to my sources, the savvy Solicitor says she\u2019s enjoying the best sex of her life. With a Defrock priest. What? Geez. I mean, I\u2019m flattered, but Yeah. Well, she wasn\u2019t that far off the mark. And yes, Eric, I am still furious with you, but maybe I admit I was a little hasty when I ended things so fast since I find myself missing all the fun we had together.\tAnd I\u2019m not talking about the good clean time either. Oh, come on Eric. I know you miss a deal, and if you do, I think we can work out a deal.\tI\u2019m not sure what you think. You heard, John, I think I heard you say that you wanted Stephan to make enough mistakes for you to be able to push him out of Dera. Is that what I heard him say? Well, the fact is your Uncle Stephan has made a. A serious one. Remember that vial of drugs you found at the Yahu and you thought was mine?\t", "If I had a white flag, I\u2019d be waving it. Jing one. I\u2019m sorry. I I I thought you had left. I, oh, so you just wanted to trash my apartment? Not causing me bodily harm. Are you hurt? Tell me you\u2019re not hurt. No, I\u2019m fine. See, I\u2019m worried about whatever happened to my brother with ice water in his veins. Gabby, I found out she lied.\tHey, what did she lie about? She said she couldn\u2019t spend the day with me because she had a mix up at Ariana\u2019s school, and so I called the school and found out Gabby had made it all up, which I suspected. In fact, I knew she did, so I tracked her phone. You. No wonder she lies to you. You\u2019re stalking her.\tShe\u2019s my wife and right now she\u2019s in the park and I know exactly who she\u2019s with. You sure you\u2019re okay? Yeah. Yeah. I\u2019m fine. I am. I am very happy to be here with you and happy that we are finally back together. Yeah, it\u2019s great. You don\u2019t sound like you think it\u2019s great. No, I mean, we\u2019re, we\u2019re together. We\u2019re here sitting at the park together, but we\u2019re not together.\tNot the way we should be. Okay. Not to spoil the moment here, but whose fault is that, Lee? Everything is Lee\u2019s fault. Not to spoil alone again, but Lee did not hitch over the head with his club take you back to his cave for six months. Luke chose to stay married to him to live with him.\tYou don\u2019t love what? No, of course I don\u2019t love him. How could I love somebody that\u2019s said horrible things to you? To us? Okay then why\u2019d you agree to his? Because he made me an offer I can refuse.\tWell, whatever drug Stefan was going to give you doesn\u2019t affect house plants. At least not immediately anyway, but it will work on him. Stefan wasn\u2019t about to dose me with something that wasn\u2019t going to. Which is something of a problem. How so? Well, as we discussed before, Stefan knows all about this drug and its effects, meaning he might start to get suspicious when he\u2019s experiencing them.\t", "Yeah. It wasn\u2019t. It was your Uncle Stephans.\tSo Lee gave you his Demari shares in exchange for six more months of marriage. That\u2019s right. And you agreed I did. Uh, so it\u2019s more like a, uh, limited partnership than, right. You negotiated the terms. So it\u2019s, it\u2019s kinda like a holding company, right? With a clear designation of duties and, uh, revenues. So really, it, it\u2019s more like a, a, ah, what is it, short term merger than a marriage.\tYou wanna know if we\u2019re having sex? Yeah. I wanna know if you\u2019re having. No, it\u2019s off the table. Not happening, wasn\u2019t negotiated. Uh, Lee says he is doing this to show me how much he loves me, that he\u2019s committed to me, and that really puts me in the driver\u2019s seat. He can\u2019t do anything to upset me at all.\tRight. And I, I did this because I was feeling rejected by you. I really thought that you weren\u2019t ever gonna be over. Chloe and Lee pointed out accurately that he could hold up this divorce for longer than six months, and I wouldn\u2019t have the shares So, It, there just didn\u2019t seem to be a downside at the time, but now there is.\tAnd that is, are you kidding me too? I, I wanna be with you, so obviously I\u2019m gonna tell Lee that he, he can take his six months and his shares and shove where the sun don\u2019t shine.\tOkay. So you beg for like six. To prove your love and devotion. And then on day two or something, you start stalking her. I can\u2019t lose her. No, you don\u2019t have her. You don\u2019t own her. I don\u2019t want to own her.

Let me look at my beautiful girl. I thought you were in the Caribbean sailing around with Ben and Little Bow.\tYeah, I was, uh, up until a few hours ago we docked and um, I got a motel and I happened to call Sean and he told me that you were about an hour away.\tWow. What a coincidence, huh? Yeah. Yeah. I\u2019m so thrilled to see you. Yeah. Oh my gosh. But wait a second. I\u2019m a little confused about this because this is a secured facility. How the heck did you get in here?\tWell, uh, I am my mother\u2019s daughter after all.\tMm-hmm. ,\tI convinced Cousin Andrew to give me clearance.\tYeah, that turns out I did it just in time.

It is absolutely not.\tOkay.\tAnd I just know that daddy would be rolling over in his grave if he could see you right now.\tWe weren\u2019t expecting this.\tRolf told me that Megan was trying to bring back a lost love, but honestly, I never, I never thought it was possible. Miracle, miracle.\tWhat happened?\tOh. Tried to inject me with his sedative and gave her a taste of her own medicine.\tOh, they just love needles around here, don\u2019t they?

Kimberly wasn\u2019t having any lucks, so he signed up for E C T.\tReally?\tYeah. And a bunch of his memories came back, including the location of the facility where he originally underwent the conditioning.\u00a0 He thinks that\u2019s where Megan could be held up and with any. John and Steve could be closing in on her right now.\tI\u2019m surprised you don\u2019t wanna be a part of that. Don\u2019t you wanna find her, bring her back?\tWell, I have no doubt that John and Steve can get that done.

So I, I suggested Paris from reel, but uh, her heart was set on the emerald aisle.\tAnd why was that?\tMight be hard to believe, but Kate admitted to me that she liked being a breed.\tWhat\u2019s not to like ? Well, we don\u2019t live in mansions. We don\u2019t run billion dollar companies, but we do have people in.\tShe wanted to know where they came from. She told me that an historian once described us as ego temper and stubbornness mixed with charm, warmth. That would shine through adversity.\tHmm. Sounds a lot like Kate.\tActually. I told her that. I told her that, but in her case I would\u2019ve to add stunningly. Beautiful. Anyway, Austin and Billiw are gonna meet me over there and we will scatter Kate Ashes.

Just tell me that you are using him to get information.\tI, he\u2019s already filled as a possible location.\u00a0 In fact, John and your uncle Steve are checking it out right now as we speak.\tOkay. All right. So you got him to give up his boss. That\u2019s very nice work, mom. But did you have to do it by literally kissing him on,\tstop it just. Stop for one minute and listen to me. Harris is not the same man.\tHarris is a monster who we both know is very skilled at deception.\u00a0 He might still be on your side, but he also might be loyal to Megan mom. He sometimes three women to their deaths already. Do you really wanna be one of them?\tCan you hear me?\u00a0 Oh, if this really is, shoot, come on.

See, that\u2019s why he\u2019s in the hospital bed because he collapsed after undergoing a very painful course of shock therapy.\tYou made him do that?\tNo, I did not. He volunteered. Judicial treatments weren\u2019t working, so he consented to a more dangerous method that could have killed him.\u00a0 It nearly did kill him and thank God he\u2019s okay.\tHe\u2019s been completely deed mom.\tYou don\u2019t know that for sure.\tI do know that. I was there. I watched the entire session and I was there and I watched him pretend to be in love with you when he was actually an assassin. Plus, oh my God, home. Please, please wake up.\u00a0 Just because he got zapped a couple times doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s changed. Do you know what Navy sealed training entails? He can withstand anything.\tCiara, I understand that. He told us where he thinks Megan is.\tOkay. Those could just be some random coordinates on a map.

My daughter as this stubborn as her father was, you\u2019re not gonna change your mind.\tThat\u2019s fine, because I agree with everything she said\twe\u2019re well.

First of all, Steven, I, we found Megan Hathaway. Did you kill her? No. No, but she\u2019s in custody. She\u2019s paying for what she did. Not enough.

Well, of course he is. Apparently he has an ironclad alibi and Brady said Kristen sold him a bill of goods about Megan Recanting in the Nu Recanting.\tYour story. So all this is tracking. There\u2019s something else you should know. Steve went to look for Kayla. Now he\u2019s missing as well. Damn. So Megan took Kate from me now once, but twice.

I did not.\tThe, the word he is arrested Thomas Banks and he insists he didn\u2019t kidnap Kayla. That he didn\u2019t kill Kate Roberts. Well, what else is he gonna say?

But back to us, our deal was based on you supplying information that would lead us to Kayla, but you didn\u2019t supply information.\tInstead, you lied through your teeth.

You\u2019re asking me to seduce her and, and then break her heart.\tYou\u2019re right, Chanel. I wasn\u2019t comfortable on our date and um, I owe it to you to tell you why.\tNicole. Oh, Anna. Hi. Hi. I just. Just came up to see if you\u2019re feeling better today. Physically. I\u2019m fine emotionally. I\u2019m not so sure. Honey, what\u2019s wrong? EJ found out about my secret. You mean the secret? The one you shared with me a few weeks ago? Yeah, that one. Yeah. Honestly, EJ didn\u2019t hear it from me. I didn\u2019t.\tI didn\u2019t tell his soul. Not even Tony, Anna. No, you have to believe me, honey. I honestly would never betray your trust that way, Anna. That\u2019s okay. I know it wasn\u2019t you. It was that. Ah, awful. Sloan Peterson. Eric,\tI hope you know that I, I didn\u2019t tell EJ about you and Nicole out of spite. Oh, God\u2019s honest truth. I really thought he knew. I get that.\tSloan, I appreciate you being so understanding and and trusting because I know you\u2019re a kind and loyal person, and you would never cheat on me if you hadn\u2019t been out of your mind as you put it, that only EJ would\u2019ve had a similar reaction.\tAh, Tony old chap looks like it is going to be a beautiful day. I hope you and Anna will be able to go outside and enjoy it. Well, you seem to be in a good mood today. Why wouldn\u2019t I be? Well, I\u2019m just glad that you\u2019re no longer brooding. Have that secret Nicole\u2019s keeping from you. Oh, then actually I found out what that is.\t", "I mean, I\u2019m so sorry. No, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m fine. Fine. How is this fine. You were assaulted Eric. I mean, this could have all been avoided, had Nicole just told EJ herself. You, you guys did nothing wrong. Okay. I mean, this only happened because those biscuits were drugs. I mean, it didn\u2019t mean anything. Right. Yeah, right.\tGod, if EJ would just stop targeting you and he would just turn his focus to Chanel, the Demonn Baker of Salem. I mean, thank God the Health Department shut her down before she killed someone. You know, the health Department shut down my baby\u2019s bakery even though, you know, had nothing to do with those tainted biscuits.\tI know that. I\u2019m sorry. I feel terrible for everything junior family are going through. Oh. How you feel? Doesn\u2019t help me rap. I need you to do get up there and arrest the Luna. Tickle who\u2019s trying to ruin our lives. As I have said before, I can\u2019t do anything without evidence. Where\u2019s your damn evidence? Okay.\tYeah. It\u2019s from a block number, probably a burner phone. Well, of course that woman\u2019s not stupid enough to use her own phone. Yeah. Which is why there is no proof that Sloan sent it, and why we can\u2019t be sure that someone else isn\u2019t responsible for this. The tainted biscuits, the trashing of your office and the threatening messages.\tOh, no, no, not this, not this again. Are you really going to waste more of my time and your breath trying to tell me the threat is coming from that sweet girl Talia. I\u2019m sorry, who exactly was it that said they saw your sister Talia? Right. Coming outta my room, Chloe Lane. Does that name ring a bell? No. No it doesn\u2019t.\tOkay. How about Xander Cook, large man Scottish accent. He said you two had some words. I see. Yeah, you were talking about my nosy neighbor. He\u2019s a bit of a winker. That one. Be that as it may, Mr. Cook and Ms. Lane both remember seeing Talia leaving this room the other day, but you\u2019re insisting that she was never here.\tAnd that you do not know her. Is that right? What was all of this about? Is your sister in some kind of trouble? I certainly hope not, but you will be if you don\u2019t start answering my questions. So let\u2019s start with an easy one. What\u2019s your name? Colin. Colin What? Faith. Seriously. It\u2019s quite a coincidence really.\t", "Oh, and judging from your chipper mood, I assume that it turned out to be rather trivial, just like I assured you it would.\tTell me why was Nicole\u2019s secret? Did she book her a Amanda getaway for the turvy? Oh, she you, that timepiece she had your eye on? Nope. She slept with Eric Brady.\tAnd why do you want to see my id? Is there a reason you don\u2019t wanna show it to me? Do you have a warrant? Do I need one? I\u2019m just trying to figure out the nature of your visit. Detective, you\u2019re referred to the two people who claim to have seen your sister coming from my room as witnesses. Does that mean you\u2019re investigating some sort of crime?\tUnderage prostitution? Perhaps. What? When a woman is coming and going from different motel rooms, okay, hold it right there. Talia is not a prostitute and she\u2019s not underage. And see, sounds like the nature of your visit is more personal as opposed to official. Damn right is personal. This is my sister we\u2019re talking about.\tCourse now I see why you\u2019re so rattled too. If I knew someone had hurt someone in my family, I\u2019d make damn sure the answer to me. I wasn\u2019t comfortable on our date because in all honesty, this is all new to me. Being with girls, you mean? No, actually being in a romantic situation. I don\u2019t have much experience with guys either.\tNo. Stop it. Talia. I\u2019ve seen the way guys look at you when they come into the bakery. They\u2019re so busy staring at you that they almost forget to order you. Shouldn not staring at you. No, they are not. But how is it possible that you haven\u2019t had like a zillion boyfriends? Well, okay, in high school when my friends went to prom, I was too busy studying for my AP chemistry tests.\t"], "answer": [1, 0, 3, 2, 4]}

You and phyllis, you weren\u2019t in the best place when she died and I would imagine that would make her loss even harder.

Nate and elena, they weren\u2019t pretending to try and help her. They did everything that they could to save her and now we know that she was poisoned and the ambulance crashed and burned. I mean, there\u2019s not a person in this world that could survive all of that.\tSummer: What if she survived? And it was all a part of this scheme that was orchestrated by jeremy stark.

He played on all of mom\u2019s emotions. He forced her to be part of his plan for revenge against diane. And frame diane for murder. Mom didn\u2019t have a choice. And even though she regretted things that she\u2019s done, she was\u2013 she was trapped.\tDaniel: Look, even if any of that is true, why wouldn\u2019t mom come home now?

Do you remember when diane was cuffed and hauled out of here and she begged you to represent her and you refused, as you should? That was your gut telling you, you should not give that woman the benefit of the doubt.\tMichael: You\u2019re right. You\u2019re right. How could I not? I was reeling. We all were. We had just found out that phyllis had been poisoned.\tLauren: And after jack pleaded with you personally, you still refused. What superseded your reluctance? Your enormous ego?\tMichael: How could you even say that?\tLauren: Because I remember you telling me that victor and nikki were giving you a hard time for even thinking about defending diane. So what was this, the ultimate pushback to prove that you can make your own decisions?\tMichael: You hold on now. That is a gross oversimplification. I would not just blithely sacrifice my job with victor because my fragile and enormous ego was bruised.\tLauren: Then tell me. Tell me what it was? Because it certainly seems that your desire to prove a point was more important than everything, including my feelings. You knew exactly how I would react with you defending diane and you went and you did it anyway.\tBilly: So you asked diane to marry you, right then and there? And she didn\u2019t give you an answer?\tJack: Nope. I\u2019m not sure why. I thought that offering to marry her now would make her see that my faith in her is unshakeable.

As much as she loves you, and she does love you, that is pretty impulsive.\tJack: Yeah, I will admit to that.\tBilly: Look, maybe she\u2019s thinking that there\u2019s more to this than you asking her to marry you.\tJack: Meaning what?\tBilly: I think it\u2019s pretty clear that you think things are spinning out of control right now and maybe this is your attempt to desperately find something that you can control.\tJack: Billy, the last thing I need right now is you analyzing me. My suggestion did not come out of the blue. We are engaged. I fully intend to spend the rest of my life with her. I was simply moving up the timetable.\tBilly: Why don\u2019t you just slow down a little bit, okay? This isn\u2019t something you can outrun, jack.\tJack: What are you talking about? What am I trying to outrun?\tBilly: Not that long ago, you were ready to spend the rest of your life with someone else. Someone that you loved deeply. You called her red, and now she\u2019s gone and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve even begun to mourn that loss yet.\tDaniel: You are overwhelmed and emotional and I think I know what\u2019s going on. I haven\u2019t told anyone this, but I see mom too. I see her all the time. Someone walking by me on the street and\u2013 and my heart, it skips a beep.\tSummer: This wasn\u2019t like that, daniel. This was real.\tDaniel: I know that it seems that way. I mean, those fleeting moments, they\u2013 they feel real to me too. But our mind, it plays tricks on us, especially in a stressful situation like this. And I think that\u2019s why mom, she comes to me in my dreams and you know, when I\u2019m alone, sometimes I find myself talking to her. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just my way of trying to hold on to her, I guess. Trying to still feel close and connected with her. I just keep thinking about the way she died and going over and over all the unanswered questions.\tSummer: What if I had answers to those questions? Moderate to severe eczema\tJack: Once again, you have misconstrued things. My desire to marry diane is quite separate from my need to mourn phyllis.\tBilly: With all due respect, I\u2013 I disagree, jack. It seems like to me, you\u2019re avoiding your pain and your grief by simply focusing on your future with diane.\t", "Daniel: If it was self-defense, why wouldn\u2019t she come back and explain everything?\tSummer: Because who would believe her? Who would believe her? She would be the one in jail right now for murder instead of diane. Daniel, we have to do something. I don\u2019t know\u2013 I don\u2019t know what, but we have to do something. We can\u2019t just let our mom slip away from us forever.\tMichael: That\u2019s not at all the way it happened. I didn\u2019t just deliberately take diane\u2019s case to go against your wishes.\tLauren: Then why did you?\tMichael: It was victor and nikki\u2019s rush to judgment. They had diane tried and convicted without any awareness of the facts. They didn\u2019t just suspect diane was to blame for phyllis\u2019s murder, they knew it.\tLauren: So, who cares what victor and nikki think, right?\tMichael: That\u2019s when I realized that\u2019s just the kind of jury that diane\u2019s gonna go up against in court. A bunch of biased people who have already made up their mind. Everybody deserves legal representation. Guilty or innocent and they deserve an attorney who works to make sure that the system is\u2013 that the system works fairly for everybody.\tLauren: Well, I can\u2019t argue with that.\tMichael: Exactly.\tLauren: But there are other top attorneys that could have defended her. Lawyers with no emotional ties.\tMichael: I think I\u2019m a good attorney because of my emotional ties and you are partially to blame for that. It is why I\u2019m passionate about what I do.\tLauren: Not this time. This is phyllis, our best friend, the victim, the woman who has gone through hell with us.\tMichael: You know she meant the world to me.\tLauren: And yet you choose not to fight for her, but her killer could go free because of you. And if that happens, I don\u2019t know if I can ever look at you again.\tAre you tired\tof washing dishes?\tDaniel: Summer, I know how hard it is to let go. I\u2019m dealing with it, okay? And I want you to know that I love you and I will be here for you every step of the way. I will.\tSummer: You think I\u2019m a wreck, don\u2019t you? You think I\u2019m out of my mind?\tDaniel: I think that you have to admit it is a pretty wild string of theories. But I understand. I get why you would be so desperate for there to be something that would tell us that mom\u2019s still out there somewhere.\tSummer: She is. I saw her.\tDaniel: If only that were true, it would make everything easier between you and kyle and it would probably fix the whole problem with diane.\tSummer: It would change everything.\tDanie: Yeah, it would. And that\u2019s a nice thought, but it isn\u2019t real. And it\u2019s not healthy for us to be obsessing over things that aren\u2019t gonna happen, summer. You and kyle, you\u2019re gonna be fine.

I\u2019ll keep your name out of it completely.\tJeremy: Who\u2019s going to believe that? How could you possibly explain it all? Huh? The hijacked ambulance, the poison, the dead body doubles. What possible reason would you give for marrying me when you knew you were gonna fake your own deaths supposedly without me even knowing about it? No. There\u2019s too many holes.

He was determined to make mom pay for rejecting him and helping put him away.\tJack: Of course, I know you\u2019re right, but I have to take some responsibility for underestimating stark. I thought by just standing up to him, freezing him out, he would be neutralized. That not giving him that power in our lives, he would ultimately just give up and go away. Wow, was I wrong.\tKyle: Hey, stark has gotten lucky.\tJack: No, he has been one step ahead the whole way. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong about any of this. And now\u2026 and now phyllis has paid for her life by mistakes I made.\tKyle: Hey, hey. Who could have known how deranged that man is? That he would go as far as to murder phyllis to punish mom. That\u2019s how little he values life.\tJack: I appreciate you defending me, but I\u2013 I deserve some of this guilt I am carrying. I\u2026 god, I handled this whole thing so badly. And moving forward, we can\u2019t do that. We can\u2019t make any mistakes.

And she let her son suffer for years and years thinking that she was dead. I cannot do that. I can\u2019t go through another minute of this knowing how my children feel. I cannot do it.\tJeremy: Okay, just shut up and think. The only reason your kids softened towards you is because they think you are dead. Now, once you become alive again and they realize that you deliberately put \u2019em through this hell, trust me, it\u2019s not gonna be sunshine and roses.

It\u2019s personal. Holly. I\u2019ve been trying to reach her, and she\u2019s gone radio silent. And given our last conversation, I\u2019m just a little bit concerned that something\u2019s happened. Something has happened and it\u2019s all my fault. Well, that\u2019s gratitude for you. After everything I went through to get you and chase back together again? Oh, that explains the serenade on the terrace! Congratulations, honey. I\u2019m very happy for you. I\u2019m glad chase finally came to his senses and let you out of the doghouse. If only we could all be that lucky. Ned, this is not the time or the place. Oh, come on, olivia. You can\u2019t still think dad was the one who blew the whistle on carly and drew. Of course he did. And he deserves a medal. No, I don\u2019t! Because I didn\u2019t! Brook lynn believes me. Why can\u2019t my own wife? I would like to believe you, ned. I really, really would. I\u2019d love to believe you, too, ned. Just give me one good reason. So, how\u2019s the sec situation with you and drew going on? We\u2019re not going down without a fight. My offer still stands. If you want to turn me in to the feds, you can. Just let me know what you\u2019re gonna do beforehand. Thank you, but it\u2019s too big of a risk, sonny. Let me be the judge of that. Really? Yeah. If the situation were reversed, would you give me up to them? What do you think? Mom, w\u2013 what\u2019s he doing here? It\u2019s not going to hurt. You promise? The donating was the hard part.

I know you\u2019re going through a tough time, um, wanting to see willow and not being able to do so, so, believe me, I do feel for you. I get it. I\u2019ve never been able to make friends very easily. And just so you know, I\u2019d be with willow right now. I\u2019d be at the hospital room if I didn\u2019t love sonny so much because I didn\u2019t want to run into carly or michael, have another clash.

As one woman speaking to another\u2026 I\u2019m gonna be charging sonny for this conversation. This isn\u2019t legal advice. This is just a get-to-know-you thing. Mm. Now I\u2019m charging him double. Oh. [ Laughs ] I love my job at crimson, right? But it wasn\u2019t until I was in nixon falls that I realized that the magazine shouldn\u2019t be my whole life. Have you considered a puppy? I have a family, a small one. I have a daughter and two grandchildren who are in my thoughts. Is there someone in yours, diane? Is there anyone special in your life? If not, why? Sonny stopped by to talk to donna, and she insisted her daddy make her pancakes. Oh. Well, did he tell you that I stopped by his office? He did. He did not tell me why. Well, that\u2019s because it was a private matter between josslyn and me. Oh, well, I asked him for a favor, and he said no, so\u2026 well, I told you to tell your friend to come to me. But you know what? We don\u2019t need to rehash this. This \u2014 I got to go. So can you do me a favor? Tell michael and willow that I\u2019m praying for them. I will. I thought that there was a schedule for visitations. There is, but some things need to be said face-to-face. Like what? Like sonny and nina are engaged. Are you coming home?\tI\u2019m gonna do my best. Hey, tj, look, is there anything I can do to make things easier for willow? Looks like you\u2019re already doing it. I mean, seeing all of you, it\u2019s the best medicine she can get. Looks like it\u2019s a party. Hi. How\u2019s the guest of honor?\tJust happy to see everybody. Hey, why don\u2019t I keep the kids entertained so you can have more time with willow? What do you say, wiley? Hm? Do you want to have some playtime with aunt sasha? Let me ask amelia. Okay.\t[ Whispering ] She says yeah! Then let\u2019s do it! Ooh! Sounds like fun. Can I join? The more the merrier. Alright. Come on, buddy. Your mommy and daddy need to talk. Hi, sweetie.

Your fan club misses you.\tNot half as much as I miss them. I love you, mommy!\tYou, too, sweetheart.\tYou keep asking how I coulddo this to you and carly when willow is so sick. And the answer is simple. I couldn\u2019T. And I didn\u2019t! And I want to believe you, ned. I really do \u2014 if you hadn\u2019t threatened to do just that. He\u2019s right! You said that you were gonna do this. I said I might consider it, which was an empty threat! But even if I had considered it, I didn\u2019t follow through with it! Okay, okay! That\u2019s enough! Get back to your corners! Shame on you! And shame on you for focusing on elq and the sec and that whole mess! None of that matters compared to what willow is facing today. Exactly. Thank you, brook lynn, for reminding this family what is really important. Why can\u2019t you come together instead of pulling each other apart? Is this really what it\u2019s come to? That brook lynn is the voice of reason? Believe me, nobody\u2019s more surprised than me. There she is. And you, tracy, being the voice of family unity? Hm. I always advocate for family unity. Didn\u2019t you withhold medication when edward was having a heart attack? She sure did. Famously. If there was one person that could absolutely attest to my devotion to the well-being and the happiness and the harmony of this family, it would be my granddaughter.\t[ Chuckles ] Oh! I get it! Tracy got you and chase back together, and now she wants you to feel like you owe her something, huh? Mnh-mnh! It\u2019s not always quid pro quo. There are such things as altruism and self-sacrifice. Mm. Mother, are you feeling well? Oh, trust me, ned. She\u2019s feeling just fine. Now, let me ask, tracy. How exactly does doing right by your granddaughter\u2019s heart become a sacrifice? What \u2014 what exactly did you give up? Or, by some chance, did you stand to gain something? Olivia, of course I am grateful for my grandmother helping me and chase get back together. Oh, sweetheart, you are more than welcome. But like my dad said, in this house, kindness usually comes at a price. Whatever the price was, I hope you can afford it. Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m back at work. Wait. What work? Oh, I didn\u2019t tell you? I\u2019m back at deception. What about your music? Well, you know I can\u2019t sing anymore. Yes, but I thought you were putting a list of artists together to manage. Things were going well, right? Why give that up? Diane: You know what, nina? Maybe I should just wait in the lobby until sonny gets back. W-wait, wait. Diane. Um\u2026 you know, now that sonny and I are engaged, I was hoping that\u2026 his friends can be my friends. You might just have to settle for \u201ccordial.\u201d Okay, well, in the spirit of cordiality, maybe we can get past our differences and try to get along. Our differences? You mean like the time I shredded you on the stand and got a judge to deny you visitation to see your grandson? Well, you were doing your job. It wasn\u2019t personal. No. No, it wasn\u2019T. The least I can do is admire your skill. As I admire yours.\t", "One thing, though, that I do know\u2026 about you and me.

Willow\u2019s procedure is starting soon, and I want to be there for michael. Well, I don\u2019t know if michael wants to see me right now. Why? What\u2019s going on? We had a fight. And sonny and nina? So \u2014 so what? He wants to officially make her a member of the family she set out to destroy? Okay, first of all, this family is just fine. And sonny and nina being engaged? Whatever. It\u2019s kind of a relief. How can you say that? Because sonny\u2019s committed to nina. I\u2019m committed to drew. Oh, so what? No harm, no foul? No, there was a lot of harm and a lot of foul. But, you know, it\u2019s just like a clean break, josslyn. Well, I just wonder why he didn\u2019t tell me that when I was alone with him in his office. Why would he? He knows how you feel about nina. You\u2019re right. I haven\u2019t made that a secret. The secret here is why you went to see sonny in the first place. I told you. I was asking him for a favor. For dex. Yes, I went to see him about dex. Why? Did you want sonny to give him a raise? No. I want sonny to fire him. So holly just left town without so much as a farewell? Well, at least we didn\u2019t have to fake an escape \u2014 the towering inferno, third-degree burns, and hospitalizations. This time it was just\u2026 goodbye. It never is just goodbye with you two, though, is it? We decided that, uh, you can\u2019t recapture the past no matter how much you might want to. And this time, when we said our farewells, we really meant them. I\u2019m sorry. Did she tell you about ethan? Yeah. I know all the trouble he\u2019s in. Did she tell you that she was willing to go back to the bureau just to pay off his debts? Apparently, she decided on a shortcut. Did she? A deal with the devil. Selina wu. I said there were alternatives. I offered to help. She doesn\u2019t want me involved. Well, she\u2019s protecting you.

Why are you forcing this on him? Especially with everything else that\u2019s going on in his life right now?

Besides, his ordeal with cameron and sally losing her baby, it\u2019s too much for anyone to handle all at once.\tNikki: Victoria, you should have let him make the call.\tVictoria: I made the right decision for nicholas and for the company.

That\u2019s me before dawn powerwash.\tNikki: Victoria has forced nicholas to take a leave of absence.\tVictor: Why would you do that?\tNikki: Well, because she decided that with all the trauma, with sally losing her baby and cameron kirsten terrorizing sharon and faith, that he must take a break from the company, whether he wants to or not.\tVictoria: Nicholas thinks that he can handle this all.

That will happen.\tHope: When?\tLiam: I don\u2019t know.\tHope: Liam, I\u2019M\u2026 I\u2019m douglas\u2019s mom and douglas is my son and I am so tired of people bringing up the fact that I\u2019m his adoptive mother like that should change anything.

Of course you do.\tHope: Liam, I\u2019m so terrified that he\u2019s going to realize that he is happier over at steffy and finn\u2019s and that he\u2019s going to choose to live there permanently.\tLiam: Hey.

The truth is, changes need to be made to hope for the future.

But, you know, I don\u2019t want to get ahead of myself, there\u2019s a lot of qualified candidates who have, you know, worked here a lot longer than I have, but\u2026 that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been putting in the time, you know, doing the work. And the personal sacrifice of my dad being here so much has really cut into my time with my wife and kids.\tLi: I hope it\u2019s not causing problems?\tFinn: No, no. No one understands work demands more than steffy.\tSteffy: Have I mentioned I hate this?\tCarter: I get it. I hate it too.

It\u2019s always been about this message of empowerment and positivity.\tSteffy: Yeah, she did a lot of good through hope for the future. But what worked then isn\u2019t working now. We\u2019re running a business and we have to do what\u2019s best for forrester creations, even if it hurts.\tCarter: Sounds like you\u2019ve made a decision.\tHope: Oh, sorry. I know I\u2019m early. I just, I didn\u2019t realize you had another meeting.\tSteffy: Did you\u2013 do you need something?\tHope: Um, no, it\u2019s fine. I\u2013 I can get out of your way.\tSteffy: Actually, come in. What we\u2019re discussing affects you.\tHope: Oh. So, you must mean hope for the future then.\tSteffy: The latest numbers are in.\tEric: Hope, I take full responsibility. I did everything I could to convince the two of you and zende that we would be able to replicate thomas\u2019s flair for the line, but we weren\u2019t able to do that.\tHope: No. You two were amazing. Hope for the future is just\u2026 we\u2019re in transition and that is why the numbers are low, we are trying to find our footing again now that thomas is no longer lead designer and I think it just requires some patience and us finding our new identity and once we do, I believe that these numbers will rebound. Do you\u2026 not agree?\tSteffy: Hope for the future has been one of forrester creations\u2019 most popular lines.\tHope: Which is why I think it deserves consideration now that it is struggling.\t", "Li: Under your capable and caring hands, I\u2019m not surprised.\tFinn: See, that\u2013 that\u2019s spoken like a true mom.\tLi: Well, I might be the tiniest bit biased, but I\u2019m also a doctor in this hospital and I hear the buzz around here. About you.\tFinn: Buzz?\tLi: Let\u2019s just say your hard work and dedication haven\u2019t gone unnoticed.

Is, uh\u2026 anything else going on for you lately? Just, like\u2013 like, outside of\u2013 of douglas, I don\u2019t know, you just seemed a little\u2026 internal, you know?\tHope: Just been under a lot of stress lately. I mean, it\u2019s mainly\u2026 about douglas and\u2026 addressing a life without him has been\u2026 difficult. You know, then there\u2019s sheila running around, wreaking havoc, and now under your dad\u2019s protection and, um\u2026 yeah, uh, hope for the future is, um\u2026 it\u2019s not doing too well.\tLiam: Oh\u2026 well\u2026 you don\u2019t have to go through it alone. That\u2019s what I\u2019m here for. The ol\u2019 husband. You can talk to me about anything. I hope you know that. Do you know that? Do you? Okay, good.\tHope: I know. You know what I need? I just need douglas to come home. I need my line to rebound successfully and I just need my life to go back to the way it was.\tSteffy: Ah, there he is! Mr. Ten years.\tCarter: You guys are way too kind. And thank you for the engraved clock, by the way.\tSteffy: Of course, we still want to take you out to celebrate, too.\tCarter: You know I won\u2019t turn down a free meal.\tEric: That\u2019s why you\u2019re coo.\tCarter: How\u2019s life at the beach with douglas in the mix?\tSteffy: Got a house full of, uh, happy kids.\tCarter: And hope, how is she holding up?\tSteffy: Not very well, I\u2019m afraid, which makes what we have to decide here today that much harder.\tCarter: Hope for the future continues to underperform, it\u2019s numbers are disappointing yet again. Starting to cost us.\tEric: Look, I feel terrible about this. Zende and I tried to step in for thomas there, but we couldn\u2019t quite capture his vision for the line.

Everyone, please welcome danielle ponder.\t", "\u00a0\u2013 Get down!\t[Suspenseful music]\t[Gun firing, shouting] \u2013 I have an instinct about these things. You were born to be a performer. You just need the right person to guide you. \u2013 What the hell? \u2013 Linc, is that you? You\u2019re so insignificant, you\u2019re easy to miss. \u2013 You guys look like you\u2019re enjoying yourselves. \u2013 Mm-hmm. \u2013 You two are doing a fantastic job. Everything is going off without a hitch. \u2013 Don\u2019t jinx it. \u2013 Well, you know, the trick is to make it look effortless, which maxie is doing beautifully. \u2013 Thank you. \u2013 Because no one needs to know what goes on behind the scenes.\t[Laughs] \u2013 Well I, for one, can\u2019t wait for the big act coming up later. \u2013 Oh, we have a lot of great ones before that, which reminds me, I should check on them. So excuse me. \u2013 Ok. \u2013 Maxie was younger than georgie at the first nurses\u2019 ball. Now, look at her. She\u2019s running the show. \u2013 Time sure flies, doesn\u2019t it? That\u2019s one thing I know for sure. And if the nurses\u2019 ball could have all of its unexpected acts happen, including mac\u2019s surprise acts over the years, it can handle anything.\t[Laughter] \u2013 Well, I remember my first performance. I was absolutely petrified. Everything was a big blur. And when it was over, the one thing I knew for sure, that I was better off in the audience. \u2013 I remember being furious at robin and stone\u2019s romeo and juliet scene. I mean, I was so mad at kevin and the kids, my stand-up became a tirade.\t[Laughing] \u2013 Oh, we can laugh about it now. At least you were a hit. \u2013 Yeah, not with robin. \u2013 [Chuckles] \u2013 Oh, well, what about my act? \u2013 At least your situation with robin didn\u2019t end up in an out and out brawl. \u2013 Talk about the show must go on. \u2013 Oh, I\u2013I had no idea what the nurses\u2019 ball would come to mean to robin personally or to the whole community. \u2013 Yeah. With all of the surprises and the loved ones lost, I\u2019m really proud of the tradition that we started in those days. And I\u2019m even more proud that we\u2019re continuing it on tonight. \u2013 Hear, hear.\t[Dramatic music]\t\u2013 Oh, my gosh. I am so, so sorry. \u2013 [Groans] Back off! \u2013 I think your mother\u2019s looking for you. \u2013 Ok. Um, are you ok? \u2013 Yeah, I\u2019m fine. Linc and I have some business to discuss. Ow. \u2013 What the hell was that?\t[Suspenseful music] \u2013 Lucy, no! \u2013 Victor\u2019s men will have surrounded the house! They\u2019re coming in front and back! \u2013 Oh, my god. Oh, my god. We\u2019re\u2013we\u2019re trapped. \u2013 No, we\u2019re not. You got out your window before, remember? \u2013 Ok. Right, right! We can all go out that way. \u2013 Anna, go with her! \u2013 No, come on. \u2013 No. \u2013 Come on. Come on. \u2013 Lucy, leave now. \u2013 No, I\u2019m not leaving you! No! No! \u2013 Lucy, you have to go. \u2013 Ok, but I\u2019m getting help. \u2013 Now, go. Go. This is your last chance to get out alive. \u2013 I\u2019m not leaving you. \u2013 They\u2019re gonna be in here any minute. \u2013 Well, they won\u2019t like what they find. \u2013 Oh, thank you. \u2013 Yeah. \u2013 [Laughs] But you really don\u2019t have to wait on me. \u2013 Well, it gives me an excuse to escape the muckety mucks and talk with you. \u2013 [Laughs] Well, they\u2019re not all muckety mucks, and you never need an excuse to talk to me. \u2013 Good to know. So how are things with gladys? \u2013 I\u2019m not sure what you mean. You spoke to her earlier. She seemed fine. \u2013 Oh, no, no, no. No, gladys is having a great time. I was asking about you. When you found out that she sold your husband\u2019s garage, you were pretty upset. \u2013 Yeah. Actually, that still bothers me, but gladys had good reasons. It had to be a painful reminder for her to deal with that every day, all the paperwork, constantly seeing brando\u2019s name. She sold it to give us both closure. \u2013 But I mean, did she even go over the details of the sale with you, you know? Do you know who the new owner is? \u2013 Actually, I don\u2019t think so.

I\u2019m sure they\u2019re on their way. \u2013 Oh, is that so? \u2013 Well, these are the suburbs. So if you don\u2019t want a lengthy gun battle with the police, I think maybe you should probably leave. \u2013 [Scoffs] Suggesting that I just turn around and walk away after going to all this trouble to track you and anna down?

My mom, bobbie, is maxie\u2019s co-chair, and I shamelessly used my connections to come back here just so I could meet you. \u2013 Nice to meet you, carly. \u2013 You were so amazing. I mean, of course, for your incredible voice and lyrics, but just as much for leaving your law career and following your dreams. How did you have the courage to do that? \u2013 You know, it just got to the point where I knew I couldn\u2019t do both, and I could never leave behind music, so I just completely surrendered. \u2013 You followed your instincts. \u2013 Sounds like you know something about that. \u2013 [Laughs] \u2013 Yeah, carly\u2019s kind of known for following her instincts, no matter where they lead. \u2013 And I\u2019ve never regretted it. \u2013 Neither have I. \u2013 Yes.\t", "[Laughter] \u2013 Apparently, cody was dating dr.

{"content": ["What did Johnny Wall? No, he was just wondering when I was coming back to Salem. Right.\tWhich made me think. Um,\tmaybe I should go back today and book a flight. I mean, that, that seems kind of sudden. Well, Joey\u2019s getting better and I do have a job, but you can work remotely, right? I can, I mean, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing. I\u2019ve been here as I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed,\tyou\u2019re upset,\tWendy.\tWe said that we would go on one day and if there was nothing between us, then we just. Be friends, but\tI felt something on our one date, something pretty well great actually, and it seemed like you did too,\tso. I don\u2019t want you to leave. I really don\u2019t. I, I really,\tI want you to stay.\tSo why do you think you\u2019re losing Wendy? Uh, well, for one thing, she\u2019s still in Seattle and doesn\u2019t seem to be in any hurry to head home. Okay. Wait, she\u2019s not still upset about you proposing to me. She knows that we were both high on those peanut biscuits, right? She does, yeah. Okay, so then that can\u2019t be the reason why she\u2019s staying.\tNo, which is why I\u2019m starting to want, you know, no, I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not just wondering. I, I\u2019m pretty sure that the reason is Trip. You want me to stay in Seattle? I\u2019m trip. Are you nothing here? No, no, no, no. I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll be back and save them soon. I just promised my dad and Kayla that would look after Joey until he got back on his feet.\tSo it should only be a few more weeks. So if you did stay, we could see where this thing goes. You know, without all the typical Salem distractions, we could go see the sites, just be. Together. I can\u2019t, yeah, I can work re remotely and now for weeks on end, and also\tmy brother\u2019s been final loss lately now that he\u2019s given up on Gabby and I need to be there for him. And for Johnny,\tso I assume since you know this is his phone call, I got you so anxious to get back there today. It\u2019s because of Johnny\tthat you\u2019re choosing him.\tSo why do you think that Wendy is staying in Seattle because of Trip? Is that what she told you? Uh, what she told me was that she is staying to help him take care of Joey. Well, that sounds reasonable. Yeah, a little too reasonable. And Trip, once again comes off looking like the Boy Scout look, it\u2019s the perfect way for him to just weasel his way into Wendy\u2019s heart.\tI dunno. Maybe I should fly out there and try and woo her back. Okay. Wooing is one thing, smothering is another. You\u2019re the big movie buff, right? Maybe you should just take a page outta West Side story and play it. Ooh boy. Right? Except that\u2019s not me. I am the opposite of cool, as you know. Yes, I do know that.\tBut can\u2019t you just fake it? Right. Just if, if you don\u2019t come off as needy and desperate, then I promise you that if you lie low that Wendy will be much happier when she does get back. You\u2019re right. You\u2019re right.

Yeah. And, and look, I, I know that it seems soon since Allie and I just broke up recently, but I found out that she\u2019s seeing someone in New Zealand, and so if she\u2019s moving on, then why shouldn\u2019t I?\tYou didn\u2019t know about it, did you? That Allie was seeing someone? You kidding? She didn\u2019t even bother to tell me when she left town. You think she\u2019s gonna keep me up to date on her love life? Yeah, I guess not So, You are gonna keep me in suspense. You\u2019re gonna tell me who this date was with last night.\tNext time. Text when you\u2019re close. All right. I don\u2019t want you hanging around in the hallway. Relax. I was waiting all of five seconds. Still better not take any chances. Speaking of, did your sister hear you say anything? Yeah, she heard me talking about Paulina.

I actually have come up with a plan. Yeah. Okay. Go on. You know those, uh, panic attacks you said she has? Yeah. What about \u2019em?

Why is that? Because you can update us on your investigation. Have you arrested Sloane Peterson yet? Xander?

Actually, things did get ugly for a lot of people. I am so sorry that that happened to you, Ms. Lane, but I\u2019m afraid that I am not a liberty to discuss an open investigation. Well, I hope that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s progressing slowly. I would think that you would wanna solve this sooner rather than later.\tRight?

It might be Lee\tJohnny.\tHey. Hey, Johnny. Uh, hey, I, I just talked to your brother and you said you\u2019re still in Seattle. I am. Are you avoiding me? I mean, Wendy, I thought you said that you believe me when I said the only reason I proposed to Chanel was because of those damn biscuits. Yes, I believed you. I, I told you I did. But Trip just brought Joey home from the hospital and, um, I felt bad leaving, so I stuck around a hell pound.\tOkay. All right. Well, good to know. Um, So when are you coming back?\tDid you just ask me what\u2019s for breakfast? Yeah, I mean, honestly, Chloe, I mean, I\u2019m a little bit disappointed. For some reason I got it into my head that you were like an early riser and you would\u2019ve had breakfast on the table hours ago. Wow. Well, you assumed wrong. No, Chloe. I thought this was all part of our agreement.\tWell, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve forgotten already. No, I have not forgotten. When we decided to move in, I said I would pick up some of the slack of the household chores. I didn\u2019t sign up to be your full-time housekeeper and cook. I never said anything about full-time. No, you just want me to have breakfast ready on the table for when you roll out of bed.\tChloe, I knew this was a bad idea. Brady said it was a terrible idea. I should have listened to him. Where are you going to pack?\tWait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Please. What do you wanna put in your lunch order before I leave? Or was I late picking up your dry cleaning? I\u2019m sorry. For some reason I assumed this was some kind of, I dunno, all inclusive deal. I shouldn\u2019t have expected you to make me breakfast or anything else. You\u2019re right.\tThat wasn\u2019t part of our agreement. No, it wasn\u2019t. And if I agree to stay here, we need to figure out what this arrangement is, right, which we can hash out over breakfast, which I will happily prepare for us both right now. Oh, so you cook now? I do indeed. And one day I will delight your palate with all the Scottish favorites, Haggas, blood pudding, neeps, and Tatties.\tBut for today, I\u2019ll just scramble some eggs.\tOr at least I would if we had any eggs to scramble. Don\u2019t suppose you, uh, went to the grocery store, did you?\tWhat? Am I coming back? Yeah. I mean, I know Damara has a pretty liberal vacation policy, but my dad and Uncle Stephan need you.

But uh, what\u2019s that joke about lesbians? They bring the U-Haul to the second date, something like that. Chanel\u2019s not a lesbian. She\u2019s bisexual. Okay, whatever. Well, the matter is that she falls head over here, is in love with you so that you can break her little bisexual.\tHa again. And in the meantime I\u2019m gonna focus on the plan for her mother.

I don\u2019t have a policy against coworkers fraternizing, as long as it\u2019s consensual. Of course. But is the city council\u2019s policy and I simply enforce it. Mm-hmm. But businesses, private businesses have more leeway OB, obviously.\tYeah. Well, I don\u2019t even know if that matters since my business is still shut down. Well, has the health department given you any idea about when you can reopen? No. They, they said that until the police find out who\u2019s behind those tainted biscuits.

You do that?\tCome in.\tWe need some talk Commissioner. I hope this isn\u2019t a bad time, uh, for my boss. Never. So what can I do for the two of you? Yes. If you don\u2019t know, you can get on the stick. Excuse me. My poor daughter can\u2019t reopen her bakery until you arrest Sloan Peterson. So why the hell is it taking so long you shoulda arrested her the minute that someone took a bite of those bad biscuits?\tSweetheart, RA can\u2019t arrest Sloan just because she has an animosity toward you and Chanel.

Are you going to tell us that the evidence now points to someone else? Not exactly. What do you mean not exactly?\tI was just talking to Chanel. Chanel, yeah. Remember I told you I recommended some breathing and meditation exercises for Paulina when she has panic attacks? Yeah, well, I was just checking in with Chanel to make sure her mom was okay. Because I was concerned. Right. Any other questions, Jada, or should I get a lawyer?\tSince you\u2019re just so interested in my private phone conversations, I just asked you who you were talking to.

I, I, I checked the bakery first, but that\u2019s still not open yet. Well, I think yet, might be a bit optimistic. Really Sorry you\u2019re going through this. Thanks.

Maybe it\u2019s a good thing that I interrupted.\tWhat does that mean? Why don\u2019t you let me talk to Talia? Give yourself a break. No, it has to be me. I know her better than anyone. Sure. Yeah. But you know, maybe in this case a little less, uh, closeness could be a good thing. Are you saying that I can\u2019t be objective? I\u2019m saying she\u2019s your sister. Exactly. So I\u2019ll know if something\u2019s off.\tJust like when she suddenly remembered that she didn\u2019t come straight home from dinner at Chanel\u2019s and she got a headache and took a walk around the lake a night before half the town got drugged. Tell me more about what happened at the motel. Ugh, you should have seen this Colin Firth. Dude, that\u2019s shady.\tHuh? He was evasive, uncooperative, and he wouldn\u2019t even admit that he knew Talia. Even after I had two witnesses that swear they saw her leaving his room. All right, Talia, who still has no motive whatsoever. I know. I know. And even if she did, I just. I can\u2019t figure out how this call-in guy even fits in. You know, if this joker won\u2019t tell me what I need to know, then I\u2019m gonna find out myself.\tMeaning he can play dumb, he can stonewall, but he can\u2019t stop me from investigating. I am gonna find out everything there is to know about him, starting with what kind of car he drives. I\u2019m in his place. See if he\u2019s in the system. I\u2019m gonna go back to that nasty motel room and see who else is stopping by to see him.\tHow could I have not seen this sooner? Yeah, seriously, and not usually this low. I am sorry. Old habits. Look, you\u2019ve put enough time and the effort in trying to make that little slut pay for what she did to our mom and to dad. And now it\u2019s my turn. Your turn. This isn\u2019t a game. What I mean is that you tried to get justice for our parents using the legal system and it didn\u2019t work.\tAnd that\u2019s not an insult. All right?

Eric, you, you, your face ej and I, we got into it last night. I heard, but I I didn\u2019t think it was that bad. Said I\u2019m fine. I was worried about you. Actually, I left you a message.\tI was trying to warn you that EJ found out about us. Yeah. Thanks to Sloan, but I didn\u2019t get the message until after EJ confronted me. Now we spent timing. More like bad judgment on your girlfriend\u2019s part. Why the hell would Sloan tell EJ that you and I slept together? What the hell is she thinking?\tNo, don\u2019t gimme that hassis crap. When you missed me. I missed you a lot. Like hell you have. If that were true, you\u2019d have told me you were in town. I know what you\u2019ve been doing, little brother. So close the door. We need to talk.\tNo answer. The first call went to voicemail, so I\u2019m trying her again. Remember, Sloane Peterson is our prime suspect. Yeah, but I still wanna know what my sister can tell me about this calling guy. He\u2019s part of me is afraid to hear it.\tDid you wanna kiss that? No. I\u2019ll just turn off the ringer.\tSee no more interruptions.\tLike sand through the hourglass. So are the days of our lives.\tShall we take this? Yes.\tLet\u2019s go to my room.\tI don\u2019t know Carolina, I don\u2019t think I can do this. You know how important this is to. And babe, when this is finally over, I\u2019ll be okay. No more mood swings, no more crazy depression, cuz I\u2019ll feel like I\u2019ve got justice. For my mom and we will be so happy together.\tI love you so, so much.

That one is my favorite, and believe me when I say I\u2019m gonna do everything in my power to make sure that becomes a reality. Nicole didn\u2019t write one word of that crap. Nobody has her name on it, and it was sent from her email address to Shin and the rest of the DER board.\tI don\u2019t know how you did it, but you obviously pulled something while Nicole was at the hospital.

Really? Yeah. So just a little twinge. Well, last night I, I got some cramps that were pretty painful, so I, I went to the hospital. You, you were at the hospital last night. I was there too.

I mean, we can get past that. Right, right. There is one thing that\u2019s a bit strange. What\u2019s that? EJ mentioned he went to the hospital to get his hand checked. But obviously he was there to see you.\tAnd why would he lie?\tChanel, I\u2019m so sorry. I thought you were alone. Okay, mama. It\u2019s okay. Oh, I didn\u2019t mean to hold alone. Don\u2019t panic. Just breathe. Ms. Price. Please don\u2019t get the wrong idea. Oh, no, no, no. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay. Chanon told me you were dating. Uh, you know, and the last thing anyone wants on a date is a third wheel, so I\u2019ll just roll on out the way I came in.\tNo, no, no. This is your home. I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll go, but you don\u2019t have to do that. Tell you, honey, please don\u2019t leave on my account. I should really handle this missed call. Really, it\u2019s fine.

Well, I figured. Get down to the station. You\u2019re looking guilty here by the minute. Somehow wasn\u2019t the right approach. Please let there be something that explains us all away.\tAnd what is it that I\u2019ve been doing? Oh, there it is. The same. Who me act you\u2019ve been doing since we were five. You know it never bothered me until the time whenever you snuck out with the car and you cracked the taillight and let mom and dad believe that was me. I was grounded for a month. Yeah, sorry about that.\tOh, stop playing innocent Collin cuz I\u2019m not buying it. Okay. No more games. Just advice leave now. The less you know, the better. Too late. As I said, I already know what you\u2019ve been doing.\tSloan and Miss, she made a mistake. Hmm, that\u2019s big of her. She also thought Youj already knew. Since you and I have been drugged and what happened between us wasn\u2019t our fault that you would\u2019ve already told EJ and that maybe he wouldn\u2019t have made such a big deal about it. Well, clearly she doesn\u2019t have a full appreciation of the complicated history you share.\tShe does, but I filled her in some. She also assumes that some of our complications are in the past.

Not that I answered to you, or you\u2019re so-called consultant, but I was tending to Nicole. Is she okay? She\u2019s fine. Oh, good. I for one, I\u2019m glad that this little episode hasn\u2019t interfered with her work. Mother thought I was a hell. Is that supposed to mean. You know her work.\tYou hired her to evaluate my job performance. Surely that hasn\u2019t slipped your mind now. No, it hasn\u2019t. Right? How could it anyway, I was, um, a little concerned, given Nicole\u2019s obvious bias against me, that she would be anything but fair in her reports to board.

Well, those feelings weren\u2019t mutual. One of the many reasons I left that island. And you brought Kayla with you, right?\tWhy would I do that?

You see, she gave me some details about the deals she made so she wouldn\u2019t get locked up in a supermax Isa dungeon for eternity.\tKristin, I already know all of this. Megan Hathaway told the police that it was her henchman Thomas Banks that was responsible for Kayla\u2019s kidnapping. Right. Look. So unless you is that I\u2019m not so sure it was him.\tYeah. Well, I\u2019ve heard. Two. Michael Harris. No, no. Scratch that. Reverse it. Harris Michaels, how do you know who I am? We have a mutual acquaintance, Megan Hathaway. I gotta tell you, man, she\u2019s extremely proud of how she orchestrated your dissent. How did she put it? The corrupting of a good man, a Navy Seal with a impeccable record turned into a simple hired gun.\tBut even with all her conditioning, she missed something. It was soft side and the real fly in the ointment. Hope Brady,\twho is that? His name is Thomas Banks. You have reason to believe he\u2019s involved in all of this? No. Clearly I would not forget a face like that. It was not him. Okay. Then if it wasn\u2019t Thomas Banks impersonating Shane Donovan. Then what did this man look like? Describe him to me please, in detail.\tNow, isn\u2019t that better than a crust, your breakfast biscuit? Well, I\u2019m sure if that biscuit hadn\u2019t been laced with the hallucinogens, it would\u2019ve been divine, but this chatter is always delicious, so thank you. You\u2019re welcome.

I believe I, I wept the floor with you. Yes, you did. And it was quite humiliating actually. So maybe you\u2019ll soothe my wounded ego by allowing me a rematch. Uh, well, since I\u2019ve been doing a little dart technique research, I\u2019m not sure that I would be able to soothe your wounded ego dart technique research.\tOh, yeah. It\u2019s a whole thing. I mean, I learned it\u2019s, it\u2019s very important to lead with your elbow and then you use your sight line for your throwing. Can you use your dominant eye to look at the target while you aim? So, um, are you sure you\u2019d like a rematch?\tWell, now you\u2019re fasty and I like it, but you\u2019re gonna have to be just a little bit more specific, see and known a lot of mothers, off the top of my head, I just can\u2019t remember what I did with heat. Is that really the game you\u2019re gonna play? Banks game? I don\u2019t even know the rules, Chad. Fine. Let me spell it out for you.\tThe woman you kidnapped is my mother, Kayla Johnson.

I would think this is any.\tYou\u2019re dangling some tidbit of information that I\u2019m gonna find interesting. Just so you can see Rachel. Ready. I\u2019m sorry, but you are really gonna want to hear this, not just you, everyone in Sailor. This news is so explosive and it\u2019s gonna change a lot of people\u2019s lives. Mm-hmm. I\u2019ll think about it.\tI don\u2019t know how helpful my description will be. I mean, normally we have our sketch artist come in and draw a picture of Thep, but he\u2019s working in another town. Okay. Please just. Something, anything. Does this man have any distinctive features? Scars, tattoos, tall, short, skinny. He was just pretty average looking guy.\tOkay. Middle aged, brown hair, brown eyes, medium built. Sound like anyone you know.\tWell, if you heard about me from, from Megan, maybe. She had something to do with bringing you back?\tNo, because when I, when I was in that lab, there was someone else in one of those polygenic tubes. But I never knew who it was,\tbut what Megan wanted most was those three prisms.\tThey were why she brought me under control, why she programmed me. Now, she didn\u2019t tell me what she was gonna use \u2019em for, but I know that they had some healing properties that maybe they could be used to perform medical miracles. And now it all makes sense. She wanted to use the prisms to revive somebody in that cryogenic state, somebody that she left,\tthat somebody was you.\tUnbelievable. It\u2019s just unbelievable. Lemme see these darts. Have you got magnets in there or something? There are no magnets. I just happen to be extraordinary at this game. Yeah.

Uh, well, you were kind enough to warn me about those biscuits laced with drugs that would\u2019ve had me saying pink offense or whatever.\tSo I will give you a handicap and for this next dart I. I\u2019ll close my eyes. Oh, come on. You threw the first bullseye of your life last night with your eyes closed. Do you want the help or not?\tOkay. Elbow sideline.\tDid I nail it?\tYeah. You uh, you nailed it. All right.\tAll right, thanks. Hey, your boss Megan already told us that you\u2019re the one that kidnapped you. Whoa. Whoa. No. Where\u2019s your boss? Ele? I\u2019m an independent contractor. Okay. I\u2019m sure just like you looking for your mama, that\u2019s why I followed you. You were following us. Oh yeah. You think it\u2019s just a Wanka dance?

I mean, right around the time that he did, you know, she started to realize the tragic consequences of her obsession. She\u2019s lost two children now, and her grandson and her niece, nina, are the only family she has. Wait, isn\u2019t she supposed to be donating bone marrow to nina\u2019s daughter?\tMm.\tI\u2013I don\u2019t think she left this town willingly.\tI mean, it\u2019s not like cassadine yanked her off the street.

To handle a pathogen that\u2019s potentially active?\tAre you sure?\tWell, of course I\u2019m sure. Mikkos and I developed this pathogen so that it\u2019d only be activated by uv light.

You got something maybe, uh, turns out there was an opportunity for Sloan to have gotten a hold of Paulina\u2019s office keys. I knew it, but Sloan wasn\u2019t the only one. Turns out my sister had the same opportunity.\tLike sand through the hourglass. So are the days of our lives.\tYou really think your sister had something to do with this? I\u2019m just going by what was taught to us at the Academy Boss gathering all the facts. Don\u2019t rush to judgment what we think doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s what we know. True. So what do we know? We know that Tallier Rens, Paulina Price at the square and so did Sloan Peterson, who has made it no secret that she is gonna continue to pursue her vendetta against Paulina and Chanel.\tSloan also had motive to trash Paulina\u2019s office, whereas your sister did not. In fact, from what I have witnessed, your sister has no reason whatsoever to want hurt Paulina. In fact, she works for Paulina\u2019s daughter. You said that she and Chanel get along great, didn\u2019t you?\tSorry. I guess I was just caught in a moment. Now I, I wasn\u2019t looking for an apology, Talia. Yeah, I know, but I owe you one. You\u2019ve been upset, you know, with everything going on and. The last thing I want is to take advantage of that. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s just, I, it kind of surprised me. I, I didn\u2019t even know you were into girls.\tI\u2019m not. At least I wasn\u2019t. And so now, I mean, I\u2019ve only dated guys before. And I don\u2019t have to tell you, you know how baking is all about chemistry? Yeah. So it\u2019s physical attraction, right? And there\u2019s no denying that there\u2019s real chemistry between me and you. Look, it\u2019s not like this was a premeditated thing.\tI mean, you were in my arms and it felt right and you know, kissing. You just felt like it was supposed to happen. Yeah, it felt right to me too. But you just broke up with your girlfriend, so maybe it\u2019s too soon to do something with me. Actually, maybe it isn\u2019t.\tI don\u2019t know any. Tanya, I said, Talia, whatever. I don\u2019t know any Talia either. I think you have the wrong room. Um, she definitely saw her here. I know. Cause I, I live right down the hall here. My friend, uh, Chloe and I, we bumped into her recently coming out of that room.\tListen, I appreciate your concern for me, Brady, but if my moving in with Xander\u2019s a mistake, then. It\u2019s my mistake to make, but Chloe, God, it affects me too. See, don\u2019t you, don\u2019t you understand that? I see. I care about you, Chloe and I, I love you.\tI love you too, but I think it\u2019s time for United Admit that in our case, love is not enough.\t", "Auntie Mag. Sorry I\u2019m late. That\u2019s it. Sorry you\u2019re late. Not even a decent excuse. Well, or even a fabricated one. I actually, I was with Gwen and I was letting her stop. Stop. Alex, really, seriously, you have the nerve. To tell me that you couldn\u2019t make it to work on time because you were having a booty call with that woman.\tNo, I\u2019m telling you that I\u2019m late because I was letting that woman know that our booty calls are over.\tOh, wow. I hate seeing my gwenny looking. So glm just stop staring then and go back to your. Phone or whatever, but I wanna be here for you. And you know, it\u2019s so late if Alex, Kiki had been my friend with benefits and he suddenly cut off those benefits, my pennies is being a twist too. You know damn well that that is not what I\u2019m upset about.\tWell, it\u2019s one of the things, right? And the reason I didn\u2019t bring up the other thing is because I\u2019m your best friend, and I know that the other thing is the painful thing, whereas the thing with Alex is more of an insulting, irritating thing. So I thought. It\u2019d be something of a distraction to bring up that thing rather than the really, really hurtful thing, you know?\tNo, I don\u2019t, I haven\u2019t. The funs idea of what you are rambling on about. Well, that\u2019s because you\u2019re obsessing over Xander. Poor Gwenny. Oh. Could you just stop being so patronizing? You know, I hate that damo. Are you sure that Sandra and Chloe are, are really moving in together now? I wish it weren\u2019t so. What I saw with my own two eyes, your cock doodle do.\tAnd that songbird definitely looking to nest. And they actually bought the apartment. Yep. And the crazy thing is right before they decided it was right for them, Brady showed up to look at the same apartment for him and his bratty kid. As soon as he sees Chloe, he gets this miserable look on his face just like that one.\tAnd he was hell bent on talking her out of it.\tChloe, look, I, I know that things have been challenging for us lately, but, but moving none with Xander. I mean, you say your friends, but what kind of friendship can you have with this guy? I mean, he\u2019s, he\u2019s distrustful. He. He\u2019s made enemies left and right, including you at one point in time. I mean, I don\u2019t understand why you wanna make a home with him.\tBecause to be honest, I am lonely and he\u2019s good company. Chloe, if he wants to move in with you and he\u2019s, he\u2019s offered to foot the bill, that\u2019s because he\u2019s expecting something is going to happen. Please don\u2019t do this. Don\u2019t make this kind of a mistake that you and I both know that you\u2019ll regret. Oh, hey, I thought that was Baker Girl\u2019s room.\tBakery. Yo, who the hell is that? The girl that works with Chanel that sweet bit, believe her names Talia.\tUm, why did you do that? Listen to me. Hi. And listen. Good before that bitch killed my mother. She broke her heart when she went for my father. So now it\u2019s time to see how she likes having her heart broken. She\u2019s already had her heart broken her ex cheated on her, and then moved to a different continent, which is why it\u2019s the perfect time for you to swoop in and sweep her off her feet, and then break a little heart all over again.\t", "Come on. You know what you need to get you through this. What? A giant dartboard with zanders bubbly mug on it. That, but I was thinking a nice bottle of tequila. Two pints of ice cream. No. Make it three. You could use one too. Strawberry, right? I\u2019m going to dial a broom. Service. No, don\u2019t you dare. Look, I don\u2019t know what you think you saw.\tBut this is my room. And if there was some random girl coming and going, believe me, I would notice. I\u2019m sure this is the room. I saw that tell you, girl, come out. What are you the house, dick? Excuse me mate. No offense mate. It\u2019s just slang. For hotel detective, they used to say it all the time in those old black and white noir films, you know, the ones where people have questioned more moral character, give each other trouble of some sort.\tJada, where is this coming from? Has Taja done something like this before? Something to make you suspect her of these pretty egregious offenses? No. No. God no. No, no, and and it\u2019s hard for me to even come up with a reason why Talia would wanna hurt Chanel or her family. But I also know that I need to put my personal biases aside and look at all of the possibilities as hard as it may be, and both my sister and Sloan Peterson had the opportunity to steal Paulina\u2019s keys from her purse when she left it unattended.\tOkay. I can\u2019t argue with your logic, but Yep. I think I may have found a hole in your theory.\tI was talking to Commissioner Hernandez in his office and he had this picture of Allie and her son Henry on his desk, and she had just sent it to him. Allie\u2019s your ex. Right. And she and the commissioner are there real close and he told me that she started seeing someone in New Zealand. Well, he didn\u2019t actually tell me that.\tI just, um, I asked and he didn\u2019t say anything, which was obviously his way of telling me that yes, she is seeing someone. Sorry. Yeah. Well, I\u2019m not all that surprised anyway. Now you know why the health department shutting us down is only part of the reason why today has been such a rough day for me. So you and your ex, you guys were pretty serious.\tWe were. And then we hit this rough patch and then I, I thought that we were gonna be able to figure things out and work it out. But then I caught her with this guy, Alex, and, well, that was pretty much the end of us. So you and Gwen Oh, sit, sit. Are done seeing each other.\tAuntie I, um, I started some therapy with Dr. Evans and she helped me realize that all this sleeping around that I\u2019m doing, it\u2019s actually my way of avoiding any commitment and not just to a particular woman, but in everything else in my life. Hmm. Well, I\u2019m, I\u2019m glad to, um, hear that you see that, Alex. Well, good, because as of right now, I\u2019m putting all of my energy into my commitment at Titan.\t", "I\u2019m gonna show you firsthand that I am dead serious about doing my part in contributing to the growth and the success of our family business.

Phyllis is this close to seizing the spectator and auctioning it off to pay off this massive hotel bill. No tequila fine. It\u2019s not the expensive stuff.\tWhat if we settled on a cheap bottle of wine and two fruit cups? Wow, my mouth is watering.\tAll joking aside, I know that losing Xander was a huge loss for you. You need to mourn that loss. So if you need to yell, scream, throw pillows, just not at me. You do whatever you need to do to get a handle on your feelings. I\u2019m here for you. Thank you, Matt. And you\u2019re right, I do. Oh, do you really need to just vent and just get it out and just cry and scream and just throw things?\tI need to just really mourn the loss as you put it. I need to stop pretending to be so tough and invulnerable.\tYou know, I was talking about that earlier with Alex Keis before he dumped you too. I am so sorry. That just slipped out.\tBo has been dead for years. Yeah. Or so we thought. And he\u2019s just, he\u2019s alive. I mean that\u2019s, that\u2019s wild. That\u2019s great news. Yeah, but there\u2019s some bad news as well. Bo\u2019s in a coma in a hospital in Greece, and they\u2019re not sure he is ever gonna wake up. Oh my God. I\u2019ve only heard a million times from Uncle Vic about his son and how proud he is of him and how much he loves him, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s fueling up the Titan jet as we speak.\tHe\u2019s planning to fly to Greece and do everything he can to make sure that that Beau is getting the best possible care. I mean, honestly, I, I have never heard Victor this emotional, but then why wouldn\u2019t he be, I mean, everything, any of him just aches to be with Bo the son. The son, he thought he lost Auntie.\tI can only imagine what he\u2019s going through right now. You know what? Why don\u2019t you go to Greece, go with Uncle Vic. I will handle all the business here if you give me that chance.\t", "What are you, what are you saying? I am saying that you and I are over. You don\u2019t mean that. You don\u2019t mean that. Come on, Brady. You and I both know that we\u2019ve been done for a while now. We\u2019ve just been in denial about it ever since Rachel started hating me and you had to put her feelings first. She\u2019s my daughter.\tI know that. I know that. And I don\u2019t blame you for that. I\u2019m a mom too. I understand. What is. It\u2019s like to prioritize your child. Look, listen, listen to me. Rachel\u2019s a kid. She\u2019s a little girl. She\u2019s, she\u2019s not always gonna feel the way she feels right now. She\u2019s gonna come to realize that, that, that, that you make her father happy.\tIt\u2019s not gonna matter to her cuz she also sees me as the person who makes her mother miserable. And you and I both know all too well that Kristen fueled that fire she made Rachel believe that the only thing standing in the way of the three of you being this happy little family is me. So what\u2019s, what are we, we\u2019re just gonna let Kristen win.\tIs that it? No. No. No one wins in this. Kristen got Rachel to hate me, but she didn\u2019t get you to fall back in love with her. And Rachel got her way by keeping us apart, but her parents still aren\u2019t together. And you ready? You are the man that I fell in love with. You are so full of hope and so joyful. And little by little, I have witnessed that that joyfulness and that hopefulness just steadily being eaten away.\tAnd I know why. It\u2019s because you are her wonderful father and you can\u2019t stand seeing your girl suffer. But the way that Kristen regards me and the way that she\u2019s influenced Rachel to regard me, I am indirectly responsible for that pain and I can\u2019t in good conscience continue with that.\tI can\u2019t believe this, and, and Chloe moving in together, I mean, She is such a boar, completely humorous. There\u2019s not an ounce of a spark to the woman. And not to mention the fact that I, I thought that she hated Sandra because he left her with some Mexican drug, Lord. So why a sudden 180? I mean, it just doesn\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t make sense.\tAnd I know that he and I weren\u2019t perfect together, but I mean, Really, really, really good times. You know, a lot of romance and laughter. Laughter. My God, I can\u2019t even imagine him laughing with Chloe Lane cause she\u2019s such a,\tis everything just. Oh, everything\u2019s just such a struggle. Why? Matt? Why? Why? That\u2019s it, girl. That\u2019s it. Let it all out.\tHey, hey. If it\u2019s any consolation, it is a two bedroom apartment. What two bedrooms sink. Two bedrooms, that that means that they have their own room, although the second bedroom would make for a great office or a workout room for that. Scotty Hotty. Oh, Gwenny.

But it\u2019s also exactly the kind of opportunity thomas can, and has in the past, used to get close to you and manipulate you.\tHope: I can\u2019t\u2013 I can\u2019t do this. Okay, I\u2013 I don\u2019t\u2013 I don\u2019t wanna keep arguing this with you, liam. I just want you to understand that hope for the future is my life\u2019s work!\tLiam: I absolutely understand that, and I support you in that.\tHope: Okay, so then do you understand that I tried to find a designer that would make it work? I mean, eric, one of the most prolific designers to ever pick up a pencil, even he couldn\u2019t interpret my vision as well as thomas could.\tLiam: The designs are done, though. The dresses are made. You don\u2019t need thomas for this next part.\tHope: Okay, I\u2013 I get that you have issues with thomas.\tLiam: Of course I have issues with thomas. How could I possibly trust him after everything he\u2019s done to us?\tHope: Because I do! I\u2013 I\u2019m not some child, liam. I\u2013 I work with him every day, I\u2019ve seen the changes that he\u2019s implemented into his life, a\u2013 and the progress that he\u2019s made, and not only that, he\u2013 he brings a certain artistry, a certain creativity to my line.\tLiam: Hope, hope. I\u2019m not asking you to get a new designer.\tHope: But you\u2019re telling me not to bring thomas to rome. And I can\u2019t do that.\tLiam: You can\u2019t or you won\u2019t?\tHope: Liam, I don\u2019t want to hurt you. But thomas is my lead designer.

You\u2019re gonna both get involved in office gossip?\tRidge: Well, that\u2019s not office gossip. It came from your sister, it came from steffy.\tTaylor: Yeah. Your sister has her suspicions.\tThomas: Suspicions or paranoia? Because lately, she\u2019s been singularly focused on all the things hope does wrong.\tTaylor: Okay, because she\u2019s concerned.\tThomas: Okay, look. Steffy may have her own issues with hope, but it has nothing to do with me.\tThomas: Oh, relax. We\u2019re not accusing you of anything. Your mom and I, we\u2019re on your side.\tTaylor: No, yes, and I\u2019m sorry if it sounds like it is. I\u2013 we love you so much, and\u2013 and we know how hard you\u2019ve worked to get to where you are, and we just don\u2019t wanna see anything or anyone jeopardize that.\tThomas: Okay, well, all right, thank you. Um, hope and I have a great working relationship and we\u2019re co-parents to douglas and that is it, okay? But as far steffy is concerned, maybe she\u2019s just mixing up her signals, right? She\u2019s got her care for me, and\u2013 and her issues that she\u2019s got with hope.\tTaylor: Okay. Okay. Well, that\u2019s good. So there isn\u2019t anything that hope has done to lead you on?\tThomas: Look, I\u2013 I know you\u2019re both looking out for me and I appreciate your concern.\tRidge: Simple question, son.\tThomas: Hope and me work together. We\u2019re co-parents together. That\u2019s where it stops. There is no reason that either of you should have any concern about hope and me going to rome together.\tLiam: I\u2019m tr\u2013 I\u2019m tryin\u2019, hope, I\u2019m really tryin\u2019, but this is just\u2013 it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s eating me up. You were\u2013 you were just in san francisco with the guy, and you were this close to spending the night together.\tHope: Because the plane had mechanical issues?\tLiam: I know. And now you\u2019re going to rome. Of all places.

That\u2013 that is what is happening here. He\u2019s not manipulating me, he\u2019s not sitting there biding his time. He is committed to hope for the future. And this could be one of the biggest showings of my entire career.\tLiam: I believe that. I believe it will be. And you absolutely need to be there, but thomas does not.

It\u2019s about time.\tThomas: Oh, it\u2019s about time, all right. It is.

And this is just a really long winded way of me trying to tell you that I am so thankful for you and you being willing to give me another chance in your life, and it\u2019s just\u2013 it\u2019s a testament to the kind of person that you really are.\tHope: Wow.

No, if there\u2019s a vibe, it\u2019s just a friendly one.\tHope: Uh, okay. Well, uh, what about sloan?\tThomas: The model?\tHope: She asked you out for drinks the other day?\tThomas: Yeah.

I\u2019ve got several people asking.\tHope: Oh, that actually reminds me. I did get your email and thank you for putting that list together on such short notice because I would like to partner with all of them. I mean, they all seem worthwhile.\tParis: Yeah? Great.

I\u2013 my, my crazy thought days are over.\tLiam: Well, listen, I, um, I appreciate you lending an ear and I appreciate your support. I know you\u2019ve got much better things to do than listen to me drone on and on about your brother, so.\tSteffy: Hey, what could be more important?\tLiam: Um, I don\u2019t know, maybe the whole like running a company thing.\tSteffy: Yeah.

I know he\u2019s your brother and you want him to succeed obviously.\tSteffy: Yeah, definitely.\tLiam: And I respect that and more than that, I respect you as a businesswoman, but you\u2019re the one who urged hope to bring thomas back on her line and I just, I got\u2013 I gotta think you wouldn\u2019t have done that if you thought there was even a possibility that he\u2019s not\u2013\tSteffy: No, no, they\u2019re a successful team. A profitable one. And thomas is a really talented designer.\tLiam: I know that. I\u2019m not questioning that. I\u2019m just\u2013 can he be professional? That\u2019s the thing. Like, can\u2013 can thomas be content with\u2013 with a totally platonic, healthy working relationship with hope or is he already going down the same path he always goes down where he starts getting obsessed with my wife?\tLiam: So, like, wait, I didn\u2019t, just so you know, I wasn\u2019t asking that out of nowhere.

Are you saying I have a reason to be concerned?\tSteffy: No, no, no\u2013\tLiam: Really? Are you sure, \u2019cause?\tSteffy: No, not any more. I\u2019m sure. I\u2019m sure.

He wasn\u2019t even allowed here in this building. If I thought thomas was the same man he used to be, lying and manipulating, I would not expose hope to that kind of trauma.

Now, we can talk about a lot of his accomplishments, but one thing stands out to me as a father who\u2019s concerned about family, is how he dealt with raising devon and lily. Every parent hopes to pass on to his offspring a solid foundation with which the children who go out into the world and deal with all the slings and arrows. Often outrageous fortune. Neil did that. The fact that both devon and lily are here tonight, honoring the memory of the man who raised them, says everything about my friend. And says everything about family because after all has been said and done, it is family that holds us together. So cheers to neil and his memory.\tAll: To neil.\tSummer: I\u2013 I\u2013 I don\u2019t understand. Did the\u2013 did the D.A. Drop the charges?\tKyle: Michael was able to get mom out on bail.

I mean, the very idea is preposterous. Why are you looking at me that way?\tI guess I just, I thought you\u2019d be more upset. I mean, how can you be so sure that it\u2019s not true?\tSorry, just had to send that. Um, No problem. So you were saying Lee walked in, stormed in. It\u2019s more like it. Ever since he left us at the end, I was worried about it happening and EJ assured me that he would have his best people on Lee\u2019s people and he would be kept off the scent. This, this is awful. How did Lee even figure it out?\tLook at ejs gonna be furious. He\u2019s gonna be furious. So how ugly did it get? It didn\u2019t get physical, did it? Wow. Not to mention Gabby\u2019s shares. She\u2019s not gonna get any now. She must be a wreck. No, no. Gabby and Lee\u2019s deal is still on. Really? Hmm. Even though he found you in bed with her, Lee found me in bed.\tOoh. Somebody else,\tI, I don\u2019t understand. You did go to the Salem in last night, didn\u2019t you? I followed the plan Exactly. I burst in and caught step infl grande.

Well, the last time we talked, I told you that if you didn\u2019t hand me an airtight case against Sloan Peterson, my office would have to drop the whole thing. Yeah. Since then, radio silence.

Oh, of course I was.\tI flat out lied, but it wasn\u2019t meant to hurt him. It, it was to, to see he worries about me and I don\u2019t want him to, it\u2019s not good for him. Like I said, you don\u2019t have to explain anything to me. Okay. Now, could you, uh, tell me why you\u2019re here? Well, I have an appointment with Dr. Greenberg. I guess he\u2019s running late.\t", "Uh, no, he actually got called into surgery. He asked me to handle your initial workup and.

That\u2019s good to hear. Mm-hmm. You have a nice night.\tYou too.\tSo you\u2019re up work. It\u2019s not work if you love it. I just made a strudel that was a masterpiece. If I do say so. You know, it\u2019s, it\u2019s kind of weird hearing a doctor, well, X doctor be so happy to triple their customer\u2019s cholesterol levels. Look, I know you think I\u2019m wasting my medical degree, but once a doctor, always a doctor, whatever, you say, oh, you don\u2019t believe me.\tAsk my boss\u2019s mother. She\u2019ll tell you, just today I performed a medical miracle.\tSo you performed a medical miracle? Yes. Chanel\u2019s mother was convinced she was having a heart attack, and I diagnosed it as a panic attack. Wow. You know, that\u2019s right up there with the loaves and fishes. You always minimize my achievements. I\u2019ve always spoke very highly of your cupcakes. The works of art.\t", "Huh? You know, I just see Paulina having a panic attack.

You know, life in the fast lane. Hmm. Okay. Stop. Let me ask you this.\tWhen\u2019s the last time you\u2019ve been on a date since that X, please. Five. Your silence speaks volumes. Girl, you need to get back out. What about that hunky cop guy that I always see you with? Hmm. Sean\u2019s my partner and he\u2019s married. No, I\u2019m not talking about him. I\u2019m talking about your boss, the Hernandez guy.\tHmm. Hey, commissioner. Hello, Mr. Mayor. Check in, see if there\u2019s anything new on the break here, and call me the sauce. Yeah, well, unfortunately we didn\u2019t have enough evidence on Peterson to hold her, but Jada and I will start over tomorrow. Jada Hunter, right? Mm-hmm. I just ran into her. Yeah.

I mean, you\u2019ve gone on the run before.\tDiane: Why would I want to leave my home, when I have everything I could possibly want right here?\tAshley: You had everything you could want before and you still walked away.\tJack: That was a completely different situation and you know damn well.\tAshley: So, what if she gets bored and she wants to leave again? It won\u2019t be just kyle who\u2019s left with a broken heart. It\u2019ll be you left holding the bag for a, what, seven-figure bail payment? Not to mention the fortune you\u2019re spending on her defense.\t", "Daniel: [ Sighs] I would prefer if we agreed that this was the right decision.\tSummer: It\u2019s not. Daniel, mom faked her own death. She framed diane and she killed stark. What if the police don\u2019t see that as self-defense and she goes to prison forever? Do you really want that on your head?\tDaniel: Of course not.\tSummer: Okay. We\u2019re gonna tell the truth. We will. We just need to figure out a way to keep mom safe first.\tDaniel: Sitting on a lie never solves anything. I was talking to lily earlier tonight\u2013\tSummer: You didn\u2019t say anything to her about this, did you?\tDaniel: No, of course, I didn\u2019t say anything to her. But something she said to me just really resonated. It\u2013 it was something about the decisions you make, the ones you can live with and the ones that you can\u2019T. I can\u2019t live with this secret, knowing how many people it\u2019s hurting.\tSummer: So, you\u2019re willing to jeopardize our mom\u2019s entire future because of\u2026 your conscience?\tSummer: Yes, summer. My conscience. That thing that helps guide me through life and determining right from wrong.\tSummer: Oh, my god. Get over yourself. This isn\u2019t about you. This is about mom and what she needs and what she needs is us. We have to help her. We are the only chance she has at coming back home.\tDaniel: Look, I understand that you are angry about\u2013\tSummer: Oh, don\u2019t do that condescending big brother thing to me because it\u2019s not like you have all this wisdom. You blew up your own family, remember? So, what makes you think that you can make the smart, sensible choice in all of this\u2013\tDaniel: You\u2019re right, summer. You\u2019re right. I blew up my own family. You know why? \u2018Cause I was so damn busy worried about my own pain that I forgot to put heather and lucy first. But you know what, I fixed it and I learned from it.\tSummer: Wow. Good for you.\tDaniel: You really sound like mom, you know that? You really do. Let me ask you something. What\u2019s it like when kyle holds you in his arms and he\u2019s trying to comfort you because he thinks that you\u2019re grieving and he loves you.\t", "Summer: Don\u2019t do that.\tDaniel: No, no, no, no. And what\u2019s it like knowing how upset he is about his mother? His mother that he just started to rebuild a relationship with. How can you look him in the eyes knowing that you could take all that pain away? But instead, you just keep choosing to lie to him.\tKyle: Thanks, but I\u2019m good. I gotta go.\tMariah: No, no, no. The hell you are. Your life is a mess. I say that with love. But this thing that you\u2019re doing, kyle, this stiff upper lip thing, it\u2019s not good. You need to be able to get this out and not with another abbott. There\u2019s plenty of stiff upper lips in that family. So, spill.\tKyle: There is some good news. My mom got out on bail today.\tMariah: That is amazing. So, why don\u2019t you look happier? And why are you here instead of with diane?\tKyle: Well, summer walked in the front door, saw her, there was a confrontation, and she couldn\u2019t get out of the house fast enough. I\u2019ve been looking everywhere for her.\tMariah: Ah. Uh, well, I gotta say, I think that I\u2019m team summer on this one. It\u2019s gotta be hard living under the same roof as the person who was accused of killing your mom. Not that I think diane did it.\tKyle: No, my mom is innocent. Summer just can\u2019t see it. Even worse, I swear that when she looks at me, she doesn\u2019t see her husband, she sees the son of her mother\u2019s killer.\tMariah: As sure as you are of your mother\u2019s innocence, you have to understand that summer sees it differently. Her mom was killed. She is grieving and she\u2019s angry and she has to have a place to put all of this blame. And who better than the person that all of the evidence points to?\tKyle: No, I\u2013 I get why summer feels the way she does. But I don\u2019t know how much longer I can stand having my wife believe I am defending a murderer. Just the idea that she thinks that of me, it hurts like hell.\t"], "answer": [1, 0, 3, 4, 2]}

The only thing that seemed to lift his spirits was the possibility of a relationship without hope.\tOnly He was reluctant to pursue it because of. Well, sculpt of Uncle Beau. I see.

Well, I have reason to worry about him, don\u2019t I? What with Bo being alive and learning that he\u2019s the one who might have killed Kate. Yeah, it\u2019s um, so after take in, that\u2019s for damn sure. I just can\u2019t help but think if there is a way that I put, if not told him, oh, no, no, no, no.\tCan\u2019t even think like that. Can\u2019t tell him the truth. Uh, Even if it hurts, it\u2019s always the right thing to do. And besides, we\u2019re talking about Megan Hathaway here.

Oh, living in Salem is one thing that living under the same roof is something else.\tIs there tension? No, not at all. But they\u2019ve hardly had a chance to reconnect since we got back from Greece. You know, after all those months of thinking my mom was dead, the way they look at each other, I\u2019m starting to feel like a third wheel. Wow. Yeah. Tmmi. Oh, no. Yeah, a little, sorry. I\u2019m just, I\u2019m starting to think that maybe it\u2019s time for me to look for my own place.\tYou know what\u2019s funny is I, I was thinking the exact same thing on Maggie. Hey, is everything okay? I don\u2019t know. You tell me. Did you just make a deal with Yuri Koff? Yeah. Yeah, we did. We\u2019re actually launching a brand new digital fashion line on his app. What about it? Well, up until a few weeks ago, he was ready to make a deal featuring exclusive Titan content.\tOn that very same app.\tWell, you should know, Alex. You blew the whole thing. Did you do this on purpose? Excuse me? Well, I was in Greece with Victor and I let you take that meeting with Fury. Your one job was to get him to sign that contract. And somehow he didn\u2019t. And ever since, I\u2019ve been wondering how you managed to botch such a simple task, and now I know you did it on purpose.\t", "Ah, I hope so. Me too. I mean, I just had to. Promise our two top reporters are raised so they wouldn\u2019t jump ship. I bet you\u2019re regretting not taking that job at Titan. Rightly, and even the worst day of the Spectator is still a day I get to spend with you. Yeah, and there it is. The patented Sander Cook charm, which has convinced me to ignore all the reasons why pursuing a relationship with you is a horrible idea.\tAnd yet here I am. What can I say? It\u2019s a blessing and a curse. Okay, back to work for one second. Are you sure that Maggie\u2019s not truly upset that you turned her down? I mean, yeah, she was disappointed, obviously, but she knows I have to fall in my heart. Are you sure about that? About Maggie? Yeah, I know. It\u2019s just when I went over there to talk to her, I had the strangest encounter with Bonnie.\tOh,\tI thought you could use a fresh supply. Thank you, honey. Go. That is some cold you have. It seemed to have come outta nowhere. No, I told you it\u2019s God\u2019s way of punishing me for lying. No, no. That\u2019s not how it works. And you know that besides, all you did was pretend you were sick. That\u2019s not all I did. I told like a zillion lies.\tGod, Justin. It just kept on yapping and yapping and digging myself in deeper. I really didn\u2019t mean to. I mean, it just sand her short off and I panicked. You\u2019re caught off guard. You weren\u2019t expecting to see him. No. Please don\u2019t use that word expecting it. Just reminds me of the secret Sarah\u2019s wanting me to keep, but honey, it just makes me panicky.\tOkay, sweetheart. Xander\u2019s not here. Yeah, but he could come back and I could mess up everything. I could crack under this pressure and tell him Sarah\u2019s pregnant with his kid.\tLike sand through the hourglass. So are the days of our lives.\tIs it okay for you to invite Stephanie here to dinner? More than Okay. You know, I like her so much. Oh, well, you know, she feels the, the same way about you, you know, you and Doug. It, um, our talk yesterday in the cemetery, it, it really did help. You\u2019re right. Guilt is corrosive. And, and Abby wouldn\u2019t want me to shut myself off to the world.\tShe would, she would want me to live my life. Yeah. She would darling. And\t", "God, I was so shocked to see Zander there. I, I just, I couldn\u2019t think straight. I, I just, the more kept trying not to tell him what I knew. The more it got closer to blurting it out, it was like I was a pressure cooker ready to blow, you know? I\u2019m just so glad I have a release valve. What\u2019s that? Oh honey, you, if I wasn\u2019t able to tell someone I\u2019d be climbing the damn walls, I am just so grateful.\tYou don\u2019t have a problem keeping Sarah Secret. You know, actually Bonnie, I do.\tSo Bonnie may have reacted a little over the top, but maybe she was trying to be considerate and try not to get you sick. Yeah. But that wasn\u2019t really even the weird part. It wasn\u2019t, no, no. As I was leaving, I found out that Nicole was pregnant. I got a news alert on my phone and when I read it, I went, oh wow, she\u2019s pregnant.\tAnd Bonnie replied with, she told you she\u2019s pregnant. Why would Bonnie think that Nicole would tell you personally that she\u2019s pregnant? Right? I mean, everyone knows Nicole and I aren\u2019t exactly pal\u2019s, honestly, I, I got the impression that Bonnie thought I was talking about someone else.\tYou have a problem keeping Sarah\u2019s secret. Why didn\u2019t you tell me this before? Well, you didn\u2019t gimme a chance. You just handed me a dollar. So we\u2019d have attorney client privilege. No, wait. Hang on, hang on. I filled you in and told you we had to keep this between us, and then Maggie interrupted us. But after she left, you didn\u2019t say a word.\tYou kissed me and went off to your meeting. And in fact, we talked on the phone later and you seemed like everything was fine. I know, but I\u2019ve had some time to think. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Justin, please, please. You gotta stick with me on this. Just like you stick with your clients, you keep their confidences, and I bet they have secrets way worse than this.\tWell, that may be, but those secrets don\u2019t involve my cousin. Are we feeling bad for Xander? Are we forgetting what he did to me? No, I\u2019m still very upset with him, but that doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m okay with keeping life-changing information from him. Justin, I made a promise to Sarah. I know you did, but I didn\u2019t and I just don\u2019t feel comfortable knowing that Sarah\u2019s pregnant with Sander\u2019s baby and he doesn\u2019t know\t", "thank you. Just you, you know, for your wisdom and for everything you\u2019ve done for, for me and the kids and helping out. And I, I just, I, I, I really don\u2019t know what I would do without you guys. Well, Doug and I feel the same way about you having, having you here with your children. It\u2019s a comfort. It\u2019s been wonderful.\tWe love you. We love you kids too.\tHello Doug. Let me in. Hi, is he in the Dan in front of the big tv. Yeah, I think so. Uhhuh, well, a few darlings will, excuse me. I will just get ahold of my naughty husband and put him back into bed. Enjoy your dinner. I hope I\u2019m not too late. No, no, you\u2019re right on time.\tSo neither of us are having much luck with the ladies at the moment, but at least things are going damn well between you and I. That\u2019s a big comfort. I\u2019m serious man. We may be family, but after all the fighting, Sonny and I did a Titan. There is no guarantee this was gonna work out. I know it\u2019s still early and we just landed Yuri freaking Kana about the gate.\tAre you kidding me? I think this is the beginning of a very long, successful partnership, Alex. It could be. Or in a couple months we end up trying to kill each other. Who knows? Dude, the pessimism. My God. You\u2019re right. You\u2019re, listen. I\u2019m so, don\u2019t take it personally. Okay. Just lay lately, being hopeful about anything hasn\u2019t worked out for me.\tI\u2019m just constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop.\tWe need to talk now.\tYou had a strange encounter with Bonnie. Isn\u2019t every encounter with that woman strange? Now this was stranger than usual. How so? Well, she was nervous, like super jumpy, scared. Really? When I walked in, she screamed at me to stay back and then ran behind the couch. Well, maybe she has a little bit of PTs. D From that time you held her prisoner in the garden.\tShe, yeah, I mean, obviously that\u2019s what I thought too, but no, Bonnie assured me that she\u2019s forgiven me for all that. Then why would she tell you to stay away? Well, her excuse was that she had some terrible cold and she didn\u2019t want me to catch it.\tSo after you left to go meet with your client, I gave myself this pep talk, you know, I said, body girl, you got this. You just gotta steer clear as Xander. And I turned around. Boom. There he was. You must have been surprised. Surprised. No, I was terrified. God. It was like being in a horror film where you\u2019re peeking around the corner looking for the killer and you turn around and he is been behind you the whole time.\t", "Hi. Hi. How\u2019s uh, how\u2019s Doug feeling? Well, I\u2019m getting him some chicken soup. And he insisted it was fine for him to come downstairs and eat the soup in front of the big tv and I insisted, no, he\u2019s still recovering from the flu and he should stay put and have the soup upstairs in bed. Uhhuh, I can guess who won that argument.\tIt wasn\u2019t easy. Oh, thank you so much for spending time with him earlier. There\u2019s nothing he loves more than a good game of gin rummy. Yeah, we, I mean, like I told him, there\u2019s, there\u2019s nobody I would rather spend time with. No, I\u2019m grateful he took his mind off Abraham for a little while. Oh. And he lifted my spirits as he always does.\tI\u2019m so glad. So, um, what are your plans this evening, darling? I noticed you set out the good silver and the good napkins. Well, um, if it\u2019s, uh, if it\u2019s okay, I was, uh, hoping to have Stephanie over for dinner. There\u2019s our baby girl. Hi. The, uh, the Juneteenth celebration was just incredible food, music. Oh. If only the hospital hadn\u2019t had that emergency, I would\u2019ve loved to have gone.\tYou were missed both of you. Yeah. Well, John and I didn\u2019t wanna let up on the search for Abe. Abe was supposed to give the keynote speech and Theo stepped in for him. He did such a great job. I bet he did. This whole thing is so horrible. I mean, who on earth would wanna kidnap Abe baby? That\u2019s what we\u2019re all trying to figure out.\tWhat is it? Who, what is it? Um, it\u2019s Alex. Oh, is everything okay? Yeah. Fine. He just, um, was sharing some good news. Yes. We just did that. We just did that and I just sent the signed contract off to legal. Which means we are officially in business Basic Black with Yuri Casas. No. Good job man. Good job. Hey, it\u2019s all you man.\tDrinks on me. Ah, drinks yeah, drinks on me. No bueno, Alex. Ah, right. Yeah, I\u2019m sorry about that. That\u2019s my bad. Well, how about we, um, I don\u2019t know, split a play of nachos wings. Hey, whatever the hell you want. I just know I\u2019m in way too good of a mood to go home right now, and it\u2019s not like anybody\u2019s waiting on us.\tRight. Yeah, definitely not. Oh, I\u2019m so tired.

You can spew your grandiose threats all you want on Melinda, but you know damn well that if these Salem Keystone cops actually had anything on me, I\u2019d be in custody. Not necessarily, and since it\u2019s fairly obvious that this crime was committed on the night before, everyone was tripping on those biscuits.\tYou\u2019d better start inventing your alibi for saided night. She doesn\u2019t have to invent one because she was with me all night. Yeah. Well, you better hope someone can corroborate that Ms. Trask in order for somebody to corroborate that. That means they would have to have been there. Sloan and I are not into that kind of thing.\tWhen we spend the night together. We like just to be two of us together and what a wonderful night it was.\t", "Oh. How awful for you. I\u2019m so sorry, but why should I give a damn? Since I had nothing to do with this? Here\u2019s why you should give a damn Ms. Peterson. You have caught the wrong people in your net, powerful people who do not like being screwed with. So get your affairs in order because I am going to make sure that you go down for this and you will go away for a long, long time.\tWe don\u2019t have the evidence that we need to tie Sloan to any of this. Oh, no fingerprints. No, no security footage. Oh, detective Hunter interviewed Chanel and Talia, her new employee. Your sister? Yes. Yeah, who accidentally left the security camera off. She\u2019s still new with the job.\tAnd Sloan Peterson is still walking streets. With all due respect, Mr. Mayer, we can\u2019t even be sure that Sloan was the perp. We checked the security cameras this morning. There is no way that anyone could have tampered with these. Baby. I, I\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s, it\u2019s just with everyone is sale. I\u2019m so worried about being drugged.\tSuddenly got got a little worried myself because I know that was a one-time awful thing that you and Talia had nothing to do with. Uh, so gimme that delicious beer claw. In fact, gimme a whole tray of \u2019em. I\u2019ll show you how much I support you. You know not to mention how much I love Sweet Fit, and it\u2019s the finest bakery on the planet.\tOh Mama. It\u2019s okay. Look, you don\u2019t need to prove anything to me or Talia. We both know that you\u2019re on our side. It\u2019s just I\u2019m feeling a little sensitive this morning because Sweet Bids business is doing really bad for the first time ever, and. Well, we all know who\u2019s to blame that evil. Sloan Peterson, she came to Salem to ruin me, and she thinks I took her mother\u2019s life.\tAnd that isn\u2019t news. But what is news is she\u2019s succeeding. Her plan to destroy me is going real, real well. Oh,\tOh, look after me baby girl. I will not stand idly by while Sloane continues her heinous attacks on us. On your business, on decency itself, and I swear to you, should now mommy your phone. Oh, it can wait. No, no, mom, it\u2019s okay. Just take it. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going anywhere. Okay, honey, but I\u2019ll be right back.\tI love my mama and trust me, she can move mountains when she puts her mind to it. But it\u2019s not like she can single handedly convince everyone to trust our treats. Talia, I I don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna be able to keep you on. Hey, don\u2019t worry about me right now. Okay. Listen, I\u2019ll be fine and so will you. And yes, unfortunately people are worried about what sweetest has to offer.\t", "I thought you were gonna sleep day away. Oh, who saw? Is that Mr. Keeping me up all night? Hmm. So you enjoyed your new bed and your new room. And your new room. Well, can you tell, I mean, it is a new bed and then new room, but it\u2019s not a new home. We, we lived here once upon a time as husband and wife. I remember.\tI do. It\u2019s the happiest time of my life and now you\u2019re back here where you belong. Pretty soon, your divorce from Lee will be final and we\u2019ll be back to being Mr. And Mrs. Steph and Damara again forever. This time. For now, do you think we completely press in the place? No, no. I think we could go for another minute.\tI didn\u2019t tell EJ and I don\u2019t want him to know, so it has to be our little secret.\tYou haven\u2019t touched your breakfast\tpenny for your thoughts.\tYou haven\u2019t even touched your breakfast. No appetite. You\u2019re still thinking about Polly\u2019s rant last night, aren\u2019t you? I mean, how can I not God, Eric, it seems like every time something awful happens in this town, I\u2019m the one that\u2019s getting blamed for it. It\u2019s so unfair. It is. I know,\tI know. You know, I\u2019m sorry. I should be focusing on the positive, you know, like you and I are officially a thing now. You sing. Sounds so official To hell with everything else, Eric, Brady and I are officially thanks. Hey, I, I already feel better. Good.\tAre you sure you want to eat that? Sloan? What? I\u2019d expect retaliation if I were you after drugging all of Salem\u2019s breakfast, including mine.\tHi.\tSorry, it\u2019s just, um, no, no, I, I understand, but I promise I am not hallucinating anymore. I even skip breakfast just to be sure. I am not happy with you two. I\u2019m not happy at all. I dunno what, what\u2019s wrong? Am uh, please tell me that Sloane Peterson didn\u2019t go public with what she saw. Not that I know of. And I don\u2019t give a damn about that kiss that happened between the two of you when you were hallucinating or whatever.\tWhat I do give a damn about is there has been no arrest. In this insane drugging debacle, you know, the only person that\u2019s paid a price is my stepdaughter, whose career is in jeopardy. So what is the hold up? Why the hell is Sloan Peterson still walking the streets?\tReally? No one, and we can\u2019t even give this stuff away. People see me standing here smiling, and then they just turn, tell and run. Even old Mrs. Weaver, who is always here bright and early every morning, you know, I\u2019m so sorry. Those breakfast biscuits were my recipe. I feel terrible. Why? It\u2019s not your fault.\t", "It\u2019s not like you drug those biscuits. What are you feeling guilty about?\tMorning girl. Morning mama. I have a bearclaw. On the house.\tMaybe I\u2019m not in, in the mood for a BigLaw. Not in the mood. Since when have you ever not been in the mama? Not you too.\tLike sand through the hourglass. So are the days of our lives.\tRemember you said that to me earlier, Patty, for your thoughts. Ej, this is where you, this is where you jump in. Sorry. I, um, honey, is, is something bothering you?\tI\u2019m just a little tired. I mean, Aren you, after all that racket coming from Stefan\u2019s room last night. Oh yeah. That was quite a performance and I\u2019d say Act three was a bit unnecessary. Yeah, that\u2019s, that\u2019s the problem. Those noises weren\u2019t a performance, not this time. It was all too real. A bloody siren call to troubled waters.\tYou think they heard us downstairs? I think they heard us in Cat Mando. But who cares? Not me. I love you. I love you. I can stay with you like this all day. Yeah. Mm-hmm. What are you doing the rest of the year wide open. We both know we do some pretty important plans today. We certainly do. Yeah.\tPlease. You know, It\u2019s one thing for Paulina Price who\u2019s totally ignorant to how the law works to make an accusation with absolutely no proof whatsoever, but it is unseemly, if not despicable and unethical for someone with a law degree to do the same. I assume you do have a law degree in Melinda. Yeah, and I also have a brain, which is why I deduce that you are the only person that hates Chanel Dupree enough to want to kill her business.\tAnd don\u2019t even get started on these conspiracy theories that her and her mother are masterminding a frame up because both of us know that that is patently ridiculous. Ms. Trask, if you don\u2019t mind, I believe that Sloan pointed out that you have no evidence to prove that she ever tampered with the biscuits, which means this is heading towards slander.\tWould I be correct, Sloan? Oh, this is not slander Mr. Brady. It is personal, you see, because I was also drug by whatever the hell was in those biscuits. I ended up assaulting Stephan Damira and I wound up spending the night in the hospital. And do you know who was in the room? Across from me, the police commissioner.\t", "This, this is preposterous Stephan moving Gabby back into my family home without consulting me acting like it\u2019s his God-given, right?

She, Dr. Ralphs manufacturer serum to cure them, and then he kept them in a cryogenic state. Okay. It\u2019s a lot to take in. Yeah. My God. Funeral. She\u2019s alive. My God. That\u2019s wonderful. That\u2019s incredible. Hmm. Oh my God. But what about Kate?\tIt was just so real. Andrew came and he, he told me my parents were dead.\tI know what nightmares are. When I lost Abby, I, uh, I was afraid to close my eyes. Chad, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to No, no, no. Don\u2019t I That\u2019s, I, I, I\u2019m just saying that I know how scared you must be. I really do believe we\u2019re gonna find them alive. That\u2019s weird. What is, you said that in my nightmare, you\u2019re.\tEven in a nightmare. Thank you. I couldn\u2019t get through this without you. I wouldn\u2019t let you think about this. We\u2019re making progress. We\u2019re getting closer. Are we? I mean, now that we know that it wasn\u2019t Thomas Banks who took my mom, to me it feels like we don\u2019t even have a clue of who we\u2019re dealing with, let alone why.\t", "Where are we going? Not you? Just her. She\u2019s not her. She\u2019s your sister. Okay. Beautiful. Sister of mine. I have found a Titan Research Lab, brand new. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s used it, but it has everything you say. You need to create the formula for the sear. So, yep, we\u2019ve got the orchid, the prisms, everything we need.\tLet\u2019s go over my dead body. Hmm. That could be arranged.\tNot yet, nothing. What, what\u2019d he ask? Uh, because you look like you haven\u2019t slept. Yeah. It\u2019s just, you know, it\u2019s uncomfortable and I, I can\u2019t stop worrying about Steven, Kayla. Yeah, me too. I, last night I was racking my brain trying to figure out why banks was telling Stephanie and Chad. He said he wanted them to lead him to Kayla, but why does he even care about Kayla?\tAnd why did Megan lie to us about her? Really did take her, she must be protecting someone, right? The question is, who does she care enough about to protect? The fact is that she is crazy too. Yeah, very crazy. But she\u2019s definitely not stupid. She never does anything without reason. A self-serving reason.\tHarris, it\u2019s so frustra. There are so many questions and no good answers. Listen, hope\tthere\u2019s something I have to tell you.\tYou know, I really do think it\u2019s, it\u2019s good that it wasn\u2019t Thomas Banks that took your mom and that guy is extremely dangerous. He tried to kill hope, but whoever has her and my dad may be worse. I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m whoever did this was sophisticated enough to waltz into a police station, impersonating Shane Donovan, and walk out with your dad without raising any suspicions.\tChad, that\u2019s terrifying. That means that he\u2019s really, really good at being a criminal. Yeah, I\u2019m, I\u2019m, I\u2019m not so sure. I mean, if it\u2019s the same person who took both your parents, he let your mom get to his cell phone. He hasn\u2019t made any random demands. So then what does he want? I don\u2019t know. I mean, that\u2019s the question.\tHe can\u2019t be taking orders from Megan Hathaway. If he ever was because she\u2019s in prison. Isa swept the island and found her Ralph and a whole lot of jungle, and there aren\u2019t a lot of people that it could be when you get your detective badge. Well, your dad taught you how to pick locks. Mine was a master criminal.\tYou ask yourself, what would Stefan out do? Something like that. Yeah. And like I, I, I still think the best clue we have is the one your mom gave us when she said Victor\u2019s name. I think she\u2019s gonna be at one of his properties. I mean, we. You still have a few to check out? I really do believe we\u2019re gonna find them today.\tYou just gotta have faith. Okay. I\u2019m trying. I\u2019m trying.\t", "Yeah. Who the hell is that at this time of night?\tWhoa. And you\u2019re home. Home. You were in Bed Man\u2019s, your. I forgot. I\u2019ll go. No, no. I\u2019ll, no, no, no. Get your butt in here. Come on, man. I\u2019m nowhere near going to bed. You now you look beat. Have a seat. Yeah. Well, yes I am. Uh, the, uh, flight got in late to here. I, uh, couldn\u2019t sleep on the plane. I, it\u2019s way too late. I shouldn\u2019t, I\u2019m doing some work here.\tEating a sandwich. You want some food? I\u2019m, I\u2019m getting you a sandwich. You want a drink? I\u2019m good. Good. All right. No, I\u2019ve, um, been trying to get ahold of you buddy. Yeah. I was in Ireland to, uh, you know, scatter Katie\u2019s ashes. Yeah, I know. And then I spent a few days with Carrie and Austin and, uh, Billy and Chelsea.\tSo that was good. Yeah. Few days, huh? So what you um, lost track of time. You\u2019ve been gone a hell of a lot longer than that. Yeah. Well, I. Went out the grid for a while. I just needed some, uh, time to myself to kind of, you know, get it together before I came back home without Kate. Yeah, I get that.\tA few things I need to tell you. First of all, Steven, I, we found Megan Hathaway. Did you kill her? No. No, but she\u2019s in custody. She\u2019s paying for what she did. Not enough. Roman, there\u2019s something else that you need to know, and this is, this is kind of complicated, John. I thought I heard somebody.\tSure. You don\u2019t want something to eat? No, I, I wanna get. As soon as I get this list of Victor\u2019s properties in order so that we don\u2019t keep doubling back. Some of these places are up in the mountains. This could take forever.\tOh God. Jen, how can this be happening? Hey, listen. Look at me. Your parents are fine. I\u2019m sure of it. How can you be? How can I be? Well, cuz what we\u2019re talking about, Steven, Kayla. The meanest sons of bitches in the valley.\tMaybe that\u2019s Andrew.\tYou found them? We found where they were being held. Steph, when we stormed in to try to rescue them, there was resistance. Resistance. The people who were holding them were armed and they fought back. Steph, they were caught in a crossfire. Both of them. I\u2019m sorry. They died. No, no, no. What, what? What was a nightmare?\tHe said they were dead. Who? No, nobody\u2019s. Nobody\u2019s dead. They\u2019re not dead. They\u2019re okay.\tIt\u2019s best for both of us. If you think about. For hope too. She started a whole new life. She\u2019s moved on with you and you guys, you, you have a good thing going. Why break her heart again? So she\u2019s all yours. You get the girl, I get my new life without her win-win as long as you keep this little conversation of ours.\t", "Well, well, and she said she didn\u2019t, said it was someone who worked for her. This is who you think has Kayla. No, we\u2019re not sure about that. Megan said that Thomas Banks is the one who took killing. Thomas Banks is in custody in Greece. He\u2019s denying everything. Well, of course he is. Apparently he has an ironclad alibi and Brady said Kristen sold him a bill of goods about Megan Recanting in the Nu Recanting.\tYour story. So all this is tracking. There\u2019s something else you should know. Steve went to look for Kayla. Now he\u2019s missing as well. Damn. So Megan took Kate from me now once, but twice. And now she\u2019s the reason that Kayla and Steve are missing. What is she? She cut a deal to do her time in State\u2019s film. Okay, good.\tI don\u2019t have far to go to choke the truth out her. I did not.\tThe, the word he is arrested Thomas Banks and he insists he didn\u2019t kidnap Kayla. That he didn\u2019t kill Kate Roberts. Well, what else is he gonna say? Shirley, you didn\u2019t believe him? I did because he has an alibi for when Kate was killed and when Kayla disappeared. He was a Aristotle\u2019s retreat. The sex club.\tDing, ding, ding. You got it. And there\u2019s an orgy full of people who can verify his whereabouts. I can\u2019t imagine Thomas going at it with even one person, let alone in orgy full. That is the most ridiculous alibi I can imagine. Hmm. Well, it all checks out. But back to us, our deal was based on you supplying information that would lead us to Kayla, but you didn\u2019t supply information.\tInstead, you lied through your teeth. And those lies, in fact, led us off on a wild goose chase that impeded our efforts to find her. You will be remanded to a black site that makes Statesville look like the Ritz.\tYou know, the, the sketch artist is, uh, it\u2019s a good idea. Yeah, I know it\u2019s a long shot, but what else have we got? Michaels? It\u2019s us. Okay. Hi. And I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here too, right, Marilyn, how are you holding up? Um, pretty well. Only the occasional meltdown. Good morning, Chad. Good morning. So should, uh, should we write up the list like we did before?\tI think guys a great idea. We have three sites left on ours. Yeah, same here. Okay. Should we go now again, again, I will reiterate, if you do find anything, please call us right away. Okay. Whoever took your mom and dad is probably just as dangerous as banks.

What is it?\tTaylor: Thomas.\tBrooke: Thomas.\tTaylor: Brooke, the line was doing great when thomas was lead designer. Everyone loved what he and hope created together. And then he was let go, and the vision changed, and the numbers tanked, so yes, bringing back thomas is the solution.\tLiam: I am really surprised that steffy would even consider dropping hope for the future. I mean, your line has been a huge asset to forrester creations. Like\u2013\tHope: Mm-hmm. Yeah, until now.

And it\u2019s just that the two of them, those personalities alone in that house together? It\u2019s like darkness upon darkness. It is not healthy.\tHope: And bill\u2019s not worried at all.

Because you\u2019re always looking out for me, all in my best interest, given the lengths that I have gone to, to rescue you and protect you. I don\u2019t understand how you could possibly be questioning my motives.\tReally. Let me think about that. Um, you order me to kill, to kill, I, I don\u2019t know. I might. I think you have a more sinister agenda. That wasn\u2019t an order, that was also a suggestion, a friendly suggestion. I, I didn\u2019t want you and I to have any distractions. Right? Kind of like a do not disturb, shine, a permanent do not disturb a.\tThat vial has made you very negative and oppositional.\tI was just hoping that we could talk. Oh, well, good. Because there\u2019s something. I would like to talk about, what is it? I\u2019m leaving\tas beautiful as Turks and Caicos was. I\u2019m actually really happy to be back home, although I guess we\u2019re not technically home yet. Oh, not unless you have property on the waterfront of Annapolis, Maryland that I don\u2019t know about. No. . I\u2019m pretty sure our boat is about as much waterfront as I can handle.\tMm-hmm. Um, , but actually while we are in the us I was thinking, what if we make a little pit stop? Oh, let me guess. You want to go back to Salem? Mm-hmm. . We can fly out and we can see Sean and my grandparents. I mean, you read Grandma Julie\u2019s last email, she basically threatened us with bodily harm if we didn\u2019t bring him home for his first birthday.\t", "You always do. Yeah. Well, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m gonna find the words when I see John, your Uncle Steve, your Uncle Roman. I mean, I, I don\u2019t know. I guess we can just tell him how much we cared about Marlena and about Kayla and Kate and just let them know that our hearts go out to.\tYou know, I had another dream about Dr. Evans last night. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t like even remember all the details, but I was with her when she was dying and, uh, all I remember is that I was desperately trying to save her life, like, like she saved mine. And it, it really wasn\u2019t a bad dream, I guess it was a good dream because like I said, I, I can\u2019t remember all the details.\tI just remember. She opened her eyes,\tshe smiled at me and uh, I knew she was gonna survive.\tHated waking up from that train. I know you did.\tYou know, if it wasn\u2019t for her, I wouldn\u2019t have, you wouldn\u2019t have bow.\tWell, Marlena saw the man that you are, she saw the person that you really are, and at least she got to meet though, and she got to hold him and she saw how happy we are,\tand that was because of her.\tBen? Yeah, I am. I suddenly have this feeling like we\u2019re on, on the boat again, like we\u2019re on the water. It\u2019s, it\u2019s normal. Yeah. Trust me, I don\u2019t feel that great either. And I don\u2019t think we got our, our land legs back yet. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That must be it. It\u2019s just, um, it kinda feels like rocking and swaying and it\u2019s making me really dizzy.\tThey\u2019re probably just gonna eat something. No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what I need. Are you sure? Mm. Because you know this hotel is an amazing restaurant. Mm-hmm. , I\u2019ll just want a room service. They have some amazing seafood. They got these clam cakes and these fried clams that are supposed to be unbelievable.\tWas there something I said,\tHey, hi.\tHow are you feeling?\tNot sure what happened. You collapsed. I was really worried. The treatment had caused some kind of permanent damage, but the doctor, um, looked you over and assured me it was just a delayed reaction. He wants to keep an eye on you for a little while, make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. But really he didn\u2019t think, he didn\u2019t think you had anything to worry about.\tYou\u2019re okay. That\u2019s good to know.\tThank you for staying. Of course. I stayed. You scared.\tYou scared me. You were so pale Harris lying there on the floor. I feel better now, obviously. Yeah. Thank God obviously. I, I am a little thirsty. Yeah, of course. Treatment was so hard to watch. I can\u2019t even imagine what it must have been like to actually experience it.\tThanks. But Harris, you came through those co. John and Steve have pinpointed the location of the lab as we speak right now, and then you should get going. I know how important it\u2019s for you to find Megan. No, I\u2019m, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\t", "Well, if it will gimme my life back, it was worth it. And the first time, this is the first time in a, in a long time, I feel like that actually might happen. Have you thought about what you might wanna do with that life? Honestly, I don\u2019t know. Navy\u2019s my life. I mean, I like to get my career back, but considering how I was compromised, I don\u2019t think the feeling would be mutual.\tWell, maybe an arrangement could be made. I know you\u2019re close with the ISA director, but I don\u2019t know if even you could pull those strings. I wouldn\u2019t mind trying. I appreciate that. But here\u2019s what I do know.\tI\u2019d like to spend more time with you.\tSo this is the chart that Michaels remember seeing in the room where he was brainwashed. What\u2019s the number of this notable? Map 26 4. It might be too much to hope for, but I betcha. Somewhere on this map is the lab\u2019s location. So all these little dots right here, these indicate islands in the Mediterranean, right?\tYeah. And that island chain contains about 30 islands. 30. Yeah. Man, we gotta narrow that down. Partner. Well, hey, cross reference. These chain of islands with any of D\u2019S properties.\tOkay. No. It doesn\u2019t look like Stephano bought any property in this region. It\u2019s not. Couldn\u2019t be that simple. Great. So now we\u2019re looking for a needle in two haystacks. Well, wait a minute. Maybe we can eliminate some of these right off.\tAll right. This whole group right here, it\u2019d be almost impossible to approach because they\u2019re all surrounded by Rocky Schoz. All right, good to know. All right, we\u2019ll toss those out. What about, what about this group over here still leaves that wherever this lab is, it has to be housed in a fairly large facility.\tMost of these islands couldn\u2019t support that. In fact,\tthere\u2019s only one that has any infrastructure that size. What kind of infrastructure\twill that be? A military base.\tMegan eliminated her. Are you, are you saying that Yes, Kate is dead and the takeaway is that it\u2019s not a good idea to resist? Well, anything. Now moving right along. After Kate destroyed my initial batch, I went back to the drawing pat and actually improved it so soon. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be asking for another dose because this is going to give you quite a refresher.\tAnd what is it that that\u2019s going to refresh? All of you. My serum is a literal fountain of youth. Rev is intended. It\u2019ll turn back the clock. Make you young again, but I don\u2019t want that. Oh, no . Well, you certainly are in the minority. Most people would spend the fortune to go back in time, and as I say, youth is wasted on the young.\t", "What do you mean you\u2019re leaving? What are you talking about, Ben, in this hell hole for months. So I\u2019m getting out. You\u2019ve been here for years and that\u2019s why you\u2019re still. . Is that not good enough for you? Couldn\u2019t. It\u2019s a cell, so I gotta get back out there. Out where? Huh? Where are you going? I don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m not gonna find what I\u2019m looking for.\tStuck in here. And what is that? I have given you everything that you could possibly want. That\u2019s just the thing. I don\u2019t know what I want hope. All I know is I have a lot of questions like about who I am, so I just gotta get out there so I can find myself. Such a cliche. You have to find yourself. Do not mock me.\tI am not mocking you. But I just think that when people feel that they have to find themselves, that that is just a bit ridiculous, frankly, self indulgent. Not to mention the fact that you hardly have to travel anywhere to know what you want in life. Haven\u2019t you ever heard the expression wherever you go, there you are.\tWell, I don\u2019t want to be here. Hey, I just gotta, I gotta get out there, find some place where I can think and breathe. Maybe see the sky. Good.\tJust have to leave here so I can figure things out for myself though. I can tell you anything you wanna know. No, you can\u2019t. I\u2019m the only one who can answer these questions, so I\u2019m leaving here. I\u2019m afraid I cannot let you do that.\tAre you okay? Well, yeah, I am now. Please the love of God. Don\u2019t mention food again, so, okay. Really. See, I can\u2019t believe this right now. We just traveled the world in a boat. We get back to land and you get seasick. I am not seasick. Well then, what is it? Get a little bug down on the Caribbean or something.\tYou don\u2019t feel hot. Maybe we should postpone going to Salem. Get you a doctor. No, no, I, I didn\u2019t get a bug. I did not come down with the flu. Huh? Then what\u2019s wrong?\tOkay. So, um, I didn\u2019t wanna say anything until I knew I was sure, but about a week ago I realized that I was late.\tWhat are you saying? Yeah, I, I am, I, uh, I think I might be pregnant.\tWhat do you mean? Don\u2019t you wanna find Megan? What if you collapsed again? You just said the doctor said I was gonna be fine. Paris. What you just did, what you\u2019ve been through obviously took a tremendous toll. You were in a lot of pain. Even the doctor wanted to stop, but you insisted she keep going. Okay.\tDon\u2019t, don\u2019t, don\u2019t make me out to be some kind of hero, okay? I did it because, I don\u2019t want Megan to get away with it. She brainwashed me. She used me to hurt people. I wanna bring her down as much as you do. Oh, I don\u2019t know about that. I mean, I definitely wanna bring her down, but I didn\u2019t nearly get myself killed in the process.\t", "Yeah, I think her exact words were that if I don\u2019t see my great grandson soon, Doug and I will be water skiing to meet you. . Yes. And as much as I would literally love to see that, I think a two hour flight would just be easier for all of us. So what do you say you wanna bring Bill back home and show him what he\u2019s been missing?\tIt would be really great to see everybody again. Mm-hmm. , and obviously they\u2019d fall all over Bo. Mm-hmm.\tBut\tit\u2019s not gonna be the same without Dr. Evans being there.\tShould I flip a coin? Ah, not possible. No currency on this island.\tAny mini mining mo catch a doctor. How does the rest of it go? Ah, no matter I\u2019ll improvise. A chief of staff is good for a laugh, but to shrink, we really make you sink. Out goes by o you. Hmm.\tSo hope\u2019s efforts paid off. Huh? She got here is to give up Megan\u2019s location. Yeah, well, took quite a bit of effort and an assist from the isa, but he was finally able to remember some kind of facility in the Mediterranean where Rolf and Megan first programmed it. Hmm. Better. He remembered Z, an nautical chart on the wall, and he recalled the latitude and longitude markers.\tHope looked up the coordinates. She sent me this.\tSo what are you thinking? Partner? Megan\u2019s location can be somewhere on this map. After Megan fled Caracas, it\u2019s very possible she hole up in this location.\tAh, Dr. Johnson, welcome back to Len of the Living yet again. Let go of me. Let go. Don\u2019t try to. You\u2019re coming out as the effects of a very strong sedative. Your limbs won\u2019t be fully functioning for some time yet. Ah, I know she\u2019s still sleeping, but we won\u2019t be needing her participation as I\u2019ve determined that today is your lucky day,\tWell, not as a case. Maybe what he, what do you mean lucky? I have developed a miraculous new. One that, if not for the irrational influence of politics would be certain to win a Nobel Prize. But so I have no doubt of my genius. I\u2019m afraid I cannot prove its effectiveness without a human trial. Human trial.\tYour friend, Kate, first to be the first subject, but she destroyed my initial badge. Megan had no choice but to eliminate.\tWe both know how much Marlena did for you, for us, actually, and it\u2019s gonna be so strange to go back to Salem without her there. I think it\u2019s gonna be, it\u2019s gonna be more than strange. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s terribly sad. And you\u2019re on Kayla and Kate. Oh my God, it all just seems so unreal. You know, when we were gone for so long, I mean, we missed all the funerals.\tI think maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019m having a hard time believing that Dr. Evans is really gone. I never got the chance to say goodbye to her. And I mean, even if I did, I don\u2019t even know what I would\u2019ve said, Sierra. I mean, how do you thank somebody for literally saving your life?

You called her red, and now she\u2019s gone and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve even begun to mourn that loss yet.\tDaniel: You are overwhelmed and emotional and I think I know what\u2019s going on. I haven\u2019t told anyone this, but I see mom too. I see her all the time. Someone walking by me on the street and\u2013 and my heart, it skips a beep.\tSummer: This wasn\u2019t like that, daniel. This was real.\tDaniel: I know that it seems that way. I mean, those fleeting moments, they\u2013 they feel real to me too. But our mind, it plays tricks on us, especially in a stressful situation like this. And I think that\u2019s why mom, she comes to me in my dreams and you know, when I\u2019m alone, sometimes I find myself talking to her. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just my way of trying to hold on to her, I guess. Trying to still feel close and connected with her. I just keep thinking about the way she died and going over and over all the unanswered questions.\tSummer: What if I had answers to those questions? Moderate to severe eczema\tJack: Once again, you have misconstrued things. My desire to marry diane is quite separate from my need to mourn phyllis.\tBilly: With all due respect, I\u2013 I disagree, jack. It seems like to me, you\u2019re avoiding your pain and your grief by simply focusing on your future with diane.\t", "Daniel: If it was self-defense, why wouldn\u2019t she come back and explain everything?\tSummer: Because who would believe her? Who would believe her? She would be the one in jail right now for murder instead of diane. Daniel, we have to do something. I don\u2019t know\u2013 I don\u2019t know what, but we have to do something. We can\u2019t just let our mom slip away from us forever.\tMichael: That\u2019s not at all the way it happened. I didn\u2019t just deliberately take diane\u2019s case to go against your wishes.\tLauren: Then why did you?\tMichael: It was victor and nikki\u2019s rush to judgment. They had diane tried and convicted without any awareness of the facts. They didn\u2019t just suspect diane was to blame for phyllis\u2019s murder, they knew it.\tLauren: So, who cares what victor and nikki think, right?\tMichael: That\u2019s when I realized that\u2019s just the kind of jury that diane\u2019s gonna go up against in court. A bunch of biased people who have already made up their mind. Everybody deserves legal representation. Guilty or innocent and they deserve an attorney who works to make sure that the system is\u2013 that the system works fairly for everybody.\tLauren: Well, I can\u2019t argue with that.\tMichael: Exactly.\tLauren: But there are other top attorneys that could have defended her. Lawyers with no emotional ties.\tMichael: I think I\u2019m a good attorney because of my emotional ties and you are partially to blame for that. It is why I\u2019m passionate about what I do.\tLauren: Not this time. This is phyllis, our best friend, the victim, the woman who has gone through hell with us.\tMichael: You know she meant the world to me.\tLauren: And yet you choose not to fight for her, but her killer could go free because of you. And if that happens, I don\u2019t know if I can ever look at you again.\tAre you tired\tof washing dishes?\tDaniel: Summer, I know how hard it is to let go. I\u2019m dealing with it, okay? And I want you to know that I love you and I will be here for you every step of the way. I will.\tSummer: You think I\u2019m a wreck, don\u2019t you? You think I\u2019m out of my mind?\tDaniel: I think that you have to admit it is a pretty wild string of theories. But I understand. I get why you would be so desperate for there to be something that would tell us that mom\u2019s still out there somewhere.\tSummer: She is. I saw her.\tDaniel: If only that were true, it would make everything easier between you and kyle and it would probably fix the whole problem with diane.\tSummer: It would change everything.\tDanie: Yeah, it would. And that\u2019s a nice thought, but it isn\u2019t real. And it\u2019s not healthy for us to be obsessing over things that aren\u2019t gonna happen, summer. You and kyle, you\u2019re gonna be fine.

Is that the real reason why you invited me here?\tAshley: Maybe.\tTucker: You want me to be here?\tMichael: Hm. Thank you. So, how was your day?\tLauren: Fine. My day was fine.\tMichael: That sounds interesting. The weather\u2019s nice. Feels like summer might come early this year.\tLauren: That\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna talk about? The weather?\tMichael: I was hoping we could try to renew some sense of normalcy, you know, get things back the way they were. That appears not to be possible, especially in this place. It\u2019s way too much pain, it\u2019s in the air.\tLauren: I think it\u2019s the perfect place to talk about what\u2019s going on. Because this is the last place we saw phyllis alive.\tMichael: Do you want to talk about phyllis?\tLauren: Yes, I do want to talk about phyllis. I have been trying to contain myself and I can\u2019t do it anymore. How do you justify defending the woman who murdered our best friend?\t[ Jack sighing ]\tJack: Working late?

I\u2013 I just came from seeing diane.\tBilly: Really? I thought kyle said she didn\u2019t want to see anyone.\tJack: Yeah, well, I chose to ignore her. I told her I refused to let this thing come between us, to tear us apart. What\u2019s more, I told her that I wanted to marry her now more than ever and I wanted to do it right away.\tBilly: And what did she say?\t[ Summer sighing ]\tSummer: Mom?\tDaniel: It\u2019s just me.

Is there any part of the service I can take off your hands?\tSummer: No, I just came from the venue and it\u2019s all ready to go.

I need something positive to focus on. Lily, please. My mom, she loved the whole idea of this concept, even if she went behind my back and she tried to find other backers without consulting me first. You know, if you think about it, it was probably the most phyllis thing that she could do.\tLily: Okay, daniel, okay.

She\u2019s so caught up in planning this service, we\u2019ve barely spoken in days.\tJack: Hey, summer is a perfectionist, even in the best of circumstances. Staying busy, distracting herself from the pain she\u2019s feeling might be soothing.\tKyle: It\u2019s more than that, dad. It\u2019s like she\u2019s on a mission to prove something. To be together where we last saw phyllis.\tDiane: Well, either way, it leaves me with a dilemma.\tJack: How do you mean?\tDiane: Well, I\u2019m trying to give summer space to grieve in her own way, but to her, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m a reminder of the events that led up to phyllis\u2019s collapse. I don\u2019t want to cause her any more pain, so maybe I should just stay home.\tKyle: That\u2019s the one answer I was able to get out of her. She wants all of us there. In fact, she insisted. Look, do I think having the service in this venue will be upsetting? Yes. But it\u2019s the only support summer\u2019s asked for. She wants all three of us there. So, we need to be there for her.\tNick: Why don\u2019t you, uh, grab a table and I\u2019ll order?\tSally: Okay, yeah. Sounds good. Summer, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m really sorry about your mom.

Oh, my god.\tLucy: Hi, dad.\tDaniel: How is it that you\u2019re here right now?\tDanny: We couldn\u2019t let you go through this alone.\tLucy: Grandpa talked to mom and took care of everything.\tDaniel: Come here.\t[ Indistinct whispering ] Hey, man.

She wanted to get every detail just right.\tDiane: I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be a lovely tribute. Although, the location she chose makes me a little uncomfortable.\tJack: Yeah, the new jazz lounge at the athletic club. I was surprised, too.\tDiane: Yeah. I mean, don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s an elegant space. It\u2019s certainly large enough.\tJack: It\u2019s also where we saw phyllis collapse after she created that dreadful scene and where\u2013 where we all got the news that she passed away.\tDiane: Why would summer pick that spot to say goodbye to her mother? Why not choose a place with happier memories?\tKyle: I couldn\u2019t agree more.

Are you coping or are you just shutting it all out?\tDaniel: Little bit of both. Today is important, you know? Even if I\u2019m faking it, I gotta pull it together for summer and for my mom.

Eric, she said she wasn\u2019t done with them and didn\u2019t need court to get her revenge. Obviously, ransacking, Paul\u2019s office was just the first step in whatever diluted plan your little bed buddies got all cooked on. No, no, no. The cops questioned her and let her go.\tWhy? Because they didn\u2019t have one trip. Once they, she did anything wrong? The hell\u2019s going on here. Eric and I were just having a, A disagreement. Yeah. We\u2019ll knock it off.

I knew everyone would be in danger. That\u2013 that whole bear mauling bs. I didn\u2019t buy your missing toe story for a second. Ugh.

To keep everyone safe.\tChen: We\u2019ve been maintaining close tabs on sheila to make sure she doesn\u2019t hurt anyone. Especially when she leaves your house.\tBill: Practically had her. I mean, she was just about to confess all her sins. Killing that\u2013 that lance day with the bees. I mean, who\u2013 who does that? Pushing that dr. Garvin to his death, shooting steffy and finn and who knows what else? She said she has done things that are absolutely unimaginable. Why couldn\u2019t she just spit it all out already?\tRidge: This is really taking a toll on you.\tBill: You have no idea, forrester. I\u2013 I have had to go so deep into this thing that there are times when I\u2013 I actually believe what I\u2019m saying. I mean my sons, brooke, katie, they actually think that I\u2019ve lost my mind! That I\u2019ve gone to the dark side and fallen for sheila carter.

I just hope they will understand and forgive me.\tRidge: Of course they\u2019re gonna forgive you. They\u2019re gonna throw you a party. You know why? Because they\u2019re gonna realize that the police weren\u2019t gonna hold sheila. They couldn\u2019T. Attempted murder? She\u2019s not gonna be in there forever. That\u2019s why we need that confession. So she goes away for good and brooke, taylor, our kids, our grandkids, everyone\u2019s gonna be safe.\tBill: I\u2019m trying, ridge.\tRidge: Well, you\u2019re not trying hard enough.

I\u2019m good.\tHope: You sure?\tDeacon: Yes, absolutely.\tHope: Okay because I could help out. I could roll up my sleeves, wash some dishes. I make a mean margarita. I could even mop the floor.\tDeacon: Are you implying that my floors are dirty?\tHope: I would never. I know I could eat a pizza of that floor. I am just saying I don\u2019t like seeing you stressed out. I mean, this is supposed to be fun. Are you having fun?\tDeacon: I am, I am. I\u2013 I do, yes.

Is everything all right?\tBill: I love watching sheila pace around like a caged animal.\tRidge: It is satisfying. Maybe not for you, seeing your girlfriend flirt with someone else, but for us.\tBill: Well, I think I\u2019m gonna be able to get over that. Are you kidding me? That pizza boy convict is doing me a favor. Less time I have to spend around that vile woman, the better. Plus, it\u2019s given me an opportunity to plant some seeds in her brain. Make her squirm.\tRidge: Well, maybe you can find a way to make her squirm enough to give up some information. What do you think?\tBill: She was very close.\tRidge: Really close.\tBill: She was about to confess her deepest, darkest secrets until the lights flickered and she clammed up!\tChen: Technical glitch with one of the bugging devices.

Sally, we have never been able to lie to each other with much success, but if you would just look at me, you will know that I mean every word. You will see how much I am grieving our little baby girl and how I will never get over something like that, but at least I\u2019m not grieving you. Even if I had opted to save the baby, there was no guarantee that she was going to live. I couldn\u2019t risk losing both of you. And I\u2019ll never regret saving you because you deserve to live.\tSally: Yes, but ava deserved to live too.\tAdam: But you will be a mother again someday. You\u2019ll be the mother that you always wanted to be. And even though I won\u2019t be the father, your next baby will be the luckiest little being in the world. Because she\u2019ll have you as her mother. If I could only save one life for sure, it had to be yours.\tSally: Just go.

Is there a problem with that? I mean, she is his coo.\tNikki: It\u2019s very presumptuous, victoria.\tVictoria: Okay, fine, big deal. What if nate comes in here and helps me to run newman while nick\u2019s taking some time off? Look, he\u2019s already proven himself. He\u2019s smart. He\u2019s forward thinking. He\u2019s loyal. Dad, you said yourself how impressed you are with him.\tVictor: Sweetheart. You also happened to be romantically involved with him, don\u2019t you? Was he part of the decision making process before this started?\tNikki: Or was it his idea from the very beginning?\tVictoria: I refuse to be interrogated by my parents about this.

Uh, I\u2019m proud of quite a few new accomplishments I\u2019ve managed to pull off at newman media.

And brilliant.\tNate: Very. And now, she\u2019s finally being given the opportunity to shine. I know exactly how that feels.\tTucker: Oh, you mean after what happened to you at chancellor-winters?\tNate: I wasn\u2019t treated right there. My ideas and opinions weren\u2019t valued, and that was a\u2013 that was a frustrating experience.

Now, if you excuse me, I\u2019ve got work to do.\tTucker: Some work to do.\t[ Laughing ]\tNick: Gotta hand it to you, nate.\tNate: Why is that?\tNick: Pretty smooth, man.

I\u2019m not worried about that. What I\u2019m worried about is him carrying around this heavy burden on top of his workload. And look, newman is in a strong enough position. We can afford for nick to take a little time to himself. He\u2019ll thank me for it later,\tNikki: But who are you to make that decision for him?\tVictoria: It\u2019s my decision to make. I am looking out for everyone concerned, including this company.\tNikki: Did you ever stop to think that nicholas needs a distraction like work with everything else that\u2019s going on with him right now?\tVictoria: Why is everyone making such a big deal out of this?\tNikki: While I suspect that there\u2019s more at play here than you\u2019re saying. And I believe it has something to do with your relationship with nate hastings.\tNate: You\u2019re way off the mark here, nick. There is no clandestine plan going on with victoria and me.\tNick: Why should i believe you?\tNate: Look, I know you\u2019re going through a lot of personal issues right now, and I get it.

Hope for the future is just\u2026 we\u2019re in transition and that is why the numbers are low, we are trying to find our footing again now that thomas is no longer lead designer and I think it just requires some patience and us finding our new identity and once we do, I believe that these numbers will rebound.

So we\u2019ll follow up on evidence because that\u2019s what we do, but we can\u2019t get ourselves. We both know how this ends.\tOkay? I\u2019m outta here. You\u2019re gonna expect a delivery soon. All you have to do is sign for it. I\u2019m impressed with your preparation. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that twice you have promised to have Commander Michaels ready to do what must be done, and twice you have failed to produce him. I would hate to find that I\u2019ve risk coming back here for nothing.\tYour joy ride on Princess Gina Summer and wasn\u2019t wasted. Doctor. This is being handled by Megan Damara herself. Did I say more?\tYou forget about Kate. I\u2019m doing this alone. I wanna be the one to make sure you get what you deserve. I\u2019m, I\u2019m feeling properly threatened, I assure you, but I can\u2019t help wondering. Why are you doing this now? What nudged you into it? And when I asked myself that question, I remember just how ruthless your friend Kate Roberts Brady has always been.\tSo let me guess. Kate wants me dead, but you held out for delivering me to my own private Siberia. Am I close? This conversation\u2019s a waste of time and your boat is waiting. Well, you see, you should have listened to Kate. Your problem that you\u2019re too much of a Boy Scout. You are only effective when I was giving you your marching orders,\t", "I\u2019m gonna have to keep myself strong for him until he gets home. We both will. Okay. So now tell me more about this call that Eli and RAF got got.\tHi, is this Hi Dave? Yeah. Uh, 9 1 1. Caller said he saw guy who was wobbly put this pile on and then toppled into the water. There was blood stain on it and uh, we found Abe\u2019s Hospital ID bracelet. Did you interview the witness? Yeah, I showed him a picture, said it was the eye he saw. Oh my God. So there\u2019s still a chance that it might not be.\tNo, I hope so. Yeah. I\u2019m not gonna tell Pauline about any of this. It\u2019s all based on circumstantial evidence in one guy\u2019s statement, if there\u2019s a body in there, the divers will find it. One, the texts gave me a blood sample from the pylon. They want to do a DNA match with apes. They volunteered to be a bone marrow donor, so they probably still have his sample at the hospital.\tI\u2019m gonna take it over there right now. Okay. I\u2019ll let \u2019em know you\u2019re coming and it\u2019s priority one.\tIt\u2019s Paulino.\tI gotta, let\u2019s go to voicemail. I can\u2019t let her know what\u2019s going on. Not yet. I can\u2019t. You did the right thing. She\u2019ll only hear what you know now in panic. Yeah. When did the call come in? I hope it wasn\u2019t when you and I were together. Well, I know what you\u2019re thinking. Just stop. I get in here a little bit sooner, I wouldn\u2019t to change anything.\tWe\u2019re here now and we\u2019ve got a job to do much as we\u2019re dreading what we might find.\tI\u2019m sorry to be bothering you again, Rafe, but as soon as Theo told me you have a had a lead. I, I had to call. Uh, so, uh, please call me back if something happens. Even if it doesn\u2019t seem so important, and just so you know, I am filled with hope that you are on the verge of him finding my Abraham and bringing him home to me where he belongs.\tThat I do. That was great.\tA won\u2019t be long. It\u2019s just peeking out a shirt to wear. What the hell\u2019s the matter with you? Didn\u2019t you hear me tell you to back me up? Oh, I heard you loud and clear. Then why did you shoot off your big mouth? I\u2019m trying to make people think that he\u2019s dead. Don\u2019t you forget that\u2019s why I hired you. I did everything like you said, and so far it\u2019s going exactly the way you wanted to.\t", "Kate isn\u2019t here Commander. It\u2019s just you and me and Mr. Baretta in your right hand.\tSo I\u2019m wondering what you would do if I were to suddenly turn and run for my life? Do you really have it in here to shoot me in the back?\tI\u2019m not gonna shoot you cause you\u2019re not going anywhere except where I take you.\tHow you gonna spend all that time? All alone in the middle of nowhere.\tGosh, maybe you can take my mind off April while, why don\u2019t you tell me about you and Raf. Well, I mean, there\u2019s not much to tell. It\u2019s still very new, obviously. Yeah, but you\u2019re, you\u2019re happy it happened, right? Do you have regrets, right? Oh, nope. None. We definitely wanna be together, but we have to keep it between us, you know, behind closed doors.\tWell, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to manage that. Now comes the time when you should. Thank me for giving you such good advice. Thank you Kate. Your advice really was helpful and, and you know, I\u2019m grateful to Eli too because he had a talk with Rave, apparently he picked up on the energy between us and he gave him some similar advice.\tOh, I gotta go, Ralph needs me down at the docks. Do you think that\u2019s about it? He didn\u2019t give me any details. Listen, Kate, you can\u2019t tell anyone about rape and I, okay? My life is not an open book either, and believe me, I know how crucial it is to have someone you can trust, especially with your secret self.\tIt\u2019s time to go. Don\u2019t I get a teary goodbye with my old friend, Kate. Oh,\twhat? What is it? Just something they shoot at charging rhinos.\tOh darling, I know how impatient you are to feel better and those test results are great. Step in the right direction, but look at you. You can barely walk. Darling. You know you brought me home in the wheelchair, so why don\u2019t we, why don\u2019t we take that with us, then the exertion will be all yours. May I remind you that a man tried to kill you and unfortunately he is still out there on the loose.\tI would feel so guilty if I put you in danger for even one moment. Spra day we\u2019ll be in a public park. I, I am not going to live in fear. I\u2019m not gonna be a prisoner in my own home. Oh, let me get the door darling.\tOh, Theo, I am so very happy to see you. Perhaps you can convince your father that it\u2019s not time for him to go out yet. Actually, I think that\u2019s a great idea. Come on, puffs. Let\u2019s get you dressed.\tOh, I\u2019m sorry if it sounded like I was preaching at you. You, you didn\u2019t preach. You opened my eyes. I\u2019ve been thinking about myself worrying if I could handle the stress and it\u2019s Abe who suffering the most away from his loved ones.

So Ray came over to give me some really good news about my sister, which was a huge relief, obviously.\tAnd you know, one thing led to another. And that\u2019s all I\u2019m gonna say. Well, I am very happy for both of you. I really am. Thank you. He\u2019s a great guy and you are a great catch and I, I really hope it works out for you. Thank you. So where is he now? Oh, he had to go. He, yeah. Well, one of us needs to be out looking for him.\tTrying to figure out what happened to him.\tI\u2019m not sure about this guy. He was a little nervous to me. Yeah. Well, why wouldn\u2019t he be? I mean, seeing somebody fall into the river and then just disappear. Yeah. Well, I still want to dive team in forensics all over this. Look man, you make the call. I\u2019m going in. What? No, you\u2019re not going in Not without scuba equipment and dive team.\tYou\u2019re not. This is Abe. I need to see for myself. E Eli, Eli.\tI was just thinking how happy I am that your test results were so good. You know, you\u2019re not only on the road to recovery, you are in the express lane. Oh look, the commercial\u2019s almost over. You know, I, I don\u2019t wanna watch that show. You don\u2019t. No. You know, it\u2019s such a, a beautiful day outside. When do we get outta here?\tLet\u2019s go to the park.\tYou. You wanna go out? Yeah. Why not? It\u2019s a nice warm day. Oh, it\u2019s not just warm, it\u2019s actually hot. You just got outta the hospital. You\u2019re nowhere near ready for that kind of exertion. Oh, come on now. You can drive us to the park and we\u2019ll sit on the bench. Listen to the birds.

And her employee per thing, who\u2019s now shacked up at the same CD motel I used to call her.\tWait, which employee? There\u2019s only one, isn\u2019t it? What was her name? The bakery girl. Uh, Talia. That\u2019s right, Talia.\t", "Hey, can I finish my pancakes first? Huh?\tOkay, now that was an amazing breakfast. No, don\u2019t get up. Don\u2019t get the fire at the plates. Uh, no. Uh, you cooked and you\u2019ve been a great host in every way. Why we\u2019re friends? So, you know, I don\u2019t think of myself as a host. Right. Well, you\u2019ve been a great friend and you, I\u2019m actually really, really glad you decided to visit Seattle and me.\tI really enjoyed you being here.\tI should probably get that. Mm-hmm. Yeah. It might be Lee\tJohnny.\tHey. Hey, Johnny. Uh, hey, I, I just talked to your brother and you said you\u2019re still in Seattle. I am. Are you avoiding me? I mean, Wendy, I thought you said that you believe me when I said the only reason I proposed to Chanel was because of those damn biscuits. Yes, I believed you. I, I told you I did. But Trip just brought Joey home from the hospital and, um, I felt bad leaving, so I stuck around a hell pound.\tOkay. All right. Well, good to know. Um, So when are you coming back?\tDid you just ask me what\u2019s for breakfast? Yeah, I mean, honestly, Chloe, I mean, I\u2019m a little bit disappointed. For some reason I got it into my head that you were like an early riser and you would\u2019ve had breakfast on the table hours ago. Wow. Well, you assumed wrong. No, Chloe. I thought this was all part of our agreement.\tWell, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve forgotten already. No, I have not forgotten. When we decided to move in, I said I would pick up some of the slack of the household chores. I didn\u2019t sign up to be your full-time housekeeper and cook. I never said anything about full-time. No, you just want me to have breakfast ready on the table for when you roll out of bed.\tChloe, I knew this was a bad idea. Brady said it was a terrible idea. I should have listened to him. Where are you going to pack?\tWait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Please. What do you wanna put in your lunch order before I leave? Or was I late picking up your dry cleaning? I\u2019m sorry. For some reason I assumed this was some kind of, I dunno, all inclusive deal. I shouldn\u2019t have expected you to make me breakfast or anything else. You\u2019re right.\tThat wasn\u2019t part of our agreement. No, it wasn\u2019t. And if I agree to stay here, we need to figure out what this arrangement is, right, which we can hash out over breakfast, which I will happily prepare for us both right now. Oh, so you cook now? I do indeed. And one day I will delight your palate with all the Scottish favorites, Haggas, blood pudding, neeps, and Tatties.\tBut for today, I\u2019ll just scramble some eggs.\tOr at least I would if we had any eggs to scramble. Don\u2019t suppose you, uh, went to the grocery store, did you?\tWhat? Am I coming back? Yeah. I mean, I know Damara has a pretty liberal vacation policy, but my dad and Uncle Stephan need you. In between you and me, the place is kind of falling apart with you gone. I doubt that and uh, I, I, yeah, I haven\u2019t made any travel plans yet, but I\u2019ll be back soon. Well, I\u2019m glad.\t", "I cannot believe I slept so late. That was a great decision on those mattresses. Oh, well I can\u2019t sleep on a limpy mattress, so could hardly expect my roommate too either. Well, I really appreciate that. It was very comfortable. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re well rested. I have to say I\u2019m getting a little peckish. Okay.\tYeah, I\u2019ve been up for a couple of hours and all I\u2019ve had is some coffee and a bit of a donut. Right. Time for a hearty breakfast, so, What\u2019s on the menu?\tI made breakfast. Put this ungodly hour be really hard. Morning person, huh? Oh, well med school will do that to you. Yeah. It\u2019s my, uh, my mom\u2019s peppers and eggs.\tHmm. Oh my God. Mm-hmm. But that\u2019s delicious. Yeah. Not too spicy. No, they\u2019re perfect. Just what I needed to. Wake me up. And at home I usually just grab a protein bar or smoothie, but um, I gotta say the Coke could get used to this\tmorning. Morning, sweetheart. Once the pancakes, it\u2019s Abe\u2019s secret recipe. Sounds good. But coffee first. Mm-hmm. So, How was your date day? What date? Says, uh, you didn\u2019t tell him? Was it my news to tell? Like that\u2019s ever stopped you before? Oh gosh. Shit. We can all turn over one new leaf like you\u2019ve just done, baby.\tGetting back out there in the dating pool. Wait, a wait, wait, wait. Anybody wanna tell me what\u2019s going on here? Fill me in. Who\u2019s this state with Chanel? Who\u2019s the lucky guy? Uh,\tKind of early for you to be checking in, isn\u2019t it? What if I was with Jada? Well, I knew you wouldn\u2019t answer if you were. Is that, come on then. How was it Dave?\tIt was fine. Just fine. Come on. I need more ds. The meal was great. Service was good. Conversation flowed. No one cares about all that. What I wanna know is, did you melt the girl\u2019s heart? Is she in love with you yet?\tLike sand through the hourglass. So are the days of our lives.\tIt\u2019s cool too soon for her to be falling in love with me. Don\u2019t you think? I mean, it\u2019s only been one date. Yeah. But uh, what\u2019s that joke about lesbians? They bring the U-Haul to the second date, something like that. Chanel\u2019s not a lesbian. She\u2019s bisexual. Okay, whatever. Well, the matter is that she falls head over here, is in love with you so that you can break her little bisexual.\tHa again. And in the meantime I\u2019m gonna focus on the plan for her mother. For her mother. What are you planning to do to Paulina?\tYou\u2019re dateless with Talia, isn\u2019t she the woman that works for you? Yes. And don\u2019t gimme that look, unlike you, mayor Carver. I don\u2019t have a policy against coworkers fraternizing, as long as it\u2019s consensual. Of course. But is the city council\u2019s policy and I simply enforce it. Mm-hmm. But businesses, private businesses have more leeway OB, obviously.\tYeah. Well, I don\u2019t even know if that matters since my business is still shut down. Well, has the health department given you any idea about when you can reopen? No. They, they said that until the police find out who\u2019s behind those tainted biscuits. They won\u2019t even consider it. Oh, the hell with that. Come on, Abe, let\u2019s go and light a fire under that commission of yours.\t", "Because I really miss you, so let me know when you know for sure. Okay? Of course. Talk to you soon.\tAnswer me What is happening to Paulina? I told you, I\u2019m still working out the details, but it\u2019s all part of my plan. What\u2019s the, sorry, my sister\u2019s\tmorning. Morning. Who were you just talking to?\tSo maybe when we draw up this agreement, we can add grocery shopping to the list. We can just order an online delivery. Actually, you could do that if you don\u2019t mind. I just thought, you know, you do have a little bit more time on your hands right now because you are. Between jobs. I\u2019m gonna go get my suitcases.\tAlright, fine. We\u2019ll, we\u2019ll both do it. We\u2019ll alternate. I\u2019ll do one week, you do the next and it\u2019ll be great. Look, we need to draw out the rest of this agreement, but. I can\u2019t do it over an empty stomach. So how about take you out for breakfast please? Will you let me do that? Okay, I\u2019ll go get dressed in the meantime.\tCan you dust those blinds? The blinds? Yeah. The last tenants left and pretty dirty. Right. But we don\u2019t have any dust cloths cuz you didn\u2019t go to the, because we didn\u2019t go to the store. But I\u2019ll figure out. I\u2019ll just use a t-shirt or something. You do that?\tCome in.\tWe need some talk Commissioner. I hope this isn\u2019t a bad time, uh, for my boss. Never. So what can I do for the two of you? Yes. If you don\u2019t know, you can get on the stick. Excuse me. My poor daughter can\u2019t reopen her bakery until you arrest Sloan Peterson. So why the hell is it taking so long you shoulda arrested her the minute that someone took a bite of those bad biscuits?\tSweetheart, RA can\u2019t arrest Sloan just because she has an animosity toward you and Chanel. He has to follow the evidence. Well, unless I\u2019m missing something, the evidence all points to that.\tWhy aren\u2019t you saying anything? Are you going to tell us that the evidence now points to someone else? Not exactly. What do you mean not exactly?\tI was just talking to Chanel. Chanel, yeah. Remember I told you I recommended some breathing and meditation exercises for Paulina when she has panic attacks? Yeah, well, I was just checking in with Chanel to make sure her mom was okay. Because I was concerned. Right. Any other questions, Jada, or should I get a lawyer?\tSince you\u2019re just so interested in my private phone conversations, I just asked you who you were talking to. A very simple question, and yet you get all defensive. Why\tenjoy your coffee?\tJohnny, Hey, um, I\u2019m sorry. Just stop by like this. I, I, I checked the bakery first, but that\u2019s still not open yet. Well, I think yet, might be a bit optimistic. Really Sorry you\u2019re going through this. Thanks. So, What\u2019s so important that you had to see me face to face? Um, it\u2019s about Wendy and I\u2019m really hoping I can get some of your advice because I feel like I\u2019m losing her.\t"], "answer": [3, 2, 4, 0, 1]}

His body was found in pheasant lake. It\u2019s outside my jurisdiction.\tSummer: You\u2019ll know more about stark than anyone in that area. You know what a disgusting thug he was.\tChance: The guys over there, they\u2019re good and his record speaks for itself.\tSummer: So, you\u2019re not here looking for clues or anything?\tChance: You know, that\u2019s not really what detectives do. I don\u2019t just pop up random places, whip out a magnifying glass like sherlock holmes.\tSummer: From what I\u2019ve seen, your method is usually to watch. The brooding look in your eye. It\u2019s why I asked you to go to my mom\u2019s memorial service because you watch. You analyze.\tChance: Yeah. Most of the time. Today, I just came up here to think through. Same as you, I imagine? Yeah. Yeah, I bet we have a lot of the same things weighing on our minds.\tJack: This is not denial. This is devotion. This is commitment. This is confidence. I would never spring an impromptu wedding on you.\t[ Diane chuckling ] I mean, say the word. I\u2019ll make it happen. I will marry you anytime, anywhere, anyhow.\tDiane: You know, I\u2013 I believe you.\tJack: Good. You should.\tDiane: You\u2019re impossible.\tJack: I am going to get you through this, diane.\tDiane: How can you be so certain? How does that even make sense? I am stuck in here for god knows how long. And jack, you have a life to live.\tJack: You are my life. And here\u2019s how we do it. You let me visit every day as long as they\u2019ll let me. I am not going to let you go through this alone. If you need to shut down in order to survive, well, you\u2019ll shut down right alongside of me.\tDiane: Oh, damn you!\t[ Diane groaning ]\tJack: Damn me? You won\u2019t be pushing me away?\tDiane: Jack, I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019T. Because as good as this moment feels right now, nothing has changed. And I am\u2013 I am not going to drag you down alongside me or the rest of the family. You need to go.\tJack: Don\u2019t do this, diane.\tDiane: Guard, I\u2019m ready to leave now.\tJack: There\u2019s something else you need to hear.\tDiane: Michael can tell me what it is.\tJack: Jeremy stark is dead. No two bodies are the same.\tDaniel: I just hate seeing summer like that. And I tried talking her through her feelings, helping her to see reality. She just covered, told me that she got it, but I mean, I could tell she was still hanging onto that fantasy she\u2019d created in her head.\t", "Lily: Look, what matters is that you were there for her and maybe she needs more time.\tDaniel: She\u2019s just so angry. You know, I mean, I\u2019m mad about what happened to mom too, but summer, she\u2019s got some serious rage and it\u2019s not helping her cope with the loss.\tLily: Well, I mean, there\u2019s no right way to grieve or to help someone through it.\tDaniel: Yeah. More than anything, I just want for my sister to be okay. But I don\u2019t really know how that\u2019s possible when I\u2019m barely keeping my own head above water.\tLily: Well, look, I mean, you\u2019re both in a lot of pain. You know, you need each other right now. You\u2019re going through the same thing.\tDaniel: We both want mom back so bad. We\u2019re both seeing her in our dreams. And now summer is seeing her while she\u2019s awake.\tLily: Look, the mind is a powerful thing. It makes sense that you would wanna try to undo her death somehow.\tDaniel: Unfortunately, that\u2019s not happening.\tLily: No, but it doesn\u2019t stop the heart from wishing that it was.\tDaniel: Can\u2019t argue with that.\tLily: Look, I know from experience that losing someone is soul crushing. And it\u2019s not gonna go away for a long time. So, you know, you and summer, as you\u2019re working through this grief, you guys are gonna do and say more things that you regret.\tDaniel: Well, I don\u2019t regret anything that I\u2019ve done so far. Most of all, reconnecting with you. I mean, I don\u2019t know what I did to deserve you coming back into my life, but I\u2013 I hope you\u2019re not having any regrets either.\tDiane: Jeremy\u2019s dead? How? When did this happen?\tJack: It happened a few days ago. I tried to tell you the last time.\tDiane: How did he die?\tJack: It appears to be murder.\t[ Diane exhaling ]\tDiane: Do they know who killed him?\tJack: I think the police are looking into his criminal activities and I\u2019m guessing that one or several of his colleagues had a grudge serious enough they wanted him dead.\tDiane: Oh, I\u2019m sure of it. I\u2019ve met some of those people. They\u2019re no one you would wanna mess with. But, you know, jeremy\u2019s ego always made him feel like he was untouchable.\tJack: Well, he\u2019s not going to be mourned. Certainly not in genoa city. How do you feel about that?\t[ Diane exhaling ]\tDiane: Well, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m relieved that he\u2019s no longer a threat to our family, but at the same time, this\u2013 this doesn\u2019t exactly work in my favor.\tJack: Because like me, you think stark killed phyllis?\tDiane: I know he did. Which makes his death a really bad thing for me. Now that jeremy\u2019s gone, there\u2019s no way to get a confession from him. The only person who could clear my name is now dead.\tSummer: Do you have any ideas about who killed stark?\t", "[ Mariah sighing ]\tSharon: Just what I needed.

So funny.\tSharon: I\u2019m just kidding. You are wonderful also.\tMariah: Ah, no. Well, aria is a lot more popular than I am these days. As she should be.\tSharon: Look at her sweet little face. She\u2019s just an angel. Can I pick her up?\tMariah: I love you, but no. This angel wailed the whole car ride until she fell asleep. So, just give her a few minutes?\tSharon: No problem. I can wait. I think.\t[ Chuckles ] Meantime, why don\u2019t you fill me in? What\u2019s been going on?\tMariah: I really, really wanna dish, but first I need coffee. Anything before caffeine is just gonna sound like gibberish.\tSharon: Okay. Wow. I hope you\u2019re not pushing yourself too hard. Going back to work. You\u2019re taking care of aria. That\u2019s a lot to take on at once.\tMariah: Tessa has my back. And I\u2019m only in the office like two days a week. I mean, I spend the entire time wishing I was with aria. But then she woke up three times last night, so.\tSharon: Sounds like a recipe for insomnia.\tMariah: Oh, sleep? Who needs sleep?\tSharon: Wait, am I sensing there might be something else going on?\t[ Knocking ]\tDaniel: Hey, am I interrupting?\tLily: No, not at all. What is this?\tDaniel: Well, I thought you could use a little afternoon pick me up.\tLily: Thank you. It\u2019s very sweet.\tDaniel: Not totally selfless. I was actually hoping to talk to you about something. Do you have a minute?\tLily: Yeah, of course. What\u2019s up?\t[ Daniel sighing ]\tDaniel: God, I don\u2019t mean to keep leaning on you, but you\u2019re kind of my go-to person when it comes to this.\tLily: Is it your mom? Did you have another nightmare or?\tDaniel: Yeah, something like that. Only this one is happening in real life.\t[ Summer sighing ]\tPhyllis: Listen to me. You\u2019re the only one who can know that I\u2019m alive. I mean it.

I told you not to come here. Why don\u2019t you listen to me?\tJack: Because I love you. Because the last time I was here, I left you with a question that you never answered.\tDiane: It was a crazy question.\tJack: That is still not an answer. I\u2019ll ask again. Will you marry me?\tDiane: Before I go on trial for murder? Is there nothing I can do to drive you away?\t", "Chance: Summer, we don\u2019t have to talk about that. I know it\u2019s just gonna bring up memories of your mom and all these unanswered questions. I don\u2019t wanna do that to you.\tSummer: The memories I can handle. It\u2019S\u2026 it\u2019s the guilt that I can\u2019t stand. I still feel like I owe my mom answers and apparently, there aren\u2019t any.\tChance: Hey.

Is there any other physical evidence?\tChance: Summer, is there anything else going on?\tSummer: Other than my mom was murdered? Followed by her new husband being murdered?

Hey, look at me. If you know something or if you\u2019ve learned something new, you can tell me.\tSummer: You\u2019re the police. How could I know something that you don\u2019t?

Listen, let me be very clear. I don\u2019t regret it. Clearly, it was something that we both wanted and needed.

You know, fantasizing what it would be like to be mother of the bride.\tWillow\u2019s gonna come around. Trust me on that.\tYeah, hold that thought, okay?\tMm-hmm.\t[Knock on door]\t[Sighing] Okay.\tDaddy!\tHi! Come on in. Come on in. Let me see this dress. Give it a twirl. Wow, that\u2019s a beauty. Thanks for bringing her by.\tOh, yeah, of course. Avery\u2019s so excited about the wedding.\tOhh.\tWow! Dress beautiful! You are beautiful. Are you ready to be a little flower girl with donna?\tCan I have a snack first?\tYeah, let\u2019s see what we can find in the kitchen.\t[Both laugh] Come on.\tOh, my gosh. Is she not a knockout or what?\tAh, she sure as heck is.\tSo what do you have there?\tIf victor has said that only people closest to him will be safe, then we can assume that there will be devastating consequences for the rest of us-\tfor the rest of the world, quite frankly.\tThe guards seem to think that \u201cthose closest\u201d meant people who are in proximity to victor.\t[Laughs] What are the odds that victor doesn\u2019t give a damn what happens to his henchmen?\tNo, that man will only keep people alive that are useful to him. But he does have spencer and ace. What if the people \u201cclosest to him\u201d are the ones that he cares about? I mean, if he\u2019s even capable of that.\tOh, come on, man! What\u2019s taking you so long?\t[Sinister music] Ah, finally. Welcome to our distinguished guests.\tWhat is this dump?\tThis is the future, my boy. Oh, imagine, liesl, just in a few moments, you will be performing scientific wonders right here in this room.\tYou cannot expect me to work in these conditions.\tOh, don\u2019t be deceived by appearances. You have everything you need.\tIt\u2019s off.\t", "[Wind whistling]\tThis place has been running on low-level auxiliary power. We just got the main power back on.\tHa!

Wh\u2013the cassadine technology from the \u201980s was deadly. Are our friends walking into a trap or\u2013or what?\tI don\u2019t know. I\u2013I can\u2019t say for certain. But from what ethan heard, victor\u2019s plans have been decades in the making. So god help our friends if they\u2019re swept up in that. God help all of us.\tYou guys look so happy, so in love.\tWell, that\u2019s, uh-\tthat\u2019s because we are.\tAnd it\u2019s our wedding day.\t[Laughs]\tWell, let me know what they say, okay? Thank you, martin.\tNina.\tWhy were you talking to your lawyer?\t[Dramatic music]\t[Heavy clunk]\t[Tense music]\t[Sighs] Mikkos, old boy, you did not disappoint. Finally, after all these years, the end is in sight. It\u2019s in there. Fetch the prisoners. It\u2019s time they earned their keep.\tWas ethan able to tell you anything else?\tApparently, victor told his personnel that the only people guaranteed to be safe when he finally executes his plan are the people closest to him.\tWhat the hell does that mean?\tNothing good for the likes of us.\tScott, he\u2019s been so preoccupied, you know, worrying about aunt liesl. We\u2019re all worried about aunt liesl. I called martin grey to look into a matter for me.\tAre you in trouble?\tNo, nothing like that. It\u2019s\u2013it\u2019s just something that I have to do. And I also want to open up a-\ta trust for amelia and wiley. You know, I\u2019m sure michael and willow have that covered, but I figure it\u2019s the only way I can spoil my grandchildren.\tYou\u2019re gonna have plenty of opportunity with that. Have faith.\tEasier said than done.\tHow can I cheer you up?\t[Soft dramatic music]\tMm.\t[Laughs]\tThis helps.\tHey.\tIf it isn\u2019t the groom. Hi.\tThis, uh, what you\u2019re wearing to the wedding?\tUgh.\t[Chuckles]\tHow do you put up with him?\t[Laughing]\tI manage.\tHi.\tHi.\tOh, mom, you look incredible. I would hug you, but I don\u2019t wanna wrinkle anything.\tOh, get over here, get over here. I love you. Are you kidding me?\tAw. I love you too. Can I help the kids get ready? Do you need anything? Any water or some juice? I don\u2019t know.\tI\u2019m\u2013I\u2019m good. Thank you.

And I\u2019m sure that your heart is in the right place, but you can\u2019t start showering willow with gifts. It\u2019s not gonna work. And she may even think that you-\tyou\u2019re trying to bribe your way into her life.\tWell, it\u2019s my-\tmy daughter\u2019s wedding day. I can\u2019t just do nothing.\tYou can if you wanna have a relationship with willow in the future.\tFuture? You say it like it\u2019s certain that we\u2019ll have one, that\u2026 willow will have one.\tYou have to honor her wishes, no matter how painful it is.\tJust one cookie? It just does not seem like enough. I mean, you\u2013you could have a lot of cookies. You know what I mean?\tBut there\u2019ll be wedding cake.\tYes, yes, there will be plenty of wedding cake. Did you show your dad your-\tyour flower girl walk?\tShe nailed it.\t[Laughter]\tOf course. Okay, well, then you two should get going \u2019cause you don\u2019t wanna be late, right?\tYou gonna be okay?\tYeah.\tAll right.\tI\u2019m glad you\u2019re gonna be there.\tYeah.\t[Gasps] Oh.\tI\u2019ll save you some cake.\t[Chuckles] You better.\tI\u2019ll stick around, okay?

Let\u2019s go.\tYou have the best time!\t[Sonny chuckling] You did the right thing.\tWhy does it feel so wrong?\tLook, drew is gonna find victor. He is, and he\u2019s gonna bring liesl, trina, and spencer home. I believe that.\tRight. But it\u2019s still a very dangerous situation, so\u2026 you can tell me how you\u2019re really feeling.\tI\u2019m worried. I\u2019m really worried. But I have faith in drew.

I had butterflies when I married brando, and it was in a car repair shop with only the owner and his wife in attendance.\tI have butterflies, but in the best way. Marrying michael in front of all the people we love, it just\u2026feels like my whole life has been leading to this moment.\tWell, before we all cry all our makeup off, let\u2019s get you in your dress.\tUm, actually, ladies, uh, josslyn and I are gonna take it from here if that\u2019s okay.\tOkay, then we\u2019ll leave you to it.

They\u2019re here.\t[Laughing]\tHi. Come in.\tHi there. Willow. Are you ready to become one of us?\tAre we certain that liesl obrecht is a captive? Maybe she\u2019s a collaborator. She could have gone willingly with victor.\tWell, I mean, she disappeared from the nurses\u2019 ball right in the middle of a magic act with her grandson and his sister. I don\u2019t think she did that on purpose.\tWhen luke and I crossed paths with her back in 2013, she was hardly a doting grandmother. I mean, she admitted to putting you into a coma, and she knocked me out in order to escape. She and victor are two of a kind. I can\u2019t believe you would ever trust her.\tWell, I\u2019m not gonna nominate obrecht for sainthood, but she\u2019s a different person to what she was ten years ago.\tYeah, since faison died. I mean, right around the time that he did, you know, she started to realize the tragic consequences of her obsession. She\u2019s lost two children now, and her grandson and her niece, nina, are the only family she has. Wait, isn\u2019t she supposed to be donating bone marrow to nina\u2019s daughter?\tMm.\tI\u2013I don\u2019t think she left this town willingly.\tI mean, it\u2019s not like cassadine yanked her off the street. I mean, that-\tthat stunt that they pulled at the nurses\u2019 ball, that took a lot of planning.\tIt sort of implies that she is pivotal for some reason. And given that she is a brilliant researcher, I bet victor wants her for her skills in the lab, not her sparkling conversation.\tSo if victor needs something that only obrecht can give, maybe that means what he has isn\u2019t a bomb.\tA far more sinister weapon.\t[Dramatic music]\tIn this canister is the pathogen mikkos and I developed.\tForgive me if I don\u2019t applaud.\tBut there\u2019s still one step we have to take before we can begin. And that\u2019s where you come in, my dear liesl. I take it you\u2019ve read all the material provided you by my scientists that have been working on this.\tTheir notes were thorough and made interesting reading.\tAh, good. Then you\u2019ll know all about the pathogen. You know its modes of transmission, as well as the antidote. And since this pathogen has been untouched for decades, I need you to check that it\u2019s still viable and can be effective. Then I\u2019ll need you to do the same with the antidote. You\u2019ll find, uh, a microscope and slides here. So shall we begin our work?\tYou fool! What are you doing? The pathogen is airborne. If you open that, we\u2019ll almost certainly die.\t[Scoffs] Really? Do you think I\u2019m that stupid? To handle a pathogen that\u2019s potentially active?\tAre you sure?\tWell, of course I\u2019m sure. Mikkos and I developed this pathogen so that it\u2019d only be activated by uv light. That\u2019s why it\u2019s down here in this bunker, so far away from the sunlight.\tStill, I\u2013I cannot study this pathogen in\u2013in these conditions. I\u2013I need a controlled environment and protective clothing.\t", "I hope you all realize just how privileged you are.\tNot the word I\u2019d use.\tYou are about to witness the dawning of a new age.\tCome on, come on. What\u2019s the holdup?\tIt\u2019s jammed.\tWell-\t[Scoffs] Unjam it.\tWhat do you think is in there?\tThe pathogen that I was telling you about.\tThe one that will kill everyone on this planet? We can\u2019t let him get his hands on it.\tMaybe they won\u2019t be able to get the door open.\tA broken door will not stop victor cassadine.\t[Both grunting]\t[Dramatic music]\tIt\u2019s here. It\u2019s all here. At last, the power to set the world right.\tThis is only a theory, but what if victor has some kind of bomb?\tYeah, that would certainly fit his doomsday scenario.\tWhat could he possibly accomplish with a bomb?\tI don\u2019t know, but it would explain why he\u2019s gathering his loved ones around-\tto protect them.\tTrina robinson was a stowaway.\tYeah, so he wouldn\u2019t have been counting on her presence.\tDoesn\u2019t explain obrecht. I mean, apparently he was obsessed with her at one point. But since her return to port charles, you know, his focus has been on other things.\tSo unlikely she would count as a loved one. Why take her then?\tMaybe he wants something from her.\tHey. Ned wanted you to have this.\tOh, really? Well, where is he? We can\u2019t toast without him.\tHe\u2019s helping olivia in the kitchen, said to not wait on him.\tWell, then let\u2019s not wait on him.\tI\u2019m with you.\tDon\u2019t leave me out.\tWell, I wasn\u2019t gonna leave you out.

And drew will no longer be at the ceremony.\tWhy won\u2019t drew be there?\tWell, he\u2019s tracking down a lead on victor, and if he finds victor, that means he can bring liesl home.\tOh, thank god. I have been really worried, and so have james and georgie. It\u2019s gonna be okay, willow.

We haven\u2019t talked about it. But I will say this, I\u2013 I pulled a fast one on you the other day and I\u2013 I\u2013 I wasn\u2019t trying to\u2013\tRidge: I know you weren\u2019T.

That\u2019s all I ask.\t[ Taylor chuckling ] Because\u2013 oh, damn it, I love you. And I will always love you.

You know, he\u2019s being protective of himself and his heart, since taylor and i did banish him.\tKatie: That break had to happen. You had to end that cycle. You, taylor, you, taylor.\tDonna: Yeah, it wasn\u2019t healthy or fair to either one of you.\tBrooke: I know that, and ridge knows that. He totally understands. It\u2019s just he\u2019s questioning things. I mean, he\u2019s not even calling me his logan. It\u2019s almost like he\u2019s guarding me and him against any future pain or heartache.\tRidge: You know, brooke has been here almost as long as I am.\tTaylor: Yes. I know. I know. She\u2019s an important part of forrester creations. Yeah, she deserves to be going. But you know, the\u2013 the timing isn\u2019t in my favor, really. But you know, this isn\u2019t about me. This is about you and all the success that you and hope are gonna have in rome.\tThomas: Well, the line\u2019s solid. And hope and i are going to kill it. And I think these new designs are going to surprise everybody.\tHope: Liam, you know, thomas is my lead designer.\tLiam: No, I know, but it\u2019s your baby. It\u2019s your name on the billboard.

I mean, it\u2019s obvious that she was trying to set you up with somebody other than ridge.\tBrooke: Yeah, she set me up all right.\tDonna: I\u2019m sorry, brooke. But you know what? At least now you know who taylor really is.\tKatie: Yeah, and now, you can be together with ridge. There\u2019s nothing holding you back.\tBrooke: Yeah. It\u2019s just, uh\u2013 it just feels different. Ridge has put up a wall between us, and uh, he\u2019s deliberately not calling me logan.

Not when the\u2013 the schedule has been set. The invites have gone out, the press release. I mean, this\u2013 it\u2013 plans have been solidified.\tLiam: It wasn\u2019t the 11th hour the first time I asked, and plans can absolutely change. It\u2019s not the end of the world if thomas doesn\u2019t go. What matters is that all these people are there to see you because it\u2019s your line, right? You\u2019re the face of it.

{"content": ["Why did you kiss me, Talia?\tOkay, thanks. Yep. Hey, just spoke with Paulina Price and reviewed her statement with her. You got something maybe, uh, turns out there was an opportunity for Sloan to have gotten a hold of Paulina\u2019s office keys. I knew it, but Sloan wasn\u2019t the only one. Turns out my sister had the same opportunity.\tLike sand through the hourglass. So are the days of our lives.\tYou really think your sister had something to do with this? I\u2019m just going by what was taught to us at the Academy Boss gathering all the facts. Don\u2019t rush to judgment what we think doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s what we know. True. So what do we know? We know that Tallier Rens, Paulina Price at the square and so did Sloan Peterson, who has made it no secret that she is gonna continue to pursue her vendetta against Paulina and Chanel.\tSloan also had motive to trash Paulina\u2019s office, whereas your sister did not. In fact, from what I have witnessed, your sister has no reason whatsoever to want hurt Paulina. In fact, she works for Paulina\u2019s daughter. You said that she and Chanel get along great, didn\u2019t you?\tSorry. I guess I was just caught in a moment. Now I, I wasn\u2019t looking for an apology, Talia. Yeah, I know, but I owe you one. You\u2019ve been upset, you know, with everything going on and. The last thing I want is to take advantage of that. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s just, I, it kind of surprised me. I, I didn\u2019t even know you were into girls.\tI\u2019m not. At least I wasn\u2019t. And so now, I mean, I\u2019ve only dated guys before. And I don\u2019t have to tell you, you know how baking is all about chemistry? Yeah. So it\u2019s physical attraction, right? And there\u2019s no denying that there\u2019s real chemistry between me and you. Look, it\u2019s not like this was a premeditated thing.\tI mean, you were in my arms and it felt right and you know, kissing. You just felt like it was supposed to happen. Yeah, it felt right to me too. But you just broke up with your girlfriend, so maybe it\u2019s too soon to do something with me. Actually, maybe it isn\u2019t.\tI don\u2019t know any. Tanya, I said, Talia, whatever. I don\u2019t know any Talia either. I think you have the wrong room. Um, she definitely saw her here. I know. Cause I, I live right down the hall here. My friend, uh, Chloe and I, we bumped into her recently coming out of that room.\tListen, I appreciate your concern for me, Brady, but if my moving in with Xander\u2019s a mistake, then. It\u2019s my mistake to make, but Chloe, God, it affects me too. See, don\u2019t you, don\u2019t you understand that? I see. I care about you, Chloe and I, I love you.\tI love you too, but I think it\u2019s time for United Admit that in our case, love is not enough.\t", "Auntie Mag. Sorry I\u2019m late. That\u2019s it. Sorry you\u2019re late. Not even a decent excuse. Well, or even a fabricated one. I actually, I was with Gwen and I was letting her stop. Stop. Alex, really, seriously, you have the nerve. To tell me that you couldn\u2019t make it to work on time because you were having a booty call with that woman.\tNo, I\u2019m telling you that I\u2019m late because I was letting that woman know that our booty calls are over.\tOh, wow. I hate seeing my gwenny looking. So glm just stop staring then and go back to your. Phone or whatever, but I wanna be here for you. And you know, it\u2019s so late if Alex, Kiki had been my friend with benefits and he suddenly cut off those benefits, my pennies is being a twist too. You know damn well that that is not what I\u2019m upset about.\tWell, it\u2019s one of the things, right? And the reason I didn\u2019t bring up the other thing is because I\u2019m your best friend, and I know that the other thing is the painful thing, whereas the thing with Alex is more of an insulting, irritating thing. So I thought. It\u2019d be something of a distraction to bring up that thing rather than the really, really hurtful thing, you know?\tNo, I don\u2019t, I haven\u2019t. The funs idea of what you are rambling on about. Well, that\u2019s because you\u2019re obsessing over Xander. Poor Gwenny. Oh. Could you just stop being so patronizing? You know, I hate that damo. Are you sure that Sandra and Chloe are, are really moving in together now? I wish it weren\u2019t so. What I saw with my own two eyes, your cock doodle do.\tAnd that songbird definitely looking to nest. And they actually bought the apartment. Yep. And the crazy thing is right before they decided it was right for them, Brady showed up to look at the same apartment for him and his bratty kid. As soon as he sees Chloe, he gets this miserable look on his face just like that one.\tAnd he was hell bent on talking her out of it.\tChloe, look, I, I know that things have been challenging for us lately, but, but moving none with Xander. I mean, you say your friends, but what kind of friendship can you have with this guy? I mean, he\u2019s, he\u2019s distrustful. He. He\u2019s made enemies left and right, including you at one point in time. I mean, I don\u2019t understand why you wanna make a home with him.\tBecause to be honest, I am lonely and he\u2019s good company. Chloe, if he wants to move in with you and he\u2019s, he\u2019s offered to foot the bill, that\u2019s because he\u2019s expecting something is going to happen. Please don\u2019t do this.

The girl that works with Chanel that sweet bit, believe her names Talia.\tUm, why did you do that? Listen to me. Hi. And listen. Good before that bitch killed my mother. She broke her heart when she went for my father. So now it\u2019s time to see how she likes having her heart broken. She\u2019s already had her heart broken her ex cheated on her, and then moved to a different continent, which is why it\u2019s the perfect time for you to swoop in and sweep her off her feet, and then break a little heart all over again.\t", "Come on. You know what you need to get you through this. What? A giant dartboard with zanders bubbly mug on it. That, but I was thinking a nice bottle of tequila. Two pints of ice cream. No. Make it three.

And if there was some random girl coming and going, believe me, I would notice. I\u2019m sure this is the room. I saw that tell you, girl, come out. What are you the house, dick? Excuse me mate. No offense mate. It\u2019s just slang. For hotel detective, they used to say it all the time in those old black and white noir films, you know, the ones where people have questioned more moral character, give each other trouble of some sort.\tJada, where is this coming from? Has Taja done something like this before? Something to make you suspect her of these pretty egregious offenses? No. No. God no. No, no, and and it\u2019s hard for me to even come up with a reason why Talia would wanna hurt Chanel or her family. But I also know that I need to put my personal biases aside and look at all of the possibilities as hard as it may be, and both my sister and Sloan Peterson had the opportunity to steal Paulina\u2019s keys from her purse when she left it unattended.\tOkay. I can\u2019t argue with your logic, but Yep. I think I may have found a hole in your theory.\tI was talking to Commissioner Hernandez in his office and he had this picture of Allie and her son Henry on his desk, and she had just sent it to him. Allie\u2019s your ex. Right. And she and the commissioner are there real close and he told me that she started seeing someone in New Zealand. Well, he didn\u2019t actually tell me that.\tI just, um, I asked and he didn\u2019t say anything, which was obviously his way of telling me that yes, she is seeing someone. Sorry. Yeah. Well, I\u2019m not all that surprised anyway. Now you know why the health department shutting us down is only part of the reason why today has been such a rough day for me. So you and your ex, you guys were pretty serious.\tWe were. And then we hit this rough patch and then I, I thought that we were gonna be able to figure things out and work it out. But then I caught her with this guy, Alex, and, well, that was pretty much the end of us. So you and Gwen Oh, sit, sit. Are done seeing each other.\tAuntie I, um, I started some therapy with Dr. Evans and she helped me realize that all this sleeping around that I\u2019m doing, it\u2019s actually my way of avoiding any commitment and not just to a particular woman, but in everything else in my life. Hmm. Well, I\u2019m, I\u2019m glad to, um, hear that you see that, Alex.

It\u2019s not the expensive stuff.\tWhat if we settled on a cheap bottle of wine and two fruit cups? Wow, my mouth is watering.\tAll joking aside, I know that losing Xander was a huge loss for you. You need to mourn that loss. So if you need to yell, scream, throw pillows, just not at me. You do whatever you need to do to get a handle on your feelings. I\u2019m here for you. Thank you, Matt. And you\u2019re right, I do. Oh, do you really need to just vent and just get it out and just cry and scream and just throw things?\tI need to just really mourn the loss as you put it. I need to stop pretending to be so tough and invulnerable.\tYou know, I was talking about that earlier with Alex Keis before he dumped you too. I am so sorry. That just slipped out.\tBo has been dead for years. Yeah. Or so we thought. And he\u2019s just, he\u2019s alive. I mean that\u2019s, that\u2019s wild. That\u2019s great news. Yeah, but there\u2019s some bad news as well. Bo\u2019s in a coma in a hospital in Greece, and they\u2019re not sure he is ever gonna wake up. Oh my God. I\u2019ve only heard a million times from Uncle Vic about his son and how proud he is of him and how much he loves him, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s fueling up the Titan jet as we speak.\tHe\u2019s planning to fly to Greece and do everything he can to make sure that that Beau is getting the best possible care. I mean, honestly, I, I have never heard Victor this emotional, but then why wouldn\u2019t he be, I mean, everything, any of him just aches to be with Bo the son. The son, he thought he lost Auntie.\tI can only imagine what he\u2019s going through right now. You know what? Why don\u2019t you go to Greece, go with Uncle Vic. I will handle all the business here if you give me that chance.\t", "What are you, what are you saying? I am saying that you and I are over. You don\u2019t mean that. You don\u2019t mean that. Come on, Brady. You and I both know that we\u2019ve been done for a while now. We\u2019ve just been in denial about it ever since Rachel started hating me and you had to put her feelings first. She\u2019s my daughter.\tI know that. I know that. And I don\u2019t blame you for that. I\u2019m a mom too. I understand. What is. It\u2019s like to prioritize your child. Look, listen, listen to me. Rachel\u2019s a kid. She\u2019s a little girl. She\u2019s, she\u2019s not always gonna feel the way she feels right now. She\u2019s gonna come to realize that, that, that, that you make her father happy.\tIt\u2019s not gonna matter to her cuz she also sees me as the person who makes her mother miserable. And you and I both know all too well that Kristen fueled that fire she made Rachel believe that the only thing standing in the way of the three of you being this happy little family is me. So what\u2019s, what are we, we\u2019re just gonna let Kristen win.\tIs that it? No. No. No one wins in this. Kristen got Rachel to hate me, but she didn\u2019t get you to fall back in love with her. And Rachel got her way by keeping us apart, but her parents still aren\u2019t together. And you ready? You are the man that I fell in love with. You are so full of hope and so joyful. And little by little, I have witnessed that that joyfulness and that hopefulness just steadily being eaten away.\tAnd I know why. It\u2019s because you are her wonderful father and you can\u2019t stand seeing your girl suffer.

What happened?\tBecause they got their behinds handed to them by Sloane Peterson. What happened? Oh honey, on nothing good. You see, all of my assets have been frozen and so have yours.\tI didn\u2019t think it was a date, our dinner on Valentine\u2019s Day. No, not at all. No, I just, um, I\u2019m not at the time anyway. What do you mean? Not at the time. All right. You know what, Jada, as much as I, I enjoyed our evening, I just, I think it\u2019s best that we don\u2019t do it again and. I hope you\u2019re not offended by that.\tOffended. No. If that\u2019s what you want. Yeah, that\u2019s what I think it\u2019s, yes. I think that that\u2019s best to not socialize outside of work. Yeah, yeah. Right. I just, um, I don\u2019t want there to be any confusion, infusion confusion, so that I don\u2019t think. Hmm. That you\u2019re interested in me in a way that you\u2019re not. Yeah.\tRight. I\u2019m, yeah. Even though that\u2019s, uh, not exactly the case. Ray, are you seeing it? Are you interested in me?\tI am sorry, what was the question? Well, you said you didn\u2019t want any confusion. No. You didn\u2019t want me to get the wrong idea. Didn\u2019t want you thinking that you were interested in me. Huh? But then you said that wasn\u2019t the case. No. Right. Did say that. Didn\u2019t I? Brief? Listen, aside from being my boss, you\u2019re my friend.\tI\u2019m a good friend, so you can tell me honestly. Do you wanna be in one friends?\tThere she is. Talia. Oh my God. Oh my God. Honey, it\u2019s so good to see you. I know you too. Okay. I\u2019m guessing you two know each other very well. Brave. I\u2019d like you to meet my sister, Talia Hunter. Wow. Are you saying I can\u2019t access any of my money? You can access some of your money. Just not much. This is insane.\t", "Your mom\u2019s right. . Yeah. I\u2019m mixing business. And pleasure is always a risk day about your one true love. Were you,\tare you thinking about Sarah? No, no. I was, um, I was thinking about her mother actually. Maggie, why? Oh, Michael Uncle just made her the new CEO of Titan Industries yesterday, and by the time the word got out, we\u2019d already put the paper to bed. Oh well, Oh well come on. When This\u2019s big news should have been on the front page.\tYeah, the business section. Perhaps with the arrest of Brady and Eric for kidnapping the COCE O of Damara Enterprises. Well, clearly that is the winner here and the Brothers Grim was an inspired headline. If I do say so myself, that\u2019s pretty clever. Yeah. Under Sure. Fire Away to Sell more papers. Have we sold more paper?\tDunno yet. But um, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s gonna be an improvement. Still wish we had the Tyson story, and I wish you\u2019d start focusing on what\u2019s in front of you instead of the one who got away.\tSorry, it\u2019s a force of habit. Here you are. Have a habit of sitting in the CEO\u2019s chair. Well, Sonny, never minded sharing his desk. Well, I. Okay. Got it. Alex, are you gonna have a problem reporting to me? No. No, auntie Not at all. This is what Uncle Vic wants, so I will do my best for Titan in a supporting role.\tWell, I know that you were very disappointed that he didn\u2019t give you the. No, really auntie. It\u2019s cool. Lately I\u2019ve had to get used to a lot of things. I don\u2019t really like\twhat Alex Curios situation. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Oh, come on now. Chadwick, don\u2019t play dumb with me. Alex works for Titan. You work for Titan\u2019s PR company. What\u2019s the skinny behind the musical chair situation? In the executive suite, there are no musical. Victor Carus found the ideal CEO O candidate, Maggie Carus, and the board is convinced that should be the perfect fit.\tI\u2019m not interested in lines from the press release. I wanna know what happened behind the scenes, the backstabbing, the double crossing, the betrayal. Sorry to disappoint your vast readership, but there was none of that. Oh, really? I heard Alex was a shoeing for the job, and then Victor did a 180 at the last minute and chose Maggie instead.\tSomething must have prompt.\tOkay. You want the real skinny? Yeah, I want the real skinny. It was you. What? Yep. You reached out to Vic for comment about Alex\u2019s extracurricular activities with Alex Chanel. So we reconsider, are you saying Victor passed over Alex because he\u2019s a man whore? I didn\u2019t use that term, but Sure. Ah, what\u2019s, uh, what\u2019s going.\tWanna answer me?\tOkay. Looks pretty straightforward. Do you want any references? Yes, please. There is a space for that. Right on the bottom, you put their phone numbers and then you can circle one of the two hour timeframes in which you want me to call them. It eliminates phone tag. Ooh, that\u2019s smart. . Oh, believe me, I haven\u2019t always been this organized, but time management is crucial to run a successful bakery.\t", "Mm-hmm. , uh, especially when you have to get up at the Graco Dawn every day. See you mean, and tell me you\u2019re not pulling all items at the club. That will be a no. . . But anyway, I really do need to hire someone. So if you could just fill that out and then get it back to me as soon as possible. Yeah, will do. Oh, and by the way, I am.\tTalia. Um, I\u2019ll be back soon.\tI don\u2019t get it. Why wouldn\u2019t it be a good idea for us to grab lunch? Didn\u2019t you read Abe\u2019s email? His office sent out a new policy on inter-office relationships, and we\u2019re not supposed to be fraternizing. , but how\u2019s that Fraternizing partners have lunch together in the job all the time. Yeah. Well, that\u2019s the thing.\tI\u2019m not, I\u2019m not, we\u2019re not partners. I\u2019m your boss. So come on, Ray. I mean, we had burgers at the Brady Pub on Valentine\u2019s Day. You didn\u2019t seem to have a problem with it. I mean, it\u2019s, it\u2019s not like it was a date.\tWait, did you think it was\tanyone going to answer me? Well, I was just asking Chad for a comment on the shake up at Titan, but since you are the brains at SJ p r, perhaps you\u2019d like to do the honors. Certainly, after an exhaustive search, Victor Kakkis has found the ideal c e o candidate in Maggie Kakkis. The board is every confidence she\u2019ll be the perfect fit, not you too.\tExcuse me. Chad already gave me the party line. I want your comment on the real story. That\u2019s what I just did. Exhaustive. I don\u2019t think so. Victor was going to choose Alex and then changed his mind at the last minute. According to Chad, it\u2019s at least partly because he was a, uh, whatever Mr. Damer told you was strictly off the record.\tWhy is there more to the story? You were dating Alex Kiki exclusively, and then your relationship suddenly fell apart. Is that part of the reason why Victor chose not to name him c e o? We\u2019re done. Was Alex having threesomes behind your back? Did he cheat on you with the bisexual baker? Honey, did he dump you because you couldn\u2019t satisfy him in certain aspects of sleep enough?\tIt has nothing to do with her. They broke up cuz Alex shut off her phone. What? They were on a date. Alex didn\u2019t want to be interrupted, so he shut off her phone. She didn\u2019t get the sick. Goodbye to her dying mom there.\tAll these emails. Well, we\u2019ve been in meetings all day. Right, right. Uh, just getting to know the different departments on Maggie, do you need a little help with the lay of the land? Um, oh, I got it. Thanks. Okay. It\u2019s just that last night called me a right hand man. You said that you\u2019d be counting on me to help bring you up to speed on some things.\tWell, the meeting and the meetings, they, they took care. . Okay. Okay. Okay. So what are you tackling first? Um hmm. Well, I\u2019d like to find ways to make Titan run more efficiently. Decide where we, the wisest for us to vest moving forward. Huh? There was one area that stood out to me in particular publishing. Oh, well, as soon as Sonny put me in charge of that department, my first order of business was to make Bella Magazine the flag.\t", "The potential is huge. So we\u2019ve been increasing the profile for the business, strengthening the brand. In fact, I just turned in the latest advertising budget for approval. Yes, I saw that. But you won\u2019t be needing my approval. I\u2019m shutting down the magazine,\tbut this publication has a very bright future and I just. Wish that you\u2019d stopped second guessing. And of course, you, you\u2019re, you\u2019re absolutely right. I\u2019m sorry. I mean, we couldn\u2019t have wished for a better lead story on day one than Brady and Eric\u2019s arrest. It\u2019s just after everything we did to get this paper, I just really wanted to be a success.\tWell, I can\u2019t fault you for that. Can I partner? Oh. That\u2019s Skylar with the numbers. Sky. Talk to me. Really? You course. Want a damn press release. Thanks. So our numbers are up 20% since last week. And not just new sales stands, I mean online traffic as well. Our subscriptions are through the room and we\u2019ve even outsold the intruder.\tOh my God, that\u2019s incredible.\tThat is not what I was expecting to hear. Tell me more, please. How did you feel when you realized you\u2019d never get to speak to your mother again? Leo, don\u2019t do that. Can you explain what was going through your mind when you walked into her hospital room and realized? The wft of life. Okay. If you don\u2019t get out of here right now, I\u2019m gonna take this phone and shove it so far, okay?\tOkay. But I feel like I was asking very tactfully, just go, I\u2019m going and I am very sorry about your mother. Get out.\tWhat the hell is wrong with you?\tWait, did you just say you were shutting down Bella? Well, actually I\u2019m surprised it didn\u2019t happen sooner. The magazine has been struggling for some time. Yeah, I\u2019ve been working to get it back on track. Alex, I\u2019m sorry, but the numbers are The numbers by shuttering Bella Titan can take a ride off . I got it.\tAuntie, can you please just gimme a little bit more time to show you what I can do? I\u2019m afraid the decision\u2019s been made. What about the staff? What are you, are you just gonna let \u2019em all go without any warning? We\u2019ll offer a generous severance package. A severance package. And what about Uncle Vic? Bella was named after his daughter.\tDo you really think he\u2019s gonna sign off on this? He doesn\u2019t have to. Fitzer isn\u2019t the c e o of this company. I am\tsorry. Sorry. I just, um, I got really excited about the numbers as well.\tSkyler has told me we are up 20% from last week. Isn\u2019t that amazing? So between lady whistleblowers, skating wit, you are awe inspiring work ethic. We give the British tabs a run for their money, right? Governor? Oh, I\u2019ll be back. Where are you going? Don\u2019t you wanna break out the SHS and celebrate? I can\u2019t just sit around here congratulating each other.\t"], "answer": [0, 2, 3, 4, 1]}

Okay, I\u2013 I don\u2019t\u2013 I don\u2019t wanna keep arguing this with you, liam. I just want you to understand that hope for the future is my life\u2019s work!\tLiam: I absolutely understand that, and I support you in that.\tHope: Okay, so then do you understand that I tried to find a designer that would make it work? I mean, eric, one of the most prolific designers to ever pick up a pencil, even he couldn\u2019t interpret my vision as well as thomas could.\tLiam: The designs are done, though. The dresses are made. You don\u2019t need thomas for this next part.\tHope: Okay, I\u2013 I get that you have issues with thomas.\tLiam: Of course I have issues with thomas. How could I possibly trust him after everything he\u2019s done to us?\tHope: Because I do! I\u2013 I\u2019m not some child, liam. I\u2013 I work with him every day, I\u2019ve seen the changes that he\u2019s implemented into his life, a\u2013 and the progress that he\u2019s made, and not only that, he\u2013 he brings a certain artistry, a certain creativity to my line.\tLiam: Hope, hope. I\u2019m not asking you to get a new designer.\tHope: But you\u2019re telling me not to bring thomas to rome. And I can\u2019t do that.\tLiam: You can\u2019t or you won\u2019t?\tHope: Liam, I don\u2019t want to hurt you. But thomas is my lead designer.

That\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s ridiculous, though.\tTaylor: Okay, normally, your father and i would agree with you, but\u2013\tThomas: But you\u2019re what? You\u2019re gonna both get involved in office gossip?\tRidge: Well, that\u2019s not office gossip. It came from your sister, it came from steffy.\tTaylor: Yeah. Your sister has her suspicions.\tThomas: Suspicions or paranoia? Because lately, she\u2019s been singularly focused on all the things hope does wrong.\tTaylor: Okay, because she\u2019s concerned.\tThomas: Okay, look. Steffy may have her own issues with hope, but it has nothing to do with me.\tThomas: Oh, relax. We\u2019re not accusing you of anything. Your mom and I, we\u2019re on your side.\tTaylor: No, yes, and I\u2019m sorry if it sounds like it is. I\u2013 we love you so much, and\u2013 and we know how hard you\u2019ve worked to get to where you are, and we just don\u2019t wanna see anything or anyone jeopardize that.\tThomas: Okay, well, all right, thank you. Um, hope and I have a great working relationship and we\u2019re co-parents to douglas and that is it, okay? But as far steffy is concerned, maybe she\u2019s just mixing up her signals, right?

I mean, if he feels so strongly about sally, in spite of this situation, I think it\u2019s gonna be very hard to change his mind.\tSummer: I agree. But what if something in their relationship were to drastically change and he realized that it would be better to end it sooner rather than later?\tNikki: Change how?\tSummer: Like if sally fell back in love with adam.\tNikki: Okay. And then what?\tSummer: Sally was heartbroken when adam dumped her. I mean, that\u2019s the reason why she glommed on to dad in the first place. And we all know that adam\u2019s not over her. So, maybe deep down, she still cares for him, too.\tNikki: I wouldn\u2019t doubt that.\tSummer: So, if I could pull this off, it would be sort of a service to two people who belong together.\tNikki: Oh, my god, yes. I mean, that would be ideal. But there are two obstacles that you need to consider.\tSummer: What are they?\tNikki: Whatever lingering feelings sally may have for adam, she has decided to keep him at arm\u2019s length. So that tells me that her walls are up pretty high.\tSummer: Walls can be climbed. You just have to have the right tools and motivation. What\u2019s the other one?\tNikki: No one is more charming than your father when he is infatuated with someone. So it\u2019s unlikely that adam would be able to win her heart without a lot of help and a whole lot of luck.\tSally: Adam, your offer is very generous, but\u2026 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m gonna have to say no.\tAdam: Well, I\u2019m sorry to hear that.\tNick: This is what she was worried about, you overstepping.\tAdam: Uh, no, I was just trying to provide for my child and his or her mother.

I-I don\u2019t know. I mean, for me to know and not tell him\u2026\tSummer: I know. I know. I know. It was really unfair for me to dump all of this on you, but i just \u2014 I needed to talk to somebody who would be just as horrified as I am, but the thing is, if grandpa confronts dad about this before he\u2019s ready, it\u2019s gonna cause this huge conflict.

It\u2019s not healthy to have stress during pregnancy.\tSummer: Thank you.\tNikki: I wish that nicholas would tell victor already, but he\u2019s probably too embarrassed and upset, doesn\u2019t want to talk about it.\tSummer: This is the thing, grandma. He\u2019s not wallowing in self-pity. Dad is actually still seeing sally.\tNikki: They\u2019re not breaking up?\tSummer: [ Exhales sharply ] I guess this thing with adam was a one-time occasion and sally doesn\u2019t have any desire to get back together with him.\tNikki: Oh, no, sure. Why should she? She can have nicholas.\tSummer: I actually think that I\u2019m the most upset about all of this. And I kind of blew up at sally. I told her how selfish I thought she was being and how she\u2019s using my dad. And then dad came over and told me how wrong I was and how this hasn\u2019t changed his feelings for sally at all.\tNikki: Unbelievable. He is too noble for his own good.\tSummer: I know, right? It\u2019s like he can\u2019t see what\u2019s going on, and it kills me.\tNikki: Trust me. I know exactly how you feel.\tSummer: I wish that this could all work out for dad.

I didn\u2019t know you were in town.\tHarmony: Oh, it is the most incredible thing. I was in chicago working at a conference for the last few days and as I was leaving, tucker reaches out to me. Yeah, told me about this lounge and neil\u2019s name and how you and lily were gonna put together this event to celebrate his memory. Yeah, he even sent a fancy car to bring me here.\tDevon: Tucker did that?\tHarmony: Yeah.\tDiane: Thank you both for never giving up on me. Even when I thought it was hopeless. And how lucky am I that michael was my lawyer? He managed to pull off the impossible, getting me out of that jail, at least for now.\tJack: No, forever. We are in this with you for the long fight.\tKyle: Mm-hmm. Dad and I are not going to give up until we prove your innocence.\tDiane: Well, I know the two of you believe that I had nothing to do with phyllis\u2019s murder, but there\u2019s a lot of people in this town who feel differently, including your wife. How is summer going to react when she sees me here in her home? I don\u2019t want to cause any tension in your marriage.\tKyle: I am going to do everything I can to help summer accept that we are all back under this roof, together. Because you need to be here. This is your home too.\tJack: That\u2019s exactly what I told your mother.\tDiane: It\u2019s almost like the two of you rehearsed that.\tKyle: Uh, does she know about, um\u2026\tDiane: Know about what?\tJack: I think he is referring to a new house guest we have who is complicating things a bit.\tDiane: Someone else moved in? Who?\tJack: Brace yourself. Tucker.\tDiane: Tucker mccall is living here?\t[ Diane scoffing ]\tDevon: So tucker, you invited my mom here.\tTucker: I did. Yeah, I thought it would be nice for her to be here and to see you.\tDevon: Well, that was an incredible gesture.\tTucker: I\u2019m just glad it worked out.\tDiane: Why on earth would tucker\u2026 it was ashley, wasn\u2019t it?\tJack: My sister claims she has every right since I brought you into this house without her approval. She\u2019s just trying to prove a point. But worse, I think she actually has feelings for the guy.\t", "Sharon: Uh, good observation skills.\tMariah: It\u2019s a gift.\tSharon: Back when tucker and ashley were married, he and harmony had a moment.\tMariah: Got it, got it. So, harmony is not ashley\u2019s favorite person. Well, that certainly makes things interesting.\tHarmony: You know, I can\u2019t thank you enough for contacting me.\tTucker: The smile on devon\u2019s face is all the thanks I need.\tHarmony: I am so in awe of that young man, everything he\u2019s accomplished. But even more importantly, who he is. With little to no help from the two of us.\tTucker: Probably just as well.\t[ Harmony chuckling ] I\u2019m still not very good at doing the right things for the right reasons, but ashley\u2019s helping me get there.\tHarmony: I\u2019m really glad that you two got back together.

He\u2019s making a real effort with his son.\tAbby: Well, I have to hand it to the guy. He found a way to make tonight even more special for devon.

Since the minute you lured jack to L.A., You set off this whole chain of events that has put us where we are now and after everything you\u2019ve done, after all the lies you told, it\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s not fair that you get to be here with the people that you love and my family has been ripped apart.

Uh, there\u2019s something I need to explain to you.\tAshley: Hello, harmony.\tHarmony: Oh, hi, ashley. So nice to see you.\tAshley: You as well. So nice you could be here for devon.\tHarmony: Ah, well, it\u2019s even more meaningful to me since I wasn\u2019t able to attend neil\u2019s original service.\tTucker: Yeah, I wasn\u2019t either.\t", ">>Kyle: He\u2019s taken over our guest room, for now.

Phone calls and text messages don\u2019t compare to being with you.\tHarmony: No, you\u2019re so right. And I am long overdue for some one on one time with my little grandbaby. Cannot wait to wrap that little baby in my arms.\tDevon: Yes. We will make that happen as soon as possible.\tHarmony: Yes.\tDevon: \u2018Cause dom would love to meet his amazing grandma.\tHarmony: Oh, well, I don\u2019t know how amazing I am but I sure am eager to meet him.\tDevon: I think you\u2019re amazing. Look at everything you\u2019ve accomplished in the last few years. You have a degree and you\u2019ve been clean and sober for almost two decades. There\u2019s nothing easy about any of that. I\u2019m very proud of you.\tHarmony: Mm. Well, to hear you say it like that, I\u2019m proud of me too.\tDevon: Good, you should be. How\u2019s your job?\tHarmony: So far so good.\tDevon: Yeah.\tHarmony: Yeah, I love what I do. I do, I do. I just, uh, I get to contribute to the community. I get to help people in need. I remember what it was like to be in their shoes, you know. So, it\u2019s just so much more rewarding.\tDevon: Good. It\u2019s amazing.\tHarmony: Yeah. But look who\u2019s talking, you know. I\u2019m sorry, it makes my heart want to burst seeing how well you\u2019re doing, you know. Your son, abby, and\u2013 and\u2013 and, oh, I\u2019m so relieved that the two of you, you and lily resolved your issues. The two of you working side by side again.\tDevon: I know. It feels like everything in my life is moving in the right direction.\tHarmony: Yes. Well, even with tucker? Seems like he\u2019s trying to make up for lost time.\tDevon: He is. He really is.

In some respects, it never goes away.\tNikki: And I know I\u2019ve said this to you before, but I am deeply sorry for what happened. I just want you to know that you have my full support and victor\u2019S.\tSharon: And mine. Whatever you need, daniel. If you want someone to talk to or just listen.

Is that harmony?\tNikki: Tucker\u2019s surprise for devon.\tVictor: May I have your attention, please? We\u2019re here to celebrate a man who was my friend. Not only on a personal level, but I trusted him implicitly in business. One of the few people I ever trusted, it was neil winters. Now, we can talk about a lot of his accomplishments, but one thing stands out to me as a father who\u2019s concerned about family, is how he dealt with raising devon and lily. Every parent hopes to pass on to his offspring a solid foundation with which the children who go out into the world and deal with all the slings and arrows. Often outrageous fortune. Neil did that. The fact that both devon and lily are here tonight, honoring the memory of the man who raised them, says everything about my friend. And says everything about family because after all has been said and done, it is family that holds us together. So cheers to neil and his memory.\tAll: To neil.\tSummer: I\u2013 I\u2013 I don\u2019t understand. Did the\u2013 did the D.A. Drop the charges?\tKyle: Michael was able to get mom out on bail. Dad and I tried to reach you.\tSummer: Did the cops find out any new information?\tKyle: Unfortunately not.\tJack: Summer, I realize this is going to be difficult for you, but diane is innocent. She didn\u2019t kill phyllis and it\u2019s only a matter of time before we find evidence that proves that.

Just make sure you see me before you leave because I wanna discuss your, uh, follow-up care. Okay. Uhhuh. Okay. Let me get dressed now.\tEj, I\u2019m sorry, Gabby scared you and, and she. Should have made so much out of it, but I\u2019m fine now. Well, that\u2019s a relief. Um, does Kayla know why you had this pain? It\u2019s just something I ate. I didn\u2019t agree with me. Obviously a delayed reaction to the biscuits maybe? Yeah. That. That might have been it, but like I said, it was, it\u2019s nothing.\tIt couldn\u2019t have been nothing Gabby despises you, yet she was worried enough to drive you here and now you are fine.

Why didn\u2019t you say that to me when you first saw me?\tWhat kind of coldhearted person are you? Hey, I\u2019m the one who took her to the er. Okay. Um, was she seen to, is she all right now?

But I\u2019m sure you know that it doesn\u2019t prevent a hundred percent of pregnancies. But the the cramps, why was I having cramps? They were probably just little contractions, which is normal in early pregnancy. They stopped on their own and you\u2019re not spotting.\tSo I\u2019m not concerned at the moment, but I do think that you should do a follow up exam with your ob gyn given your medical history, especially in light of the fact that you\u2019ve. Had difficulties going full term with your pregnancies and all the risks that go along with that. Oh my God, I did not see this coming.\tIt\u2019s a lot to take in. Ah, obviously was unplanned.

Oh, honey, that is not gonna close without stitches. Let me take you to the hospital. Mom, look, you know what? You\u2019ll end up with a scar if you don\u2019t. I don\u2019t care. Or you\u2019ll end up with an infection. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019re a doctor. Stitch it up. I don\u2019t have my bag.

I remember she was typing it in when she was grabbing her stomach in pain. Yeah. Oh, I love your memory. Okay. You do realize that it is highly unethical for me to access and alter an evaluation by job performance, right.\tLike it\u2019s not unethical for her to lie about you. That report of hers is probably calling you everything in the book you want. You wanna let that go in. I mean, I know I, I started this whole thing when I hired you to do these job performances, but what a crockett\u2019s become, huh? No, Stephan, listen, everything that I wrote about either Damer is accurate.\tOkay. From his annuity attitude for, to his nasty colon, to him letting his mistress from this company for him.

He also posed as an I s A agent named Kyle. Somebody. Graham. I take it. Agent Reid refilled you in. Billy told me you had an accent. Yes, but Kyle Graham doesn\u2019t, and I find myself reverting to his voice whenever I speak to Americans.\tTell me how is Agent Reid? I have such fond memories of romancing her as we jetted around the globe about the Issa\u2019s money. Yeah. I know all about the tango in New Orleans, the hot kiss in Amsterdam. The fact is she knows that she was played by you. Actually. She\u2019s forgotten all about you. Wow. I guess I had that coming.\tYou totally did.

Kayla, we didn\u2019t know what we were doing. Mm-hmm. Oh my God. Could the drug hurt the baby? I think it\u2019s too early to know that\tthis is such a mess.\tOh, hi. What are you? What are you doing here? I had to know if you are all right. Didn\u2019t I? Is she.\tYou know, the least EJ could have done was, thank you for taking a call to the hospital. Yeah, no kidding.

Are you in some kind of trouble? No, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m working the case and the clock is ticking. I just gotta go. No, not until we talk. I can\u2019t talk. This is a highly sensitive operation.\tIt\u2019s true. So I don\u2019t have your operation. Listen to me. Kayla is missing some. Psycho has her. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here in Greece. I\u2019m trying to track down Thomas Banks. Why banks? Hope, and I have reason to believe that he\u2019s the one who took Kayla\tHope is here in Greece. We gotta call her and tell her you\u2019re alive. You\u2019re not calling anyone,\tsir. We mean no harm. I know you don\u2019t, but this one is a different story. Sir, my name is Constantine.

He\u2019s gonna be all alone, so I, I gotta get to Seattle. Stay. He\u2019s gonna need help getting around.\tNo, I know, but Dad\u2019s in Greece looking for mom, so obviously neither of them can get there quickly. Someone has to, someone has to go right away. I will. I, I\u2019ll go to Seattle. What? No, you don\u2019t have to do that. No, I, I want to. Okay. Joey\u2019s my brother too, and I do have some medical expertise and a job here.\tSame as you. I can work from anywhere. Steph, you haven\u2019t slept since you talked to your mom. Okay. You need to go see Marlena and figure out if Kayla left you any clue of where she might be. I just don\u2019t want Joey to think that he, he won\u2019t trust me. He wants you to focus on finding your mom and getting her back home.\tHey, look, I, I, I\u2019ll book my flight right now. He, I\u2019ll be in Seattle before he even wakes up.\tThank you. Trip. I really appreciate this. Of course. Oh wait, what about your big date?

You know, losing her the way that we did, having the answers and, and knowing what happened, it didn\u2019t take away the pain, but, uh,\tum, it made it a little easier. I understand. I wish I could tell you something more. In fact, as we were, we were sedated most of the time. There actually was only one day that the three of us were, were conscious together. How was Kate? Was she all right? She was all right. She kept going after Megan, demanding to know what Megan planned to do with us.\tWhat did Megan tell you? Not much, unfortunately.\tAnd then she put us under again. When Kayla and I woke up, Kate wasn\u2019t there. We tried to escape. And, and, and find her. But Ralph, stop this. Did he tell you where Kate was? She was with Megan. Apparently Kate was going to be the first test subject of Ralph\u2019s new serum, five new. I don\u2019t know. He just said it was going to be life changing.\tHow or what? I don\u2019t know. So Megan made Kate her own personal Guinea pig. Yeah.

Gladys: What kind of question is that, \u201cis sasha good with me selling the garage?\u201d Gladys, that\u2019s not an answer. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so worked up. Okay, let me just make it clear right now that this is not me being worked up. But i can be worked up\u2026\t[Whispering] If you don\u2019t give me an answer. Well, this is a surprise. What brings you here? Well, I was hoping to have lunch with one of the owners, and I\u2019m not talking about olivia. You have time for me? Well, I\u2019m going to have to check my calendar. Why, as a matter of fact, I have an opening. You know, I think we\u2019re way overdue for a proper catch-up. I want to hear about all the developments in your life. Oh, I don\u2019t know about that. Careful what you wish for. So, this form states that the pcpd has returned all the items taken from the quartermaine boathouse as evidence in the investigation when ava jerome was attacked near the boathouse. Just need your signature, and, uh, I\u2019ll be out of your hair. Glad to put this behind us once and for all. Thank you for catching the woman who killed brando and so many others. My sympathies for everything your family\u2019s going through. And, uh, for the challenges still to come. Maxie: Ned! It is so perfect that you are the one who answered the door. Come on in, maxie. So, what brings you by? As a matter of fact\u2026 you. Carly: Oh, my gosh. We made quite a mess last night.\t[ Laughs ] Wow. Yeah. [ Laughs ] I\u2019d say it was worth it. Oh, yes. I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re just now leaving the bedroom. Well, it\u2019s not every day we get the house to ourselves. I feel like we\u2019re kind of obligated to take advantage of that. We are. Yeah. Yeah. Mm, you know what? Hmm? Sooner or later, you\u2019re going to have to clean this up. How \u2019bout later?\t", "You don\u2019t have to worry about selina wu \u2014 or me. You know how much I love my daughter-in-law, and I want to do right by brando. I always have sasha\u2019s best interests at heart. Alright, listen. I got some business to take care of. As for you, you better know what you\u2019re doing. Who owns the garage now? I really don\u2019t want to get any more involved. But I-I-I don\u2019t want to lie to you, either.\t[ Sighs ] Like I said, I just overheard part of a conversation. I just \u2014 I really think that you need to ask gladys yourself.\t[ Exhales sharply ] Oh, I intend to. Cody, I know that you feel bad, but please don\u2019T. I appreciate you being honest with me. At least someone was. The nurses\u2019 ball is back! I wanted to commemorate G.H.\u2019S 60th anniversary and celebrate how much G.H.\u2019S workers have meant to the community. I thought, what better way than the nurses\u2019 ball? That is a great idea, sweetheart. Normally, I\u2019d say maybe we should skip it, the year of lucy\u2019s death. But 60 years of general hospital is too big of an anniversary to ignore. I agree. And since lucy isn\u2019t here to run things, I\u2019m going to attempt to step into her shoes and chair the event. As you can imagine, it\u2019s a big undertaking financially. Which is where you and ned come in. You know what? I have some things I have to take care of, so I will leave you to this. Congratulations again. Thank you. Maxie, whatever you need, you can count on elq and the entire quartermaine family. Thank you, ned. Um, I\u2019m sure things are pretty crazy at elq right now with valentin being gone, also. And, of \u2014 of course, you know, aurora media will be at your service. I\u2019m sure drew will be on board, too. Thank you, michael. I really appreciate it, both of you. And I\u2019m going to hold you to it. We really need sponsors for this event.

Really, I blink one day, and maxie\u2019s all grown up. Oh, moral of the story \u2014 don\u2019t blink.\t[ Chuckles ] Uh, what are you doing here? I had some police business to finish up. Oh, that\u2019s a good thing, because I have a big announcement for all of you. I ran into your mother-in-law. Gladys? Have you two even met? How \u2014 how did you know it was her? I \u2014 at some point in the conversation, it came out that her last name was corbin, and she was talking about selling a garage that belonged to her daughter-in-law. So it wasn\u2019t hard to put together. And then what? Look, I-I\u2026\t[ Sighs ] I just got the distinct impression that she was trying to sell the garage. I had been afraid that she would sell the garage without consulting me. But I told myself I was just being paranoid. I can\u2019t believe she actually did it. Is there anything I can do? Yes. You can tell me who she was selling the garage to. Last time we talked, you were so eager to sell the garage that you wanted me to convince sasha to get on board. How do I know that you didn\u2019t badger her into taking the offer? Is that really what you think about me? Let me just say this. I know how ms. Wu\u2026operates when she sets her sights on something. And if she is pressuring you, I can help you. But you\u2019ve got to tell me what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t stick around last night. Oh, that\u2019s okay. I know that you wanted to see willow. Well, I-I sp-spent the night with sonny, but I am so glad that you decided to stay at my place. You know? It\u2019s just, with all the drama happening at wyndemere\u2026 yeah. Even with ryan dead, I \u2014 I just don\u2019t feel safe there on that island all by myself. Yeah, anyone in their right mind would need a little break from wyndemere for a while. Yeah. And you don\u2019t even know the whole story. You\u2019re welcome to stay with me as long as you want to. I can only imagine what you\u2019re going through. And sonny mentioned that nikolas threatened to take avery? Th-that \u2014 that was just a miscommunication, really. So tell me how \u2014 how things went with willow last night. Um, better. Better than I had hoped. You know, she finally opened up to me about the specifics of her health issues. Hey, well, ain\u2019t that something? Well, liesl asked her to do it, and willow\u2019s very grateful to aunt liesl, so she honored her request. But I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019T. I\u2019m climbing the walls wondering what\u2019s happening to her. And maybe this is \u2014 this little thaw is a step in the right direction. Yeah, I hope so. And how about sonny? How are things with sonny? Oh, they\u2019re fine. \u201cFine\u201d? Oh. Is there trouble in paradise? Yes. Only it\u2019s not my paradise. Whose? Carly.\t", "[ Laughs ]\tI have to leave soon. Right. Your mystery boss needs evidence against sonny. Michael: Forget about the pikeman update. If \u2014 if sonny\u2019s talking to you about his past, you got nothing to worry about. You know, I can make a lot more than grilled cheese sandwiches. Oh, what? Egg salad? Pb and j? That\u2026\t[ Chuckles ] \u2026And grilled salmon with grilled asparagus marinated in truffle oil. Oh, so you can cook. And you\u2019re just now telling me this. Why have you been holding out on me? I ate so many mres in afghanistan that I promised myself I\u2019d learn to cook when I got back to the states. Mres \u2014 that\u2019s meals ready-to-eat? They\u2019re packaged to withstand rough conditions, exposure to the elements. They\u2019ll keep you fed, but they are not exactly fine dining. Oh, so you can cook now that you discovered truffle oil? Yeah. Adds depth and flavor. I\u2019ll make you grilled asparagus sometime. It\u2019s too cold to grill. But it won\u2019t be this summer. Oh, so\u2026 \u2026you think we\u2019ll still be doing this, this summer? The job should be over by then. And I can spend every minute getting closer to you without worrying about sonny. I can\u2019t wait. Me, either. Will I see you later? Count on it. I\u2019ll walk you out. I hope you don\u2019t mind. Maxie told me about your illness. I\u2019m so sorry about everything you\u2019re going through. Especially so soon after the birth of that adorable baby.\t[ Chuckles ] Well, that is \u2014 that\u2019s very kind of you, mac. Hopefully, there may be some good news on the horizon. I might have a match with a bone marrow donor. That\u2019s terrific. I\u2019ll pray that everything works out. I will take all the prayers I can get. [ Chuckles ] I want as much time with my family as possible. Congratulations on amelia. She\u2019s beautiful. Thank you. Yeah, I think so, too.
