{"content": ["Tucker: I\u2019d actually like to be ringside for it. I\u2019d stick around and wait with you if you want.\tAshley: Might be a little fun to have an audience cheering me on, but I\u2019d like some alone time before they get here.\tTucker: Well, good night. And I anxiously await your answer to my proposal. Well, good night.\tAshley: Night. What are you doing?\tTucker: Well, because you said we had a traditional date tonight, so I was hoping for a traditional goodbye.\tAshley: Oh. Okay.\tTucker: Thank you very much.\tDevon: Yeah, I don\u2019t really know what my role is going to be with either family company moving forward. I\u2019m just happy that I didn\u2019t ruin my relationship with lily.\tAbby: And what about mccall?\tDevon: I\u2026I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if\u2026 if it\u2019s the right thing to start over with a new company like that or just to go back to chancellor-winters. I should probably sleep on it.\tAbby: Well, your company means so much to you. Why wouldn\u2019t you want to go back and lead it?\tDevon: Just because, you know, I know there\u2019s still a lot of differences between me and lily when it comes to business. And I know she\u2019s pushed hard to get us to work side by side together, but I just don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the smartest thing to do. Maybe starting from scratch with mccall is the right way to go.\tAbby: I understand how you feel and just know that no matter what you decide, I\u2019m here to support you.\tDevon: Well, I can\u2019t tell you how grateful I am for that. And I can\u2019t tell you how grateful I am for you. You made me see things clearly tonight, and I\u2019ll never forget that.\tAbby: Well, you did the hard part. You had to reconnect with lily and let go of your feelings of anger and hurt.\tDevon: Yeah. I did let go of the anger, but you gave me something positive to replace it with. So, it all started with you.\tChance: Hey.\tSharon: Hey.\tChance: None of the patrols have seen the ambulance.\tSharon: You don\u2019t suspect foul play, do you?\tChance: I don\u2019t know. Maybe, considering that jack and diane have a history of taking things into their own hands, especially when it comes to stark. The animosity between them is dangerous.\tSharon: Hey, that\u2019s phyllis\u2019 mask. She must have dropped it. Why don\u2019t I grab it for her?\tChance: No. Don\u2019T. It could be evidence.\tJack: I am worried that stark is doing something to harm phyllis.\tDiane: Do you think?\tJack: Would it be such a surprise? I\u2019m still furious at her that she ever brought stark into town to begin with. The anguish she put you through is unforgivable. But I never wanted any harm to come to her.\tDiane: Jack, I want you to know that that fight you overheard, it\u2019s not who I am. I mean, I was just caught up in the heat of the moment, and I-I really, I was \u2014 I was pushed by an out-of-control, psychotic phyllis. But I didn\u2019t want anything bad to happen to her. You do believe me, don\u2019t you?\tJack: Of course I do.\tTucker: A single malt, neat, if you will, and whatever the lady\u2019s having.\tAudra: What makes you think i want anything from you, tucker?\tTucker: I can always tell when you need a friend. So, we both bailed on the big gala, huh? I guess neither of us feels like we\u2019re part of the fabric of this town\u2019s society.\tAudra: Don\u2019t project your insecurities onto me. Look, I have a very coveted position at newman media. I\u2019m doing just fine being accepted by the movers and shakers of genoa city.\tTucker: What a load of bull. From what I\u2019ve observed, nate only has eyes for elena. Kind of puts you out in the cold, don\u2019t it?\tAudra: You know, for someone so observant, you sure miss a lot. I thought you were on a date with ashley. I don\u2019t see her. Is she parking the car?\tTucker: Actually, things are progressing quite nicely on that front, thank you very much.\tAudra: Hooray. Well, I also have a plan in the works for what I\u2019m after. No matter what type of dog you have\u2026\tDevon: This is perfect. You know, it made me so happy to come home to you waiting for me.\tAbby: I feel like I belong here.\tDevon: That\u2019s because you do. This is home. With our son asleep upstairs\u2026 it should be our home. Serious. Would you consider you and dom moving in here with me?\tTucker: What\u2019s this plan of yours that you\u2019ve got schemed? Maybe I can help.\tAudra: No, thanks. I got it. But, you know, come to think of it, you can occasionally be resourceful. Maybe you can help.\tTucker: I\u2019m always at your disposal, audra. You know that.\tAudra: I need to track down a man named J.T. Hellstrom.\tVictoria: Hi. Any word on phyllis?\tNate: I\u2019m afraid not.\tVictoria: You know, it was really nice seeing the two of you working together again. Nate, it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen you use your medical skills.\tElena: Well, nate is an amazing talent. I\u2019ve always thought it was his true calling.\tVictoria: Well, a person can have many callings, don\u2019t you think?\tElena: Can they?\tVictoria: Absolutely.\tElena: Hmm. Well, I really enjoyed working with nate as a team again. I think we have a very natural rhythm together.\tVictoria: So I noticed. Nate is a great team player.\tElena: I completely agree. In fact, I\u2019ve got some ideas about how to make that teamwork a bigger part of our lives again.\tSummer: That was dad. He\u2019s still at the hospital.\tNikki: Is phyllis there? Has he seen her?\tSummer: No. There\u2019s still no sign of her.\tDaniel: Not only am I worried that she might be in danger, but she was in need of medical attention. You know, every minute that she\u2019s not at the hospital, she\u2019s not getting the care that she needs. Chance, what was that, that call? Was that about phyllis?\tChance: There was an accident on collins road. It\u2019s involving one car, an ambulance. Now, that\u2019s all the information that I have right now. We don\u2019t know if it was phyllis\u2019. But we should prepare for the worst.\tNext week on \u201cthe young and the restless\u201d\u2026\tTucker: J.T. Hellstrom? I\u2019ll find him for you. It\u2019s going to cost you, though.\tDaniel: I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here, but my mother would never marry a lowlife like you \u2014 not of her own free will.\tLauren: How did this beautiful event turn into such a catastrophe?\tJeremy: Is phyllis okay? Look, I want answers. I have a right to know.\tSummer: Chance, please. Tell us something, anything.\t", "Chance: Is that true? Did you threaten phyllis tonight? Hi, I\u2019m karen.\tAdditional sponsorship\tprovided by\u2026\tChance: Okay, diane, I am just trying to understand the events that led to phyllis collapsing. So, why don\u2019t you fill me in on what you know about that? Of course we can take this down to the station, make it official if you\u2019d like.\tJack: What exactly are you trying to imply?\tKyle: Yeah, I mean, how has phyllis\u2019 clearly being unwell turned into something that diane\u2019s under suspicion for? Some known criminal makes random accusations, and now you\u2019re suddenly questioning my mother like she\u2019s to blame? This is outrageous.\tChance: Under the circumstances, the questions are necessary. Now, when phyllis fell, did she lose consciousness? Or could you tell if she was intoxicated at all?\tNate: Uh, chance, that didn\u2019t seem to be the case. I didn\u2019t detect any signs of alcohol.\tElena: But her breathing was shallow, and her heart rate was faint.\tJeremy: She was a picture of health until that moment. No complaints. Which makes this so suspicious.\tChance: Hey, I\u2019m handling this. Thank you. Diane, he is claiming that phyllis had reason to be fearful of you. So, I\u2019m gonna ask you again, and please answer the question. Did you two have a physical altercation tonight? And did you threaten her life?\tDiane: Oh, my god. Do you really think I did something to her? That\u2019s insane.\tAmanda: Any word from daniel?\tLily: Um\u2026 no, nothing.\t[ Sighs ] So, I saw you chatting with devon earlier. How did that go? Was it difficult?\tAmanda: Well, he apologized again for hurting me with abby. I\u2019m sure you guessed that much. And then we just \u2014 we just started talking about business, how he\u2019s dropping the lawsuit.\tLily: I know. I am so relieved.\tAmanda: Be careful. I know devon may appear remorseful, like he\u2019s willing to put all tensions aside, but never forget that he was willing to take down chancellor-winters. I would not be so quick to trust him.\tLily: Yeah, I know that you\u2019re still hurting, but he is my brother.\tAmanda: Yeah, no, you\u2019re right. I can\u2019t forget what he did to me. I can\u2019t act like it didn\u2019t happen. But I also can\u2019t ignore how it affects his trustworthiness.\tLily: I understand. But what happened between you two is not the same as what happened between us.\tAmanda: Isn\u2019t it? I mean, someone is willing to rationalize their betrayals in one situation, and\u2026\t[ Scoffs ] That\u2019s why they say never trust a man who cheats at golf. If you\u2019ll cheat and lie about something as stupid as golf, you\u2019ll lie about anything.\tLily: Well, good thing devon doesn\u2019t play golf.\tAmanda: That\u2019s not my point.\tLily: No, I know. I get your point. I do. But devon also \u2014 he loves his family. Family is very important to him, okay? It was the whole reason behind our merger. It\u2019s at the core of all of the issues that we even had.\tAmanda: And look where that led.\tLily: Okay, look, I get it. But we are finally back on track. We are. And now that the lawsuit is over, maybe now we can start to rebuild our bond that we had, maybe even work together again. I mean, it\u2019s the first time i feel hope for us.\tTucker: Oh, ashley, you know that I\u2019m not gonna take no for an answer. Look how things have gone since I\u2019ve been back.\tAshley: You mean when you landed your helicopter in my backyard? How did that turn out for you, by the way?\tTucker: Okay, but did I give up on my plans? No, I did not. I came right back with a sentimental gift from our past.\tAshley: Which I dumped in the trash immediately.\tTucker: And, again, I was undeterred.\tAshley: Mm-hmm.\tTucker: So, I came up with a brilliant idea for the romantic picnic in the park.\tAshley: In the dead of winter.\tTucker: Yes, but I fed you your favorite delicacies, along with some, um \u2014 you know, some flavorful intel on stark and diane.\tAshley: Oh. Oh, you\u2019re right. That was beautifully incriminating and tied up in a nice, little bow. It was very romantic.\tTucker: I know. And then I offered to set you up with your own company, which I believe was quite an aphrodisiac for you because\u2026 I believe you remember what happened after that.\tAshley: Oh, I sure do. It led to me finding out that you lied to me about your true intentions regarding jabot, and I left the country.\tTucker: Yeah, that was a slight misstep, but a well-intentioned one, you have to admit. And then I gave up control of my company to you.\tAshley: I bought your debt for one goal only, and that was to own you completely.\tTucker: It\u2019s so funny. I-I actually like the sound of that. So, what do you say? Let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s make the tie that binds us a matrimonial one.\tAshley: You just never stop.\tTucker: Now, I understand why you\u2019re hesitant, so why don\u2019t we take it in stages?\tAshley: What does that mean, stages?\tTucker: Well, for now, we could just consider it a \u2014 a game, a fun ploy, no actual commitment. But publicly, we would announce the engagement.\tAshley: Oh, I think I see where you\u2019re going with this. So, you want to steal jack and diane\u2019s thunder. They would hate that so much.\tTucker: Yeah.\tAshley: Hmm. My a1c stayed here, it needed to be here.\tChance: Alright, diane, here\u2019s what I need you to do. I need you to explain to me exactly what happened and then leave it for me to judge the veracity of stark\u2019s claim. You got it? So, once again, did you two have some sort of altercation where you threatened her life?\tDiane: Phyllis lured me up to her room under false pretenses. She claimed that kyle was really sick and \u2014 and that he was asking for me. And supposedly he was laid out in her suite upstairs.\tChance: And you believed her?\tDiane: Well, I texted kyle to verify, but he didn\u2019t respond.\t", "Kyle: I left my phone at the bar and didn\u2019t realize till later. That\u2019s why I missed her text.\tChance: So you went up to the room?\tDiane: Yes, of course I did. I was concerned about my son. But then phyllis followed me in there and \u2014 and trapped me.\tChance: And there was a physical altercation?\tDiane: Yes, but she provoked it. She \u2014 she came at me and then she pushed me down. And then she started unleashing all these horrendous accusations. I mean, she lost it. She said that I had wronged her in every possible way and that i had ruined her life and \u2014 look, this had been building for months, and I just \u2014 I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, so I responded.\tChance: In what way?\tDiane: [ Sighs ] Any negative comments that i might have made were done in the heat of the moment. I wasn\u2019t seriously threatening her.\tChance: Alright, during your scuffle, did she hit her head?\tDiane: No.\tChance: Any kind of injury?\tDiane: No.\tJack: Detective, is this really necessary? We are not the criminals here.\tChance: Hold on, jack. There\u2019s no need to be so defensive. I\u2019m just sorting out the facts.\tJack: I am hardly being defensive. I just think our focus needs to be on phyllis and how she is doing.\tElena: Maybe we should call the hospital and see if there\u2019s an update.\tJack: If there are any questions you have, I suggest you address them to stark. That is the big mystery tonight, how in a million years phyllis would marry a man like that. I\u2019d like some answers. I\u2019d like them now.\tTucker: You think jack hides the good scotch when he knows I\u2019m gonna be around?\tAshley: How could he know that you were coming over? You don\u2019t even know when you\u2019re coming over. That makes no sense.\tTucker: Gee, lady, you got yourself a big brain.\tAshley: I do. Thank you. Nope.\tTucker: You like my idea, though, don\u2019t you?\tAshley: Mm, well\u2026 I \u2014 I find it intriguing.\tTucker: Mm-hmm. It\u2019s because you want to see the look on diane\u2019s face when she finds out the news of our impending marriage.\tAshley: Mm, it would be gratifying on so many levels. It would be. I\u2019ll think about it.\tTucker: Fair enough.\tAshley: But your work is far from done.\tTucker: Meaning?\tAshley: Meaning you have to get devon to buy mccall. As owner of your debt, I have a vested interest in this coming to fruition.\tTucker: Yeah. So you\u2019ve said.\tAshley: Yes. And I also do not want the newmans to get their dirty, little hands on it.\tTucker: I\u2019m working on it.\tJeremy: Why is my relationship with phyllis so hard for you to understand, jack? We\u2019re kindred spirits, both on the outside, taking on all comers, giving as good as we get. A woman like that deserves respect and support. Seems like once upon a time you knew about that, but then you forgot.\tJack: Why aren\u2019t you at the hospital with your wife right now?\tJeremy: There\u2019s no other place I\u2019d rather be right now, but I was under the impression i was being questioned by the police.\tChance: Well, there\u2019s not an official investigation yet, so you are free to go. But I would recommend that you don\u2019t leave town.\tKyle: Summer, what are you doing back here? How\u2019s phyllis?\tJack: Is she okay? Has she already been released?\tSummer: No, that\u2019s what we came to tell you. The ambulance never arrived at the hospital.\tJack: What do you mean? What are you saying?\tSummer: Memorial dispatch lost contact with the driver. We have no idea where our mom is.\tSometimes, the lows\tof bipolar depression\tJack: I thought you were following the ambulance to the hospital.\tDaniel: When we got out to my car, the ambulance was already gone. So, we went straight to the hospital.\tSummer: And the ambulance wasn\u2019t there. There was no sign of mom. She hadn\u2019t been admitted or anything.\tKyle: None of this is making any sense.\tSummer: I know, especially since the dispatcher has no idea what happened to their vehicle.\tKyle: Something is definitely wrong here.\tSummer: Dad is at the hospital in case the ambulance does show up, but we didn\u2019t feel like we could just sit there helpless.\tDaniel: I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here, but if our mom is in danger, then we need your help. Can you find out where she is?\tSummer: Chance, please. Something is seriously wrong. We need to know that she\u2019s okay.\tDanny: Son, is there anything I could do to help?\tDaniel: If I could think of anything, I\u2019d say yes. But it\u2019s like summer said. We both just feel a little helpless right now.\tJack: Alright, stark. What the hell is going on?\tElena: The whole thing is strange. One minute she\u2019s fine, then she\u2019s slurring her words, and then she\u2019s laid out on the floor.\tNate: Something caused a syncopal episode like that \u2014 loss of oxygen to the brain, sudden drop in a heart rate or blood pressure, something neurological.\tElena: You always think it\u2019s neurological, but with those symptoms, it could be anything. It could be a heart attack, dehydration.\tNate: Stroke, tia. Seizure, even. She hasn\u2019t had an accident or injury or a blow to the chest or head that we know of.\tElena: Yeah, I\u2019m really interested to see her cat scan and mri results. Maybe I\u2019ll call the hospital and see if there\u2019s any updates.\tNate: Yeah. I\u2019m sure her family would appreciate that.\tAudra: Interesting, isn\u2019t it?\tVictoria: What\u2019s that?\tAudra: The two of them \u2014 I think I can finally see the spark they share. Well, I think I\u2019m going to call it a night. Looks like my boss has his hands full.\tVictoria: I will see you tomorrow morning at the office. I\u2019m going to go check on nate.\tAudra: Of course. And, by the way, I hope to have an exciting new, project to present to you soon.\tVictoria: I look forward to hearing about it.\tAmanda: Lily, I\u2019m sorry. I know that there is still tension between you and your cousin, but I really need to go over and get an update.\t", "Lily: No, of course. Please.\tAmanda: Nate, elena, hey, I\u2019m really sorry to interrupt. I was just wondering if there was any word on phyllis.\tElena: I actually just got off the phone with memorial. They said she hasn\u2019t been brought in yet.\tAmanda: The ambulance hasn\u2019t arrived yet?\tAbby: So, they took phyllis to memorial?\tDevon: Yeah. They sure did. And it was lucky that nate and elena were there to help out until the paramedics got there.\tAbby: Wait. Did phyllis make this big scene before or after my uncle jack\u2019s engagement announcement?\tDevon: I don\u2019t know. I think it happened at the same time.\tAbby: How do you not know?\tDevon: Because I wasn\u2019t there for jack\u2019s announcement. I was still talking to amanda.\tAbby: Uh-huh. Well, how did your conversation with amanda go?\tDevon: We kept it civil for the most part, even though she has every reason to resent me.\tAbby: To resent both of us.\tDevon: Mostly just talked about business and lily and i figuring things out.\tAbby: How did she feel about you dropping the suit against chancellor-winters?\tDevon: Oh, she was skeptical about that because she doesn\u2019t really trust me these days for some reason.\tAbby: Um, maybe amanda\u2019s onto something.\tDevon: What do you mean?\tAbby: Look, I love the idea of you dropping the suit, but are you sure this is really what you want? Or are you just doing it out of some sense of guilt and obligation to lily? Because it\u2019s a huge reversal after fighting so hard to get your company back.\tDevon: No, I know it is. I know it is. But something shifted in me tonight that took away all that guilt that I was feeling. And it\u2019s because of you. Oh\t\u201cThe young and the restless\u201d\twill continue.\tAshley: I need more from you than \u201cI\u2019m working on it.\u201d\tTucker: What would you have me do?\tAshley: More than you\u2019ve done. If you\u2019re already stymied by devon not buying mccall, then you\u2019ve lost your killer instinct. And I don\u2019t like that at all.\tTucker: I thought it was my killer instinct you want me to let go of.\tAshley: True. I would prefer a kinder, more gentle tucker.\tTucker: But only when it suits you.\tAshley: Exactly. And right now, I want devon to buy mccall, and I want you to make it happen. I mean, that\u2019s the only way there\u2019s going to be a future for us, even if it\u2019s just a pretend future. A game, if you will.\tTucker: You know what, ashley? I realize you\u2019re enjoying this power you have over me right now, but I know that you feel the chemistry between us. I know that you\u2019d like to say, \u201coh, it\u2019s just a game. It\u2019s just a ploy.\u201d But you know there\u2019s something deeper. You feel there\u2019s something deeper, but you\u2019re so scared to admit it.\tAshley: What makes you so sure?\tTucker: Because you wouldn\u2019t be all interested in me becoming a \u201cbetter\u201d man if it weren\u2019t true.\tAshley: As long as I have the upper hand, you can think whatever you want. I mean, you know what they say. Whatever gets you through the night.\tAbby: I helped ease your guilt?\tDevon: Mm-hmm.\tAbby: I\u2019m glad. But how?\tDevon: Well, because you reminded me of what the most important thing on earth is.\tAbby: Family.\tDevon: Yes, exactly. And that was \u2014 that was the main reason for the chancellor-winters\u2019 merger to begin with, you know? But lately, we\u2019ve been using the whole family thing against each other and making accusations that we don\u2019t care about our relationship as brother and sister or neil\u2019s legacy.\tAbby: You both knew that wasn\u2019t true.\tDevon: Yeah, I mean, sure, we both knew it deep down. But, you know, when you\u2019re in the middle of everything, it\u2019s easy to forget. I was trying to use my connection to neil to break away. But it was our shared connection to our dad that brought us back together. And it\u2019s really all because of that amazing gesture that you helped present to us that made us realize that.\tAbby: Well, the timing couldn\u2019t have been more perfect.\tDevon: No, it couldn\u2019t have. It really couldn\u2019t have. A place like that that embodies neil\u2019s love for jazz was such a special way to honor him and to give back to him. That\u2019s what lily and I found common ground on and made me realize that maybe we can work things out together.\tAbby: Wow. It sounds like you\u2019re considering working with lily at chancellor-winters again. But what about your other family business? What about mccall?\tNikki: After all the work we put in to make this event perfect \u2014 first, jack\u2019s misguided announcement and then phyllis\u2019 bizarre rant. I have to say, at first I did think she was drunk.\tMichael: That\u2019s what most of us thought.\tDanny: How can an ambulance just disappear?\tLauren: Look. Phyllis is queen of making a big scene. But tonight, something was terribly wrong.\tMichael: Stark\u2019s involvement makes the whole situation a glaring red flag. The gcpd is our best bet at this point. They can track down the ambulance, see what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m more concerned about why phyllis collapsed in the first place.\tLeanna: Oh, wow. This could actually be the story I\u2019ve been looking for.\tSharon: Not every crisis needs to become gossip fodder, leanna.\tLeanna: Sharon, this is more than gossip. It\u2019s news. This could be a huge story.\tSharon: I just hope that phyllis is alright.\tLeanna: Oh, my gosh. Yes, of course. That\u2019s what matters most. Life\u2026 doesn\u2019t stop for diabetes.\tTucker: Well, i guess I should get going. I don\u2019t suppose you want to be up when jack and diane return.\tAshley: On the contrary, i plan on staying awake and giving them hell when they walk through that door.\tTucker: Well, I find that irresistibly sexy.\tAshley: I\u2019m sure you do.\t", "Jack: Take your lies and get the hell out of here, stark. Phyllis, the woman you claim to have married, was just taken out in an ambulance, and all you can seem to do is stand here and throw around accusations.\tJeremy: I\u2019m not claiming anything, jack. I have a marriage license here, dated three days ago.\tMichael: Excuse me. Looks like phyllis is mrs. Jeremy stark.\tJack: Wait, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s ridiculous. Why would phyllis marry a known criminal? This is insane.\tJeremy: You want to know why she married me? You, diane, and many of the fine, upstanding citizens of genoa city has pushed phyllis to a new low. You pushed us to find each other.\tJack: Wow, you are a piece of work. You know that? You got a lot of nerve taking advantage of phyllis\u2019 condition. What the hell is wrong with you?\tJeremy: You don\u2019t like that I\u2019m married to phyllis? Too bad. It\u2019s your fault. All of you! Especially you.\tKyle: Hey, I have warned you. Don\u2019t point your finger at my mother.\tNikki: Time for you to go, mr. Stark.\tJeremy: Phyllis was scared. She was seeking comfort and protection. And I was more than willing to provide it.\tJack: Protection from what?\tJeremy: From her.\tDiane: How dare you imply that I had anything to do with phyllis\u2019 collapse.\tJeremy: All I know is you wanted to cause my wife harm. Tonight, she threatened her with violence, and now she\u2019s on her way to the hospital.\tChance: Those are some heavy accusations. Can you prove it?\tAshley: Marry you?\t[ Laughs ]\tTucker: That\u2019s not the reaction I was hoping for.\tAshley: You can\u2019t be serious. Oh, come on.\tTucker: No, to me, it seems like the next natural step for us.\tAshley: Oh, of course! We went out on a date, and the natural next step would be to plan a wedding. Sure.\tTucker: Well, it wouldn\u2019t have to be a fancy wedding. We could elope.\tAshley: Right. Yeah. No. See, I think what happened to you is that jack announced his engagement to diane, and it went to your \u2014 your brain. You\u2019re temporarily insane. Thank you. But, no, I will not marry you.\t[ Chuckles ] Great.\tAmanda: Phyllis just collapsed. It just\u2026 it doesn\u2019t make any sense.\tLily: I know. I know. Look, we\u2019ll get an explanation, I\u2019m sure. Daniel\u2019s gonna give me an update from the hospital.\tAmanda: The waiting\u2026 I think that is the part that I hate the most. Seconds feel like hours. You ask the nurse and then you ask the doctor and then you wait some more and\u2026 I know that this is not helping. I just\u2026 I have been through way too much of this with my family and \u2014\tLily: I know. Hey, I get it. I do. I know when someone you love is sick or injured, you feel helpless, and it\u2019s a horrible feeling. I know.\tAmanda: Yeah, but it\u2019s not just that. This news that phyllis is married to this stark man? I mean, how did I miss something so big in my best friend\u2019s life? I didn\u2019t know anything about it. She didn\u2019t call me. She didn\u2019t \u2014 nothing! And then \u2014 and then this?\tLily: I know. Look, we just have to be thankful that nate and elena were there before the paramedics arrived.\tAmanda: Yeah, well, thank god for that.\tLily: All we can do is just pray and just wait to hear back from daniel.\tAmanda: The waiting is\u2026\tLily: I know.\tAmanda: I really hate the waiting.\tLily: I know. I know.\tAmanda: [ Breathes deeply ]\tDevon: Hey.\tAbby: You\u2019re back. I just checked on dominic. He is sound asleep.\tDevon: Yeah?\tAbby: Mm-hmm. Mwah!\tDevon: Not a care in the world for him.\tAbby: Not a care in the world, right? It must be nice.\tDevon: Yeah.\tAbby: Well, I have been anxiously waiting to hear how everything went with amanda. I got to say, I was very relieved that chance did not show up at the gala tonight. I did not want another awkward interaction with him. Although, uh, nina sure let me have it. She had some choice words for me, which brought back this feeling of guilt, which\u2026 I\u2019m not gonna talk about right now because I want to know how everything went after I left.\tDevon: No, that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s \u2014 everything got out of control after you left.\tAbby: I mean, amanda has every right to be upset, but there\u2019s got to be a way for the two of you to make peace.\tDevon: Oh, it had nothing to do with amanda. It was the rest of the gala.\tAbby: Did something happen?\tDevon: Yeah. Jack and diane announced that they\u2019re engaged, and then phyllis collapsed.\tAbby: [ Sighs ]\tJeremy: It\u2019s good that you finally showed up, detective.\tChance: Yeah, I was on a stakeout on the other side of town. Got a hot tip about a car theft, but it turned out to be a dud. It\u2019s almost like somebody didn\u2019t want me to be here tonight.\tJeremy: Well, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here because we need some law and order after what happened.\tChance: Yeah, I\u2019ve been brought up to speed on what happened. I\u2019m gonna need statements from everybody. Now, stark, can you prove that diane wanted to harm phyllis?\tJeremy: All of the tension from the last few months, all of the verbal attacks and threats from diane towards phyllis.\tDiane: What?\tJeremy: It all happened upstairs in phyllis\u2019 suite. She told me after the fact, but I believe that kyle, summer, and jack witnessed the whole thing. Isn\u2019t that right, jack? And I believe that you said something like, \u201cI should do the world a favor and strangle her to death.\u201d Did I get that right? Phyllis said diane said the exact thing to her.

I feel so used.\tAudra: Listen, I like pillow talk as much as the next girl, okay? Tonight, however\u2013\tKyle: Your mind is on work.\tAudra: Yes.\tKyle: I get it.\tAudra: Look, if I misled you in any way, I\u2013\tKyle: No, no, not at all.

You can do that. After we shower.\tKyle: Ooh, I think that\u2019s one hell of a great idea.\tNick: I mean, I\u2019m sorry, you are struggling with this. I cannot believe your mother faked her own death and has put you and Daniel through this. You don\u2019t deserve it. Where is she now?\tSummer: I don\u2019t know. She won\u2019t say. She\u2019s trying to protect me and Daniel, and herself.\tNick: Yeah, probably more herself.\t[ Summer sighing ]\tSummer: She did offer to turn herself in if it would save my marriage, but\u2013 but I couldn\u2019t let her do that. And it wouldn\u2019t have helped anyway. We need to keep searching for a way for her to come home without being arrested for Stark\u2019s murder.

Uh, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m grateful that your mother\u2019s still alive.\tSummer: Only now you could kill her?\tNick: My feelings are complicated. I cannot understand why she\u2019s making you feel responsible for solving problems that she created.\tSummer: What else is new? Though, if I\u2019m being fair, and if we\u2019re being fair to her, a lot of this is Stark\u2019s fault. And not to mention the fact that Diane faked her death and tried to pin it on other people and it never caught up to her, so I know mom\u2019s logic was really, really screwy, but I do see that there was some justice to it.\tNick: Sweetheart, I know you love your mother, but we\u2019re also talking about Kyle\u2019s mother.\t[ Summer sighing ]\tSummer: You\u2019re right. I tried to protect my mom.

And yet, god help me, I adore her.\t[ Lauren chuckling ]\tMichael: Yeah. Likewise.\tLauren: What do you think it would take for Phyllis to turn over a new leaf, huh?\tSummer: When we thought Mom was dead, I\u2013 I couldn\u2019t even stand to be in the same room as Kyle. He kept on shielding Diane and he\u2013 he wouldn\u2019t even accept the possibility that his mom had murdered mine. And\u2013 and it made me so angry. But then suddenly there was mom. And she had killed Stark, and she was asking me not to tell anyone that she was alive.\tNick: Including Kyle.\tSummer: Especially Kyle. Because of course he would have gone straight to the police. And\u2013 and Mom needed time to be able to prove that it was self-defense. And I went along with it. I froze Kyle out to protect mom, even though it meant prolonging his mom\u2019s suffering. And I\u2013 I knew that it was horrible even when I was doing it. But I just\u2013 I couldn\u2019t risk anybody finding out the truth before she\u2019d come up with a plausible defense.\tNick: And the longer this dragged on, the more distance it created between you and Kyle.\tSummer: [ Sighing ] Dad, it was such a disaster. Kyle was so upset that Diane was in jail, and there I was, and I had information that could have gotten her out and I didn\u2019t do that. I put Mom first. I put her ahead of Kyle\u2019s feelings. Ahead of our marriage, and\u2026 ahead of what I knew was right. But I had convinced myself that\u2013 that I didn\u2019t have a choice, that I\u2013 I had to do what I did. He won\u2019t even look at me now and I\u2013 I don\u2019t know what to do. God.

Tell me everything.\t[ Audra moaning ]\tMichael: I laid out a scenario for what Phyllis could expect, legally speaking, if she were to surrender.\tLauren: With you representing her?\tMichael: That would be the plan.\tLauren: Can you keep her out of prison?\t[ Michael sighing ]\tMichael: There are no guarantees.\tLauren: I knew you were gonna say that.\tMichael: Look, her best shot is to come in from the cold and at least let me try.\tLauren: But she has to be terrified to come all the way back here and then wind up in a cell.\tMichael: Well, she is, but her only other option is equally grim.\tLauren: Right. Looking over her shoulder, the rest of her life is no choice.\tMichael: Or she could put her faith in me, which seems a no-brainer.\tLauren: Honey, she\u2019s scared.\tMichael: As well she should be. Do you know what she told me? \u201cLet me think about it.\u201d Before she ate the last strawberry and vamoosed. Now, all I can do is, wait. Wait!\tLauren: I hope she makes the right choice because I really miss my friend.\tMichael: Me too. You know, I\u2019ve known Phyllis has been alive for a while, but seeing her in person\u2026\tLauren: How did she seem? I mean, she\u2019s been through so much.\tMichael: That\u2019s exactly what you said. She\u2019s worried and afraid and hiding behind a big old wall of bravado.\tLauren: Hm. That\u2019s our Phyllis.\tMichael: It was incredible to see her, but at the same time, uh, it was heartbreaking.\tLauren: I wish I could go back in time and just talk her out of that insane scheme.\tMichael: No, no, no, listen to me. Phyllis got herself into that jam, and I intend to get her out of it, but she\u2019s gonna have to at least pay for some of her crimes. And her life will never be the same.\tLauren: Don\u2019t be so sure. Diane played dead for many years. Came back and look at her life now.\t[ Diane chuckling ]\tDiane: Another toast? How many is that?\tJack: I\u2019ve lost count.\t[ Diane chuckling ]\tDiane: That\u2019s my favorite number.\tJack: To your resilience. No matter what life throws you, you never let it keep you down.\tDiane: I\u2019ll drink to that.\tJack: I mean that. I really do admire that you have your problems like anyone else, your insecurities, your worries, your frustrations. You never let it derail you. Not Ashley\u2019s resistance and ugliness, not Phyllis eluding the law after the abominable things she did to you.\tDiane: Well, one thing that does worry me is that Kyle came here to sleep to get even farther away from Summer, it\u2013 it hurts my heart.\tJack: Yeah, mine too.\tDiane: Yeah. But still, you and I had some steep mountains to climb to get to this point and I\u2013 you know, I have to hope that things will work out for them, too.\tJack: I really believe they will. But they may have to learn the hard way about love and forgiveness.\tDiane: You know, we\u2019re lucky, Jack. One good thing about getting older is that we\u2019ve been around long enough to know that struggle is just a part of life.\tJack: Thinking about the kids again?\tDiane: Yeah. You know, you take the bad with the good and you cherish what you have when you have it. It\u2019s a lesson I failed to learn \u2019til I had lost everything. Or I should say I threw it away with both hands, but I was\u2013 I was younger then, I\u2013 I made a lot of mistakes.\tJack: Didn\u2019t we all?\tDiane: Yeah. But having you back in my life, it, uh, it makes me want to be better. To\u2013 to be a better person. I mean, I\u2019m so grateful for every moment that we have and I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m not taking any of it for granted.\tJack: I think luck, I think fate play a part in all of this. How lucky we are that life brought us back together when we could really be partners.\tDiane: Yeah. I\u2019ll try not to ruin things this time.\t[ Diane chuckling ]\tJack: No, I think we are both walking into this marriage with our eyes wide open. You are not perfect.

In the meantime, I have so enjoyed this celebration of your new position.\tDiane: Jack, I have so much to be thankful for, all at once.

I promise, together, you and I are unstoppable.\t[ Diane chuckling ]\tDiane: Yeah.\t[ Michael sharply exhaling ]\tLauren: Is something the matter?\tMichael: No, no, no, no.

Oh, my god. How\u2013 how was she? How did she seem?\tMichael: Oh, you know, same old Phyllis. She was wearing a trench coat and dark glasses to avoid being recognized.\tLauren: I would\u2019ve given anything to see her. Oh, my god. It must have been just so surreal.\tMichael: Well, that\u2019s one word for it. Behold, behold.\tLauren: What?\tMichael: What your best pal walked in on, not to mention, myself, barely clothed.\t[ Lauren laughing ]\tLauren: This is so romantic. The candles, the flowers, and ooh, look at this. My favorite Champagne. You put a lot of effort into this.\tMichael: You are so worth it.\tLauren: Ah, and then Phyllis crashes this?\tMichael: Yeah. Where she wiped out an entire platter of chocolate-covered strawberries.\t[ Lauren chuckling ] Uh, well, you must get an appetite running away from the law.\tLauren: Yes, and look, I really want to partake in all of this, but come here. First, I want to hear everything that you and Phyllis talked about.\t[ Michael chuckling ]\tLauren: Have you figured out a way for her to come home without her life being wrecked?\tSummer: Kyle. Kyle! [ Sighing ] Where is he?\t[ Summer sighing ]\tKyle: We\u2019re completely in sync. Just proof we were meant to be. And everything we went through in the past, breaking up, getting back together again, breaking up again.\tKyle: It\u2019s just proof that once we finally made it permanent, we were destined to last forever.\n\n[phone chimes]\tPhyllis: (via text) Spoke with Michael.

Like, I get it. No pressure from me.\tKyle: I don\u2019t want to go home. From the very first touch,\t[ Summer sighing ]\tNick: This a good time? I\u2019ll take that as a yes.\tSummer: Dad, how are you after everything that happened?\tNick: Oh. You mean with Cameron Kirsten? How\u2019d you hear about that?\tSummer: Faith told me when she was letting me know that she was headed back to Michigan. Oh, my god, it\u2019s horrible. Look, I know that this might sound bad, but I\u2019m glad that he\u2019s dead.\tNick: That\u2019s not bad at all. Cameron meant business. He was determined to take out as many of us as possible.\tSummer: In a sewer? I\u2013\tNick: It\u2019s just like his mind. Sitting over in that cell, rotting away, obsessing about Sharon. I guess he thought this would bring things full circle.\tSummer: Are Sharon and Faith really okay?\tNick: They\u2019re doing the best they can considering the traumatic experience they went through.\tSummer: It\u2019s so scary. I mean, if that had happened to Harrison I\u2019d\u2013\tNick: Summer, listen, we\u2019re dealing with it, all right? We\u2019re all tough. We\u2019re determined to get through it.\tSummer: How\u2019s everything else? You okay?\tNick: I don\u2019t know if you heard this or not, but I\u2019m taking some time away from Newman Enterprises. It\u2019s not my call, but with everything that\u2019s happened, maybe it\u2019s for the best. Also, Sally lost the baby.\tSummer: Dad, when?\tNick: The day Faith got kidnapped. Adam was with her. I didn\u2019t even know about it until after it happened.\tSummer: That is so awful.

You are remembered by the rules that you break.\tMichael: Who said that?\tLauren: MacArthur. And he should know.\u00a0 And I have no doubt that you\u2019re going to help Phyllis.\tMichael: No, I\u2013I intend to as long as she doesn\u2019t disappear on me, but she\u2019s gonna have to meet me halfway.\tLauren: And what does that look like?\tMichael: Phyllis is gonna have to temper her expectations. Even if\u2013if I get rid of the murder rap,\u00a0 she\u2019s still facing a boatload of charges. And there are gonna be repercussions.\u00a0 It\u2019s absurd to think otherwise.\tLauren: Well, if anyone, anyone can get through to her,\u00a0 it\u2019s you.\u00a0 I have faith.\tMichael: Oh. Oh, I see what you\u2019re doing. You make it sound like flattery, but that\u2019s a challenge.\tLauren: [ Laughing] Well, then consider the gauntlet thrown. You know what? Forget about that.\u00a0 Forget about Phyllis, forget about everything, except the two of us in our own private oasis.\u00a0 I\u2019m so proud of you. And I love you so much.

And Kyle, I am\u2013 I am so sorry for my lapse in judgment earlier.\u00a0 I shouldn\u2019t have exaggerated how upset he was. I just\u2013 I just wanted to bring you and Summer closer together, and I know it wasn\u2019t my place, and I shouldn\u2019t have done it. And I promise you I will never do it again.\tKyle: Mom, I don\u2019t want to discuss this right now.\u00a0 See you at the house.\tJack: He seem a little off to you?\tDiane: Off how?\tJack:\u00a0 I don\u2019t know, out of sorts, a little nervous.\tDiane: He seems exhausted, but he is under a lot of stress, Jack.\tJack: Yeah, you\u2019re right. I\u2019m making too much of it.\tDiane: Yeah, I just hate seeing him like this. I wish there was something I could do to help, but apparently what I did made things worse.\tJack: I think our son had a good idea that we should table all of this right now. Besides, I want to leave on a high from our incredible evening together.\tDiane: Okay. That works.\tAudra: \u201cKyle Abbott named CEO of Marchetti as Jabot acquires legendary Italian couturier.\u201d Hmm. Oh, nice pic.\tNick: Feel better?\tSummer: No. [ Sighing ] Okay, a little.

I don\u2019t know where I got that from.\tNick: Yeah, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a mystery.\tSummer: [ Chuckling ] Look\u2026 Uh, I\u2019m sorry that I didn\u2019t come to you sooner.\u00a0 Like you said, if I had, maybe I wouldn\u2019t even be in this fix, but I could be in a whole different fix entirely. One that wouldn\u2019t be so destructive. [ Chuckling]\tNick: [ Clicks tongue] I get it.\u00a0 Your mom can be very convincing. And she\u2019s not above really slathering on the guilt, especially when it suits her.\u00a0 But that\u2019s why I think eventually Kyle\u2019s gonna\u00a0 come around because he understands\u00a0 how your mom likes to manipulate everyone.\tSummer: Don\u2019t we all?\tNick: As far as coming to me sooner, don\u2019t worry about it.

Yeah. It, um, it helped, but I realized staying away from the house isn\u2019t going to solve anything. I want to be near Harrison when he wakes up.\tJack: Everyone needs to get away sometimes.\tMichael: What would it take to rehabilitate Phyllis?\t[ Lauren laughing ]\tLauren: Can people change that much?\tMichael: Hmm. I did. Prison helped.\tLauren: Yeah, but with Phyllis, she\u2019s been there, done that. I mean, even hitting rock bottom didn\u2019t exactly have an effect on her.\tMichael: Well, maybe that\u2019s the answer, in the end. You know, Phyllis is Phyllis. Maybe there\u2019s no saving the woman.\tLauren: You don\u2019t believe that. And neither do I. Of course, people can evolve.\tMichael: People, yes. But Phyllis\u2026\tLauren: Well\u2026 [ Lauren clicking her tongue ] \u2026If she wanted something badly enough, maybe it\u2019s just finding the right motivation.\tNick: Summer, I understand why you\u2019re worried this rift between you and Kyle is permanent, but I really believe you can get through it if it\u2019s something you both want.\tSummer: That\u2019s the thing. He\u2019s so mad at me that I\u2013 I don\u2019t think that Kyle wants to fix this. This might really be the end for us.\tNick: I wish I had the, uh, just the right words that would help you feel more hopeful.\t[ Summer sighing ]\tSummer: It\u2019s okay. God, my stomach is in knots. My brain keeps telling me to fight for my family, but I just feel so lost right now.\tNick: I\u2019m sorry Phyllis put this in motion. She was asking far too much of you.\tSummer: Right, but I could have said no. And I did. I told her that it was horrible of her to put me in this position. All because she hates Diane, I\u2013\tNick: And what did she say to that?\tSummer: That I was right to resent her. That she felt awful. But she couldn\u2019t handle being locked up and I couldn\u2019t handle her going on the run. It would have been like she died all over again.\tNick: I wish you\u2019d come to me sooner so I could help.\tSummer: Yeah, I really wish that I had too, but once I confided in Daniel and he started telling everybody, it just\u2013 it unraveled so quickly. [ Summer sighing ] I know that Mom is Stark\u2019s victim\u2026 but I cannot help but hold her responsible for this mess.\tNick: As well you should.\tSummer: You know, I really wish that I could just be happy that Mom was alive. I really do. But everything with Kyle is so bad and it\u2019s just getting worse and it\u2019s all because she has this grudge against Diane. I mean, I am so stupid. I should\u2019ve never agreed to keep this secret. It\u2019s come with too high of a price.\tNick: Look, I know you love your mother, but there\u2019s always a trade-off with her.\u00a0 [ Nick sighing ] I mean, she is a cyclone. She mows down everything in her path.\tSummer: Including my marriage, apparently. I\u2013 I seriously don\u2019t know if Kyle\u2019s ever gonna forgive me or if this separation is gonna turn into a divorce. [ Summer sighing ] And the worst part is after all of this\u2013 after all of this, we don\u2019t\u2013 we don\u2019t even have a way to bring Mom home without her being arrested for Stark\u2019s murder. So I just\u2013 I feel like I\u2019ve already lost them both. God. I\u2019m just scared that no matter how much I try, there\u2019s\u2013 there\u2019s really not a way for me to make this right.

Well, everyone\u2019s gonna tell you that it\u2019s magical and it\u2019s intense, which is true. It is. Right, \u2019cause all of a sudden you have this human that you\u2019re responsible for. To keep them happy and healthy, but you will also experience a love that you couldn\u2019t imagine. And all you want to do is just protect them from the world because you know what it\u2019s like out there.

That phyllis still walks among us?\tChance: They got some complicated family dynamics at play right now. And after trauma like that, there is no normal, not for a while anyways.\tChristine: So, what\u2019s the latest?\tChance: So, I went to stark\u2019s last known residence, a motel room where he was using an alias.\tChristine: Oh, wait, please say that he left something in that room that we can use in court.\tChance: Nothing. I couldn\u2019t get confirmation that the shower curtain was missing. A lot of the cleaning crew turn over there, but the shower curtains they have are the same type, same brand that stark\u2019s body was wrapped in.\tChristine: So really nothing.\tChance: Not exactly.

You were\u2013 you were there. You\u2013 you saw what losing you did to us.\tPhyllis: I needed to know.\tSummer: You needed to know what? That your plan to make us suffer was a success?\tPhyllis: No. No, I needed to see how my children felt about me. I needed to know that, summer. And I saw how much pain you were in. But I knew you had something up your sleeve because you had it at the jazz lounge. So, I knew you were working something and you were fierce. You were amazing. And you had diane on a hook and you kept on pushing and you didn\u2019t let her go. And you pushed her to the breaking point.\tSummer: Yeah.

Look at you, you\u2019re a C.E.O. And a mom, a wife. Oh, and you are stronger and more fierce than you ever were, aren\u2019t you?\tSummer: Turns out helping your dead mother stay one step ahead of the police counts as cardio.\tPhyllis: Okay. You\u2019ve been through a lot the last few months.\tSummer: Ever since italy, it feels like I\u2019ve been to hell and back.\tPhyllis: I\u2019m sorry, I hate this. This is my fault.

I mean, all the things that we said to each other? My god, the things that I have said to diane, I\u2013 I thought that you were gone forever. I\u2013 I thought that you were dead in this horrific way. I\u2013\tPhyllis: I know, I\u2019m sorry. You\u2013 you didn\u2019t even get a chance to sort of work it out and move on, did you?

I don\u2019t know how to act. I mean, yes, you\u2019re alive, but I\u2019ve got to keep it a secret. You can\u2019t even leave this hotel room without being caught and prosecuted. There\u2019s so many people out there that are still mourning your loss. I mean, you\u2019ve turned our whole lives upside down.\tPhyllis: I know, that\u2019s what I do.

And then, I had the nerve to attempt a relationship with adam. And even though I put newman media on the path to success, now that I am pregnant with the newest newman, they\u2019ve probably decided that I\u2019m just going to use her as my meal ticket.\tChloe: Yeah, but it\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to invest in the company and then go tell his family that he did. I mean, they would never know.\tSally: But I would.\tChloe: He wants to give you this money because you\u2019re good and because he believes in you.\tSally: I just don\u2019t want to take advantage of my relationship with nick.\tChloe: Because of the baby?\tSally: Well, yes. Yeah.

I mean, well kind of, I am. I look, I am so happy that one of you geniuses finally figured it out and spoke up the truth.\tSally: Oh, has it just been awful?\tChloe: Yeah, it\u2019s been brutal. I mean, I\u2019ve just been, like sitting there quietly just rooting for you guys. I mean, the amount of hours that I have spent talking to kevin about you and how I could just make love happen.\tSally: You\u2019re a very dedicated partner and a loyal friend.

Are you breaking up with me?\tSally: Look, I love you too much to just keep disappointing you.\tChloe: Wait\u2013 wait, are you saying this because we\u2019ve been let down yet again? I mean, come on, I\u2019m not just gonna scurry off because of that. I\u2019m sorry, but I am made of much sterner stuff than that my friend.\tSally: So you\u2019re still in?\tChloe: We\u2019re a team.\tSally: Even though I won\u2019t take nick\u2019s offer.\tChloe: We don\u2019t need it. We have something way more valuable than nick newman\u2019s money.\tSally: Well, I\u2019m dying to hear what this is.\tChloe: We have talent, tenacity, and a brilliant business plan. Jill loved it. I mean, that was before her budget came up and bit her on the bottom line.\tSally: So, our mission is to find someone who is visionary enough to hire us even though we have no track record?\tChloe: Fall in love with us, sight unseen.\tSally: Or we give an old option something new to see.\tLily: Hm.

Now, he\u2019s disappeared.\tHow sure are the police that victor has trina?\tAll I know is, I was at josslyn\u2019s dorm when dante showed up, and he wanted to ask trina some questions. Then we all realized that no one had seen trina since the nurses\u2019 ball. Josslyn said trina was really worried about spencer because he was upset. We\u2019re all just assuming that trina was with spencer when victor took him.\tOh, that son of a bitch. Okay, I have to go and see portia. She might have an update.

I\u2019ll be there.\tYou\u2019re a good doctor and a good guy, dr. Gatlin-holt. Maybe you don\u2019t know about ava jerome.\tOkay, that\u2019s enough.

Won\u2019t you do it with nina for willow\u2019s?\t[Doorbell ringing]\t[Sighs]\t[Dramatic music]\tI seem to have sparked an aha moment. You want to fill me in?\tLaura, it\u2019s just like you said. The human memory is complicated. It\u2019s something I learned as a cop. Questioning witnesses, people often remember more than they realize.\tHmm.\tI\u2019m sorry to interrupt. Laura, I got one for you, too.\tOh, thank you. That was very thoughtful of you.\tYou\u2019re trina robinson\u2019s stepfather, right?\tYeah.\tI just had to say that trina has been very kind to me when, from what I\u2019ve heard, she had every right not to be. I hope you find her soon.\tThank you, and same to your baby. I appreciate the talk. I\u2019ll let you know what I learn.\tPlease do.\tYeah.\tAll right, hon, I should probably get you home. You need your rest. Are you ready to go?\tI\u2019m not sure.\tOh, honey, are you afraid to go back to the apartment? Do you feel unsafe there? Because I can tell you, the city has beefed up our security, and kevin has made sure that-\tit\u2019s not that, laura. I trust that you\u2019ll protect me.\tThen why don\u2019t you want to go home with me?\tBecause ace won\u2019t be there.\t[Dramatic music]\tIt\u2019s okay. What am I doing here?\tI thought you would enjoy a little break from your close quarters. Watkins, take ace to the baby nurse, would you? Go on.\tPlease be\u2013please be careful with him. I finally got him to calm down.\tI decided to let you eat after all.\tWhat made you change your mind?\tWell, we no longer have reason to pull off those diversionary stunts of yours. I hold all the cards.\tI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\tNo?\t[Footsteps thumping] Ah, I see our dinner guest has arrived.\t[Dramatic music]\t", "Well, never mind me. I\u2019m fine, but my baby isn\u2019T.\t[Dramatic music]\tMy mom, your grandmother, jordan, and curtis know we\u2019re on the boat. And laura was familiar with this boat and the communications room. She talked me through so that I could find the heading on the radar screen.\tIs there anything that my grandmother can\u2019t do?\tI just hope I gave them enough so that they can find us.\tSo why did you take the walkie?\tTo monitor the guards\u2019 movement. So now we just have to sit tight and wait to be rescued.\tYeah, I just hope that they can find us in time.\tWhat? What do you mean?\tTrina, while you were gone, I found out a few things myself. I always knew that my uncle victor was a very powerful man with all kinds of connections, and I knew that he could be ruthless, but that man is more dangerous than I ever could have imagined. He has this plan, one that could endanger billions of lives, and if we don\u2019t stop him before we make landfall, it will be too late for all of us.\t[Dramatic music]\tYour uncle wants to reduce the global population?\tYes. My uncle has made this his life\u2019s mission, like some maniacal zealot. He only intends to clear out half of the world\u2019s population. Cassadines are exempted, of course, at least those that he can convince to come over to the dark side. And I wonder if maybe my dad found out about this, and then my uncle did something with him.\tWell, we can\u2019t say that for sure, spencer. But we do know that your uncle is insane. No one can engineer the future of humanity.\tDo you want to be the one to tell him that?\tAmbrose, are you back on station?\tResuming post in 10 minutes.\tCopy.\tLet me know\twhen you\u2019re in position.\tCopy.\tWe can\u2019t reach wherever we\u2019re headed. This\u2013this might be my only chance. I know where the engine room is.\tTrina, no, you\u2019ve taken too many risks already.\tBut what if our families don\u2019t find us in time to stop victor? I can\u2013I can buy us some time so that they can catch up to us.\tTrina, no. I know that you\u2019re smart, and I know that you\u2019re brave. But you need to be careful. Please promise me that you\u2019re not gonna take any unnecessary risks, because I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do. Please, promise me.\tI won\u2019T. I wanna come back to you.\t[Dramatic music]\tThis is about more than you and me now. We have no choice. We have to do something. It\u2019s up to us.\tI\u2019ll be back soon.\tNow might be a good time to start praying.\tMy baby\u2013he\u2019s been kidnapped.\tI\u2013I know.\tAnd-\tand it\u2019s\u2013it\u2019s terrifying. And I hope that this is some comfort to you, but I was once really close to someone who had a baby kidnapped, too. And\u2013and she was told to stay strong and to keep it together. And I think it\u2019s really important in moments like this that we remain hopeful that ace is gonna be fine, and he\u2019ll be back in your arms really soon.\tWell, did your friend get their baby back?\tShe did, yeah.\tHe\u2019s right. The pcpd is on it. They\u2019re gonna find your baby.\tIt\u2019s just that ace\u2019s colic-\tit isn\u2019t being treated. All the stuff you gave me-\tit was in his diaper bag, and the kidnapper just left it, and-\tokay, hey, if you\u2019re concerned that ace\u2019s colic is gonna turn into a serious health crisis, you don\u2019t need to be. It\u2019s not life-threatening. It\u2019s probably just gonna resolve itself.\tReally?\tYeah, ace is not gonna suffer any lasting harm from colic.\tYeah, well, I hate the idea of him suffering at all.\tI know, but these things have a way of working out.\tYeah, but who\u2019s rocking him to sleep at night? How do I know he\u2019s eating properly if I\u2019m not there to do it?\tEsme, I heard that spencer was also kidnapped. So that means they\u2019re probably together. And I know that spencer will do everything he can to comfort his baby brother and to protect him.\tSo you\u2019re saying I shouldn\u2019t worry because my baby doesn\u2019t need me?\tThank you for letting me tuck avery in.\tIt was the only way we were gonna pry this out of her hands.\tYeah, I should have known she\u2019d want to practice her flower girl duties.\tWell, I\u2019m sure it will be a lovely ceremony.\tRight, aside from the fact that the bride may be dying.\tWell, no one can predict the future. My current feelings about love and marriage aside, I think this wedding is a great idea, life-affirming, even.\tI agree. Celebration with family and friends is just the perfect medicine for willow. All right, well, I will be in touch. And I\u2019ll see myself out.\tOh, carly, I\u2019m-\tI\u2019m just\u2013I\u2019m unclear about something.\tWhat\u2019s that?\tWell, you said earlier that the wedding is gonna be a family affair. And I\u2019m just curious, does that include nina and sonny?\tThey\u2019re moving up the wedding because of willow\u2019s condition, but that\u2019s not the only reason. They\u2019re saying to the world that they love each other and that love should be celebrated, no matter what the situation.\tYou\u2019re right. You\u2019re\u2013you\u2019re right. And despite my differences with michael, I have to admit, your son loves my daughter.\tMore than anything.\tAnd we will celebrate this, them getting married, even though we can\u2019t-\twe can\u2019t be there with them.\t[Dramatic music]\t[Lock clattering]\t[Uneasy music]\tAce! Hey, you\u2013you brought him. Is he okay?\tHere, just take him.\tHi.\tUgh.\tHi.\tWell, he\u2019s fussy and restless, so I thought maybe a visit with his brother might do you both some good.\t[Dramatic music]\tEngine room,\tassistance needed on deck.\tCopy that.\tEsme, no one is suggesting that your son doesn\u2019t need you.\tOh, please. People have been lined up to take ace away from me since the moment that he was born.\tEsme, you\u2019re ace\u2019s mom. And from what I\u2019ve observed, you\u2019re a conscientious and loving parent. So maybe just give yourself a break. Don\u2019t let people get in your head.\tI\u2019m really sorry.\tNo, it\u2019s okay. Look, you don\u2019t need to apologize.\t[Sighs] Look, we\u2019re all just really hopeful that ace returns safely.\tYou\u2019ve been a great comfort, both of you. Thank you.\t", "[Dramatic music]\tOh.\tMm-hmm.\tYou handled that well.\tOh, thank you. You did, too, so thanks for that.\tWell, I didn\u2019t want to get into it with her, but I\u2019ve lived through that trauma. I mean, for me, in the end, it\u2013everything turned out okay, but fearing for your child, not knowing what\u2019s happening to him\u2026 it\u2019s an indescribable terror.\tI\u2019m glad you came through it okay. And I hope esme comes through it okay. She\u2019s been through a lot. I really feel for her.\tI never thought I\u2019d say this, but so do I.\tYou know, kevin and I have a friend who\u2019s a brigadier general. I mean, he\u2019s a very busy man, obviously, but he may be able to assist the coast guard.\tOkay, and I still have some of my contacts from my law enforcement and pi days.\tMm-hmm.\tI want to get a bead on victor\u2019s support personnel. From the description of the safe house takeover, they sound like paramilitary.\tMm, that\u2019s a very good point. He\u2019s got a lot of resources.\tYeah.\tI\u2019ve officially been released. I\u2019m free.\tGood.\tAlthough some may say I don\u2019t deserve to be.\tIt\u2019s not my wedding. The guest list is up to michael and willow.\tI\u2019m sure they took your feelings into consideration.\tIf nina and sonny aren\u2019t invited, it\u2019s not because of me.\tOkay. Well, I just know that michael and willow love you. They want you to be comfortable, and that might dictate who they include and who they choose not to include.\tRight, and michael and willow have their reasons for who they invite and choose to exclude.\tOkay, of course, right. I just\u2013I think that a health crisis of this magnitude would bring you all together and not make a bigger divide.\tWhat\u2019s it to you? I mean, seriously, why do you care?\tNina. She\u2019s my friend, and she is devastated about willow, willow\u2019s health, the daughter that you kept from her. So what, I can\u2019t ask if my friend has been invited to her daughter\u2019s big day?\tHow is it that you guys are friends? What could you possibly have in common besides hating me?\tI hear congratulations are in order, michael. I\u2019m wishing you and willow the best on your big day. Excuse me.\tHow did she-\tbrook lynn.\tYeah, well, I guess I\u2019ll have to thank her for saving me the trouble.\tBrook lynn was-\tshe felt terrible for letting it slip. But I\u2019m glad she did, and I\u2019m happy for you and willow. Give her my best wishes.\tOr you could do it yourself.\tWhat does that mean?\tWould you like to attend our wedding?\tYou\u2019re inviting me to your wedding?\tWillow and I want this to be a family affair, so that includes you.\tWell, there\u2019s nothing I wouldn\u2019t do for willow or you.\tYeah, willow wants it to be simple, so we\u2019re\u2013we\u2019re keeping it intimate. So this guest list is gonna be small.\tI\u2019m even more honored to be included.\tWell, good. I hope you understand that this invitation is-\tit\u2019s for you, you alone.\tSo what you\u2019re saying is, you want me to come to your wedding, but you don\u2019t want nina to come to your wedding?\t[Dramatic music]\tI don\u2019t hate you, carly.\tYour friend, nina, sure does. And here you are, doing her bidding. How is this so-called friendship even possible? The woman immobilized you and forced you to give birth to avery.\tNina has definitely benefited from forgiveness and grace.\tSo you\u2019re telling me when you look at nina, you don\u2019t see what she did to you? All is forgiven and forgotten?\tI\u2019m not saying that. To be honest, I try not to think about it. And when I look at her, I don\u2019t see the disturbed woman that she used to be. I see the woman that has gotten help, that has turned her life around. And\u2013and yeah, nina and i have become friends, as unlikely as that is. And you know something, carly? It feels a lot better than harboring bitterness and resentment.\tThanks for the inspirational talk. The next time I come by, I\u2019ll make sure to wear beads and bring a candle.\tOh, carly, I\u2019m not trying to get into it with you. I just want you to see how much power you have here. You are on the inside, and that gives you the perfect opportunity to broker peace.\tSince when did you become an authority on peace?\tWell, I get a lot of quiet in this old house, but no peace. I\u2019m just trying to spare you my regrets.\tReally? What regrets?\tThanks again for dropping everything to speak with esme.\tAh, you don\u2019t need to thank me. I\u2019m happy to help.\t[Dramatic music] Nurse baldwin, can you do something for me? Could you please tell me why nurse driscoll is looking at me like that? Because she\u2019s been doing it all day.\tNurse driscoll, is there something dr. Gatlin-holt can help you with?\tNo, but I may be able to help him.\tHow would you do that?\tYou should stop seeing ava jerome if you know what\u2019s good for you.\tI\u2019m in no position to judge you, carly. I know that. We all make choices in this life, some of which keep us up at night.\tDoes morgan keep you up at night? When you think about how I deprived nina of her daughters, do you think about how you deprived me of my son? I do, every time I have to see you, and then I think about avery, and I co-exist with you for her sake. But do not deceive yourself that I\u2019ve forgotten, that it\u2019s over, because I haven\u2019t, and it never will be.\tSo is there anything else you need to say to me? Any more insight into my behavior?\tYeah, just\u2013just one more thing, actually. Time is running out. This may be the last chance for nina and willow. And I know that you\u2019re capable of rising above. I\u2019ve seen you do it with me for avery\u2019s sake. Won\u2019t you do it with nina for willow\u2019s?\tIt\u2019s not my call. It\u2019s willow\u2019s choice to make. Whatever boundaries she set with nina, it\u2019s one she\u2019s comfortable with.\tI tried.\tMaybe you\u2019re trying so damn hard to fix nina because you can\u2019t fix trina.\tWhat about trina? Has something happened?\tThis is my very good friend, curtis ashford.\tI recognize the name, but-\tyeah, no, we\u2019ve met before, esme, but I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t recall.\t"], "answer": [0, 3, 4, 1, 2]}
{"content": ["Willow, do you realize you\u2019re only two days out from your procedure? I tried to tell her to stay home and rest. Later. Right now, this is exactly where I need to be. (Sighing) oh, I\u2019m so glad to see you. Come in. Oh, come here! Hi, grandma! I\u2019m officially cleared to donate my bone marrow to willow. That is such good news, such good news! God knows that we could use them, especially a day like today. You going to the memorial? Really? I couldn\u2019t stand that people who\u2019d openly wished britta ill attended her service. Aunt liesl, you are many, many things, but hypocrite is not one of them. Epiphany and I did nothing but butt heads. I\u2019m not happy she\u2019s gone, but I\u2019m glad she died honorably. Just like britt. We should all be so lucky.\t[Sighs] Boss. Want some company?\tHow are you doing, marshall? It doesn\u2019t make sense that she\u2019s gone. Well, unfortunately, pop, a lot of things in life just don\u2019t make sense. You know, hanging out with epiphany was often the highlight of my work shift.\t[Laughter] Yeah, I\u2019m sure it was. We laughed so much when I was helping her prep for the mcats. I mean, I\u2019m surprised we got anything done. But she pulled through, didn\u2019t she? With your encouragement, marshall. You\u2019re not just a nurse. You are epiphany johnson. You\u2019ve been up to the crack of dawn studying for these mcats, girl, you got this. Thank you for the encouragement. Hey, I\u2019m just stating facts. What if I don\u2019t pass? So what? A valiant effort is not a failure. Far from it. It\u2019s brave. Epiphany, it\u2019s courageous. And it makes me so very proud of you. Right before epiphany took her mcats, she was scared. And she said that this was all my fault. And she was right. If it wasn\u2019t for me, epiphany would still be here. I just want to see how you\u2019re holding up. What do you think, does this look right here? Because I could put it over there. I think it\u2019s perfect. The fact that you pulled this all together on such short notice-it\u2019s impressive, to say the least. It\u2019s not like you really had a choice. Epiphany had it in her will that I would get to organize her celebration. Still bossing around from the afterlife, I see. Yeah.\t[Chuckles] Although that was before everything had to come out about what I had done. She must have been so disappointed in me. I just wish she could have focused on being at johns hopkins and her future and not-hey. Hey, epiphany was driving home. And there was an accident on the side of the road, and she jumped in to help, just like you\u2019d expect her to. Yeah. Yeah, she was being the epiphany we all knew and loved. I just wish I could have made it right with her. I had a feeling I\u2019d find you here. Back when we were sort of, almost, kind of dating, you\u2019d always wallow in here when you\u2019re sad. I\u2019ve earned a right to a little wallowing. Don\u2019t you think? Epiphany was my friend. This vital presence, and now, she\u2019s just gone. (Voiceover) now, I also understand that she\u2019s not the only patient that you snapped at lately. You snap at people all the time. Well, that\u2019s different. Why? Because I said so. Now, I want an explanation. Is there something going on with you? Ok, I may have been down in the dumps ever since things went so spectacularly south with brad. You can do better. I\u2019m sorry for bringing that stuff to work. Wait. What\u2019d you say? I said, you can do better. No, she\u2019s not. No one\u2019s ever really gone, as long as you hold onto her. In here.\t[Cries] Look at this place-caring for the people of port charles for 60 years. Can you believe it? These walls-they\u2019ve seen everything. Yeah. And I\u2019m afraid today is going to be a hard one. General hospital\u2019s lost one of its best. I couldn\u2019t agree more. But here we are. We\u2019re still standing. [Chuckles] Sometimes barely. Still something to be grateful for. And we have to keep going until we can\u2019t anymore. I believe epiphany would want that. Diane! Hello, laura. Hi, robert. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be seeing you today. Well, epiphany asked me to be the executor of her will. I just have one final thing to do before the memorial. Yeah. A grind never stops, does it? (Laughing) no. I actually can\u2019t stay very long either. I have to fill in for the deputy mayor while she\u2019s indisposed. Is there any update on her whereabouts? Uh, well, I acquired some assistance the other night and diane helped me. Did I ever.\t", "[Chuckles] Oh, yeah, she can be trusted. She\u2019s a friend. High praise. Right. Well, I\u2019d better get inside. I\u2019ll see you in there. I look forward to it. Well.\t[Laughs] You seem a little happier than you were before. Does this have something to do with diane? Hmm? Well.\tWhat are you talking about? Hmm? What\u2019s your fault? I pushed epiphany to go into med school. That\u2019s a good thing, pop. If she hadn\u2019t taken mcats, if she hadn\u2019t gotten into johns hopkins, she wouldn\u2019t have been on the road the other night, and she wouldn\u2019t have seen that accident. And she\u2019d still be here with us. No. No, no. Marshall, you reignited her dream, and she attained her dream. She got to prove to herself that all those people were wrong all those years ago who said that she couldn\u2019t do it, and she did it! She actually did it! Think about how amazing that is and how many people really get to have that kind of satisfaction. Before epiphany passed, any semblance of self-doubt, of regret, that she had been carrying around for decades-that lifted off of her. And I\u2019m gonna tell you right now, that\u2019s a gift. And if I know epiphany, I know in my heart that she wouldn\u2019t have wanted it any other way.\t[Sobbing] It\u2019s good to see you, milo. You, too, boss. I wish it was under different circumstances. Man, uh, epiphany was one of a kind. I\u2019m so lucky I got to have her in my life. You know what? Epiphany was lucky, too. (Voiceover) you think I\u2019m trying to change you? Aren\u2019t you? Not even close. I took you the protein shack because it\u2019s where I like to go. It never occurred to me to try anywhere else. But if I made you feel that you\u2019re not good enough for me, I am so sorry. It\u2019s just the opposite. I worry all the time if I\u2019m good enough for you. And as for the way you look, you are beautiful inside and out, epiphany. That\u2019s why I asked you out. I wouldn\u2019t change a thing. You ok? (Crying) yeah. I\u2019m just grateful for all the memories. What about you, boss? How\u2019s everything going? You mean the business? You know, things are a little dicey. I\u2019m happy to step in again if you need more help, you know, more hands on deck, just for old time\u2019s sake. I appreciate that, but you\u2019re one of the rare ones that got out-and lived. Let\u2019s keep it that way. Dr. Obrecht, just the person I was looking for. May I help you? Indeed. As the executor for epiphany johnson\u2019s will, I\u2019ve been given a specific set of instructions for you. They are time-sensitive and must be completed today. By me? Yes. But nurse johnson and I despised one another. Well, be that as it may, epiphany johnson apparently felt you were the only one to be trusted with this job. Aunt liesl, what does it say? Epiphany was important to me. I understand that, willow. It\u2019s just-without her support, I may never have gone into nursing. I\u2019m considering applying to the nursing program. I\u2019d still be able to work with kids, and maybe some of my experience as a teacher would translate. Hmm, well, the world always needs more good nurses. But you have to go back to school start from scratch. Oh, I know that. I didn\u2019t think there would be any shortcuts. I\u2019m just kind of at a crossroads. I\u2019ll tell you what. If you still want to talk about it, you know where to find me. I don\u2019t think I ever told her how much I appreciated that. I just want to attend the service and light a candle for my friend. And then, I will head straight back home. Promise. Can I count on you to help me do this? Oh, my gosh. You can count on us for anything. Always. We\u2019re with you all the way. How come you\u2019re here? I just want to see you before heading to epiphany\u2019s memorial. Oh, gosh! Mom and dad really wanted to come, but sadly, they couldn\u2019t get away from work. Of course not. Doctors, they\u2019re always so busy trying to save people\u2019s lives, right? Right. Anyways, I decided just because they kind of fly out didn\u2019t mean that I couldn\u2019T. So this young lady booked herself a flight. Of course she did. Wow. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re sitting here right in front of me. Happy surprise? Oh, it\u2019s the absolute happiest. Oh, come here.\t", "thank you all for being here. How do you sum up the life of a person who has touched so many people in so many different ways? People fall into different categories. He\u2019s the heart of the hospital. She\u2019s the brains of the operation. The soul, the glue, the entertainer, the comforter-but not epiphany. No, \u2019cause she was all of those things wrapped up into one magnificent human being. She was firm and tender. She was a pragmatist, a dreamer. She was a taskmaster. And yet, she told her nurses to take as many mental health days as necessary. There\u2019s a whole host of contradictions that, for some reason, never really seemed to conflict with each other. Fitting that today is just another one of those contradictions. It\u2019s a celebration of her life while our hearts collectively break, mourning a woman who was a mentor, a best friend, someone we all considered family. So what are your plans for tonight? Well, franco has this session and-I didn\u2019t ask you what franco\u2019s plans were. I asked you what your plans were. What are you, the bride-to-be, going to be doing on the night before her wedding? Well, I was going to treat myself to a bubble bath and watch the last two episodes-oh, wrong, wrong, wrong. You\u2019re going out with me for a drink. I\u2019m going to miss her. But I am also flooded with gratitude, because who\u2019s luckier than us to have known and loved and been loved by epiphany? No one\u2019s luckier. Epiphany had a gift for connecting people, for telling them the truth, even when the truth was scary. When I first became a nurse, I was afraid of caring for terminal patients. I didn\u2019t know how to be with them. Tiffany showed me by example. She got me to push past my fear, so I could help those who need me. She was generous with her time, her spirit, and our wisdom. I had my credentials when I got here, but it was epiphany who taught me how to be a nurse. I didn\u2019t know epiphany as long as a lot of people in this room. But the impact that she had on my life-it was indescribable. We were work colleagues. We got along great. She got along great with everyone. But there was a time when she risked everything to protect my daughter and her father. And I think that that speaks to her character. We became great friends after that. And eventually-eventually, she-she became a part of my family. My father once told me, it\u2019s the people who show up at your darkest moments-those are your real friends. God knows I\u2019ve been through some dark moments. You know how much I hate being in this chair, right? Now, it\u2019s time to take it to the next level. I\u2019ll be the judge of that. Just watch. Hold my hand. You stubborn son of a bitch! Look at you! Look at you! If that\u2019s the measure of true friendship, then epiphany was my best friend. It\u2019s hard to imagine general hospital without epiphany. She\u2019s certainly been here for as long as I can remember. It won\u2019t be the same without her. Epiphany was a truthteller. If she liked someone, then they were worth having them in your life, but if she didn\u2019t, it was probably best to avoid them. But epiphany allowed for growth. I think that was one of her best qualities in my opinion, because she believed people could change. They could get stronger, wiser, just better. And that\u2019s a good thing, because i was one of those people. Epiphany ran to my rescue so many times-a lot of people\u2019s rescue.\tladies and gentlemen-gentlemen, before we all rush away, one last piece of business. When I agreed to be epiphany\u2019s executor for her will, she gave me a small but very specific set of instructions for today, but chief among them being that I escort you all to the roof. So please, will you all follow me? You coming? Yeah, I\u2019ll be up in a minute. I have a note for all of us from epiphany. I have to imagine some nice things were said about me today, and tears were probably shed, which I can appreciate, of course. But you know that\u2019s not how I lived my life, even in the darkest of times. I held on to the joy whenever I could, so be sad if you need to be. Safe travels, my worthy adversary. But I would much rather go out with a bang.\t", "Diane! Oh, my gosh. How long has it been? Too dang long. Come here. How\u2019s max? He\u2019s doing good. And how are you? Pretty sad today. I\u2019m so sorry about epiphany. Thank you, diane. It\u2019s nice to see you. I know I said this when we spoke, but I\u2019m really, really sorry for your loss. I know that you and epiphany had a very special relationship. It really hit home how precious life can be and how it can be gone like that. That\u2019s why we have to be careful. It\u2019s funny, because when I think of life like that, the impermanence of it all, it makes me want to stay close to the people that I love. I know we can\u2019t spend a lot of time together until things settle down, sonny, but if you want company to the memorial, I would love to go with you. I\u2019d like that very much. I think the readings are a mistake. If I cut them, then it leaves more room for people to speak. Hey, elizabeth, this whole service, this celebration, whatever you want to call it, it\u2019s beautiful. But it needs to be perfect. Perfect. I need to make it up to her. I just wish I knew what she was thinking at the end. Maybe I can help with that. Were you a friend of hers? More like she was my guardian angel. Your dear friend epiphany died saving my life.\tGrandpa? [Stammering] My little girl! I don\u2019t mean to intrude. I just read about epiphany\u2019s memorial service, and I just-I don\u2019t even know what I was hoping to find. I just jumped in my car, and here I am. You were with her when she passed? We\u2019ve been trying to piece together all the details. It was late. I was driving home after a double shift. I\u2019m a nurse as well. The roads were a mess and visibility was even worse. And I didn\u2019t even see the downed power line before i was practically on it. And I swerved to get out of the way, and then I crashed into a utility pole. It was so much smoke and fire. I was terrified. I can imagine. I managed to get out of the car, but I was in so much pain, and it was so much blood and-then I saw the headlights. Epiphany? She pulled over and she just ran to me. She was barking orders at 911 the entire way. That sounds about right. Epiphany knew that if she moved me, I would bleed out, so she just-she put pressure on my wounds, and she just-she just talked to me in that soothing voice that she had. And she said to me, she said, I promise you I will not leave your side until the paramedics are here. And she didn\u2019T. If it wasn\u2019t for your friend-I just couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her. So I asked my colleagues at the hospital what happened, and they said that she collapsed at the site. They said she had some problem. There was so much smoke, that she had some kind of complications or-she had a pre-existing heart condition. And she didn\u2019t even think twice about risking her own life to save a stranger? That was her. Epiphany was a true healer. Epiphany was a hero. Sorry for your loss. We all lost her, sonny. So did you. Oh, this is milo giambetti. It\u2019s nice to meet you, mr. Ashford. I\u2019ve heard great things. Epiphany spoke very highly of you. Thank you. Thank you for saying that. Sonny, you should head to the chapel. Milo, he said? Yeah. What a nice young man. How did he know epiphany? That\u2019s epiphany\u2019s ex-boyfriend. Yeah. She was full of surprises. Wow. Thank you for sharing with us. It means everything. And we\u2019re-we\u2019re very, very glad that you\u2019re all right. Only because of epiphany. It\u2019s comforting, knowing she left this world doing what she loved. Well, it looks to be about that time. All right. You\u2019ll stay for the service, right? Oh, no, I should probably get going. I just-I just wanted epiphany\u2019s loved ones to know what a brave and wonderful person she truly was. We already knew that. Look, please, stay. You drove all this way. Epiphany would want you here. You sure? Positive. Ok, I\u2019ll stay. Who was that? Just one of the countless people who owe their life to epiphany.\t", "[Explosions] No way! Oh, my god. Leave it to epiphany. It\u2019s beautiful. Go out with a bang, you did. Um, boss? Yeah? Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but these fireworks are-highly illegal, yes. I couldn\u2019t hear that. The fireworks were so loud.\t[Laughter] Monica? Am I disturbing the memorial? No, no, no. It just ended. Are you all right? Ugh, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m just terribly disappointed I couldn\u2019t be at epiphany\u2019s memorial. If I hadn\u2019t been the keynote speaker, I would have backed out. Well, epiphany of all people would appreciate you keeping your commitment. I imagine she would, which brings me to why I\u2019m calling. Diane miller paid me a visit just before I left, and she dropped off a sealed letter that was written by epiphany a few days ago-one she intended to hand-deliver to the review board on your behalf. So she did write a letter of support? I just finished reading it, and i had to share it with you. \u201cElizabeth baldwin is an extremely talented and dedicated nurse. And watching her grow from a rookie to the leader amongst her peers has been one of the greatest privileges of my life. Her commitment to healing knows no bounds. And part of that commitment requires making snap judgments in the moment, assessing tricky situations, and deciding in real time how best to handle them. I believe that\u2019s what elizabeth was doing when she made the choice to treat esme prince while in captivity. Was that choice the right one? Ultimately, no, as is often the case with snap decisions like that. But the thing that separates the good healers from the great ones is accountability. Elizabeth didn\u2019t run from her responsibility. She ran towards it, which makes her the best of us. In fact, it had always been my intention to recommend she be named head nurse when I depart for medical school this fall. I stand by that recommendation now more than ever. Elizabeth has always made me proud, and she\u2019ll make general hospital proud, too.\u201d Elizabeth? Are you still there? Yeah, I\u2019m still here. Well, that\u2019s quite a recommendation, if you ask me. And who am I to deny epiphany\u2019s last wish? Wait, are you saying that-I plan to present the idea to the board at the end of the month. Having another hardy-slash-march from the 10th floor sounds right, don\u2019t you think? Thank you, monica. Thank you. Don\u2019t thank me. Thank epiphany. You take care, elizabeth. Thank you, epiphany. For everything. I love you. You\u2019re not alone you\u2019re not alone anymore you\u2019re not alone you\u2019re not alone anymore I know you think there\u2019s no way out like you\u2019ve been living in the dark but you don\u2019t have to feel alone I know you\u2019re reaching up for the sky and you keep searching for that but you don\u2019t have to search anymore we\u2019ll be the hands to hold you up we\u2019ll be the eyes to help you see we are here we are now we are one you are the strength inside our hearts you are the reason we believe we are here we are now we are one you know who I am? My patient.\t[Laughs] Magic milo, you disappoint me. Gotta leave something to the imagination.\t[Chuckles] Oh, I\u2019ll be imagining. Are you asking me out on a date? Are we going to sing karaoke on that date? No. I have a boyfriend. Good ones do. And he\u2019s not too hard on the eyes either. Don\u2019t you mess with the nurse\u2019s ball. You wouldn\u2019T. Wouldn\u2019t I? Did I or did I not assign you to bedpan duty? Yeah, but-but what? No running. Jason was someone I respected. He respected you, too. I never doubted that.\t[Laughter] I\u2019d go a long way to protect the people that I love, and you, my sweet, are on that list.

No. What the hell is he up to? Is he bailing out on you in this pregnancy? You know what, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t wanna talk about it. Okay. Oh God. I\u2019m taking you to the hospital.

You\u2019re clearly very important to the woman that I love and therefore, Very important to me. Okay, fine. Fine. You said all the right things, albeit in a very insincere way. So it all rang hollow, but maybe that is me just being overly cynical and mistrustful because my parents treated me like crap.\tConsequently, I have never felt respected. Love didn\u2019t have serious self-esteem issues. Oh, for God\u2019s sake. Dimitri\u2019s not your shrink, Matty. Well, forgive me for being open, honest, and authentic. And if Gwen had, let me finish, what I was going to say was,\tI will allow this marriage against my better judgment. Wow. Wow. How very generous of you. Indeed. Thank you very much for your grudging permission, Matty. And might I remind you both that I have not given Dimitri Nancy yet, and given that you two have now kissed and made up, you know what? Maybe you two should just ride off into the sunset together.\tYou know what? I\u2019m pretty sure that we are the better couple now, Gwen, I love you. I love you so much, but you don\u2019t have to answer me right now. Tonight my mother is throwing an engagement party for another happy couple.

And if Gwen does decide to be my bride, do you think you could reserve judgment and allow me the opportunity of finally giving her the happiness that she\u2019s earned?\tSo do you need a number for how worried you should be about me and Sarah? Huh? No. You\u2019ve always been honest with me about her. Just like you\u2019ve always been honest with me about your feelings for Brady. Which is why we\u2019ve been taking it slow. And slow is good, right? Yeah, it is. Uh, it was, but uh, I wanna move on.\tThat\u2019s fair. I mean, I know what\u2019s going on between us. It\u2019s brand new, but I, it just feels right. It does to me too. I\u2019m so glad to hear you say that. Actually, I was just talking to Nicole about this, huh? Well, I bet she was thrilled. Oh yeah. Really thrilled. Yeah. No, not at all. But I did tell her that even though she\u2019s one of my best friends, she is.\tNot gonna talk me out of exploring things with you. So she agreed to back off? No, not at all. But we did talk. She asked me questions, she gave me her opinions. And um, you know, we talked about you like any other relationship, and I feel like that\u2019s a semblance of acceptance. My resignation. What does she ask?\tYou know, the usual. Okay. Like one of the first things she asked was whether we had slept together. And what did you tell her? I was vague. I\u2019m a lady. I do not kiss and tell. That\u2019s good to know. Wait, does that mean that you\u2019re not gonna tell her about this?\tI\u2019ll go get rid of.\tSo tell how are you a Hypocrites loan?\tCome on. You know, you can tell me anything.\tI did something that might really hurt Eric. Let me guess. You were screwing around. What\u2019s, no. Why would you say that? Because I know you and I know you\u2019re not exactly a one man kind of girl. Yeah, it was with Eric. It\u2019s different. He\u2019s, he\u2019s just not like any of the other guys I\u2019ve been with. So you finally found someone you\u2019re serious about.\tYeah. I love him. And now you are worried that you\u2019ve done something that\u2019s gonna come between you. How bad boy is it? Oh, it doesn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t matter. Simon, come on. Your boyfriend would be the first one to tell you that confession is good for this whole. So tell Brother Colin, how are you sinned against Eric?\tEric\u2019s ex-wife? Nicole Walker is pregnant and the child could be his.\tI know you think my relationship with Sloan is a bad idea. No, stop. Sorry. I am sorry, I, you don\u2019t owe me an explanation. Well, it seems like you need one. Well, I,\tI was just thrown off guard when Sloan blurted out that you two were trying to have a baby. Okay. Was, I mean, was she just trying to get a rise outta me? No, I think it\u2019s more than that. I think she\u2019s excited about the idea.\tOkay, well, having a baby, was it saloon\u2019s idea? We came to it together. Slung saw, she saw how disappointed I was when we found out the baby was DJ\u2019s.\tYou were I, I mean, uh, I know that you\u2019ve always wanted to be a father. I just wasn\u2019t sure, especially since we both know how complicated this would\u2019ve been, right? But I know somehow we would\u2019ve made it work.\tHave to admit a part of me was hope, hoping that baby was mine.\tOh, ah, are you all right?\tOh,\tSo, so you\u2019re telling me that this Nicole woman is pregnant with your boyfriend\u2019s baby and she doesn\u2019t know that it\u2019s his, I said it might be his, it could still be EJ Damir, right? Because neither of them were actually tested. I swabbed my own cheek and that\u2019s what the lab got sent. Interesting. So the only thing that we do know is that.\tYou are not the father of this child. I\u2019m glad you find this so amusing. Come what you want me to feel? Sorry for you? You got what you wanted then you, Eric, is free to be with you. Yeah, but I feel terrible about it. Not terrible enough to tell the truth. Look, when I found out that Nicole was pregnant, I started thinking about everyone I\u2019ve lost.\tMom, dad, and now you. I\u2019m right here. For how long, Colin? You\u2019re going away to prison. We see. Anyway, the point is, is I was terrified of losing Eric to Nicole cuz if he finds out that she\u2019s carrying his child, then missed, a good guy will go running him back to her. Eric\u2019s always wanted to be a father and he and Nicole have like just decades of history, so it\u2019s bad.\tSo what you were doing was leveling the playing field. You did what you had to do to hold onto someone you love. There\u2019s no shame in that. Sloan. Oh, there\u2019s shame and deception, Colin. Just let it go. Enjoy the victory after everything that we\u2019ve lost. You deserve a win. Yeah, I suppose I do. Just trying to make up for what I did.\t", "I think it would not be wrong at all.\tSo on a scale of one to 10, Sorry, what? On a scale of one to 10, how worried do I have to be about how protective you are of your ex? Wait, do you really want a number? Well, I\u2019ve spent a good portion of my life in romantic relationships with men who are, um, unavailable or conflicted, or just a plain hot mess.\tSo I figure we should just get it all out onto the table. Chloe, you should not worry about me and Gwen. So is that a one? It\u2019s a zero. Look, I admit I was thrown to find out that she\u2019s getting married, but no, I\u2019m totally over, Gwen. Okay, that\u2019s, that\u2019s good to hear. However, in the spirit of. Total honesty. I should admit that maybe Sarah will always be the one that got away,\tand I will always think of him as a father no matter how long ago things ended with him and mom. Yeah, you too. And we\u2019ll, we\u2019ll video chat later. Okay. I love you too, Brandon.\tYou already knew about Abe. Theo told him, oh, I can\u2019t imagine what he must be feeling right now. I should check on him. Yeah, I think you should be with your family. Just let me know if you need anything because you\u2019ll be there for me. Thank you for checking on me. It means a lot. Actually it was Sloan\u2019s idea Sloan.\tShe and I were together when I found out. I just, I mentioned how close you and Abe were and so said I needed to come see you right away. Oh, no, that was nice of her. Maybe she does have a heart, but you probably already knew that since you\u2019re trying to have a baby with her.\tNo, that, that is the best news I\u2019ve heard all day, Colin, a man is dead. And, and that\u2019s, that\u2019s tragic. I mean, I, I guess I, I didn\u2019t have anything personal against Abe Carver. Uh, you bashed his skull and with a rolling pin in the wrong place, wrong time. And honestly, he was asking for it by marrying into the family that destroyed ours and continuing to support Chanel and their mother after we\u2019d found out what they\u2019d done.\tSo that makes you happy. I\u2019m all for anything that causes Chanel, Dupree and Pauline and Price to suffer, and now they know what it feels like to lose someone you love. Dammit, Colin, I\u2019m not gonna sit here while you dance on the man\u2019s grave. I\u2019m sorry. I forgot you had an epiphany and decided they\u2019re always forgiven.\tThey\u2019re on the path to righteousness. Oh goodness. And life\tSloan. Where, where did you go? What are you thinking about? No, I just said, um, I\u2019m, uh, I\u2019m not, All goodness and light at all. Actually, I\u2019m a complete hypocrite.\tYou don\u2019t have to answer him, Dimitri. Oh, no, no. It\u2019s all right. You\u2019re a friend. Well, he has doubts about my intentions, and I\u2019m willing to address those doubts. Very unconvincingly, I\u2019m sure. Oh, whether you\u2019re convinced or not, Maddie. But, uh, today you don\u2019t get to call me that. Only GW gets to call me. That fine Leo.\tThe truth of the matter is that I have fallen head over heels in love with this glorious woman, and I wanna marry her because she\u2019s the most interesting and utterly captivating creature that I have ever met. And nothing will make me happier than knowing that she is mine forever and ever, and ever and always.\tThat\u2019s you addressing my doubts. By laying on the schmalz with a trowel, how gullible do you think we are? Hey, what? What? Hey, look, as someone who knows a thing or two about laying on the schmalz and almost always has an ulterior motive, I could smell this man\u2019s ulterior von Motive from a kilometer away.\tYes. Hello, mother. It\u2019s your son, Dimitri, yet again. Yeah, I think it\u2019s a little odd that for the last month you have done nothing but nonstop nag for me to bag a wife so that you get your hands on this funnel, your fortune, and you will not answer my calls or call me back to tell you exactly what it is that you want to hear.\tI asked the risk check woman to marry me. She hasn\u2019t accepted the proposal quite yet, but let\u2019s just say I am very confident that you will. Leo, it is clear that you are a loyal and devoted friend of Gwen\u2019s, and I\u2019m sure it hasn\u2019t been easy having to watch over the years as various men of questionable character have caused her pain.\tYep. Just like the man of questionable character standing right in front of me. But what you don\u2019t realize is that you and I we\u2019re not enemies. We are allies because we want the same exact thing. Oh, please. And that is to see. This rare and, and wondrous woman whom we both love, happy and safe. Now, there is nothing in this world that I want more than to marry you, Gwen.\tBut if you can\u2019t find it within your heart to grant us your blessing, well then I will withdraw my proposal once.\tI realize that you were just trying to get Matty to stop being an absolutely royal pain in the ass, but, um, I will have, you know that I do not need his or any man\u2019s blessing to marry you. Now, yes, of course. I, I didn\u2019t mean to offend you, but it\u2019s just that I know how close you and Leo are, and I would hate to ever put you in the position of having to choose between me and your friend because you know damn well that she would choose me.\t", "\u200aDad, I\u2019m, I\u2019m so sorry to hear about Abe. I know how much you, and you and Kayla loved him.\tYeah. I mean, he was pretty much family for most of the town.\tEric, what are you doing here? I wanted to come see you as soon as I heard about Abe. What about Abe?\tYou hardly touched your burger friend. That\u2019s unusual for you. Yeah. That kind have a big lunch. Is it that, or is it because you had that run-in, in front of the pub, finding out that Gwen\u2019s getting married? That was a bit of a shock. Do you wanna talk about it?\tDo you are asking me to marry you officially? Okay. What the hell kind of proposal was that? What was wrong with it? For starters, I don\u2019t see a ring, and I have a rule. If a man isn\u2019t willing to go down on bended knee, he is not a man worth marrying. You know what stuck? You are absolutely right. Forgive me Gwen, let me do this the proper way.\tOh wow. That is a, that\u2019s a large diamond. That is a very, very large diamond. Now allow me a second chance, Gwen Sek, who you do me the great honor of becoming my wife. The answer is a hard no.\tLike sand through the hourglass. So are the days of our lives.\tGod\u2019s sake, mate. Okay? That thing is huge. The ring, I mean, but I\u2019m sorry, Freo, you\u2019ve wasted the money you worked so hard to inherit because there is no way Gwen is accepting your proposal. Damn it. Matt. How do you say? Hell no. And Almanian, you are aware that I\u2019m proposing to Gwen and not you. So Gwen, what do you say?\tWell, well, Gwenny, before you answer that, I have a question of my own that needs answering. Like what? Like what the hell is actually happening here?\tWhen\u2019s getting married to some eurotrash phony? What is it to talk about? Just like that my appetite came back. You know, you don\u2019t have to pretend like you don\u2019t care about her. Chloe, I only care about her because when we were together I ended up really hurting her. I feel good about that. In spite of everything she\u2019s done, Gwen has been through a lot.\tShe deserves some happiness. And you don\u2019t think the man she\u2019s mirroring can give her that they\u2019ve known each other for all of five seconds? I mean, how can it possibly work out? It\u2019s all too fast. Did you tell Gwen that? I haven\u2019t talked about it. She and I are hardly on good terms. I told him if you done anything to her, Gwen, you\u2019ll answer to me.\tSo you\u2019re still very protective of her. Gwen\u2019s a grown woman. She can make her own decisions. I just, I don\u2019t want her to make one that she\u2019ll end up regretting for the rest of her life.\tIf you are here to try and convince me to change my plea, save your breath. I\u2019m gonna take my chance at trial as your lawyer. I\u2019m well aware of your position, so this is just a sisterly visit. Then I came to give you some news. Abe Carver is dead.\tAbe is,\the\u2019s dead. They haven\u2019t recovered his body yet, but they have a witness who said he saw hate fall off the docks of the water. Okay. Well, he, he could have survived that, right? It\u2019s very unlikely they said he could have already been injured. Raven and Eli said they found his blood and a hospital bracelet at the scene.\tNo way. Bye. I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t believe this. I, I mean, I, I knew it was a possibility when he went missing, but, but still, I, I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t let myself think that I, I\u2019m so sorry, Nicole. I just, I thought you knew.\tHe, you be, I, I, I, I mean, I, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t believe this. To be true because he, he was the dearest est man. I He loved you so much. Yeah.\tAnd having him in my life meant so much to me. I, I mean, having someone in, in, in my corner no matter what, and even when I felt all alone, I always, always had Abe.\tAnd no matter how much I disappointed him through the years, he never judged me because you are like a daughtered him. Oh my god.\tWhat am I gonna do without him?\tOh God.\tSo awful about Abe and the way that he died. Yeah. Such a tragedy. And I feel so bad for his family, my dad and Kayla,\tI\u2019m glad to be here with you.\tI\u2019m glad to. And thank you for a wonderful dinner. Oh no, this is just fish tacos. Uh, no, just fish tacos is something you get at your local fast food chain. Okay? What you put on this plate made me feel like I was sitting on a cliff overlooking a beach in Mexico. Well, no think you\u2019re not. Maybe not a little thick, but I\u2019ll take it.\tWho knows? Maybe we\u2019ll uh, go there together for real sometime. I\u2019d like that. But for now, this, uh, this date was a pretty good placeholder\tone. I was just wondering if, uh, to be wrong, to revisit that goodnight kiss. When they got interrupted, you mean when Johnny called to cancel our date? Yeah, that\u2019s what I mean. So what do you think?\t", "Yes. Yes. Does that mean No. No. Wait, now I\u2019m lost. As am I? Yes. To the party pause on the marriage proposal. Fair enough. I\u2019m sorry if that disappoints you. Knowing that we\u2019ll be together this evening, how can I possibly be disappointed and who knows? Sometime soon we\u2019ll be together. Every evening,\tget a room. You two just left this one.\tOh, what\u2019s going on there, buddy? Oh, what? We asked for three scoops. I know you ordered, uh, strawberry, which whatever. I ordered chocolate because I\u2019m not a monster. And the cookies and cream in the middle, we\u2019re supposed to be sharing. Okay. Mm-hmm. I admit the sharing gene doesn\u2019t exactly run in my family, but I could learn, are you sacrificing your cherry?\tWell, that\u2019s not much. I like you. And for the record, this is my first bite of cookies and cream. I won\u2019t go beyond my half. Oh, you better not. I\u2019m watching you Damara. Right. I got your shit.\tUh, trip. Hey, hey, hey guys. What\u2019s going on, Nicole? She needs to doctor right away. What\u2019s wrong? Uh, uh, I\u2019m two months pregnant and I, I have a siring pain right here. I have a history of miscarriages. And this is a high risk pregnancy. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. Look, Let\u2019s get you to an exam room. Uh, see what\u2019s happening tomorrow this way.\tOkay. We didn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t make it very far. I\u2019m working on it far to either bedroom. Sorry. I\u2019m. Kind of eager. Okay. E eager is good. So your room, I didn\u2019t make my bed and my room is super messy. Okay, well then let\u2019s go make a mess of mine.\tWhat do you think? I think Count Chola doesn\u2019t deserve you looking that hot tonight. Come on. I thought you were gonna give him a chance. I am. I will. I But Gwynnie, I\u2019ve said it before. It bears repeating. I just want you to be happy. Thank you, Matt. But listen, if anything juicy happens at the party tonight, I promise I will.\tText Lady Whistleblower post taste.

This is my cousin who I just found out I had Dimitri Vaughn Locher. Nice to meet you. My pleasure is all mine. Looks like you\u2019ve made some damage out of that Sunday. We\u2019re on a date hoping for a little alone time.\tJohnny. What we\u2019re family, right. We can be honest with each other. Of course. I was just stopping by to see if you were coming to the party and what, what party might that be? The engagement party that my mother is throwing for your Uncle Stephan and Gabby Hernandez. It\u2019s just at the bistro. Oh, well that sounds great.\tBut our plans are, I love a party. Do you wanna go? Sure. I mean, it might be a little weird since I was almost Gabby\u2019s sister-in-law. Oh. But, um, I really like her and I\u2019m glad that she\u2019s marrying the man she loves. Wonderful. Hmm. Well, I guess that settles it We\u2019ll, uh, see you at the party.\tSo wait, you, you are trying to have a baby with Eric just to hold onto him. That seems a bit desperate. That is not what I am doing. Are you sure? I love Eric and I feel guilty about costing him the chance to be a dad even though you are not sure that Nicole\u2019s baby is actually his right. I. No. I mean, odds are it\u2019s e J\u2019s baby.\tI mean, those two are actually together, you know? And Eric and Nicole, they hooked up once when they were both highest kites. But anyway, the point is, is that Eric desperately wants to be a father and you wanna be a mother. Yeah. You and I are. All our family has left. Of course. I want our family to grow, and if Eric is the father, then my.\tSon or my daughter, she has a real chance at being happy,\tand I hope it happens. I hope you have Eric\u2019s baby and. Nicole\u2019s baby isn\u2019t his. Either way, I\u2019ve fixed it so that neither Nicole or Eric or anyone else will ever know\tyour vitals all look good. Uh, but we should get some blood work in the sonogram, see what\u2019s going on with the pregnancy. I\u2019m gonna step out and find the be on call. So sit tight. Okay? Okay, thanks. Hang in there. Thanks.\tI think the trip assumes that I\u2019m the, oh, it\u2019s that it doesn\u2019t matter, right? What matters is that I\u2019m here for you. The baby.\tThank you Eric for being here. I, I don\u2019t know what I would do if I was alone right now. You don\u2019t need to worry about that.\tWow. Well, so much for taking it slow. I can honestly say no.

Maybe I can help with that.\tWell, don\u2019t, don\u2019t tell me you wanna broadcast this story too, only to the person who matters. You already tried calling, so now it\u2019s my turn.

When Johnny proposed and I accepted, we weren\u2019t in our right minds. We were high on biscuits. Okay. Okay, now I\u2019m really confused. And then we\u2019re way past April Fools.\tSo, hey, look, I know it sounds crazy, but I\u2019m telling you the truth.

I did, but he was fighting and you know how stubborn he is. I do. So I just kept talking to him and talking to him until, until they finally go through and call me a fancy face. And you and dad would be together at this very moment if it wasn\u2019t for me.\tHey, hey. Uh, how to cold? Thanks. Well, he\u2019s uh, he\u2019s out of our hair. He is in ISA custody.

How did she handle the news of your engagement?\tOkay. When you said you\u2019d show me a good time, even if it killed you, I didn\u2019t think you were being literal. Yeah, me neither. I did try to tell you that Ferris wheel was a bad idea. Well, at least we didn\u2019t get stuck that No. That would\u2019ve required us to actually get on a ride. Yeah. Yeah. I wonder if I\u2019m the only clutch to manage to trip in fall getting into one of those, uh, Ferris wheel pods or whatever they\u2019re called.\tRight.

Where\u2019s Papa? This is where I left him. Uncle Beau wasn\u2019t upstairs. Do you think he took him somewhere else? Or maybe Hope got through to him and he let your father deal.\tI think he escaped. That sounds about right. Well, Papa did get free. Where do you think he went? So Michael\u2019s knew Beau was alive and he said nothing. Son of a bitch. Yeah. He said that he didn\u2019t tell my mom because he thought that he was gonna lose her. And, uh, I guess his, his conscience got the better of him, and so he sent her to the villa.\tAnd, uh, once he relayed the story to me, I raced over there too, and I, I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t know what to expect. I, and I get there and my dad just got a gun and it\u2019s, and it\u2019s pointed at my mom. And it\u2019s like all I could think of how was how Michael said that Megan had turned him and that he had, that he had probably shot and killed Kate.\tAnd I just, I just knew that there was no damn way I was gonna let that happen to my mom too.\tI understand. It looked the same way to me. Yeah, but you were both wrong. Like my mom had gotten through to him. He was the same, same man that we once remembered. And I mean, he would call her fancy face. Look, which means it, it means that I shot my dad for no reason.\tLook, and if he look at he dies. Oh my God. I.\tPlease must be something more you could do. We tried everything. I\u2019m three.

Not that it\u2019s any of your damn business, but I hope to smooth things over by explaining to her that I was high on biscuits. Biscuits, biscuits. What are these biscuits everybody keeps talking about? Are they some new designer drug? Am I missing out? He\u2019s talking about my breakfast biscuits.\tOh, so you are the hookup. My. When did our little Pat TCA break? Bad? Okay. I didn\u2019t break bad Leo. That would be Sloane Peterson because of her half the town was on a powerful hallucinogenic.

He called four more times, so I blocked him. Yeah, I, I don\u2019t get it. If he\u2019s marrying Chanel, why don\u2019t he keep calling you? Oh, probably to alleviate his guilt by groveling, but forget it. I\u2019m not giving him the satisfaction anyway. I don\u2019t wanna deal with him right now, especially since you and I are technically on our first date.\tHmm. And how\u2019s it going so far in your estimation? That is well, considering you made a scrumptious dinner and then insisted on doing all of the dishes. I\u2019d say it\u2019s going great. I can\u2019t wait to see what you have planned next.\tThank God he showed up. When you did that form for you would be missing in your lobe. Or worse.

And it\u2019ll never, ever change. Just like I know that your love for me is never gonna change.

He said there was no sign of a struggle. \u2013 So eileen went with him willingly. \u2013 Either that, or they overpowered her and took her out back in a laundry cart. \u2013 Oh, it doesn\u2019t do us any good to assume the worst. Where do you think victor took her? \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I mean, it all depends on whether eileen blew her cover or not. \u2013 Bobbie, I think you are the perfect person to end the ball. \u2013 Well, I am honored, really. But there are other nurses deserving of that honor. \u2013 What if it causes friction? I mean, whoever we ask, someone else is bound to feel slighted. \u2013 I don\u2019t really think we have to worry about that. Ok, what the heck.

I feel like you should acknowledge that. Remember what you were saying earlier about wanting to be a better person? \u2013 I am sorry, elizabeth, and I do appreciate your apology. But I really think that I should just go. It\u2019s pretty obvious no one wants me here. \u2013 Ok, because of your past, esme. You have to try to show people that you\u2019re a changed person. There is a life for you here. You just got to try. \u2013 Why don\u2019t you hand me your diaper bag, and I\u2019ll help you get settled in. \u2013 Ok. \u2013 Over here. \u2013 So tell me what happened. \u2013 Well, I might have been walking to your apartment, and I might have caught esme trying to walk through the front door. \u2013 Oh, ok. And I am guessing that she wasn\u2019t just going for a walk. \u2013 You know what, she actually tried to convince me otherwise. But after some grilling, she later admitted that she was trying to leave town for good with ace. I eventually talked her down, but i didn\u2019t want to chance leaving her alone, so I brought them here. \u2013 Thank you. \u2013 I\u2019m going to have a quick chat with esme about trying to take off with my little brother. \u2013 Spencer, no.

I didn\u2019t know. God, it\u2019s just so weird to see esme with a baby. They need to get that poor kid the hell away from her as soon as possible. Memory or no memory, she\u2019s still bad news. \u2013 So we called eileen\u2019s cell, she picked up, and then she refused to leave victor\u2019s room. \u2013 Do you think she\u2019s double-crossed us? \u2013 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t think so. She said that she would be able to get us all the answers that we need. Oh, my god, do you know what she\u2019s doing? She\u2019s going after the decryption key. \u2013 Well, that\u2019s good. Because we already have the real ice princess necklace, complete with correct code. If she can deliver the decryption key, then we don\u2019t have to follow victor. We\u2019ll be one step ahead. \u2013 I don\u2019t know.

That\u2019s the only job that\u2019s important, remember? Your very life depends on it. \u2013 I\u2019m well aware.

Since esme can\u2019t remember her past, she\u2019s like a blank slate. Can we at least try to coexist with her? \u2013 You want me to be nice to her? After everything that she\u2019s done? \u2013 I didn\u2019t say that. But we can at least try to turn down the overt hostility. \u2013 I really screwed things up with chase. \u2013 You sure? Tell me what happened. \u2013 Tell me, brook lynn, if you signed that non-disclosure agreement so that I could stop singing and I could be a cop\u2013 if you were so convinced that you were doing the right thing, that you were doing it for me\u2013 then why wouldn\u2019t you just tell me? Why make up some story about writing advertising jingles for linc? I\u2019ll tell you why. Because you knew I would be angry, and you knew that what you did was wrong. But you were right about one thing. You\u2019re not the person I thought you were. \u2013 I blew it. Epic fail. There is no going back. \u2013 Brook lynn, what\u2019s wrong? \u2013 Nothing. Let\u2019s, uh, figure out the show order. \u2013 Well, I think we should just start at the end and work backwards. \u2013 [Scoffs] Bobbie, you would say something like that. That is ridiculous. Maxie, don\u2019t listen to her. \u2013 So maxie, are you going to be the one to announce how much money we made and say good night? \u2013 No, no. I think someone from gh should do that. \u2013 Oh. \u2013 It won\u2019t be the same without lucy. I miss her. \u2013 It\u2019s funny, I feel like lucy is right here in the room with us. \u2013 I miss you too, sasha. So much. You are a good egg. \u2013 But since lucy isn\u2019t here to be the mistress of ceremonies, there\u2019s really one possible choice. It has to be you, bobbie. \u2013 (Screaming) no! \u2013 I mean, who would stand up robert scorpio? \u2013 [Chuckles] Well, it\u2019s a business meeting. I mean, not a date. \u2013 [Laughs] I still find it criminal that two people such as ourselves are working at this hour. \u2013 Oh, come on. You\u2019re killer miller.

You have totally outdone yourself. What a great lineup! \u2013 I agree, brook lynn. You did such a fantastic job recruiting people. \u2013 Thank you. Well, now on to the hard part. What order do they perform in? \u2013 Everybody knows this is for a great cause, so I think they\u2019ll just put their egos aside. They\u2019ll accept whatever order we come up with. \u2013 How do people hear something is sold out and still expect to get tickets? I have to add another table. \u2013 Where?

The nurses will be a good emotional beginning. But then the next act, it really needs to grab the audience\u2019s attention. It has to be exciting, you know, have sex appeal.

The decryption key failed you, not me. You said so yourself. \u2013 Regardless, I need more time. I need you to return this necklace to the pcpd secure locker room, so no one will know it went missing. That\u2019ll give my people time to work on the decryption key, see where we went wrong. \u2013 I only am sorry you couldn\u2019t crack the code.

You are working so hard. We all are. The ball is going to be great. \u2013 I agree with sasha.

No. Please, anyone but bobbie! \u2013 You know what, felix? I agree with you. I just need to tell that annoying voice in my head to shut up. \u2013 Maxie? Maxie?\t[Stammering] Maxie? Come back.

Victor was already suspicious of her, and maybe now he\u2019s realized that she\u2019s working against him. \u2013 Well, if he knows, then we\u2019re done. Because eileen would turn on us in a heartbeat. \u2013 Or maybe she saw an opportunity, and she jumped on it. If she can get victor\u2019s decryption key, then that\u2019s going to make things a lot easier for us. \u2013 If we still have the real necklace, then we have the advantage. \u2013 Yeah. \u2013 Because victor needs it. He\u2019s been looking for it for a long time. He can\u2019t move forward without it. \u2013 I just hope he hasn\u2019t decided that eileen is standing in his way. \u2013 [Sighs] \u2013 I thought you were going to kick the door down. \u2013 Yeah.

Doesn\u2019t matter. We\u2019re over. Which really hurts because\u2026yes. I\u2019m still in love with chase. Ugh, I keep telling myself that I\u2019m gonna get over it and that the feelings will fade and eventually disappear. But every time I see him\u2026 your heart starts to race. Butterflies kick in, and it\u2019s all I can do but to grab him and tell him how badly I want him back.\t[ Doorbell rings ] Literally saved byhe bell. I\u2019ll get that. What is this? What, mousy librarian or something? You like it? No! It\u2019s not altogether original. Come on, let\u2019s go. Wait \u2014 mnh-mnh! Where? What do you mean, where? We\u2019re going back to the safe house. No. No? No. The nurses\u2019 ball cannot survive without me. Um, hello?! I\u2019m standing right here. All right. If victor realizes that you\u2019re alive, this whole operation goes up in smoke. Not to mention that people\u2019s lives are at risk. Do you understand that? Do you want that on your head? I\u2019m guessing this is why laura refused to sell charlotte\u2019s elq shares \u2014 because she knew you were still alive.\t[ Scoffs ] No more games, valentin. What is going on? A group of us, including laura, are working secretly against victor cassadine. Who else is in the group? Anna, felicia, robert scorpio, and\u2026 lucy coe. Not exactly a combat-ready bunch. I\u2019ll say. If victor is gonna use the same kind of firepower he did in crete, you\u2019re gonna need somebody with a military background. Do you have anyone in mind? Me.\tNo, o-of course I do not want people to die. I mean, come on. I didn\u2019t want luke to die. He w\u2013 he was a very special friend to me. You remember some of his nurses\u2019 ball performances? The disco that he did? He was so amazing. And this cause was so important to him, and he would want me to \u2014 stop talking! Okay, listen. I understand that you are so disappointed that you can\u2019t participate in this year\u2019s nurses\u2019 ball. But here\u2019s the thing. Victor is planning something big \u2014 potentially catastrophic. It is up to us to end it. At the expense of the nurses\u2019 ball? Come on! You know everything we have done, the nurses\u2019 ball did for robin! Oh, don\u2019t play the robin card with me. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m just saying that the nurses\u2019 ball is very, very important to you. I know. And if anybody knows, that\u2019s me. I know that. Exactly! That\u2019s my point! Maxie: Ladies! Enough! Okay, I cannot believe I\u2019m about to say this, but we already have a solution. Lucy came up with it. You\u2019re volunteering? Well, that depends. I need to hear the plan first. Victor cassadine has a long-term plan, some grand design that has to be stopped. I don\u2019t have details, but I know it involves a necklace. A necklace? Mm-hmm. Containing diamonds cut from the ice princess. What? But why is this necklace so important? And \u2014 and does it have anything to do with operation demeter? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know why victor cassadine would go to such great lengths to interrogate you over operation demeter. I just know that he wants the necklace because it has a code or a formula engraved on one of the stones. Those are beautiful. Um, is \u2014 is willow here? Oh, yeah. She\u2019s, um, in the living room. Chase. Hi. Willow. How are you feeling? Pretty much the same.\t[ Chuckles ] Well, that\u2019s not worse. So that\u2019s good.\t[ Chuckles lightly ] These are for you. You remembered. That you\u2019re obsessed with daffodils? Of course I remembered. Thank you. That is really, really sweet. I\u2019ll leave you two to visit. It\u2019s good to see you. It\u2019s good to see you, too.\t[ Sighs ] So, what\u2019s the latest? Big news \u2014 we\u2019ve decided to reschedule the wedding for after the bone marrow transplant. So there\u2019s more to celebrate. Exactly. Do you have a date for the transplant? Not yet. My \u201cgreat-aunt liesl\u201d was on medication that has to be completely out of her system before she can donate. So, in the meantime, I am keeping myself busy planning a summer wedding in the rose garden. Everyone\u2019s pitching in to pull it off. You know, brook lynn has been a huge help.\t[ Sighs ] Do not eavesdrop. Do not eavesdrop. Come on, brook lynn. Get it together. It doesn\u2019t surprise me that brook lynn is stepping up. You bring out the best in everyone. Oh, yeah? Yeah. Michael\u2019s a lucky guy. I thought I made it clear I don\u2019t want josslyn anywhe near this. You did. And you agreed. That\u2019s right. But the situation has changed. Yeah, apparently. You need to go, josslyn. What? We\u2019ll talk about this later. It\u2019s vital right now that I talk to dex. Michael. Michael, it doesn\u2019t matter, okay? There\u2019s no point. I already know that he\u2019s collecting evidence against sonny. I know about pikeman. What i didn\u2019t know was who he was working for. And now I do. All right. The job\u2019s over. You\u2019re leaving port charles tonight. Uh, rocco said he saw nina in the lobby, and she looked upset. For my self-absorbed teenager to notice that and then to tell me about it, she must have looked really upset, so I figured it had something to do with willow. No, no, everything\u2019s the same on that front. We\u2019re waiting on liesl to be cleared for the transplant. Oh, that\u2019s good. Yeah. All right, well, hey, look, your relationship with nina, that\u2019s your business. I don\u2019t want to pry. You want to talk, you know where to find me. I\u2019ll be down the hall. Rocco\u2019s right. Yeah. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s nina. She\u2019s upset. And it\u2019s my fault.\t", "As my employer, you can fire me, but you can\u2019t force me to leave port charles. He can\u2019t leave, michael. Sonny will think he\u2019s a traitor. And then what happens?\t[ Sighs ] Sonny will track him down and have him killed. But more importantly \u2014 more important than your life? I can\u2019t leave joss.\t[ Sighs ] Sounds like you two already talked about this. Yes, michael, we\u2019ve \u2014 we have talked about this, okay? Look, the best option is for dex to finish the job that you hired him to do so that you can turn sonny into the feds. This is why I didn\u2019t want you involved in this. Why not? You know how I feel about sonny. Okay? I feel the same way you do. Let me help you take him down. Right. And what happens after that? Sonny goes to prison where he belongs. And avery and donna are devastated. Not to mention dante and kristina. Now, I\u2019m prepared to deal with the fallout from that, to take on their anger and their blame. I didn\u2019t want any of that to fall on you! So, tell me. What\u2019s the deal with nina? Well, it\u2019s not like we\u2019re breaking up. At \u2014 at least, I hope not. I love her as much as ever. So what happened? She\u2019s experienced what I would call the realities of my world. It\u2019s a lot to process. Is that why you got the guards all over the building? I had a \u2014 a security issue. A security issue, huh? Yeah. We didn\u2019t hear anything about, um, shots fired or missing persons, so I\u2019m assuming you didn\u2019t report it to the police. I-I have reason to believe that the \u2014 the focus was solely on me. The reason I got guards on my kids and nina is \u2014 just a precaution? I told carly and ava I don\u2019t want donna or avery anywhere near me. I\u2019m guessing you told nina the same thing. I just hope that when this is over, she\u2019ll come back to me. What solution? Wasn\u2019t the whole point of this rude ambush to \u2014 excuse me. It wasn\u2019t a rude ambush. Might have been an ambush. Not a rude ambush. [ Chuckles ] Wasn\u2019t the whole point to get me to agree to be your eyes and ears of the nurses\u2019 ball? Uh, yes, but you seemed less than enthusiastic. Oh, I\u2019m sorry. Did I not have the reaction that you wanted? Oh, what, you needed, like, some time to adjust? Yes. And \u2014 and I happen to be an amazing event planner. I have my own ideas, my own vision, as you like to call it. So, I\u2019m happy to collaborate, lucy, but I will not just be taking your orders. You don\u2019t \u2014 y-y-you don\u2019t get it. We do not have time for collaboration. Don\u2019t you see? The nurses\u2019 ball is syncing up with the 60th anniversary of the hospital. Which means we are, like, right in front of this speeding freight train that\u2019s bearing down on us. I am the only one that can pull this off. I am the only \u2014 I agree. What was that? No. 100%. That you should do everything lucy tells you to do, just the way she tells you to do it. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re an excellent event planner, but I\u2019m sure that you\u2019re very capable of following lucy\u2019s lead, especially when it\u2019s for the greater good. Fine. Anything you want. \u201cJust the way\u201d\u2026 just the way you want it. Guys, I really think this could work.\tR latest duet. Oh, you liked it? I love it. It\u2019s a beautiful ballad. Thanks. The majority of the props should go to blaze. I mean, her vocals were off the charts. Maybe one of these days, a girl can actually get an autograph?\t[ Both laugh ] Willow, I never took you as a groupie. Well, I guess I just can\u2019t help myself. Your wish is my command.\t[ Laughs ]\t[ Sighs ] Are you gonna listen in on a private conversation, brook lynn? . You are not. You are a grown-up.\t[ Exhales deeply ]\t[ Playing chords ] Besides [Sighs] You don\u2019t want to know what chase thinks of you now, anyway.\t[ Plays chord ] Chase: You\u2019re also caring\u2026\tpassionate\u2026 and incredibly sexy\u2026 and I\u2019ve been falling for you for a long time now. And even if you don\u2019t feel the same way about me, I-I still had to tell you, because we miss 100% of the shots that we don\u2019t take. I couldn\u2019t agree more. I\u2019m sorry. Wanted to let you sleep in. Why would I want to sleep in when I could spend my morning with you? Oh. Chase: Just tell me. When were you gonna let me know that dante asked you to write a letter to the civilian complaint review board recommending that I get my badge back? Never? Brook lynn: We can work this out. Brook lynn, you lied to me! You kept me from the thing that makes me who I am. There\u2019s nothing to work out, all right? It\u2019s over!\t[ Plays discordant note ]\t[ Sighs ] You blew it, girl. Maybe you should write a song about that.\t[ Clears throat ] \u201cTo one of the bravest, strongest, and best people I know.\u201d Back at you.\t[ Inhales deeply ] So\u2026\t[ Chuckles ] What is it like being an honest-to-god rock star? Oh. [ Chuckles ] It\u2019s cool. I guess I\u2019m gonna miss it. Why are you going to miss it? Well, hopefully when the review board meets this spring, they\u2019re gonna reinstate me. Back to police life. If it all works out, yeah. I mean, look. Do I enjoy singing? Sure. But the only reason I have been performing is so I can stay in close proximity to blaze\u2019s sleazy manager. Brook lynn\u2019s ex-manager, right? Linc brown. He is the worst. I mean, sexual harassment, shady business practices, you name it. So is the plan to find something to charge him with or\u2026? And hopefully soon. Because I won\u2019t feel right going back to the force if it means leaving blaze and brook lynn to contend with that sleaze. Aha! \u201cAha\u201d? W-what does that mean? This is really about helping brook lynn. When sonny was holding dex because he suspected him of being the hook, you came to me for help. Yeah, I did.\t", "[ Scoffs ] How did I not see it? I should have known right then and there you were too close to this. I should have pulled the plug! No, no! You shouldn\u2019t have. Okay? Dex saved my life when heather attacked me on new year\u2019S. What are you talk\u2013 britt westbourne saved your life. Well, she helped fight heather off, yes, of course, but she was losing that battle until dex showed up. He\u2019s the one who fired at heather. That\u2019s what made her run off. I-I\u2019m just hearing about this now? Michael. I work for you. Anything related to that is fair game. But what I have with josslyn\u2026 it\u2019s personal. Why wouldn\u2019t nina come back? I mean, she\u2019s obviously crazy about you. I mean, she\u2019d have to be, given the grief that you guys went through over how you got together. I mean, after enduring all that, why would she just walk away? How do I explain this? I was a different man in nixon falls. Ha ha! No kidding. Kinder. Simpler. Hey. Yeah. But you know what I noticed? A lot of that kind of followed you back here. This has been a pretty peaceful time in your business. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. Hm. I was free to focus on my family. And nina? Yeah, she \u2014 she made me better in a lot of ways. She got you to cut back on your drinking. That\u2019s the least of it. I think \u2014 I think I misrepresented my life. Not that nina didn\u2019t know that it was dangerous or what I do for a living is allegedly\u2026 ah. Thank you for that. \u2026Illegal. But now\u2026 she\u2019s getting an up-close and personal view of it for the first time. What if she doesn\u2019t want to be in my life? What about you? What about me? If nina\u2019s not in it, is it still the life that you want? Uh, we haven\u2019t been able to crack the code, but we do know that it\u2019s pivotal to the success of my father\u2019s plan. And how do you know that? Because he\u2019s still looking for the necklace, with the help of his operative, eileen ashby. Wait a minute. Deputy mayor eileen ashby? Yeah, that\u2019s the one. She\u2019s working for victor? She was. Now she\u2019s working for us. We\u2019re having her deliver a duplicate necklace to victor. With a false code engraved on it. That\u2019s right, and we\u2019re hoping once he has what he thinks he needs, he\u2019ll make a move. So you trick victor into making his final play, but you don\u2019t give him the means to accomplish what he\u2019s actually after. And in the process, he incriminates himself. And that\u2019s how we\u2019re finally gonna bring down my father.\tSorry. Stay here. Alright. It\u2019s all clear. Lucy! I-I\u2019m c-coming. I\u2019m coming. I just \u2014 it\u2019s impossible to text with these glasses on. I just can\u2019t see what I\u2019m doing. Okay. You seem to be managing perfectly well. Confetti cannon or just a big drop? Hm. I don\u2019t know. Which would have the most impact? Can you just stop? What?! What are you doing? What \u2014 what \u2014 what is the problem? Hey! Hey, hey, hey! What is the problem? You almost got us all killed. Listen, this whole plan hinges on complete secrecy. Hence you and lucy faking your death and anna playing fugitive? Well, actually, victor thinks that anna is dead, as well. He thinks he\u2019s got a straight shot for the necklace. And he would have no idea that I was involved. So what do you say? Will you help us? But if secrecy is key, what are you doing out here out in the open like this? Lucy coe has gone rogue. Of course she has. She wants to take control of the nurses\u2019 ball. Anna\u2019s gone after her. So anna is risking discovery, too. I mean, maybe it\u2019s a good thing we showed up. Like you said, we\u2019re not exactly combat-ready. We could use you. You got me. I mean, yeah, the only reason I got into the music business was to help brook lynn. And at the beginning, it was great until I found out there was a lot of stuff that she wasn\u2019t telling me. I\u2019m sorry. You didn\u2019t deserve to be treated like that. Not by brook lynn. Or by me. Willow, I w-wasn\u2019t trying \u2014 I know you weren\u2019T. But it doesn\u2019t make it any less true. I married you when I was already in love with michael. Because you thought I was dying. We all did. I told myself I was doing the right thing, giving you one final gift to make you happy. And you don\u2019t believe that anymore? I-I do. My intentions weren\u2019t the problem. It\u2019s just\u2026 now that I\u2019m faced with dying myself\u2026 hey. You\u2019re not there yet. Faced with the possibility. I\u2019ve realized that life is not only too short, but too precious to waste any time on lies. Don\u2019t misunderstand. I am very grateful that you saved josslyn\u2019s life, okay? I don\u2019t even want to imagine what would have happened if you hadn\u2019t been there. Neither can I. But the bottom line is, we had a deal. We did. And when you first told me to stay away from josslyn, I had every intention of doing just that. Turned out to be impossible. So you lied. About my personal situation. I\u2019ve never lied about anything relating to pikeman or sonny. Speaking of, there\u2019s something you should know. Someone tried to kill sonny in an ambush the other night. Where? In one of his warehouses. Your father wasn\u2019t hurt, but I was grazed. Are you okay? I\u2019m fine. But the good news is, sonny trusts me now more than ever.\t"], "answer": [2, 3, 4, 0, 1]}

You, my dear, have nothing to worry about. Like a fine wine. You only get better with age. Ooh, nothing like being compared to a decile bottle in a shelf. What I mean is that with every passing day, I find you more and more intoxicated.\t", "And so I, uh, I feel better.\tFeel better. Yes. Those, those exercises really do. Okay. Ah, Ms. Peterson, thank you for coming in. Well, I\u2019ve got nothing to hide so you can even look through my phone, but just like last time, you won\u2019t find anything. Of course not. We aren\u2019t stupid enough to think that you\u2019d use your own phone to send me those text messages.\tRolling. Would you let me handle this, please? We know the text messages that she received on her phone were not sent from your phone. Yeah. We also know that doesn\u2019t mean a damn thing, so quit stalling and confess. Are you Rafe Snow Deputy? You lucky I don\u2019t have Badge A gun. Look. Do you have any evidence implicating me?\tNo. And do you have any more questions you\u2019d like to ask? I do actually, but just one. Did you send that text, Paulina? From a burner phone, I did not let me repeat myself for the people who might be too slow to catch it. I did not send that text.\tI think we\u2019re done here. No. No, we are not. No, no. Uhuh. We\u2019re not done here. Not even close. You wicked long. You little suck your bus. You are going to pay for what you put us through. You can call me names all you want, Ms. Price, but that doesn\u2019t change the facts. I didn\u2019t send you that text. I didn\u2019t write you those letters.\tAnd I sure as hell to drug those biscuits. Your daughter, so gleefully handed out to half the town. I\u2019m just Leave, leave, leave. What your Oh, I can\u2019t walk. Can\u2019t stand beside of it. And one more. Fact that you may wanna be aware of. It\u2019s clear I\u2019m not the only one in this town who wants to see you suffer. So if I were you, I would watch my back.\tOkay? Be honest. Is it weird that I\u2019m so inexperienced? No. Weird. No, no, no, no. Just, um, surprising. Like I said, the way you kiss, I never would\u2019ve known. So there must have been someone that you had some practice with?\tUh, yeah. There was this guy that I met in New York right after med school. We had an instant connection To say I feel hard doesn\u2019t even come close to describing it. I swear I do anything for that man still. I\u2019m sorry. You just said would as in present tense, like you\u2019re still with him.\tYou care about your family? I\u2019m calling very much sir. Then you get while I\u2019m worried about my sister. Look, I\u2019m not here to get anyone jammed up. I am here purely out of concern for Talia. So why don\u2019t you tell me how you know her? Once again, I don\u2019t know her. We both know that\u2019s a lie. As I said to that Scottish wanker, I am under no obligation to answer any questions about who enters or exits my room.\tYou will be if I get a warrant and once the courts are involved, believe me, it\u2019s going to get very complicated. I\u2019m going to close the door now, detective, and I would appreciate it if you went away. Rest assured. Mr. Firth, I\u2019m going to find out who you are and how you know my sister and you will talk again.\tI was at the hospital last night and I realized that my period was late. So Kayla ran some tests and it turns out that I\u2019m pregnant with Eric\u2019s baby. No, I mean, ma, maybe. But Anna didn\u2019t you hear me say I don\u2019t know who the father is. Okay, so it could be ej? Yes. Or Eric? Yes. Or Eric. I don\u2019t know why this is so difficult to understand.\t", "We have known each other for a very long time, and I can say unequivocally that you have never been more radiant and alluring than you are right now.\tOkay? Allow me, Jay, and Tamira, you are spoiling me. You deserve to be spoiled. Ooh. I don\u2019t know about that. But as I, as I told you the other night, I have noticed the effort, effort you\u2019ve made. Show me that I\u2019m important to you and that means so much to me, and I\u2019m also grateful. You\u2019ve been so cool about Eric and me.\tNow you\u2019ve both slept together. Oh God, you can say it. You can say it and why wouldn\u2019t I be cool about it? You told me. I meant nothing. I didn\u2019t and we were, we\u2019re not in our right minds. Which is why I\u2019ve decided to let it go. It was an isolated incident that changes nothing between us, so I see no reason why we can\u2019t forget all about it and move on.\tGuilty is charged. I mean, I. I ran into EJ last night and I told him that, you know, I caught you and Nicole in bet together. I assumed he knew. Is there any particular reason why you didn\u2019t gimme a heads up? Well, I was under the impression that EJ was just gonna let it go. God, I can\u2019t believe he punched you.\tI mean, I\u2019m so sorry. No, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m fine. Fine. How is this fine. You were assaulted Eric. I mean, this could have all been avoided, had Nicole just told EJ herself. You, you guys did nothing wrong. Okay. I mean, this only happened because those biscuits were drugs. I mean, it didn\u2019t mean anything. Right. Yeah, right.\tGod, if EJ would just stop targeting you and he would just turn his focus to Chanel, the Demonn Baker of Salem. I mean, thank God the Health Department shut her down before she killed someone. You know, the health Department shut down my baby\u2019s bakery even though, you know, had nothing to do with those tainted biscuits.\tI know that. I\u2019m sorry. I feel terrible for everything junior family are going through. Oh. How you feel? Doesn\u2019t help me rap. I need you to do get up there and arrest the Luna. Tickle who\u2019s trying to ruin our lives. As I have said before, I can\u2019t do anything without evidence. Where\u2019s your damn evidence? Okay.\tYeah. It\u2019s from a block number, probably a burner phone. Well, of course that woman\u2019s not stupid enough to use her own phone. Yeah. Which is why there is no proof that Sloan sent it, and why we can\u2019t be sure that someone else isn\u2019t responsible for this. The tainted biscuits, the trashing of your office and the threatening messages.\tOh, no, no, not this, not this again. Are you really going to waste more of my time and your breath trying to tell me the threat is coming from that sweet girl Talia. I\u2019m sorry, who exactly was it that said they saw your sister Talia? Right. Coming outta my room, Chloe Lane. Does that name ring a bell? No. No it doesn\u2019t.\tOkay. How about Xander Cook, large man Scottish accent. He said you two had some words. I see. Yeah, you were talking about my nosy neighbor. He\u2019s a bit of a winker. That one. Be that as it may, Mr. Cook and Ms. Lane both remember seeing Talia leaving this room the other day, but you\u2019re insisting that she was never here.\tAnd that you do not know her. Is that right? What was all of this about? Is your sister in some kind of trouble? I certainly hope not, but you will be if you don\u2019t start answering my questions. So let\u2019s start with an easy one. What\u2019s your name? Colin. Colin What? Faith. Seriously. It\u2019s quite a coincidence really.\tTons of people actually ask me for my autograph. Well, you don\u2019t have to worry about that with me, but I am gonna ask you to show me some id.\tHello? A latte. Fancy. Yeah. My mom had this espresso machine flown in from. Italy for Abe and don\u2019t tell mama, but Abe privately told me that he prefers instant. This stuff is way too strong for him. They still make instant coffee. Yeah. Mr. Mayor is old school. Anyway, I made it just the way you like it. I hope you did.\t", "Wow. I was closing down the library. Oh my God. He must think I\u2019m like such a dork or something. No, no, not at all. I just think you found your focus a lot sooner than I did. So when did you find yours? Well, I definitely didn\u2019t have it. When I first got to Salem, I was a hot mess. And then my mama got, uh, Lonnie, my big sister, to talk some sense into me.\tAnd boy did she ever, she told me that I had all these opportunities and advantages and she, she made me realize that I was just throwing them all away. And so then I, I decided I didn\u2019t wanna do that anymore. I wanted to turn my life around, and you did. Lonnie said that if I wanted to make my dreams come true, then there were no shortcuts.\tIt\u2019s all about hard work. And so I buckled down and I got serious and. They paid off, and that is why even though it hurts to see sweet bits being shut down, I will not stop fighting back against the haters that made it happen. There is no way in hell that they are going to win. Look at you. You\u2019re a real badass, aren\u2019t you?\tYep. Just like my mama,\tTalia Hunter is a lovely young woman, hardworking, smart, kind. How could you possibly think she\u2019s behind any of this? I told you I don\u2019t. There was a brief period in time when we had some questions, but she was able to answer all those and she has no motive. Unlike that psychopath, Sloan Peterson, who came to town with the express purpose of getting revenge on me and my baby girl.\tWhat do you want me to do? How about your job? I tune into Peacock every single day to watch lower and order. So I know the drill. Get the perp in the room, sit \u2019em in a tiny room, get \u2019em under those lights, and then gorilla. And then crocker like a bad eggs. She is All right. Okay. Like a bring Sloan down here for questioning.\tBut as you already know, detective Hunter executed a search warrant at her place and they found nothing. Additionally, Sloane came down here and she gave her phone to our tech team, and there was no incriminating evidence. Oh, just gimme, gimme, gimme five minutes along with, behind that tiny room. Five minutes.\tFucking happen. No. Ooh, you hang here. Oh, sit down. Oh, do your breathing exercises take. Just sit and breathe.\tCommissioner to what do I owe the displeasure someone in need of a good defense attorney. Well, somebody is going to. Paulina Price. Just received another threatening text message. You want me to come in for questioning? I would appreciate the cooperation. I can even send a car for you. Don\u2019t bother. I know the way.\tGreat. We\u2019ll see you soon.\tLet me go to the station with you. Oh, I\u2019m a big girl. I can fight my own battles. Especially Raven is a NT crew of morons. All right. Just know I got you back and all of me.\tWow. EJ knows. That you\u2019ve slept with Eric and he hasn\u2019t blown a gasket. That\u2019s one for the books, huh? Oh, that\u2019s because he knows. It only happens because Eric and I were high. All right. Right. Yeah. Well, so turns out you had nothing to worry about after all, and yet you look pretty worried right now.\tActually, and I, I am, because now I have to figure out what to do with this new secret that I\u2019m keeping from him. What New secret? Oh yeah. You\u2019re not gonna believe this because I can hardly believe it myself. Nothing shocks me anymore. Whatever it is. You can just lay it on me.\tI\u2019m pregnant and, and I don\u2019t know if the father is EJ or Eric.\tSo Nicole slept with Eric only because they\u2019ve been drugged by those bloody biscuits. The judgment was severely impaired just like mine was when I, yeah, when your acid assets ended up on a cup machine in Tamara. You seem surprisingly calm about all of this. Oh, believe me, when I first found out I was enraged, but I finally came to my senses, I realized that what happened between Nicole and her ex was meaningless.\t"], "answer": [1, 3, 0, 4, 2]}

That\u2019s right. I am back and flying solo tonight. It is my pleasure to interview the arrivals, critique their fashion, and get a little down low on their personal lives. But first I want to pay tribute to general hospital itself, which opened its doors on april 1, 1963. That\u2019s right, ladies and gentlemen. Our beloved general hospital is 60 years old. Oh, this place has meant so much to so many over the years, myself included, and I am honored to be here to celebrate its 60th anniversary. On a more somber note, tonight is dedicated to the life of the late head nurse epiphany johnson and the late lucy coe, whose time here at the nurses ball was more than an event. It was her life\u2019s work. Oh. They love me. They really love me. So anyway, don\u2019t change that dial there, port charles. Leave it right where it is because I can promise you this.

Oh, my goodness. So ok, so there\u2019s a story behind this, folks. I was supposed to be in milan this week, but when maxie reached out and explained that the date of the nurses ball had been moved up to sync with the hospital\u2019s 60th anniversary, well, milan had to wait. There was no way I was gonna miss this. Oh, we are so glad that you adjusted your schedule. I mean, tonight is a very special evening, and you make it even better. Ok. Let\u2019s get down to business. Who are you wearing? Cartullo. Maha cheng. Well chosen. And you both should be congratulated for your fashion and for staging this spectacular event in record time. Quite an achievement. Well, bobbie and i have followed the example set by lucy coe through many successful years of the nurses ball. It\u2019s safe to say lucy\u2019s spirit is guiding us tonight. I only hope we can make her proud. Thank you, maxie. That is so sweet. Ok. Credit where credit is due. It is your extraordinary talent and commitment that is making tonight happen.\tWell, as a member of the gh community, I am just happy, and I\u2019m grateful to be here tonight. Ok, since you ladies are staying so humble, I am going to brag because I\u2019ve been told by multiple sources that this is going to be the best nurses ball ever. Oh. Really?

Well, that\u2019s very nice of you guys. Thank you, I just didn\u2019t want to head to the nurses ball without coming to see you both and tell you that you\u2019ll be missed.

That\u2019s bobbie\u2019s daughter, carly spencer, the ex-mrs. Sonny corinthos, and her gorgeous daughter josslyn jacks. Wow. Your mom looks gorgeous tonight.\tSo, carly, I know there\u2019s been some changes for you in the last year.\tMm, a few. Well, you seem to be weathering them in style. Well, what can I say? With my mother and my daughter by my side and the love and support of my family and friends, I\u2019m up for any challenge. Mm, well, everyone knows you\u2019re a fighter, carly. Any interest in reclaiming any of what was once yours? Well, to quote a great man, \u201csuccess is not final. \u201cFailure is not fatal. It is the courage to continue that counts.\u201d Poetic but short on details. Look, I\u2019ve always truly gotten whatever I wanted, and I don\u2019t expect that to change. Uh-huh. And what about you, josslyn? I\u2019ve heard that you\u2019re a lot like your mom and grandmother. Well, I hope so. Well, do you usually get what you want?\t[Lively jazz music] So far so good. Ladies, enjoy the show. Thank you so much. Yes, yes, yes. Oh, this night keeps getting better. Sonny corinthos has just joined us.\t[Soft dramatic music]\tI feel bad not being there to run interference for my mom and sister. Carly and joss don\u2019t need anyone to stand up for them. So, so true. Anyway, I better get going. Have so much fun. Hey, give everyone our best. I will. I get that drew and your mom can\u2019t go public because of the whole insider trading thing, but I sure hope that she\u2019s better at hiding her feelings than he is. I like that they don\u2019t have to hide their feelings around us. Because we\u2019re a family. You said it.\t[Tender music]\tAll right. Come on.\t[Lively jazz music]\tLet\u2019s all play nice tonight. I will on my end. Come on. Let\u2019s get going. Mr. Corinthos. Hello, sydney. Call me sonny. It\u2019s great to see you tonight. Ah. Just so you know, this is the highlight of my evening. You know, you just get handsomer every year. And you just get more gorgeous. I can\u2019t imagine. Ok. I appreciate a man who knows how to pay a compliment. And with dimples. Ha, even better. Ok. So now who is this with you? He\u2019s\u2013he\u2019s-he\u2019s my bodyguard. Oh. And do you have a name, bodyguard? Dex heller. Ok. Nice to meet you, dex heller. Listen, you do a good job protecting this man. He\u2019s very valuable to a lot of people. Understood. Mm-hmm. So I\u2019m surprised that you\u2019re here alone with just your bodyguard, sonny, but where is my former red carpet co-host, the gorgeous nina reeves tonight? Oh, oh, there she is. I just\u2013oh. And with a very fine, unexpected guest.\tI just think we\u2019re gonna need more time for the results. That\u2019s all. Hi. I\u2019m so sorry to interrupt but, doc, you seem to have forgotten that you have plans tonight. You, me, and the nurses ball. Right. I really want to. I\u2019m not sure how to manage this. Dr. Robinson just asked me to do a consult. Oh, no, no, no. Go. Make yourself handsome. You have to walk the red carpet. You have to make a splashy entrance. Don\u2019t want to be late. She sounds like a woman with a very specific plan. It\u2019s ok. I can hold down the fort. Ok. Thanks. I\u2019ll be right back. So why aren\u2019t you ditching that lab coat and slipping into your sexiest gown? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I won\u2019t be going. Curtis will be there, and that\u2019s why I picked up a shift tonight. Curtis filed for divorce. No. No. Not that I know of. Well, then he\u2019s still your husband, isn\u2019t he? And trina is still your daughter. Ok. So you made a mistake. Big mistake, but it\u2019s not like you burned the city to the ground. My unsolicited advice, use that ticket.\t[Tender music] Sydney, always a pleasure. Absolutely.\t", "[Ominous music]\tOk, I\u2019m all for this family togetherness, but you two handsome, unattached bachelors could be making better use of your time.

Everyone was wondering if nurse elizabeth baldwin would be making an appearance tonight, and here she is. Oh, you look lovely, elizabeth. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Beautiful. Enjoy. Enjoy.\tHey, uh, I wasn\u2019t sure you\u2019d come tonight. You weren\u2019t the only one. May I escort you? Sure you want to be seen with me? It\u2019d be my honor.\t[Camera shutters clicking]\tHere you go, mr. Corinthos. Thank you very much. Hey. Sam, dante, you look good. How are you doing? So do you. You do too. It\u2019s a special night. We wouldn\u2019t have missed it. Well, at least sonny had the good grace not to walk the red carpet with nina, or is there another reason why he showed up with a bodyguard and no date? Yeah, um, sonny\u2019s got a situation. Sonny has always got a situation. He better not bring it to the nurses ball. That\u2019s all I have to say. I don\u2019t think he would do anything to mess up the nurses ball. You know how important it is to him. Ok, yeah, I\u2019ll give him credit for that. That\u2019s all I will give him credit for. You don\u2019t have to be mad at sonny on my account. No. I\u2019m not mad on your account. I\u2019m mad on my account. Well, maybe a little on yours. No. It\u2019s actually hypocritical. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re away from sonny. I want to see you with somebody who\u2019s going to treat you with all the consideration and all the love you deserve. You know what, mom, you just might get your wish.\tAnd now please say hello to the face of deception herself, sasha gilmore, arriving solo. Oh. Oh, I spoke too soon. Sasha\u2019s escorted by\u2026 cody bell. She\u2019s being escorted by cody bell.\tCody bell. Yeah. And your producer should have prepped you. I would have prepped you for that. Mm. No. No. Don\u2019t turn it off. I\u2019m just\u2013I\u2019m just muting it during the commercials, although I am wondering if we should just record it and go to bed. I mean, after all, tomorrow is a huge day for you. No, the ball hasn\u2019t even started yet. I want to see it. You sure? Absolutely. It\u2019s exactly what the doctor ordered.\t[Tender music] Well, we are just moments away from the start of the 2023 nurses ball. I\u2019m sydney val jean saying good night. It has been my pleasure to serve as your host and catch you up on the movers and shakers of port charles.

We traced the car that the late lucy coe recently hired.\t[Ominous music] I refuse to let tonight turn into a total disaster. What do they say? The show must go on.

Ah, actually I checked in with the lead attorney at the firm that you hired for your case, and he said it\u2019s been pretty quiet. Hmm. No news. Good news. Right.

Yeah, Regina. Yeah, this is Paul. No. No, I haven\u2019t. I haven\u2019t checked my messages yet up, but I was what? What do you mean? All of my assets were frozen? I don\u2019t even know.

When have you decided to start passing judgment? She is the opposite of everything you believe in.\tDon\u2019t, no, do not tell me what I believe in. I\u2019ve lived my entire life. Or some moral code. I know I was there. Yeah.

I\u2019m sorry that I ran out on you like that. Let me take a look at those. Maybe that\u2019s a good idea.\tI think I\u2019ve figured out what\u2019s wrong with me.

But your father asked you not to it. It\u2019s okay. Right? He, he knows all about it. He\u2019s fine with it. What do you think your father\u2019s keeping from you? I don\u2019t know, but it, it feels a little weird. Okay. I, I have a hard time believing that Uncle Stephanie is using drugs, but you\u2019re the one that found the vial in the office.\tSo what other explanation is there? Maybe whoever\u2019s taking those drugs isn\u2019t doing it. Volunt. What do you mean? What if one Demer brother is drugging? The other one?\tI told Karen to hold out. Cole, would you mind getting that? Please? No\tstep.\tHello.\tI guess it wasn\u2019t important\tshall get to work you.\tWell disclosure, I didn\u2019t follow you, nor did I hire someone to. I found out that you faked that call to Ariana School. I knew you were in the park because I tracked your phone. Jing one said that if I stooped to that, then I needed to let you go. And I think she\u2019s right. I think we should end our marriage right now.\tHow could you not see this coming? You, you told Bell just this morning everything was quiet. Some Peterson freezing all of my assets that is not quiet. And you could imagine how much fun it was to hear it coming from her and, and not my lawyers who are charging me an arm and a leg on an hour when he faces us.\tWell, you not anymore. You\u2019re all fire. Well, uh, that might have been a little hasty. I don\u2019t need them. I\u2019ve got you.

You have a new vocation now. You\u2019re gonna be a shallow jerk and God only knows that you are the perfect person to show you the robes.\tYou know what? Have fun tonight. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll read about it tomorrow.\tYou think it\u2019s an advantage that I\u2019m in the loop. I don\u2019t say this often enough. For Johnny was right. You never say that. Actually, it\u2019s a good idea to have someone who works with Steph and be aware that there might be a problem. You know? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Maybe instead of spying on him, it could be a good idea to just talk to him directly.\tDon\u2019t ask him if he\u2019s using perhaps down the line, but I don\u2019t wanna take that step until we\u2019re sure of our facts. I don\u2019t want rumors in innuendo flying around the office, and I don\u2019t want board members using it as ammunition against Stephan. I think we should keep what we know to ourselves. Because we all know that we only have Stephan\u2019s best interest at heart.\tHey, are you all right? Fine. I would imagine he\u2019s a little disappointed at the way his day is going. Did you find it clause 2.6 on marital duties? Yes, Lee, I found. I don\u2019t mean to keep harping on it, but I think it\u2019s only fair that you know the contract and everything that you signed so you don\u2019t, you know, slip up.\tI mean, it would be a travesty to lose all those shares and all that lovely power because that one can\u2019t keep his hands off you and. With the stakes this high, even the appearance of infidelity could be disastrous to you. Well, thank you for looking out for me, for looking out for my best interests. I just don\u2019t want there to be any misunderstandings down the road.\tBut like I said, you already told him to take a hike even before you knew the consequences, and I have to.

I will file a motion and have this undone. I\u2019m just delaying the inevitable. When this is done, I\u2019m gonna have all of your houses, all your businesses, in every last crumb from your daughter\u2019s baker.\tYou know, it\u2019s been my experience that a marriage doesn\u2019t survive when the man has been possessed by the devil. It can be hard to find closure. Tell me about it now. Now that alley\u2019s out of the picture. We thinking about starting over with Johnny.\tActually, no. He\u2019s moved on with Wendy Shin,\tyou know? Hmm. I think you and I have something in common. Yeah. The love of Ancho. We both have families where it\u2019s impossible to know when or if someone is telling the truth. Do you think my dad\u2019s lying? I truly don\u2019t know, but I do have a strong feeling that he didn\u2019t confide in us just because he is worried about his brother.\tAre you implying that you think my father might have a hidden agenda? What is this about ej?\tYou were going to see Gabby, weren\u2019t you? Surprised you back so soon. Don\u2019t tell me there\u2019s trouble in paradise.\tYou seem. Such insight. You just spelled out the term for the contract and put me on alert to stay away from Stephan, a fellow you needed to know. Oh, and thank you for that. Now I\u2019m gonna tell you what you need to know. I will not put up with being stalked. I don\u2019t follow. Oh, you literally did follow. How did you know where I was?\t", "I\u2019ll leave you with your memories of your days in the sun. Okay. Bye-Bye.\tDid you enjoy that, Nicole?\tNo. No, Eric, I didn\u2019t.\tIt didn\u2019t look like she was telling you she was married. It looked like she was kissing you. Believe me, Lee, when I say that, that was a one-sided kiss. Really? Yes. You see, Gabby texted me. Meet her here to talk. And I was like, Baba Booie. This is the first day of the rest of our new life together. And then she got here and then she was like, whoa, whoa, whoa.\tStop the clock. And she told me about the, the grand gesture that you made to, to save your marriage. Right. It was a simple contract, basically you promising her your demaris shares in exchange for, for six months. And forced cohabitation. And I gotta tell you that that is one of the most romantic things I have ever heard in my life.\tAnd despite that, I said to her, screw the contract, run away with me. You know, in the name of love. But she was adamant and determined to stick to the. And that\u2019s when I mistakenly thought that the arter of my kiss could convince her to renig on her side of the agreement. And that\u2019s when you showed up in the nick of time, as it were.\tOh, no, Lee, Lee, Lee, you had nothing to worry about because as much as I hate to admit it, as you can see, my words did not sway. A bit, Stephen. I don\u2019t like to be jumped and I don\u2019t like it when a man doesn\u2019t listen.

{"content": ["[ Sighs ] Well, I\u2019m sorry for crashing your time with drew. Are you kidding? Don\u2019t apologize. This is your home. I\u2019m always happy to see you. I know, but you guys don\u2019t get to spend a ton of time together since you have to keep things on the down low. Yeah, well, that may be changing, so\u2026 really? Mm-hmm. Oh, my god, I\u2019m so happy to hear that. Well, I mean, it\u2019s still in the works, but I\u2019m cautiously optimistic. Well, I hope it works out. You know, you deserve to be able to go out and show the world how happy drew makes you. Yeah. So do you. Being in a secret relationship\u2019s a lot of fun, but it comes with baggage, josslyn. And we\u2019re back to dex. Yeah, we\u2019re back to dex. \u2018Cause I\u2019m your mom and I\u2019m always going to want to protect you and stop you from getting hurt. I mean, forget about what sonny would do if he finds out that you\u2019ve been seeing dex behind his back. But you grew up in that world. You saw me deal with it every day. Are you sure you want that for yourself? Dex is planning on getting out of sonny\u2019s organization. Seriously, josslyn? You\u2019re going to hang your future on a vague promise? Dex: Option three\u2026 I get evidence against sonny. I turn it over to my real boss, who turns it over to the feds. Sonny goes to prison. I\u2019m in the clear. Option three it is. Option three. No matter what happens\u2026 I can\u2019t walk away from you. Good. I don\u2019t want you to. It\u2019s not like that. Dex has a real plan. Okay. Like what?\tYou bring up some good points. It\u2019s a win-win for you, ned. We regain valentin\u2019s stock and I extract myself from elq. Well, you\u2019ve given me a lot to think about. Michael, if you help plan the nurses\u2019 ball, it will give us something to look forward to. We won\u2019t just be focusing on waiting for the transplant. We\u2019ll have something positive to pour our energy into, something that benefits us, G.H., And the entire city.\t[ Exhales deeply ] Well, how can I say no to that? Awesome. Thank you. Our first meeting is tomorrow, and I will call you tonight to go over all the details. Got it.\t[ Door closes ]\t[ Chuckles ] Alright. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. You know what? You\u2019re my world, willow. There isn\u2019t anything I wouldn\u2019t do for you. So, what do you say? You up for another one? No reason not to. Cody, I, uh\u2026 think you dropped something. I don\u2019t hate you, gladys.\t[ Exhales deeply ] Thank you. But I don\u2019t like that you went behind my back. Understood. I get where you were coming from. And you\u2019re probably right. Left to my own devices, I probably would have never parted ways with the garage. I couldn\u2019t bear it. Well, just so you know, it wasn\u2019t easy for me, either. Well, I guess that, maybe in a not-so-good way, it worked out for the best. Instead of hanging over us, the garage is gone, and we\u2019re forced to move forward. I can see why my son fell for you. I miss him. Honey, I do, too.\t[ Crying ] Oh. Oh! Your theory is good, ava. It is. But that\u2019s all it is \u2014 a theory. Mm-hmm. Theory that could turn the tables. Here, now, you have important information about carly, just like she had important information about you. The question is, what are you gonna do with it? Look, you and drew are working on finding a way that you can be together out in the open. Dex and i want that, too. And I know that dex is gonna get out of the mob for good. Well\u2026 I know you believe that. And I think dex probably believes that he can leave that world. But take it from someone who has been very close to it most of my life. Once you\u2019re in, josslyn, it\u2019s really hard to leave. But it is possible. It is, but the way out is usually death. It\u2019s isolated, which is good. Less chance someone notices the shipment whenever it arrives. It\u2019d be a good idea to put cameras up outside, monitor anyone approaching. I-I got somebody on that. How many points of entry? Sonny! Get down!\t[ Gunshot ]\t", "And olivia said that ned was about to turn drew and carly in to the sec. Huh. So\u2026 so sonny knows something, and he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s choosing not to tell you. How does that feel? How\u2019s the cooking, dex? Any new recipes? Uh, not yet, but I have been doing a lot of thinking since we last spoke. I\u2019ve made no secret that I want to advance in your organization, but I understand that my ambition has made me too inclined to act on my own instead of focusing on doing whatever it is that you need me to do, big or small. And I want to fix that mistake. Got it. I told you that I wanted you to be part of the pikeman shipment, and I shut you out, and you probably think that\u2026 \u2026I pulled the rug out from under you. You\u2019re the boss running your business how you see fit. And I know that I need to prove that I\u2019m trustworthy. Yeah, you still need to prove yourself. But that\u2019s not why I shut you out. The pikeman deal is a snake pit. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019m working with these people, and I don\u2019t even trust the guy who referred them. So, the less you know, the less I have reason to blame you\u2026 \u2026if it goes sideways.\tDeception\u201d? I don\u2019t knowwhat you\u2019re talking about. I have the day off work. I\u2019m talking about your lies, gladys. Please tell me that you did not sell brando\u2019s garage. H-how did you hear about that? So it\u2019s true. You actually sold it? Yes, I did. I cannot believe that you would sell my husband\u2019s garage without asking me. Hell, forget about asking. You did not even tell me. How could you do that, gladys? It was time, sasha. You told me that we would hold off until I was ready. You don\u2019t have the final say, sweetheart. What was that? We both know the situation. The court put me in charge for your \u2014 oh, forget about the damn court. You and I had an arrangement as family. And the spirit of that arrangement was that you would consult with me. You had no right to sell brando\u2019s garage behind my back. I was just trying to do what is best.\tHow was that best for me? Well, it\u2019s not all about you! I did it for me! Mac. Uh, what \u2014 what brings you here? I had some police business with the quartermaines, and, um, I thought I owed you a visit. I saw that you reached out a few times, and I feel bad for not responding. Y-yeah, I\u2019m sorry. I-I just thought maybe you wanted to talk after what you went through with ryan chamberlain. Uh, but it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s dumb, because you\u2019re a cop, and you\u2019ve obviously dealt with killing a criminal before. So, sorry if it seemed like I was hounding you. I appreciate it. Really. You know, I, uh \u2014 I should\u2019ve called you back, but\u2026 yeah, no, hey, I\u2019m not much of a talker, either, especially when it comes to emotional stuff. You know, when \u2014 when I have a lot of things on my mind, I tend to just hop on the back of a horse and go for a ride. You ever try it? In my younger days, I spent some time on a ranch in the outback. Why\u2019d you stop riding? Haven\u2019t had much opportunity since I left australia. Well, take it from me. It\u2019s the best way to unwind.\t[ Chuckles ] I don\u2019t think I could get this old leg up over a saddle. Something tells me it\u2019s not just like riding a bike. Oh, sure it is. I mean, horses are just like giant bikes with minds of their own.\t[ Chuckles ] Ah, those were the days. Riding out into the bush with my friends. The end of the day, we\u2019d head over to the pub and put back a few bludger pale ales. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. You \u2014 you drank bludgers? You\u2019ve heard of them? Uh, okay. A while back, I did a stunt gig with this guy from australia, and that\u2019s all he drank, was bludgers. So I-I developed a taste for them. You\u2019re kidding. I didn\u2019t think anyone in the U.S. Heard of bludger. Uh, yeah. Okay. Alright. Don\u2019t tell mama q, but a few weeks ago, i might have put a case of bludgers on the grocery order. And I still have a couple. You want one? I am off the clock. Aurora media will be at your disposal for the nurses\u2019 ball, and I will make a personal donation, as well. Thank you. But I\u2019m not just here for the money. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m taking the donation. But I was hoping you would join the planning committee. You\u2019re kidding, right? I mean, what about brook lynn? I mean, she\u2019s the one with entertainment experience. I\u2019m \u2014 right, but you\u2019re a respected figure in the community. You have tons of connections to local businesses because of your work at aurora and elq. Not to mention, both sides of your family have close relationships with the hospital, so you\u2019re just the person I need for this committee. It is a good cause, michael. Oh, yeah, no, it\u2019s a great \u2014 it\u2019s a great cause. It really is. It\u2019s just maybe it\u2019s not \u2014 uh, look, I\u2019m sorry, maxie. I-I can\u2019T. Not with everything going on right now. It\u2019s not \u2014 michael, before you rule it out, I think you should consider it. Ned: Drew. Ned. I should warn you, maxie is in there hustling up support for the nurses\u2019 ball. Oh. [ Chuckles ] Well, I\u2019m happy to hear it\u2019s back on again, though hard to imagine without lucy. But I\u2019m sure maxie\u2019s gonna do a great job. I agree.\t[ Sighs ] Hey, ned, um\u2026 the family managed to come together for willow and michael\u2019s sake, but, obviously, elq is still the elephant in the room, right? So\u2026 I\u2019ve got a proposal to make all this tension a thing of the past. Something\u2019s wrong. Sasha\u2019s not happy. Sasha: Brando was supposed to be my guardian, and he would have never sold something that I treasured\u2026 are \u2014 are you going to go talk to her? \u2026Without asking me. No. I mean, not right now. I mean, she knows I\u2019m there for her, and if she needs me, she knows where to find me. Okay, well, then, back to carly. Okay. Okay. You know, I\u2019m never thrilled when carly and sonny have an interaction, but I\u2019ve come to terms with the fact that, unfortunately, carly is always going to have a presence in our lives. And despite my feelings towards carly, I can\u2019t really blame sonny for trying to protect her. I mean, she is his ex-wife. Especially from the feds. So, ned \u2014 he has some kind of information that could get carly and drew in trouble with the sec. I wonder what that could be. Yeah, I have no idea. I\u2019m not sure. Well, we\u2019re smart. Let\u2019s figure it out. Now, I know that carly and drew wouldn\u2019t keep their relationship quiet to spare anybody\u2019s feelings. No, there\u2019s gotta be a compelling reason that they\u2019re not going public. Could the legal consequences that sonny mentioned actually involve jail time? I\u2019m guessing that fines wouldn\u2019t matter much to someone with quartermaine money. That makes sense. But what I don\u2019t get is the secrecy. Everyone knows that drew and carly, they got close. I mean, the reason that I own half this hotel is because carly was trying to help out drew and michael during that whole, you know, aurora/elq merger. Well, that\u2019s it! What? That\u2019s what? Yes, that \u2014 I-I know what carly and drew are so afraid of. Uh, I\u2019m leaving you out of the\u2026pikeman deal because I see that you have potential, and I want to \u2014 I want to bring you up in the business, and I want to make sure you do it well. You understand me? I appreciate the faith, but I would think that if you saw potential in me, you would want to test that by giving me more responsibility, not leaving me out. I just need to be careful how I bring you up. Because if the deal goes south, I\u2019ll know you had nothing to do with it. Makes sense. Does not mean\u2026 you still can\u2019t help me.\t", "I-I agree that the nurses\u2019 ball is a worthy cause, and under normal circumstances, I would do it in a heartbeat, but\u2026 look, with willow\u2019s bone marrow transplant coming up, it\u2019s \u2014 right now, we can\u2019t do anything about that except wait. What about the \u2014 the wedding? I have the wedding under control, along with help from your mom, your sister, sasha, brook lynn, and olivia. What about the newborn baby? We\u2019re lucky enough to have help. Oh, sounds like you\u2019re out of excuses, michael.\t[ Scoffs ] The community really needs this. And so do I. Do it for me?\t[ Sighs ]\t[ Bottles clink ] Oh, this brings me back. Me, too. Reminds me of simpler times in my life.\t[ Exhales sharply ] I don\u2019t know how things got so complicated. I can only imagine how difficult it must be having to take someone\u2019s life in the line of duty.\t[ Exhales deeply ] You know, I\u2019ve been a cop for about 30 years. And killing ryan, even though it\u2019s hardly not the first time I\u2019ve had to take a life while on the job, this was different. How so?\t[ Grunts ] Oh, man. Ryan chamberlain and I, we\u2019ve had a complicated history. This was a man who terrorized my family for decades because of his obsession with felicia. But he was also the twin brother of my best friend, kevin. He knew how twisted and downright evil ryan could be. I mean, it wasn\u2019t that many years ago when ryan actually managed to switch places with kevin. He had him locked up and drugged up in ferncliff asylum. Ryan pretended to be kevin. Man, this guy sounds pretty \u2014 pretty messed up. Yeah, he was. But he was also kevin\u2019s brother. And I don\u2019t think kevin ever really gave up hope that ryan might change one day. But that day will never come, because I killed him. But I \u2014 I mean, you did that to save ava jerome and yourself, right? I know that we\u2019re all better off and that the shooting was justified.\t[ Sighs ] But? But I killed my best friend\u2019s twin brother. And I know, in some small way, kevin still loved ryan. And I hate that I caused my friend any pain.\t[ Chuckles dryly ] None of this is your problem. Hey, hey. I\u2019m not complaining. Besides, you know, sometimes it\u2019s easier to talk about heavy stuff with people you hardly know. Well, I\u2019m glad we\u2019re getting to know each other. Yeah, me, too.\t[ Bottles clink ] The truth is\u2026 I had every right to sell the garage. Not just as your guardian, but as brando\u2019s mother, who is grieving him. I\u2019m grieving him, too. I know that, honey. And I\u2019m sorry for the tough time you\u2019ve had. But this guardianship has protected you in ways you don\u2019t even know. What is that supposed to mean? You have no idea what it\u2019s like managing all these finances, getting bills every single month for the garage, each one with brando\u2019s name on it. And then there\u2019s when the chamber of commerce calls the office phone, asks for mr. Corbin.\t[ Voice breaking ] I get faced with daily reminders that brando isn\u2019t here with us anymore.\t[ Sniffles, sighs ] I had no idea. Why didn\u2019t you tell me any of this? Because, honey, my \u2014 my job is literally to protect you as your guardian. You lost your husband. I lost my son. Been hard on me, too. So, I needed to get rid of the garage for many reasons, but not the least of which is getting on with my life. I\u2019m sorry if that makes you hate me. It\u2019s just a chance I had to take.\t[ Sighs ] Valentin\u2019s death opens the possibility to get elq back in quartermaine control. Well, technically, it is in quartermaine control now. You are currently the ceo, but this is an opportunity for the family to regain majority ownership of the company. Valentin\u2019s stock went to charlotte, which means that laura controls it. I\u2019m sure that we can \u2014 we can negotiate to reacquire that stock that valentin poached from us. So you and michael can ice me out again? No. Ned, look. Valentin drove a wedge between us. But he\u2019s gone. Okay, the way I see it, this is a chance for us to start over. So, in the interest of putting the family back together, I am willing to step away from elq entirely. Well, I honestly wasn\u2019t expecting that. I will run aurora full time. I\u2019m okay with that. The most important thing is \u2014 is making this family a united front again. I mean, think about it. Last summer, we were at each other\u2019s throats, and then we all came together for willow, and it reminded me how right it feels for us all to be on the same team. And I know that we\u2019re quartermaines, and I know that we\u2019re going to bicker and we\u2019re going to backstab, but at the end of the day, when it matters, we band together. So, come on, we\u2019ve gotta do whatever \u2014 whatever we have to, to make this family whole again, and a big part of that is to get elq back. So what do you say, ned? Carly invested in aurora when the plan was to merge that company with elq, right? Right, to get elq back under the quartermaines\u2019 control. It was drew and michael\u2019s plan, and when carly tried to help them, she invested heavily, and when the merger didn\u2019t happen, she lost it all. But if carly bought aurora stock knowing there was a merger on the horizon, isn\u2019t that insider trading? And she and drew could both be open to prosecution if anybody finds out. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s why they have to keep their relationship at a distance. Because anyone investigating, they don\u2019t want to have them suspect that they\u2019d discuss these sensitive business matters. Otherwise, they\u2019re facing jail time. Anything you need, I\u2019m good for it. I want to take you to the warehouse where the pikeman shipment\u2019s going to be stored. I\u2019m not going to tell you when it\u2019s going to land, because the date\u2019s been changed. Uh, then why take me to the warehouse? Because I want your assessment of the place. I want to see how good you identify vulnerabilities. Think of it as training.\t", "You don\u2019t have to worry about selina wu \u2014 or me. You know how much I love my daughter-in-law, and I want to do right by brando. I always have sasha\u2019s best interests at heart. Alright, listen. I got some business to take care of. As for you, you better know what you\u2019re doing. Who owns the garage now? I really don\u2019t want to get any more involved. But I-I-I don\u2019t want to lie to you, either.\t[ Sighs ] Like I said, I just overheard part of a conversation. I just \u2014 I really think that you need to ask gladys yourself.\t[ Exhales sharply ] Oh, I intend to. Cody, I know that you feel bad, but please don\u2019T. I appreciate you being honest with me. At least someone was. The nurses\u2019 ball is back! I wanted to commemorate G.H.\u2019S 60th anniversary and celebrate how much G.H.\u2019S workers have meant to the community. I thought, what better way than the nurses\u2019 ball? That is a great idea, sweetheart. Normally, I\u2019d say maybe we should skip it, the year of lucy\u2019s death. But 60 years of general hospital is too big of an anniversary to ignore. I agree. And since lucy isn\u2019t here to run things, I\u2019m going to attempt to step into her shoes and chair the event. As you can imagine, it\u2019s a big undertaking financially. Which is where you and ned come in. You know what? I have some things I have to take care of, so I will leave you to this. Congratulations again. Thank you. Maxie, whatever you need, you can count on elq and the entire quartermaine family. Thank you, ned. Um, I\u2019m sure things are pretty crazy at elq right now with valentin being gone, also. And, of \u2014 of course, you know, aurora media will be at your service. I\u2019m sure drew will be on board, too. Thank you, michael. I really appreciate it, both of you. And I\u2019m going to hold you to it. We really need sponsors for this event. [ Chuckles ] Not to mention, musical acts.\t[ Cellphone chimes ]\t[ Amelia fusses ] I might be able to help you with that, but I have to deal with this text. What about you, michael? Oh.\t[ Scoffs ] No. My \u2014 my \u2014 my performance days are long gone. So, no, thanks. Maxie: That\u2019s okay. I have a much better plan for you. Alright. Thank you for helping. Yeah. Even though you\u2019re the one that made the mess. Wha\u2013 I put the mess on the floor. When the mess was all up here, that was you. Well, I don\u2019t do a lot of baking or cooking, so I don\u2019t see a lot of cleaning up the kitchen in our future. \u201cOur future.\u201d You know, I like the sound of that.\t[ Laughs ] Me, too. Look, I\u2019m confident that my plan to get charlotte\u2019s elq shares and step away from the company, that\u2019s going to pacify ned. Well, and ned\u2019s the only person we have to worry about turning us into the sec. So we\u2019re good. So, spill it. What\u2019s the dirt on carly? Well, I haven\u2019t really been able to process it with everything that\u2019s going on with willow and my new grandchild. Nina, just tell me. I could really use the distraction. Okay, okay. Remember when I mentioned to you about drew and carly and how they\u2019re hiding whatever\u2019s going on with them? Yeah, vaguely. I don\u2019t think we went into details, though, did we? Well, I saw them hugging pretty intimately. But more importantly, I heard them say that they couldn\u2019t show how they really feel for each other in public. I wonder why. I sort of, kind of am figuring it out. But it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s raising more questions than answers.\tWell, hey. You the invoice I was looking for earlier? How did this get in here? Comet? You pulling tricks again?\t[ Knock on door ] What do you mean, you can\u2019t book spa appointments here? It\u2019s all part of the same business, right? I need a massage! Oh, and why is that, gladys? You stressed out about something? Like deception? Besides ned, the only people that know about us being romantically involved are people that we trust \u2014 sonny and olivia and michael and joss. The sec is going to have no reason to look into the timing of our relationship unless \u2014 unless ned tips them off. Oh, god. I can\u2019t believe ned. No, you \u2014 look, you were an investor at aurora, but the merger never happened. You never actually profited on any of that inside information. This was like six months ago. I think we\u2019re good. I hear you. I do. I just \u2014 I just can\u2019t quite wrap my head around being together as a couple out in public. You know, I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve gotten used to the hiding. The majority of the time we\u2019ve spent together has been stolen moments at my house here, so\u2026 yeah, but they\u2019ve been pretty great moments. Oh, they\u2019ve been amazing moments. So I say we enjoy these last few days of secrecy before the whole world finds out about us. Oh, believe me, I plan on enjoying. Mm. Oh, hi. Hi, josslyn. Hi. [ Chuckles ] Sorry to interrupt. Not at all. No. I was, uh \u2014 I was actually just \u2014 just getting ready to go. Yeah. Oh, don\u2019t leave on my account. It seems like you guys were having a good time. I\u2019m going to make sure that we have plenty of good times in our future.\t[ Chuckles ] See you. Josslyn: Bye. Hey, I\u2019ll see you? Yeah. Okay. Wow, mom, I haven\u2019t seen you smiling so much in a long time. It seems like you\u2019re really happy with drew. I am. Last night, after I came back from G.H., I overheard sonny and olivia talking. Oh, you were eavesdropping? Nothing good comes from eavesdropping, nina. You should know that. I wasn\u2019t going out and searching for it, ava. I just happened upon the conversation. Can you really call that eavesdropping? Yes, that\u2019s eavesdropping. I mean, what \u2014 you\u2019re making a habit of it. Stop. You need to give me a little credit, because guess what? I have all this information now and I haven\u2019t done anything about it. I\u2019m just trying to wrap my head around it. So, what\u2019s the information? Now you want to know. Mm-hmm. Okay. I overheard sonny say that if people knew how long that carly and drew have been seeing each other and what they\u2019ve discussed, there would be serious consequences.\t", "[ Sighs ] I had zero context of anything that was being said, so odds are likely that I got it wrong. Let\u2019s start with the basics \u2014 like who did you hear discussing brando\u2019s garage? Gladys: What kind of question is that, \u201cis sasha good with me selling the garage?\u201d Gladys, that\u2019s not an answer. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re so worked up. Okay, let me just make it clear right now that this is not me being worked up. But i can be worked up\u2026\t[Whispering] If you don\u2019t give me an answer. Well, this is a surprise. What brings you here? Well, I was hoping to have lunch with one of the owners, and I\u2019m not talking about olivia. You have time for me? Well, I\u2019m going to have to check my calendar. Why, as a matter of fact, I have an opening. You know, I think we\u2019re way overdue for a proper catch-up. I want to hear about all the developments in your life. Oh, I don\u2019t know about that. Careful what you wish for. So, this form states that the pcpd has returned all the items taken from the quartermaine boathouse as evidence in the investigation when ava jerome was attacked near the boathouse. Just need your signature, and, uh, I\u2019ll be out of your hair. Glad to put this behind us once and for all. Thank you for catching the woman who killed brando and so many others. My sympathies for everything your family\u2019s going through. And, uh, for the challenges still to come. Maxie: Ned! It is so perfect that you are the one who answered the door. Come on in, maxie. So, what brings you by? As a matter of fact\u2026 you. Carly: Oh, my gosh. We made quite a mess last night.\t[ Laughs ] Wow. Yeah. [ Laughs ] I\u2019d say it was worth it. Oh, yes. I can\u2019t believe we\u2019re just now leaving the bedroom. Well, it\u2019s not every day we get the house to ourselves. I feel like we\u2019re kind of obligated to take advantage of that. We are. Yeah. Yeah. Mm, you know what? Hmm? Sooner or later, you\u2019re going to have to clean this up. How \u2019bout later?\t[ Laughs ]\tI have to leave soon. Right. Your mystery boss needs evidence against sonny. Michael: Forget about the pikeman update. If \u2014 if sonny\u2019s talking to you about his past, you got nothing to worry about. You know, I can make a lot more than grilled cheese sandwiches. Oh, what? Egg salad? Pb and j? That\u2026\t[ Chuckles ] \u2026And grilled salmon with grilled asparagus marinated in truffle oil. Oh, so you can cook. And you\u2019re just now telling me this. Why have you been holding out on me? I ate so many mres in afghanistan that I promised myself I\u2019d learn to cook when I got back to the states. Mres \u2014 that\u2019s meals ready-to-eat? They\u2019re packaged to withstand rough conditions, exposure to the elements. They\u2019ll keep you fed, but they are not exactly fine dining. Oh, so you can cook now that you discovered truffle oil? Yeah. Adds depth and flavor. I\u2019ll make you grilled asparagus sometime. It\u2019s too cold to grill. But it won\u2019t be this summer. Oh, so\u2026 \u2026you think we\u2019ll still be doing this, this summer? The job should be over by then. And I can spend every minute getting closer to you without worrying about sonny. I can\u2019t wait. Me, either. Will I see you later? Count on it. I\u2019ll walk you out. I hope you don\u2019t mind. Maxie told me about your illness. I\u2019m so sorry about everything you\u2019re going through. Especially so soon after the birth of that adorable baby.\t[ Chuckles ] Well, that is \u2014 that\u2019s very kind of you, mac. Hopefully, there may be some good news on the horizon. I might have a match with a bone marrow donor. That\u2019s terrific. I\u2019ll pray that everything works out. I will take all the prayers I can get. [ Chuckles ] I want as much time with my family as possible. Congratulations on amelia. She\u2019s beautiful. Thank you. Yeah, I think so, too. You know, I might be just a little bit biased.\t[ Chuckles ] No, she\u2019s gorgeous. Children are a blessing. Enjoy your time with them. It goes by really fast.\t[ Door opens ] Ah. Case in point. Really, I blink one day, and maxie\u2019s all grown up. Oh, moral of the story \u2014 don\u2019t blink.\t[ Chuckles ] Uh, what are you doing here? I had some police business to finish up. Oh, that\u2019s a good thing, because I have a big announcement for all of you. I ran into your mother-in-law. Gladys? Have you two even met? How \u2014 how did you know it was her? I \u2014 at some point in the conversation, it came out that her last name was corbin, and she was talking about selling a garage that belonged to her daughter-in-law. So it wasn\u2019t hard to put together. And then what? Look, I-I\u2026\t[ Sighs ] I just got the distinct impression that she was trying to sell the garage. I had been afraid that she would sell the garage without consulting me. But I told myself I was just being paranoid. I can\u2019t believe she actually did it. Is there anything I can do? Yes. You can tell me who she was selling the garage to. Last time we talked, you were so eager to sell the garage that you wanted me to convince sasha to get on board. How do I know that you didn\u2019t badger her into taking the offer? Is that really what you think about me? Let me just say this. I know how ms. Wu\u2026operates when she sets her sights on something. And if she is pressuring you, I can help you. But you\u2019ve got to tell me what\u2019s going on. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t stick around last night. Oh, that\u2019s okay. I know that you wanted to see willow. Well, I-I sp-spent the night with sonny, but I am so glad that you decided to stay at my place. You know? It\u2019s just, with all the drama happening at wyndemere\u2026 yeah. Even with ryan dead, I \u2014 I just don\u2019t feel safe there on that island all by myself. Yeah, anyone in their right mind would need a little break from wyndemere for a while. Yeah. And you don\u2019t even know the whole story. You\u2019re welcome to stay with me as long as you want to. I can only imagine what you\u2019re going through. And sonny mentioned that nikolas threatened to take avery? Th-that \u2014 that was just a miscommunication, really. So tell me how \u2014 how things went with willow last night. Um, better. Better than I had hoped. You know, she finally opened up to me about the specifics of her health issues. Hey, well, ain\u2019t that something? Well, liesl asked her to do it, and willow\u2019s very grateful to aunt liesl, so she honored her request. But I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019T. I\u2019m climbing the walls wondering what\u2019s happening to her. And maybe this is \u2014 this little thaw is a step in the right direction. Yeah, I hope so. And how about sonny? How are things with sonny? Oh, they\u2019re fine. \u201cFine\u201d? Oh. Is there trouble in paradise? Yes. Only it\u2019s not my paradise. Whose? Carly.\t"], "answer": [4, 3, 1, 2, 0]}

My section\u2026\tDiane: Ah.\tJack: \u2026Got me these cufflinks.\tDiane: Nice. And that\u2019s a lovely story, but i still don\u2019t see how it predicted that we would get back together.\tJack: There was a legend attached to the necklace. It held that whoever wore the necklace, whoever was around the gem, found love.\tDiane: I see.\tJack: Over time, I realized that if the legend is true, it might just be about family love. After diana died, I was closer to kyle and my sisters and billy and abby and the whole abbott family.\tDiane: Hmm.\tJack: But now it turns out the teardrop of love may not have only brought me family love. It may have brought me a beautiful, captivating, gorgeous woman. Maybe the gem just needed a little time to do its magic. That kiss was brought to you by my lucky cufflinks.\tDiane: [ Laughs ] I think it had more to do with how charming and thoughtful and handsome you are, but you can think whatever you like.\tJack: You know what? Now that the teardrop has brought us this far, maybe it\u2019s time we take our fate into our own hands, decide where things go next with us.\tSally: [ Breathes deeply ]\tNick: What is it? Sally, you know you can share with me. In fact, you should share with me. I\u2019m here to carry this burden for you.\tSally: Look, I already knew you were gonna be an amazing father. There was no question about that. I\u2019m just concerned.\tNick: About what?\tSally: We were gonna take things slow. We made a point of that. And now the pregnancy and everything is just moving at warp speed, and, I mean, who knows where we\u2019re going? Every decision I make from now on isn\u2019t just for me. I have to get this right.\tNick: And we will. Honestly, I\u2019m still not sure what we\u2019re talking about. What do we have to get right?\tSally: No baby could have a better father. And that is all that matters. I just got my elite box and i am so excited to dive in. I never know what I\u2019m gonna get. Having a personal stylist makes me feel like a complete queen. So powerful. I feel sexy! The elite box by adore me. Get styled for only $10 at adoreme.Com.

Only positives. Only positives. Nothing scary about that, right?\tDiane: No, no, no. I \u2014 no, I guess not. So, what is it that you\u2019re envisioning?\tJack: I see travel for us. I want to see all the grand sights of the world with you.\tDiane: [ Chuckles ]\tJack: On school vacations, we can take harrison off on giant adventures in faraway lands.\tDiane: Well, I like that idea.\tJack: And when that\u2019s over, we can drop him off, and I can whisk you off to new york, to the met ball or paris for fashion week. I\u2019ll be your escort.\tDiane: [ Laughs ]\tJack: You can upstage all of the celebrities. You\u2019ll probably have to wear a marchetti gown.\tDiane: Well, of course. Listen, that all sounds fun, but it\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s just fantasy. I don\u2019t need gowns or galas. What I want is\u2026\t[Voice breaking] Christmas, uh, christmas with the whole family. I want to \u2014 I want to celebrate the holidays with people that matter to me.

It\u2019s a love and hate thing, not a lot in between.\tChelsea: And why do you think that is?\tBilly: I\u2019m a lot.\tChelsea: You are a lot.\tBilly: Yeah. [ Chuckles ] Yeah. See, but that\u2019s why this could not be a date \u2014 because I would never actually admit that to someone that I was on a date with.\tChloe: That\u2019s a very good point. Well, I wasn\u2019t so concerned whether we thought it was a date. It was more, would your family think this is a date?\tBilly: I think my family is a little, uh, busy right now. Apparently, jack and diane are back together.\tChelsea: Huh. Well, you don\u2019t seem too troubled about that.\tBilly: I believe in giving someone a second chance.\tChelsea: Sometimes a third chance.\tBilly: Whatever it takes.\tChelsea: Well, I\u2019m grateful for it.\tBilly: I know what you\u2019re thinking \u2014 dessert.\tChelsea: [ Gasps ] I was thinking about dessert. How did you know?\tBilly: It\u2019s a talent. I can usually tell when someone\u2019s thinking dessert. I\u2019m usually right. Who doesn\u2019t love dessert?\tChelsea: Yeah. Thank you for this. Dinner with you is exactly what I needed.\tDiane: Sorry I wasn\u2019t here when your mother died. She was an amazing woman. But I still don\u2019t see how dina predicted that you and I would reunite after years of everyone thinking I was dead.\tJack: My mother didn\u2019t exactly predict it. Her jewelry did.\tDiane: [ Laughs ] What in the world are you talking about? Wait a second. How much champagne have you had?\tJack: [ Laughs ] Hear me out.\tDiane: Okay.\tJack: Years ago, when they first met, my father bought my mother an antique emerald necklace. It was beautiful, had lots of history, even had a name \u2014 the teardrop of love.\tDiane: [ Chuckles ]\tJack: I have pictures of dina upstairs, a very young dina wearing it proudly. Anyway, when they split up, my mother traveled all over the world, and in her travels, somehow that necklace got lost. So, just before she died, I was able to track it down.\t", "Nick: I mean, of course there are some bumps and mistakes along the way. I got to be a dad. You know, my life went in a completely different direction. It was natural. It\u2019s going to be that way for you, too.\tSally: Look, I can believe that you became this outstanding father that you were always meant to be fairly easily. It\u2019s just different for me.\tNick: How so?\tSally: When you were growing up, you had a loving mother and father around. Even if they weren\u2019t always together, you knew that they loved you, right?\tNick: Yeah, of course.\tSally: [ Inhales sharply ] I never had that. I \u2014 I learned that people let each other down very young.\t[ Sniffles ] And as an adult, I\u2019ve learned to deal with it, but as a child\t[Voice breaking] It was devastating. The thought of doing that to my own kid, it just \u2014 it makes my chest tighten up so much that i can barely breathe.\t[ Sighs, sniffles ]\tNick: [ Smooches ]\tSally: [ Gasps ]\tBilly: Ooh [Clicks tongue] I think I\u2019m gonna do the clams and the muscles.\tChelsea: Sounds delicious.\tBilly: You know what?

You know everything that\u2019s on that menu, and yet you\u2019ve been staring at it for 10 minutes.\tChelsea: [ Whispering ] Our server.\tBilly: [ Whispering ] What about her?\tChelsea: She thinks we\u2019re on a date.\tBilly: [ Chuckles ] I think she made an innocent mistake.\tChelsea: Yeah, but what if she knows who we are?\tBilly: Yeah, maybe she does. I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t see the problem.\tChelsea: Well, she\u2019s gonna say something to abby, like, \u201cI saw your uncle billy with chelsea lawson on a date.\u201d And then it creates a whole rigamarole, and then your family gets involved. I mean, is that what we want?\tBilly: No, no, we definitely do not want my family asking any questions about what\u2019s going on between us. Excuse me?\tChelsea: What are you doing?\tBilly: Damage control.\tIs everything okay?\tBilly: Everything is fantastic. We are just about to order, but, um, something that\u2019s a little bit more important for you to know \u2014 um, this is not a date.\tMusic (\u201cI swear\u201d) plays\tDiane: How long have you been planning this?\tJack: Uh, I was gonna do something special on new year\u2019s eve, but we kind of had other things to deal with.\tDiane: Yes, I am glad that\u2019s all behind us.\tJack: You know what? I\u2019m glad I waited.\tDiane: Why is that?\tJack: Because I\u2019m even more enamored with you than I was just weeks ago.\tDiane: [ Chuckles ]\tJack: If you haven\u2019t noticed, I\u2019m kind of taken with you.\tDiane: Mm. Likewise. And you don\u2019t even need this tux to impress me, although I do appreciate the effort. You know, this is, uh \u2014 this is incredible. A year ago, I would have never imagined that this was happening. I didn\u2019t even know if I could return to my old life here. But for the two of us to have found each other again, it takes my breath away. I mean, nobody could have predicted this.\tJack: There I have to disagree with you. As unexpected, as unpredictable as this moment was, I \u2014 I think it\u2019s been in the cards for a long time.\tDiane: What do you mean?\tJack: Finding you again may just be the fulfillment of a prophecy, all brought about by my mother.\tNate: I love it. This is bold. This is the kind of move devon would have quashed at chancellor-winters. Too risky.\tVictoria: Well, I told you, we do things differently here.\tNate: Yes. I love it. Alright, look, let\u2019s jump right in. First things first, we need to lure daniel and his project to newman media.\tVictoria: That\u2019s right. We need to give him something that chancellor-winters can\u2019T. What is that?\tNate: The full power and magnitude of newman enterprises. We have deeper pockets.\tVictoria: Yes. Well, the money angle is good, but it might take a little more to convince daniel.\tNate: Well, I can let daniel know that chancellor-winters will micromanage and second-guess him constantly.\tVictoria: You\u2019re right.\tNate: Mm-hmm.\tVictoria: He\u2019s an artist. He won\u2019t have any control over his baby over there.\tNate: They will be breathing down his neck every step of the way.\tVictoria: Why don\u2019t we make that a part of the agreement? Give him autonomy. Put that in writing.\t", "Diane: Yes, you certainly do. But, jack, I was just here. How did you pull this together so quickly?\tJack: Oh, I had a little help.\tDiane: Oh. Kyle and summer?\tJack: Actually, mrs. Martinez.\tDiane: Ah. Ah. Well, I\u2019ll be sure and thank her the next time I see her. You know, this is amazing, but I\u2019m half-expecting the rest of the abbotts to come waltzing through at any minute, and i doubt they\u2019ll be as smitten with your efforts as I am.\tJack: Kyle and summer have taken harrison to the movies. Allie is out with friends. Traci is on a plane on her way to new york to see her publisher. We are alone in this house. You can relax.\tDiane: Well, that\u2019s good to know. I know a lot of people are probably thinking the worst of this relationship. They might even think that I was pursuing you all along. But come on. Look at you.\t[ Laughs ] Look what you did here tonight. How could I not be falling for you all over again?\tJack: How could you not?\tDiane: Mm. [ Chuckles ]\tJack: To hell with the naysayers. To us.\tDiane: To us.\t[ Glasses clink ]\t[ Chuckles ]\tNick: Come on. Talk to me.\tSally: [ Sighs ]\tNick: Tell me what\u2019s going on.\tSally: Can we just write it off as hormones? My mind, my body, they\u2019re just \u2014 they\u2019re just overwhelmed. And \u2014 I don\u2019t know. Everything\u2019s in full-on baby mode right now.\tNick: It seems like there\u2019s more to it than that.\tSally: I don\u2019t know. The whole blood pressure problem got me thinking about so many things that can go wrong bringing a child into this world. That\u2019s not even taking into account when the child\u2019s actually here and having to take care of it and having to raise it. I mean, this is just\u2026 this is just my first moment of true and genuine fear. And it definitely won\u2019t be the last. I mean, the child\u2019s not even gonna be here for months, and I\u2019m already a mess? How the hell am I gonna be a mom? I used to pre-rinse dishes cause my old detergent\tVictoria: Here you go.\tNate: [ Sniffs ] Wow. Whew. It smells so smooth, it probably drinks itself.\tVictoria: 25-year-old single malt. I told you, it\u2019s the good stuff.\tNate: Mmm.\tVictoria: Mm-hmm.\tNate: Must be some box we\u2019re stepping out of.\t[ Both laugh ]\tVictoria: I just thought that it would be nice to step away from the 9:00-to-5:00 corporate structure.\tNate: I thought you thrived in that environment.\tVictoria: Well, normally i do, but I learned from my father that sometimes it\u2019s good to mix things up, to escape, to brainstorm, to generate ideas, especially when you have your sights set on a target that might be just a little bit unorthodox.\tNate: You have to think like the target. That makes sense. Mmm. Another one of these, and i might generate all the ideas.\tVictoria: Ah, see? I think it\u2019s working.\tNate: Okay, so, what is our target?\tVictoria: I want to scoop up omega sphere, and I want to take down mccall unlimited.\tNate: You want to go after tucker mccall? I\u2019ll drink to that.\t[ Glasses clink ]\tVictoria: That\u2019s right.\tNick: Look, this is completely normal, okay? You\u2019re supposed to have fears about becoming a parent.\tSally: Yeah, but you\u2019re not supposed to be overwhelmed by them.\tNate: Of course you are. Everybody goes through it.\tSally: Even you?\tNick: Yeah, even me. Seriously, I was worried sick with every kid. Now, it did get easier, but it\u2019s still very scary.\tSally: But you\u2019re a natural. I\u2019ve seen you with your kids. You\u2019ve got, like, a dozen world\u2019s best dad mugs.\tNick: Well, if everybody says it, it must be true.\tSally: [ Laughs ]\tNick: Look, I got those mugs ironically. Before noah was born, I wasn\u2019t ready for that. I was a mess, like you are, too, but you\u2019re gonna get through it. I promise. You know, part of the problem is the buildup. Nine months seems like it\u2019s forever. But trust me \u2014 it goes by so fast. And then the baby gets here, and everything changes.\tSally: Yeah, then it gets really scary.\tNick: No, no, no. That\u2019s the crazy part. When your baby\u2019s born and you see it and you get to hold it, it\u2019s just \u2014 everything makes sense. Right now, everything is like the unknown for you, but I\u2019m telling you, when they hand that baby to you, you can\u2019t imagine loving something that much. The fear goes away, and everything becomes clear to you.\tSally: [ Sniffles ] So, that\u2019s what it was like?

Now I wanna tell Megan comes back for us. What do you think she\u2019s planning now? I mean, saying that Kate is going to suffer a different kind of fate.

She put us into a cryogenic state until she decides to wake us up, but she wanted to keep us alive for some reason.\tRemember Ralph said that she was planning on using the serum on Kate.

Yes, you gave me quite an earful about it at the time. Why do you have luck? Megan, let me outta here. I have to fly my wife. Come on. I gotta find hope. Megan,\tRalph. Thank God. Last thing I remember I was in the park. I was dying in hopes. I have to get to her. As you can hear this must stop is you\u2019ve taken me away from a very important project your brother Stephan did. I don\u2019t care about that. Megan, I need you to make this stop. I cured more of his brain tumor.\tAnd I need you to cure him of Hope Brady,\tI did as you asked. Yes, but it didn\u2019t turn out as I expected.\tWhy would I care what hope thinks? Because she\u2019s your wife. Uh, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but ex-wife got a divorce. Okay, well, there\u2019s the mother of another one of your exes whose heart she broke. I know all too well that hope was the one great love of your life and that you never got over it. Isn\u2019t that true?\tOh, what a beautiful story. Okay. Time to die. Okay.

What\u2019s going on? Did you find Megan? Well, not exactly bud. We got an. What\u2019s going on? Your nephew, Andrew did us a real solid, let us access ISA records. So we found out where Megan went after she left Ruckus. We got there. It was too late. She\u2019d already cleared out. So that was the end the line.\tMaybe not. We went into Hope. Oh, yep. What was she doing? Same thing we were doing, I suppose. She has an idea that Harris Michaels might know something that could lead us to Megan. Well, if he does that, bastard\u2019s never gonna tell. Maybe, maybe not. You see, when he was in Montreal, he indicated to hope that he thinks maybe he.\tWas brainwashed by Megan, so if she used the same techniques on him that she used on us, he could be reachable. Kayla got through to me. Marla and Paul were able to reach John help figures. She gets a face-to-face with Michaels. She might have a breakthrough there also, but Harris never really loved hope, did he?\tI guess we\u2019ll see about that.\tYou got him locked down pretty tight with good reason.

One of our top psychoanalysts Donovan\u2019s wife. Has met with him several times, but he\u2019s been highly resistant to treatment.\tYes. So I see. I\u2019d like you to let me in there with him alone. Yes, Erin. It\u2019s some privacy that would be inadvisable. As I said, he\u2019s very dangerous. Yes, I understand an agent Rose, but I need to look him straight in the eye for this to. I can call Shane if you\u2019d like. It won\u2019t be necessary. I trust you.

What, bro? What are you doing to me? Just relax. Bob. You\u2019ve been through a little procedure. That\u2019s all procedure. What kind of procedure on your brain just need to make sure that it\u2019s worked?\tHow does that make you.\tAh, excellent. As I said, , the procedure worked exactly as intended. Yes.

Not quite. Although Bo has forgotten his feelings for hope, then what\u2019s the problem? The problem is, That the spark between us, between bow and I is gone. And how do you suppose I can change that?\tWhat are you asking me to do? I read an article in the Salem Spectator the other day about an orchid that seems to have magical healing properties and or could you grew in your lab before it disappeared? And what does that have to do with. I\u2019m just wondering if you might be able to use it to help bow and me to turn back time.\tAh, you want to reverse the aging process? Oh, and I lost so much. And you think the orca could be your own personal fountain of youth? Almost as good as a time. Is it possible? I know you told the police that it\u2019s gone, but I wonder if you might not know where I can get my hands on it. Actually, I do.\tWhen we\u2019re young, again, like when we first met, I know he\u2019ll love. Instead of just following my orders like a loyal soldier, you know, he has never once questioned what I\u2019ve asked him to do or why.\tNo one knew he was in Salem. They all still think he\u2019s dead and they\u2019ll never know otherwise. Come on, we\u2019re Homan thinks you\u2019re dead. I pull this trigger. We\u2019ll make a damn bit of difference to him. I know, because eventually he will find out what you. I guess the truth always comes out, doesn\u2019t it? Both. I don\u2019t really care if the truth comes out.\tI don\u2019t care about Roman. You know? I don\u2019t believe that. I really don\u2019t. I mean, I think that you\u2019re lying to yourself because I think everything that I\u2019ve said to you deep down has struck a chord with the real vore who is devoted to his family, who adores his sisters, Kimberly and Kayla and his brother Roman, and his children and his grand children.\tSean, Douglas, Sierra, Zach, Claire, Chelsea. I mean, you could forget about Chelsea, your daughter. With my Billy. I mean, I can see you trying to deny that you have feelings for hope, even for Roman, because certainly those relationships are fraught. They, they\u2019re complicated. There\u2019s not a baggage there. But the parents love for their child.\tThat is pure, that is unshakable, even in the worst of circumstances. So you see Chelsea is my flesh and blood. Blood. You wanna see blood? I\u2019ll show you blood. Listen to me. You are not going to break Chelsea\u2019s heart by killing her grandmother. You and I. That you are not going to pull that trigger. You know that I will only to shut you up.\tSo you were together for a whole year. When you kissed me, I felt something that wasn\u2019t just part of the game.\tCome on hope. I want the. Okay. The truth,\tas much as I wanted to stay disconnected, there were moments I thought something,\tokay, I admitted it. I can, I can you Can you admit?\tOr maybe, um,\tMe just think about what Megan was willing to do to get revenge on hope. Yeah, on a pure spine. Well, just because Bo lived another woman, it\u2019s not like she could have \u2019em anyway. Now. and if she has succeeded in getting hope out of the way. Yeah, I still can\u2019t believe it. I mean, Megan Hathaway is still alive and our wives are damnit.\tYou know what guys? I mean, sometimes I feel like I\u2019m going crazy. I mean, I, I tell people, you know that Kate is talking to me from the great beyond\tthrough an.\tSo have you picked up on anything from her lately? Now she\u2019s gone silent and that\u2019s what makes me wonder. I mean, did I. Did I imagine that Paulina herd of two?\tI saw Kayla. She came to me. John, what about you? What about you? Did anything like that happen to you? Did you ever hear from Martin Le?\tI haven\u2019t heard anything at all from Doc. I thought appealing to to Ralph\u2019s ego might get us somewhere. It was getting us somewhere. I\u2019m sure that he was about to tell us who was in that fourth chamber when Megan walked in. Not that it even matters now. But it might because if somebody had been in there and they got away, maybe if they\u2019re friendly, they was able to come back, they could help us escape.\t", "What\u2019s with the yearbook? Well, it\u2019s our yearbook though. Don\u2019t you remember? We are a voted best couple. Yeah, so well, we could be that happy again, . That was a long time ago, but the feelings can come back. I know they can.\tHe was supposed to love me. I warned you that a procedure could not create romantic feelings out of nothing. They\u2019re not nothing. They\u2019re just. Dormant. Now, this serum, this serum had better work as you promised when Megan\u2019s said that Kate was going to suffer a different kind of fate. Now, do you think that she was just trying to scare us to get us to behave?\tI mean, why would she kill Kate after she had gone through so much trouble to revive her? Well, she wouldn. And even if that were her intention, I, Katie was just, she\u2019s resourceful and, and she\u2019s able to talk her way out of any dire situation. I know she will. Here again, as I recall, you and Roman were over a long time ago.\tWell, we got back together again recently and actually we got. On my deathbed, although it was the first time, you know, because I got sick and then I recovered and then I relapsed, and then apparently I died. And yet here I am. Which is pretty miraculous. Wouldn\u2019t you say ? No, no. Ralph made it happen. Have Megan\u2019s request.\tOh, well Ralph makes a lot of things happen, doesn\u2019t he? Did you see I\u2019m a survivor? You\u2019re a survivor. Roman\u2019s a survivor. Do you remember, do you remember saying goodbye to him on that beach when you thought he was dead? Because Roman loves me. If you kill his wife, he\u2019s gonna be devastated. Is that what you want?\tSo you only think that hope can get through this Harris, my close guy. I mean, he might not know anything even if, uh, she gets in to talk and after the way he got the upper hand on both of you. Oh, hey, we were on Bush, man. Come on. That\u2019s right. Hey, we\u2019ve been prepared on that. Hey, relax. Okay. I\u2019m not questioning your skills.\tAll right. I\u2019m just worried about hope. The point is he is in ISA custody. It\u2019s a highly controlled situation. We wanted to go with. , but she insisted she had to do this on her own and you know how damn headstrong she can be. Yeah. She almost got herself killed last time she got involved with this guy. I hope she\u2019s being safe this time.\tWhat are you doing here? Why would you even want to talk to me after everything I did to you and your family?\tThe last time we saw each other in Montreal, you said you thought Megan had done something to you, brainwash. You said that you wanted help. We got you that help Harris, but I\u2019m confused because ever since then you have fought it every step of the way. Why is that? I was lying. I said whatever it took to mitigate that.\tPunish. No, no, no. I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t believe you. If they were two, you\u2019d still be keeping up with that. No, I think that you are still fully under a million\u2019s control and why? It\u2019s the reason why you wouldn\u2019t open up to Kimberly, and that\u2019s why I only see the real you when we\u2019re alone. Harris, look at me, Harris.\tI came all this way today.\tRemind you of what we had. There was nothing between us. We had was a card. I was just playing you to get to the prisons just like you were playing me. No, it\u2019s not true. Not in the beginning. I wasn\u2019t. Here is something, something grew between us. Before I realized that you were after the prison, you said it yourself.\tIt\u2019s the reason you couldn\u2019t pull the trigger. When Megan had urged you to kill me, I said what you wanted to hear. Yeah, yeah, I know. To communicate your punishment. I heard you.\tAll right\tthen. Tell me this. Why? Why did Megan have to hire Thomas Banks? Put him up in the rafters to kill me? You could\u2019ve killed me. You could\u2019ve done it from two feet away. It\u2019s a backup plan. Why am I still alive, Harris?\tBecause I failed. No,\tbecause you succeeded. You succeeded. Aris, you stopped.\tI am alive because of you.\tYou felt something for me.\tYou still do. It\u2019s real. It is.\tI.\tWhat about you?\tDo you feel something for me too?\tDo you don\u2019t hope is risking her life? Is it worth it, Roman? Megan\u2019s out there somewhere behaving like a true Demir Stephanie\u2019s daughter through and through who knows what she could be planning right now to hurt even more people we love. She\u2019s still a threat. We need to stop her. Whatever it takes. As you recall, I made no promises, but if it works, This serum will allow you and Bo to go back again and start at the beginning.\t", "You don\u2019t think My relationship with Chelsea was complicated. She\u2019s responsible for the death of one of my kids. I know, and you got past that because of your love hurt.

You see, with their help, you and I are gonna get back all the time that we lost and finally live halfway ever after.\tWhen you got here a few weeks ago, Ralph, I gave you this facility and the plant continues to thrive.

{"content": ["I don\u2019t see where the big deal is. Chloe was probably just grateful that Zander pulled that hurtful article you wrote about, oh, honey, I know that\u2019s what you want to believe, but does that look like a platonic hug to you? Yes. Look at that body language. Well, if they haven\u2019t slept together yet, they have certainly rounded third base.\tAnd haven\u2019t you wondered why Xander pulled an article that was guaranteed click bait? Probably because it was click bait 2020. I know that the truth hurts, but you have to face the facts so you can heal and move on. Ah, for sake. And the facts are that Xander\u2019s next conquest is that boring songbird with the big eyes.\tNo, you are wrong. She is not Xander\u2019s next conquest because A, she\u2019s not his type, and B, her big eyes are only for Brady Black. Everybody knows that. Oh, come on. You don\u2019t see those two working out. She called his kid a monster. And yes, Xander pulled the article. So maybe Brady doesn\u2019t know that she said that yet, but trust me on this from my own vast life experience, once you hate the offspring and the offspring hate you, the relationship is.\tRachel, that\u2019s enough. Do you remember mommy\u2019s letter? Do you remember? You\u2019re supposed to be nice to Chloe and you\u2019re supposed to give her a chance. Mommy only wrote that letter cuz you made her, she told you no, but you just did.\tListen, Rachel, I, I understand why you want your mommy and daddy to live together. When I was your age, all I wanted was to have a mommy and daddy who lived together and loved me with all their hearts. But you do have a mommy and daddy who love you so, so much, and you\u2019re really lucky cuz you have other people who love you.\tYou have your, your grandparents, your aunt, your uncles, your cousins, and me. You are you crossing your fingers behind your back. No, definitely not Now. Listen\u2019s, sweetheart. We used to be really close at one point, and I want that for us again. In fact, I.

Rachel, I don\u2019t take Rachel Black. You lie. You don\u2019t love me. You hate me as much as I hate you. Fine. You\u2019re right. I do hate you.\tI don\u2019t think that that\u2019s true, Mattie, that if the offspring and the partner hates each other that it can\u2019t work out. I mean, My mother didn\u2019t give a damn about all the blokes that she slept with that I hated. And believe me, I hated every single one of them. Did she ever marry any of them and live happily ever after?\tNo, but not for a lack of trying. See, you just proved my point. Yeah. Pretty sure that that was all on my mum though. Anyway, look, it\u2019s not worth arguing over. I\u2019m gonna. I\u2019m gonna get something to eat. I\u2019m gonna go to the office. All right? I will stay put and work on my story about Xander and Chloe\u2019s Grand Romance.\tYou\u2019re gonna be wasting your time. I\u2019m not printing that story, Mattie. Oh, come on, Gwenny. Don\u2019t be bitter. This just means that your plan is working. Xander is so jealous of you and Alex that he\u2019s throwing himself at Chloe to make you jealous. I am not miss her. I am being a good friend to you because if you print that, I\u2019m just gonna fire you.\tNot if my other boss overrules. He made a unilateral decision to kill my last column. You can make a unilateral decision to run this one. I mean, it is your family paper after all. Why are you so determined to run this? Because I have nothing else. My deadline is in a few hours. Too bad. Winnie. Come on. You are reaching for a story when there isn\u2019t one.\tJust I don\u2019t want Chloe Lane suing me. Right. So just think of something else to write. Like what? Oh my God, this is Salem. Okay. People come back from the dead. They get possessed from the devil. Come back as twins. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll think of something.\tRachel, I, I am so sorry. I never meant to say that too late. You already did, Rachel. We are, uh, we\u2019re gonna go home. Okay. We\u2019ll, we\u2019ll do Sundays another time to grab your bag. Bye. Honestly, grandma my way, Brady, I can\u2019t tell you. I\u2019m sorry. I am. That\u2019s okay. We\u2019ll talk about it later. Let\u2019s.\tCan you believe that woman harassing me in my own house? I mean, I should call the cops on her. That\u2019s an option. Yeah. Well, it wouldn\u2019t do any good. Commissioner Hernandez and Detective Hunter have made it pretty clear that they are Team Paul. I mean, support the murderous daughter and the bribe passing mother, you know, and let the victim just be victimized even more.\tGod, I mean, that\u2019s obviously their mo. And you know what, before you say anything else, I did not send that letter. I just defended you, didn\u2019t I? And I\u2019m very grateful for that. But I saw the look in your face when you read the letter. Even right now, you\u2019re wondering if it was. Aren\u2019t you? No, that\u2019s not fair.\t", "Do you even have one shred of evidence? Of course not. Just like you have zero evidence that I\u2019m the one who vandalized your office because I didn\u2019t do either one of those things. Oh, yeah, yeah. And I got a bridge in Brooklyn. I\u2019d like to sell you also Obama, just to point out. But, um, there\u2019s a column missing between over and Bitch, you see.\tAnd I would just never make such a punctuation trap. Oh god sake. Ms. Price. Sloan informed me that she wasn\u2019t anywhere near your office when it was broken into it, and I believe her. Oh, really? Well then you are a bigger fool than I thought. And you know, but let me tell you, Eric Grady, Ooh, your mother would be rolling over how grave she could hear how you defending this woman, not to mention whatever else had you doing with her.\tActually, she, she wouldn\u2019t be rolling over in her grave. What I\u2019ve known Marlan since before. You were a twinkle in your father\u2019s eye, and I assure you she would not approve of this for one second. No. No. You don\u2019t understand. She wouldn\u2019t be rolling over in her grave because she\u2019s not in her grief. She\u2019s alive.\tMy gosh, are you hungry? Sorry, I don\u2019t know the answer to this one, but I\u2019m learning heart speeding check and all the other important parts are working just fine. Oh, sorry. I\u2019m not sorry at all. Okay, well then if you\u2019re not sorry. I\u2019m not sorry either.\tYour mother should be glad that she has you looking out for her. I mean, I do hope she\u2019ll be all right. Thanks. It\u2019s nice of you to say, well, Paulina was my mother-in-law. Yeah. For about 24 hours. But during that 24 hours, I don\u2019t recall any love loss between the two. Or the two of us for that night, not mine.\tFinest hour. Right. Apologize again for whatever I put you through. Mm. It was no big deal. And for you, well, you were still in love with Sarah. Mm. I\u2019m sorry. Things didn\u2019t work out. Likewise for you enjoying tomorrow and more recently, his twin sister. You know, I was rooting for you guys. Salem\u2019s favorite bisexuals.\tI didn\u2019t know there wasn\u2019t contest. I just mean that, I don\u2019t know. You guys seem very happy, very much in love. I\u2019m surprised to hear that she left Ham so suddenly. Yep. Right after she slept with Alex, Kiki.\tOh God. I\u2019m sorry. I hope you\u2019re not upset. No, no. I needed to get to work anyway. Please don\u2019t leave on my. That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing. Neil, do you wanna just take a picture? It will last longer. You know you have a point, dude. I swear to God if that ends up on any little gossip columns, Leo, I swear to God, I would never think about sharing this gym with the world.\tNo. That is from my private collection. You know what? In fact, I am going to fast track this guy right to the top of the heap. Yeah, I will make sure that that photo never, ever sees the light of day. Okay, we\u2019ll see you soon. Definitely.\tSo you and Alex are back in the proverbial saddle. Okay. Look, focus. Mattie, you said you had something to tell me about Zander. Oh yes, right. Gwe Gwe. Gwe quick. Oh, sometimes besties have to deliver harsh news. And as much as I love gossip, I also love you. So I will not enjoy imparting this time. How about skipping the theatrics and telling me fine.\tUgh. I think Xander\u2019s hooking up with Chloe Lane.\tOh my God, for Brady. This is the most amazing news I know. I know. I was just telling her that we, we have so much to celebrate. Oh, he sure do. Oh my. You must be so relieved. And your dad, and your brother, and your sister. I\u2019m just so happy for you and your family. Thanks, Chloe. Thanks. We do. We have a lot to celebrate.\tPlease sit. You know what we need to do? We need to get all the toppings. All the toppings, like chocolate chips, strawberries, fudge, the whole thing. We\u2019ll get free scoops three. How\u2019s that sound over my dead body?\tZander and Chloe. Yep. Saw them together earlier. Defined together. They\u2019re outside the Brady Pub. Oh yes, the Brady Pub. Salem\u2019s most romantic spot. Tell me where they\u2019re sitting there, ogling each other while taking in the sweet aroma of chowder and Jeep beer. Okay, so I didn\u2019t catch them in bed together, but it looked pretty intimate to me.\tIt\u2019s fine. Intimate? No, they were, oh God, no. I don\u2019t wanna see a demonstration. Demonstration. I took a photo.\tRachel, what have I told you about sharing? Hm. You can\u2019t finish three scoops by yourself anyway. It\u2019s fine. It fine. Brady? Uh, listen, Rachel, if I remember correctly, you don\u2019t like strawberries on your sundaes and sharing ice cream can be kind of annoying. Am I right? So how about we order three sundaes, one for each of us?\tHow does that sound? See, that sounds perfect, right? It doesn\u2019t to me. I\u2019ve got this for you on six. I don\u2019t mind sharing with daddy. It\u2019s you I don\u2019t wanna share with,\t", "so it was my cousin Alex. He was the reason you and Ali broke up. Oh right. I forgot. He\u2019s your cousin. I keep on forgetting that everyone in this town is related. Sorry. No, you apologize. And I should be saying sorry to you for my lecturers kin info, a narcissistic manhole. He can\u2019t keep his hands off other people\u2019s people.\tHe\u2019s such a preening, homering son of, whoa, whoa. I had no idea you hated him so much. Well\u2019s not to hate. He\u2019s only been back in Salem a few months and his conquest already outnumbered mine, at least the ones I know about. Probably not counting me. You\u2019re not serious. I was curious and he definitely lives up to the hype, not helping.\tSorry, but you seem to be taking this personally. Why? Because of his personal, his latest conquest is Gwen. Oh, Gwen Riz, whatever your you\u2019re, you\u2019re at. Yeah. Gwen Riz check. Yeah. Alex moved on on her when she was at her most vulnerable and now God, he just loves rubbing in my face at every opportunity. And what do you know?\tAnother opportunity presents itself. Be careful of how you mate. Plus you want me to give you a match in black eye.\tCarrie, so good to talk to you, honey, please. Please tell Austin how, sir, I\u2019m sorry. We are back.\tAnd you and I I will, um, I\u2019ll give him, call myself in a few days. Okay. I love you too. Hi, sweet.\tWow. So good to hear Carrie\u2019s voice. Yeah, I. But now you\u2019re thinking about Kate, aren\u2019t you? And Kayla too. I hope this whole business with banks pan out. You just let me worry about that for both of us. Okay. Hope and Steve will find her. No doubt in my mind. I hope you\u2019re right. Oh, it is. Good to be home. Hmm.\tIt\u2019s almost like this whole thing never even happened. You know? It\u2019s, it\u2019s so hard to believe all of it. I just wish that Bell and Eric could straighten out their issues. Yeah. They\u2019re still at each other\u2019s throats. It\u2019s the shame because they were getting along so well, you know, but Eric, he\u2019s, he\u2019s been in a bad way ever.\tWe lost you and, and since he and Nicole ended things. But you know what? I think now that you\u2019re back, I\u2019m hoping things will turn around for him. I hope so too. But what, what caused this whole thing I, this, is this about when Eric took a swing at Sean? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. This, this whole thing is about the situation between Sloan, Peterson and Paul.\tWhen the criminal trial against Paul and Chanel fell apart, Sloan filed a civil suit, bell stepped in and got the whole thing dismissed. That\u2019s Bell\u2019s job. Well, yeah, but Eric didn\u2019t see it that way though. And since Eric is still in a relationship with Sloan, what? Wait, wait. That\u2019s still going on still, which is why he and Bill are on opposite sides.\tBut now the lawsuit\u2019s dead, so I\u2019m hoping maybe the two of them can just move on. Mar is Alive. Oh my, oh my. Yet again. Someone gets a reprieve from death in the great city of Salem. Praise the Lord. Oh, well now maybe she can talk some sense into you and get you away from this. Viper says, the woman with a venomous tongue, look, as much as I enjoy being insulted in my home, get the hell out gladly.\tBut I\u2019m not done with you, Ms. Th not by a long shot. And to quote my least favorite person, this isn\u2019t over.\tSince you\u2019re not backing down, I have to assume that you do want me to dot your other eye for you. For what? What happens between Gwen and me is none of your damn business. I\u2019m making it my business, Alex. Cause I know you\u2019re just gonna hurt her. And I actually care about her. Is that why you called her your sloppy seconds?\tThe last time I saw you? I mean, that was very respectful. Oh, what do you know? By respecting women, you\u2019re a serial bed hop, unlike you. Look, you\u2019re not good enough for Gwen. Not by a long shot. I\u2019m, I\u2019m not gonna stand by while you take advantage of it. Oh, she didn\u2019t seem very taken advantage of just now as I left her bed after making love to her for the third time today.\tThat\u2019s Whoa, whoa, whoa. Guys, guys, let\u2019s not do this, okay? Just stop it, okay? Please just stop. Thank you. Chanel being the voice of a reason. Yeah. I just don\u2019t wanna be caught in the middle of some stupid fight in the middle of the square. But don\u2019t you for one second, think that I am on your side. Alex Riak is because I am not.\tIt\u2019s all we Were friends. Friends. Do friends sleep with each other\u2019s girlfriends behind their backs. Okay. Chanel, and as I told you, I\u2019m sincerely sorry for everything that happened with I, I really am. And you don\u2019t deserve that. Yeah. You deserve better. Yeah. You damn right. I. And I promise you, I\u2019ll do everything in my power to repair our friendship, but this whole thing with Gwen is completely different.\tI\u2019m not breaking up any happy homes. Her and Zander aren\u2019t together. This guy doesn\u2019t even water. He just doesn\u2019t want anybody else to have her. No, I don\u2019t want you to have her. It\u2019s a big difference. Look, you already broke. The girl\u2019s heart wants cause. Hmm. So if you really care about her the way you say you do, you need to get out of her life and you need to let her be happy with somebody else.\t", "So Sprinkles or chocolate fudge. What do you think, daddy? What do I think? I think I probably shouldn\u2019t be rewarding you with a treat right now given that you stole my phone and then you skipped school and then we took an Uber to Statesville. You know you scared your dad half to death. But don\u2019t you wanna celebrate that?\tI\u2019m okay. Yes, I wanna, I\u2019m very, very happy that you\u2019re okay, sweetie, but I have some really great news to share with you. Actually. What is it? Do you remember? When I told you that, uh, grandma Marano went to heaven, well, it turns out she didn\u2019t go to heaven. After all your mother\u2019s alive,\thave you been drinking? No. I\u2019m, I\u2019m totally sober. I saw it with my very own eyes. My God. I mean, how is this even possible? I\u2019m not sure. I mean, the detail\u2019s a little fuzzy, and right now I\u2019m a little blown away. But I mean, Abby does not even begin to describe how I\u2019m feeling, and she\u2019s okay. She wasn\u2019t hurt or anything?\tNo, she, she\u2019s okay. I mean, she\u2019s been through a lot. She just, she just needs some rest in tlc. But my stepdad, John, he\u2019ll make sure she gets plenty of that. So how\u2019s your spa day? It is divine. Thank you so much in the book. It\u2019s great. Margaret Atwood my favorite. You know that. I do know that. And I also know you have been waiting three months to finish that book.\tWell worth the wait. Nice. Now I want you to know. I been leading three months to do this.\tOh my God, Anita. Yeah. Whoopsy yard knocking. Oh, don\u2019t get snarky with me. You could have put the do not disturb sign on the door. I thought you were working. I was. Which is what I need to talk to you about, but no. Yes. Now it\u2019s about Sander.\tIs there any way Dr. Greenberg can squeeze us in today? A cancellation at three 30. Oh, perfect. We\u2019ll take it. Thank you. Thank you so much. Right. See you then. Hi. Hey. Um, sorry I couldn\u2019t help but overhearing Dr. Greenberg\u2019s, a friend of Sarah\u2019s. She\u2019s a cardiologist if my memory serves, she is. Yeah. Is everything okay?\tIt, the appointment isn\u2019t for me, it\u2019s for my mother. She thought she was having a heart attack yesterday. Oh God. Oh, she\u2019s all right. Yeah, she is. Thankfully. Um, it turned out to just be a panic attack. I\u2019m afraid that if mama doesn\u2019t get her stress levels down, she\u2019s gonna stroke out or so. And she\u2019s stressing it because because of that horrible Sloan Peterson and her vendetta against us, that woman has worked.\tMama up into a frenzy. Sloane Peterson. Open up this damn door.

If this, uh, Sloan, Peterson person did ransack your mother\u2019s office, then why haven\u2019t the. Arrest. Well, they brought her in for questioning and of course she totally denied it and there\u2019s no evidence against her, so, so if there\u2019s no evidence, why you so sure she did it? Well, let\u2019s see.\tIt happened right after our lawyer got Sloan civil case dismissed, and then Sloan swore revenge on my mom and me. Oh, I see. Yep. And then the. They told her that uh, they\u2019d be keeping an eye on her and that she\u2019d be disbarred if she did anything else destructive. Last something, Elise, you know, maybe she\u2019ll back off now and this will finally be over.\tOh God. How I hope so. This isn\u2019t over, bitch. You are right. This is not because you are done with making these damn threats. Do you hear me? Do you understand me? Not that you deserve it, but I\u2019m gonna offer you a little lawyerly advice free of charge. Usually when people deliver stuff like this, it\u2019s uh, anonymously.\tYou\u2019d have been better just slipping it under my door or putting it in the mail. So if you insist on doing something like this in person, just make sure there\u2019s not a witness around. What are you rambling on about? You know, damn well it was you who left me this little note, not the other way around. And I\u2019m here to tell you that if you can tell you this vision\u2019s vendetta against me and my daughter, I will ruin you.\tWhat are you telling me, dad? What do you mean Grandma didn\u2019t go to heaven? Because she\u2019s, she\u2019s alive, honey. Cuz it turns out your, your grandma Marlena. She never, she never really died. Oh my God.

Ah,\tOh.\tExcuse me, but I didn\u2019t invite you in just like I didn\u2019t invite you into my office, but you still sneaked your way in there to trash to the place and leave me.

Isn\u2019t it obvious Lord, even a blind man can see a stuff like this as a grimy little fingerprints all over it.\t", "You said you didn\u2019t have anything to do with trashing Paul in his office. That\u2019s enough for me. But, but you did say that you want to take revenge out on her and Chanel? Absolutely I do, and I will trust me, but when I do, it\u2019s not gonna be from some passive aggressive, anonymous little note with letters cut out of a.\tWhen I comfort them feel damned well, no, it\u2019s me.\tI\u2019m freaking it up guys. Now I mean it, and I cannot believe I am saying this in 2023, but you don\u2019t get to decide who Gwen wants to be with. That is totally up to her. My point exactly. Alex, shut up. What the hell is going on here? You, you get your grubby little hands off my baby girl. I was, no, my hands were nowhere nearer.\tI was just leaving. Me too. Take care, Ms. Price.\tWhat was that all about? Just men being men and reminding me how lucky I am to have other options. But anyway, nevermind that. Um, how are you feeling? You were asleep. What?

She\u2019s as pathetic. She is predictable. Oh, I just came from confronting that ambulance chasing fraud, and of course she denied it. But mommy, I know she shouldn\u2019t be confronting anybody.

And I was going to call you because I just got off the phone and I scheduled an appointment for you with Dr.\tGreenberg at University Hospital at three 30. Three 30. I can\u2019t. You can and you will. This is important. Mama. What? So is this. I can\u2019t let that go unanswered. It won\u2019t. I\u2019ll handle it. Chino Chin. I am fine. Really? Really? No. I was having some problems yesterday, but today I\u2019m feeling healthy and strong. Okay, then your appointment should be quick and easy.\tCome on, mama. Please, please. Do you want me to have my own panic attacks worrying about you? They are both. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. And I will be sure to follow up with your driver to make sure that you actually went.

Yeah, I, I am, I, uh, I think I might be pregnant.\tWhat do you mean? Don\u2019t you wanna find Megan? What if you collapsed again? You just said the doctor said I was gonna be fine. Paris.

What about, what about this group over here still leaves that wherever this lab is, it has to be housed in a fairly large facility.\tMost of these islands couldn\u2019t support that. In fact,\tthere\u2019s only one that has any infrastructure that size. What kind of infrastructure\twill that be? A military base.\tMegan eliminated her. Are you, are you saying that Yes, Kate is dead and the takeaway is that it\u2019s not a good idea to resist? Well, anything. Now moving right along.

My serum is a literal fountain of youth. Rev is intended. It\u2019ll turn back the clock. Make you young again, but I don\u2019t want that. Oh, no . Well, you certainly are in the minority. Most people would spend the fortune to go back in time, and as I say, youth is wasted on the young.\tWhat are you planning to do? I just told you I\u2019m going to make you young in Newby. Although you certainly are still very beautiful and desirable, could you, could you just stay on topic? What if that serum doesn\u2019t work?

I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t like even remember all the details, but I was with her when she was dying and, uh, all I remember is that I was desperately trying to save her life, like, like she saved mine.

And I don\u2019t think we got our, our land legs back yet. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That must be it.

Are you sure? Mm. Because you know this hotel is an amazing restaurant. Mm-hmm. , I\u2019ll just want a room service. They have some amazing seafood. They got these clam cakes and these fried clams that are supposed to be unbelievable.\tWas there something I said,\tHey, hi.\tHow are you feeling?\tNot sure what happened. You collapsed. I was really worried. The treatment had caused some kind of permanent damage, but the doctor, um, looked you over and assured me it was just a delayed reaction.

No, I just was thinking that, you know, my lucy, there\u2019s a woman who\u2019s lived one heck of a life. She sure has. And, you know, I love that about you. You live. You live each day to the fullest and then some. Okay, you know what my last conscious thought was before I hit that water? No. I just thought I didn\u2019t want it to be over. And you have a lot to do with that, you know? Do I? I just \u2014 I just feel like I have so much I want to do and so much life left to live, and I would kind of like it if you would do it with me, be by my side? Thank you for coming back to me.

Have you heard from holly? No, but I don\u2019t expect to, at least not till she finds ethan. And then what about those pieces of the ice princess that victor was looking for? Victor thinks that that was destroyed in the explosion. Oh, god. It\u2019s happening, robert. We are getting closer and closer to victor paying for what he did to luke. Yeah. It\u2019s good to have the gang back together, isn\u2019t it? Oh, yeah. Am I part of the gang? You did okay in paris. Managed to not slow anna down. That\u2019s high praise. How about this? As long as anna trusts you, I will give you the benefit of the doubt, but the second you step out of line\u2026 message received. Michael, this is incredible. It\u2019s the answer we\u2019ve been waiting for. I wouldn\u2019t get too excited. Willow hasn\u2019t agreed to it yet. Why wouldn\u2019t she? You\u2019ve seen how protective she is over the baby. I\u2019m just afraid she\u2019s gonna say no. Oh, come on, michael. That\u2019s insane. We have to convince her to do this.

Have you been able to find out anything? Ah, not yet. It\u2019s absolutely unfathomable that valentin is gone. We got off to a rocky start, but we ended up in a good place. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. Oh, don\u2019t be. Screw these reports. I refuse to accept my son\u2019s dead. Thank you, laura. I will pass along that update. Talk to you soon. What? Victor bought it. Oh.\t[ Gasps ] Oh, that\u2019s great. We finally have him off balance. Yeah. So what\u2019s the next part of the plan? We exploit victor\u2019s guilt. Maybe he will admit to something in his grief-stricken state. Ramp up the pressure? Big time. Yeah. Ideas? Don\u2019t worry. I have plenty. Carly, hey. Hey. What is it? Did willow have a setback? No. I mean, it\u2019s just the opposite. I think willow\u2019s gonna be okay. Really? Really. That\u2019s incredible. It\u2019s incredible! I want nikolas out of wyndemere by tomorrow.\t[ Chuckles ] No, no, no. This is not a negotiation, demetrius. The house is mine. I want him out. Good. No, no, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t plan on moving in right away. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m needed here, for the time being. I\u2019ll have dr. Randolph paged right away. Thank you. Do you have any apple juice? Wiley. Sorry about that. It\u2019s no problem. You know what? I think we can scrounge up some juice. What does \u201cscrounge\u201d mean? Well, come on, let\u2019s find out.\t[ Door opens, closes ] So you really mean it? You\u2019ll go through with the cord blood transplant? Yes. I\u2019m going to trust the doctors that our daughter won\u2019t be hurt. She won\u2019T. She won\u2019T. She\u2019s strong, just like her mother. I can\u2019t wait to meet her. Neither can I. And someday, we get to tell her how she saved her mother\u2019s life.\t", "[ Sighs ] Yeah. Can we talk about something else? Yeah, please. You start. Okay. I love waking up with you. I love waking up with you. Anything else you like doing with me? Mm, I can think of a few things. Yeah? Tell me more. I\u2019d rather show you. How are we doing in here? Willow\u2019s in some pain. Is there any way we can up her meds? Michael, no. I don\u2019t want that. You\u2019re uncomfortable. If I have more, I\u2019ll just want to sleep, and I refuse to waste\u2026 we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re ready to discuss treatment now that we know that nina isn\u2019t a viable bone marrow match. The donor registry could still come through. Right, but we can\u2019t count on that, though. I wouldn\u2019t advise it. So what now? There is another option. Please, let\u2019s hear it. As you know, when bone marrow is taken from a donor, stem cells are harvested, and your body can use those healthy stem cells to fight leukemia. But bone marrow isn\u2019t the only source. You can also find stem cells in cord blood from the umbilical cord and placenta. If you\u2019re talking about taking something away from the baby to help me, the answer is no. Willow, willow, if there is an option that can save both you and our daughter, please just hear the doctor out. I find it hard to believe that nikolas would give up wyndemere. Oh, I don\u2019t know. Perhaps he felt he owed it to ava after sleeping with his son\u2019s ex-girlfriend. Well, when you put it that way. It still seems really out of character for my nephew. I hope you\u2019re happy. I don\u2019t know, am I? You\u2019ve gone too far this time. Too far! I\u2019m sorry. What on earth are you talking about? I was just contacted by the paris authorities. Valentin is dead.\tWhat did you just say? Valentin is dead? Laura: I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. A portion of the paris catacombs collapsed last night. Oh, my god. How? Why? I guess they flooded when a water main broke. Rescue efforts are ongoing, but they have already recovered three bodies. Oh. Oh, my god. And one of them has been identified as valentin.\t[ Exhales deeply ] What about \u2014 what about anna? Wasn\u2019t she with him? Martin told me that he saw them leave ireland together, yes. So is one of the other bodies\u2026? A woman, but not identified yet. I\u2013I can\u2019t believe \u2014 I can\u2019t believe valentin is gone. I know. It\u2019s horrible. It\u2019s just horrible. All we can think about is charlotte. She\u2019s going to be so completely devastated. Oh, my god, and robin\u2026 well, we don\u2019t know about that yet. We don\u2019t have confirmation on that. As bleak as it may look, there is still the possibility that anna survived somehow. Enough. Is the blindfold really necessary? Clearly, I\u2019m cooperating. I think it\u2019s best for all of us, you included, if you don\u2019t know where we are. Well, mission accomplished.\t[ Knocks rhythmically ] Okay. Come in. Come on. Come on. Get over here! It\u2019s so good to see you safe. And breathing. Yes, well, there\u2019s that. Good to see you, love. Thank you. Hello, can I please take this thing off? I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. Marty, marty, marty, marty! Lucy! Oh, marty! Lucy! Oh! Oh! Oh, are you a sight for weary eyes or what? Okay, take it all in. Take it all in. And then kiss me this instant. If you insist. At last, this nightmare is over. Not quite. There\u2019s still the small matter of my death. I want to stay right here forever. Is that too much to ask?\t[ Chuckles ] I got to admit, hiding out sounds pretty damn perfect right now. Oh, yes. I don\u2019t want to go back to the real world. You know? Where willow has cancer and wiley might lose his mom and michael \u2014 oh, michael. Michael. I promised michael that I would bring wiley to visit willow. I can\u2019t believe he hasn\u2019t texted me. Michael asked you to bring wiley? That\u2019s promising that things are going to be okay between you two. Yeah. Yeah. I\u2019m lucky michael has a big heart.\t[ Cellphone rings ] Okay, it\u2019s sonny. I think there\u2019s probably news about nina. Hello? No. Are they sure?\t[ Sighs ] Okay. Thanks for calling. Oh, my god. Nina\u2019s not a match? No.\t[ Sighs ] I\u2019m so sorry. Oh, my god, willow is so sick. What if they don\u2019t find a donor in time? I mean, I could strangle her for trying to keep my daughter away from me. I mean, who does she think she is? Nina, stop it. No! Ava, are you saying that I don\u2019t have the right to hate her? Of course you do. But carly is not what\u2019s important right now. I\u2019m not gonna let it go. I\u2019m not. I can\u2019T. I can\u2019t let it go. I know. Because it\u2019s easier to be angry with carly than it is to feel the pain and fear of possibly losing another child, isn\u2019t it? Nina, willow is your daughter and she\u2019s sick. She\u2019s very sick. I can\u2019t save her, ava. I can\u2019T. I won\u2019t do anything to jeopardize our baby\u2019s health. I understand. But the baby won\u2019t be affected in any way other than being delivered by c-section a few weeks early. I know. I agreed to have the baby early to prepare for a marrow transplant. But I was never comfortable with it, and I\u2019m still not. I\u2019d prefer that our daughter be born when she\u2019s ready. But I\u2019ve consulted with dr. Navarro, and she\u2019s confirmed that this late in the pregnancy, the risks to your baby are minimal. 99% of babies born at this stage not only survive, but thrive. And after the birth, when the umbilical cord and placenta are no longer serving a purpose, it\u2019s possible to harvest stem cells from the blood. So what is the success rate of this type of transplant? Nothing\u2019s 100%, but it\u2019s the best chance we have. Because the stem cells would be coming from your baby, he only need about half the hla markers to match, which is less than bone marrow stem cells. That\u2019s incredible. In my medical opinion, this is by far your best option. Will you give it a shot?\t", "Do you know how many times I have imagined this? Not nearly as many as I have. Oh, how I have missed thee. Let you count the ways? I don\u2019t think they have numbers that go that high. Oh, please, you two. Get a room, huh? Mm! Oh, robert. That\u2019s an absolutely brilliant idea. Guess what? We actually have a room. Right this way, mr. Grey. Where you lead, I shall follow.\t[ Laughing ] I think it\u2019s sweet. Is there any reason that we needed to bring him here? It was vital. Yeah, otherwise, lucy would have driven us crazy. When you called this morning to say that you brought lucy back, I don\u2019t remember the last time I was so relieved. And you, your life as a fugitive is over. Are we forgetting the fact that the pcpd happens to have a videotape of someone looking a lot like you putting a shot into lucy point blank. Okay, well, lucy\u2019ll just say the shooter wasn\u2019t anna. Charges dropped, right? I don\u2019t know that I\u2019m ready to reveal myself just yet. Not since we have gone to the trouble of trying to convince victor that valentin is dead. Look, any plan that puts him six feet under is fine with me. Yeah, I thought you\u2019d like that. Oh, robert. Just stop. You know, you really need to think about this. There are people other than victor that will be very upset. What, that he\u2019s croaked? Yes. Are you willing to have that on your conscience? Who contacted you, and why did they call you and not me? Laura: Because charlotte is valentin\u2019s next of kin. Oh, poor charlotte. How do they know the body\u2019s valentin? Oh, don\u2019t pretend you care. Of course I care. He\u2019s my son! Who you tried to control by threatening his little girl.\t[ Sighs ] Charlotte was never in any danger. Oh, face it. You only value family when it works to your advantage! I need to make some calls. I\u2019m just filled with regret \u2014 what we missed out on and what could have been. Will you stop talking in the past tense? Willow is not gone. There is still hope.\tI was her hope. And now that I\u2019m not a match \u2014 see, I was supposed to be the game changer. My bone marrow was supposed to save her life, and\u2026 and then she\u2019d forgive me and she\u2019d love me, and\u2026\t[ Voice breaking ] But she doesn\u2019t want to be my daughter, ava. She \u2014 she doesn\u2019t want anything to do with me. I\u2019ve been there. I know how much that hurts.\t[ Inhales shakily ] I can\u2019t breathe. I just feel like the pain is going through my body with every heartbeat. Now I have to go to the hospital and say goodbye to my cousin when I know my daughter is there fighting for her life, and there\u2019s not a damn thing I can do about it. The very worst part. I won\u2019t survive losing her. I won\u2019T. Oh\u2026 so what do you think?\t[ Door opens ] Is now a good time? Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah, bring him in. Wiley? I\u2019ll give you some time to consider your options. Okay. Mommy, mommy! Whoa! Incoming. Hi, sweet boy. Wiley, I\u2019ll lift you up. Just remember to be careful, okay? Oh, forget careful. I want the biggest, strongest hug I can get get. I\u2019ve missed you so much. I\u2019ve missed you too.\tI want to know exactlywhat the paris police know, and I mean down to the last detail. This \u2014 this is unacceptable. My son was never supposed to be harmed, and I want answers, and I want them immediately! Victor seemed really shaken up. Did he ever?\t[ Chuckles ] Well done, madam mayor. You were very convincing. Yeah. This better work. Laura and alexis know the truth. We brought them in on it. But what about charlotte? I mean, you can\u2019t be okay with letting her believe that you\u2019re dead. There\u2019s a plan in place. Laura knows exactly what to say to charlotte. And if everything has gone according to plan, then laura should have broken the news to victor about now. I\u2019m sure that our illustrious mayor is spot on the target and will deliver on schedule.\t[ Chuckles ] What? You know, sometimes I just can\u2019t believe it. Little laura on the run from frank smith, holding the cassadines at bay with a machine gun. And here we are, the epitome of law and order. Look who\u2019s talking, mr. District attorney. Yeah. My, how the mighty have fallen. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Lucky, you swear to me you\u2019re alright? Mm-hmm? I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m okay. Victor\u2019s goons, they didn\u2019t hurt you, they didn\u2019t touch you in any way? Mnh-mnh. Don\u2019t I feel alright? You\u2026 you\u2026 you feel\u2026 you feel incredible. Still, still, it had to be awful, being victor\u2019s prisoner. Okay, yeah. I mean, I did spend every minute of every hour of every day praying to get out of there, and I did manage to concoct a few escape plans. That\u2019s my girl. I\u2019ll bet you did. But actually, surprisingly, they treated me physically okay. Well, except for the part where I was chained in the basement. I mean, literally chained. I mean, chain chains. I think it was all part of that plan to get anna and valent\u2013 I swear to you, I could just kill that smug son of a bitch. I know. Mm. Okay, to tell you the truth, the worst part? The catacombs! I actually had to swim through the catacombs, and it was disgusting and icky. Okay, deep breath.\t", "[ Breathes deeply ] That is all in the past, and I am back and I\u2019m home safe with you. Yeah.\t[ Laughs ] Yes, you are. And I thank god for that. But I\u2019m not kidding \u2014 watching you get shot \u2014 that \u2014 that drone footage\u2026 I know. You know, rubber bullets, they are really not that rubbery. It\u2019s not a joke. It\u2019s not funny. But they hurt! That was one of the worst moments of my life. My poor baby. I am so sorry you had to go through all of this. Is it is just me, or does this not feel real? It\u2019s real, and I know just how I can convince you it\u2019s so. Oh, I\u2019ll just bet you do.\t[ Laughs ] You evil, evil \u2014\t[ Laughs ] Ava: Oh, nina. You have to hold on to hope. Is there any? Course there is. As long as willow is alive, so is the chance to reconcile. Well, if she beats this cancer, the possibilities of that are remote. Look at it this way. Your feelings changed as soon as you learned that willow is your daughter, yes? You immediately saw her in a different light. Yeah, but it wasn\u2019t the case for willow, and she\u2019s made that abundantly clear. Still early days, nina. I tried to remember the first time that I saw willow, and I don\u2019t know if it might have been the park or the classroom when she was just ms. Tait and she was giving charlotte a hard time. I couldn\u2019t stand her. Because you thought she was picking on your kid. Yeah. Turns out that she was my kid, too. It makes sense that we didn\u2019t get along. She\u2019s a lot like me, never running from a fight. Willow\u2019s always been really strong. Now it\u2019s your turn. Don\u2019t let her push you away. What do you suggest that I do? You want me to force myself into her hospital room? That might be going a little bit too far. Ava, you\u2019re a really good friend. No giving up. No giving up. That\u2019s more like it. Cream cheese or butter? Both. You had cream cheese\tand butter on your bagel? We cut it in half. Yeah. He had one of each. Oh, now, that\u2019s smart, wiley. That way you don\u2019t have to choose. When are you coming home? I\u2019m not exactly sure. But listen, the second the doctors tell me that I can, I\u2019m going to run all the way to the gatehouse. In your hospital gown? I have to. I\u2019d like to see that. Yeah, me, too. Hey, wiley. Here. Let\u2019s give mommy your card that you made her. For me?\t[ Laughs ] Aww. Oh. [ Crying ] You didn\u2019t make this. Yes, I did. I \u2014 this \u2014 these pictures are amazing. I mean, they must have been drawn by a professional artist. Mommy, I\u2019m the artist. Well, um\u2026 thank you. Thank you so much. I love it. I am going to put it right here next to my pillow, so that way, it\u2019s the first thing I see when I wake up in the morning.\t[ Door closes ] Thank you for bringing wiley. Seeing willow\u2019s face light up when she saw him, you know, that\u2019s everything. Yeah. It obviously means the world to her. Meant the world to me that you asked. Hope this means that we\u2019re okay. We\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re okay. Or at least we will be eventually. What did doctor randolph have to say? It was actually good news. There may be a way to save willow.\tI was really relievedto get your call this morning, because I was starting to lose hope. Yes, I know. I was, too. But it is absolutely true, anna, valentin, and lucy, safe and back to the U.S. Good. Alright, so do you think valentin\u2019s supposed death will survive and hold up under victor\u2019s scrutiny? I think so, at least in the short term. And by the way, thank you for your help on that. Well, the invader will print the official story, that the french authorities say that valentin was caught in an underground flood in paris. He\u2019s been declared dead. Excellent. Alright. I should get going. Britt westbourne\u2019s memorial is going to start very soon. I\u2019m so sorry. What happened to her, it\u2019s really tragic. Yes, but she did die a hero. If only all of us could say the same. So we\u2019re good? I got it from here. Thank you. Okay, I-I just \u2014 I have to tell you something. You know, it\u2019s true what they say, when you think it\u2019s over, your life flashes before your eyes. Must have taken a while.\t", "why are you smiling? Did you know that when you sleep, your nose wrinkles just a little bit? It does not. No, it does. It does. It does. I like it. You\u2019re being ridiculous. Yeah, maybe. Ridiculously happy. Good morning. Yeah, it is. Give me the latest. Have they determined the cause of the flooding? Pierre: A water main\tunderneath the building burst.\t[ Sighs ] Well, I am perfectly aware the pipes are old, but it is inconceivable they should just happen to burst on the very night that valentin and anna come to retrieve my guest. Have they found my son?\tNot yet, or ms. Devane or ms. Coe,\tfor that matter. You do realize that\u2019s not the answer I was looking for? What\u2019s the holdup? A section of the adjoining catacombs collapsed. The area is too unstable. I couldn\u2019t care less how dangerous it is. I want a team down there right now looking for my son.\t[ Button clicks ]\t[ Sighs ]\tI hope I wasn\u2019t too much of a disappointment. I was wondering if you would like to join me for dinner. You actually were very, very good, and I was actually very impressed. But what about that belly and your beard? What about them? Mmm. You ready for another round?\t[ Laughs ] Oop. My dear, sweet lucy, where are you?\t[ Elevator bell dings ] You have been ignoring my calls, which I do not appreciate. What the hell \u2014 tell them I\u2019ll pay triple the rate. Because my son might be trapped in those catacombs. He could be injured. Just find him. Alexis. Victor. Everything okay? Oh, just wonderful. Are you having breakfast with your daughters here? I\u2019d love to see them. You never give up, do you? Well, family is worth every effort. Ah. Well, I\u2019m sorry to disappoint you, but I\u2019m here to see the mayor, not my children. Oh, well, that\u2019s a pity. Will you excuse me? So, how\u2019s everything going with nikolas? Oh, I assume you\u2019re referring to my utter and total disappointment in my nephew? Fathering esme\u2019s child is just\u2026 so unseemly? Yes. So I guess things are a little tense at wyndemere? Oh, they would be, but I\u2019ve taken a suite here at the metro court. Not that that has anything to do with a conflict with nikolas. Oh, but why? Oh, I\u2019d have thought my nephew would have told you. He\u2019s handed spoon island over to ava as part of the divorce settlement. Oh, I completely forgot. Britt\u2019s memorial is today, isn\u2019t it? At general hospital? Yeah. We\u2019re honoring her work as co-chief of staff. You know, I think she would really like it. Practicing medicine was really important to her. It showed. How are you holding up? I\u2019m fine. You know, my job right now is to be strong for aunt liesl, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do. I was referring to the willow situation. We haven\u2019t had a chance to talk about that yet. I still can\u2019t believe it. Willow is your daughter? A fact I would never know if that bitch carly had gotten her way.\t[ Monitors beeping ] Hey. Morning. Is it morning? It\u2019s always so hard to tell in here. Did you get any sleep? Uh, yeah, a few hours.\t[ Inhales sharply ] Oh, I\u2019m sorry. Did I hurt you? No, no, no. I don\u2019t mind the pain.

Mm, to be fair, though, carly didn\u2019t know nelle was your daughter until after she had died. And that makes it okay? No, of course not, and I\u2019m not defending her. Well, I should hope not, ava. Because there is no defense. Of course, saint carly will be forgiven because she was protecting willow from evil me, who no one would ever want as a mother. And now that I\u2019m not a bone marrow match, there\u2019s no foul, no harm. Nina \u2014 what? We know that that is what carly is going to say, ava. And everyone, people will buy it. You just wait and see, okay? But I\u2019m going to tell you this. I don\u2019t care if the whole world forgives carly. I\u2019m not, ever. And I am not going to rest until that woman pays for what she did to me. It is so incredible being alone with you. Do you have any idea how hard it is to pretend that we\u2019re just friends?

Well, if you\u2019re feeling the urge. Thank you\u2026 for sticking with me. You had every reason to bail. I\u2019m just really glad you didn\u2019T. I am, too. Any regrets? Except the fact that we can\u2019t go public? Oh, gosh.

Seeing the way you looked at me when you thought I was Stephan,\tI just, I knew in that moment that it wasn\u2019t gonna happen. Not today, not ever.\tAre you saying that you think that someone put that hallucinogen into Chanel\u2019s baked goods now? Who? Why? Well, Jada\u2019s over there right now trying to figure that all out. Well, I am relieved. You\u2019re doing okay. Thanks. But this seems like more than a prank, this could alleged to some serious consequences.\tYeah, believe me, I know. Although the drug did, uh, cause me to do something that I shouldn\u2019t have, albeit not so serious. I mean, On the grand scheme of things, Uhhuh. Okay. Are you going to tell me what you did that you shouldn\u2019t have? Sure. Yeah. I\u2019ll tell you,\tI kissed Jada.\tSo your boss, Rafe, he was one of the people in the hospital. Yeah. Commissioner Hernandez. Phil Ill, and was taking there for observation. How\u2019s it gonna be? Okay. Yeah. He\u2019s expected to make a full recovery. Wow. You must feel relieved. I know how much he means to you. Why does that sound like an accusation?\tI\u2019m just saying he\u2019s my boss. That\u2019s it. Okay. So, uh, what did he do? I mean, when he was under the influence\tti. Huh? Are you okay? You look a little warmer. Yeah. Yeah. I, uh, it\u2019s kind of warm in this kitchen. Sure. Look. Can we, can we just focus on the case, please? Okay. Now that you\u2019re done questioning us, are you gonna arrest Sloan Peterson or what?\tYou\u2019re sitting, Nicole and I could have been drugged. What would make you say that? Uh, well, for starters, the both of you kept babbling on like a couple of lunatics. I mean, she said she saw you dress as a priest. And you said you saw her in a bikini? Yeah, and I thought I did. Mm-hmm. Well, look, maybe I\u2019m being too generous, but it seemed highly unlikely that the two of you would intentionally get high together.\tWell, until you said that, I still couldn\u2019t figure out what caused me to hallucinate. I still don\u2019t. I do. Yeah. Turns out half of town got sick off those baked goods from Sweet bits. Sweet bits. Remember those biscuits, you kept pushing on me. They were tainted. As if it\u2019s not bad enough. Chanel killed both my parents.\tShe\u2019s gotta go and poison the whole town. You\u2019re sure that she\u2019s the one who did this? Come on. Who else? And you know she\u2019s gonna turn this around on me and the whole town\u2019s gonna go along with this.\tI highly doubt you\u2019re gonna find Sloan\u2019s prints in here. I mean, don\u2019t you think she would\u2019ve been smart enough to wear gloves? We\u2019ll see. I did note that there were no signs of forced. Wait, you security cameras. What? Oh my God, I, I totally forgot. Yeah, mama. And insisted that she have her guys come install them like last month.\tYou can access them. Yeah. Yeah. I have an app on my phone. Well, that would make things a lot easier now, wouldn\u2019t it?\tOkay, let\u2019s see. Date yesterday. Time. Oh no, Chanel. I\u2019m so sorry. It\u2019s all my fault. How is this your fault? There\u2019s no footage from last night because she told me to turn it on before I locked up. But I must have been so excited about dinner with you and your mom that I must have forgotten. I guess the security cameras won\u2019t tell us if anyone was here.\tAfter Talia left,\tbefore you lay into me, let me again assure you that I am fully aware of the new policy that prohibits romantic relationships between supervisors and subordinates at Salem pd. It\u2019s okay, Ray, you are under the influence of a substance that you didn\u2019t willingly ingest. Yes. By rules or rules, yes, they are.\tAnd this will have to be documented per policy. Of course. And I want you to know nothing like this will ever happen again. Well, I\u2019m glad to hear that. And I\u2019ll talk to Detective Hunter as will I, as soon as I get outta here and back on. And I trust that, uh, that her assessment of this situation will match yours.\tI would assume so. And I imagine that we all would like to handle this discreetly. Yes, I would definitely like that as hopefully We\u2019ll, detective Hunter, however, there was. Someone else who witnessed the event. Someone saw you kissing Jada. Yeah. Not just someone, Sloane Peterson.\tOkay. Why are you looking at me like that? I was just, well, you didn\u2019t eat any of those biscuit. Yeah, I didn\u2019t eat any Are you insinuating I knew the biscuits were drugged. No, I was just thinking that because Eric, honestly, I would never eat those biscuits because I would never eat anything from that girl or her family.\t", "Seeing giant bears.\tI heard my commissioner was in the hospital, babe. So what happened, Val? Honestly, I have no idea, but I have my best detective on the case.\tOh my God. What is all this? I\u2019m sorry. You girls can\u2019t be in here until we\u2019re done collecting evidence. We need to treat this kitchen as a crime scene. Okay, but this is my bakery. I understand that. Okay. Then you should also understand that you don\u2019t need any more evidence. We all know who slipped those drugs into my biscuit.\tOh, Erica, I want you so much. You are all I want. Nicole. Nicole, what did we do?\tUm,\tIs this a bad time? Again?\tSee, you\u2019re alone. At least maybe you were expecting somebody else.\tYour thoughts.\tHey. Oh, it\u2019s you. Yep, it\u2019s me. These are for you, Lil\u2019s. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m dead yet. No, you\u2019re very much alive. How you feeling? Anything hurt? No thing hurting is my pride. A few hours ago I thought you really wanted me. Turns out I was just delusional.\tLike sand through the hourglass. So are the days of our lives.\tHow are you? Did they say what was causing the hallucinations? They took some blood, but the, uh, test results haven\u2019t come back yet. You sure you shouldn\u2019t still be at the hospital? I\u2019m fine. I started to feel better as soon as they hooked me up to the iv. You didn\u2019t drive yourself home, did you? I wish you would\u2019ve called me.\tIt\u2019s okay. Really?\tOh, I guess you didn\u2019t need me to stay with you at the. It seemed like you were in good hands. Stephan. You mean the real Stephan?\tI admit, I I\u2019m still hazy on the details of what happened to me. I must have been asleep when the doctor came in. So, um, what, uh, what do you remember? Uh, well, I have a vivid memory of trying to bash her head in with an ashtray. It was a remote. Oh, smoking can be hazardous to your health. I, I don\u2019t know what happened to me.\tIt\u2019s like I totally lost my mind. Yeah, me too. I, I think I know why. You and I went on a little trip we hadn\u2019t planned ej. Hi, I, I didn\u2019t mean to interrupt. Whatever. Had your attention must have been quite engaging. Yeah, I was just daydreaming. I\u2019ve been a little off all day and I\u2019m not sure why. Those biscuits are the culprit.\tI\u2019m sorry. A rumor has those yummy little confections were spiked with a toxin that has caused erratic behavior all over the cell.\tWhat? Well, I\u2019m really glad to see you. You haven\u2019t been responding to my text. Yeah, I didn\u2019t come here for a visit. So what brings you by. I, um, I thought I might have, um, left a scarf here. It\u2019s my favorite. Well, I don\u2019t think so, but you know, please feel free to look. Uh, no. Yeah, I don\u2019t see it. I\u2019m sorry. No worries.\tWell, I\u2019ll just get out of your way. And out of your life. Sloan, please wait. What is it about what you said before? Before when? Before I found you and Nicole tangled in those sheets right there. Oh, yes. But believe me, there was a lot of things that I wanted to say that I didn\u2019t, and I appreciate that. But you suggested that Nicole and I must have been drugged.\tWhat would make you think that?\tSloan Peterson has been trying to destroy my life since the minute she got to Salem. She tried to have me thrown to jail, and when that didn\u2019t work, now she decided to come after my business by poisoning the customers.\tChan. If Sloan did this, then we will arrest her. But before that can happen, I need proof what proof the woman is a psycho. Well, let\u2019s see if any prints turn up. Uh, well, you\u2019re gonna find my prints, of course, and mine. Do you know if anyone else has been in this kitchen? Talia and I were alone in here last night, and we always do a thorough cleaning after we close up shop.\tSo if we find a new prints Sloans, if we find Sloan\u2019s prints, then she\u2019ll have a lot of explaining to do. But as a detective, I cannot afford to jump to any conclusions. I haven\u2019t even started questioning anyone, but I think I need to start with you.\tWait, why would you question me? You don\u2019t seriously think your sister would? Of course not. But you said that the recipe for the biscuits for Talia, so I need to know what you put in them so I can compare them to the lab results. Alright. Well, I usually keep my recipes a secret, but I think I can trust my own sister.\tSo yeah, of course. I\u2019ll tell you. I\u2019d appreciate that. Okay. If I record you? Yeah, fine. No problem. Um, it\u2019s actually a very simple recipe. Wheat flour, baking powder, not fat. Yogurt, sugar, kosher salt, honey butter, and a pour of healthy organic buttermilk. Hmm, sounds healthy. You know, the biscuits might raise your cholesterol, but they shouldn\u2019t make anyone sick.\t", "Well, not under regular circumstances, but these Biss were linked to multiple illnesses. How bad was it? Well, the hallucinations were the worst symptoms. Some of the victims experienced it so bad that they were sent to the hospital.\tYou think you were poisoned? I think drugged would be more appropriate. Were you personally targeted? I don\u2019t think so. Apparently Gabby and Stephan had a similar experience to mine. Seems like we all fell under the effects of a powerful hallucinatory drug, but this is widespread throughout Salem. We\u2019re just beginning to learn the consequences.\tYou know, when you were here earlier, it was pretty clear that you weren\u2019t in your right. No, I wasn\u2019t. I, I was convinced that you were stuffing and from what I remember, I practically begged you to make love to me. You did. So why didn\u2019t you\tlike I attempted to explain, Before we\u2019ve tried to claw my eyes out. Oh, I only came onto you because I thought you were Gabby. And then we got into bed and you realized it was just little old me. Don\u2019t take this personally. Ugh. Melinda, you are a very desirable woman. I just happen to be hopelessly in love with somebody else.\tYeah, that. Much as obvious to me now, like, and I apologize for not handling it well. It\u2019s kind of an understatement, huh? Yeah, little bit. She thought you were gonna kill me at one point. I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve taken it that far. Mm. But it does seem like you might have a good case for saw and battery emphasis on the.\tYou\u2019re not gonna press charges, are you? No. Besides, I think the, uh, DA will decline to prosecute. Uh, I appreciate that. Mm-hmm. There is one person that the DA sure as hell is gonna prosecute person who drugged us. Yeah. Am I right to assume that it was ej? No, actually it\u2019s, it\u2019s not for once. I actually think my brother is innocent.\tIt happened to you too, the hallucinations? Mm-hmm. I must admit, at first I thought Stephan was the one responsible for the poisoning that he\u2019d come after me, but as fate would have it, my brother was a victim. Okay, so what was it like for you after you ate the biscuits? Well, uh, when I stepped into the office, it was if I suddenly stepped through the looking la ooh, how weird did it get?\tFor starters, I used the copy machine to produce a rather personal image of what some would say is. Good side. Wow. That is your good side. Mm-hmm. Furthermore, when I tried to distribute the rendered copy, uh, company wide, I, um, I suddenly was convinced that my email password was letter E and the letter J all in caps repeated over and over again 1000 times.\tOh, and that\u2019s not your password. No. No, it\u2019s not. And that would\u2019ve been quite a public relations disaster. And would have ended. No pun intended. My tenures co. C o Oh, I don\u2019t know if it would\u2019ve been that bad, but, uh, Hey, you got any, uh, extra copies now? Why would you want to fact simile when you have a standing invitation to see it in real life?\tOh, ah, I will, I will definitely keep that in mind. Mm-hmm. So tell me, do you do anything crazy while under the influence? Oh, Actually I did.\tSo what did you do while under, under the Influence? I hope you didn\u2019t embarrass yourself as much as I did.\tHere you go. Oh.\tActually,\twhen I was experiencing the delusions, I went to basic black and I cut off all the colors of the samples for the summer line. The colors? Yeah, because apparently I was convinced that it looked like something a priest would wear. Ah, that is definitely. Huh. But fortunate you didn\u2019t do anything more extreme.\tYes. Very fortunate. But at at least you didn\u2019t call way shin or make any other rash decision having to do with Humira. Right? Right. Like I did when Stephan drug me. Exactly. And speaking of whom, it, it sounds like the two of you have declared war again. Yes, we have. And this time I\u2019m going to win decisively.\tYou know, initially yes, I thought it was e j\u2019s handiwork, but from what I hear, EJ and Rafe and a whole bunch of other people got sick too in the working theory is that everybody was drugged. I\u2019m eating the biscuits at Sweet Bits. The biscuits. The biscuits. Really? Yeah. So the Saban PDs working on it now.\tFor better or worse. Oh, I\u2019ll stay on them. The person who did this will be punished accordingly. I don\u2019t doubt that. And now you can go. Um, and please feel free to take your flowers with you. Why would I do that? I brought them for you. Come on, the char is over. Stephan. You and Gabby can have your happily ever.\tSo give the flowers to her.\tWell, I don\u2019t have to tell you, I was sorely tempted to take you to bed, but I didn\u2019t want it to happen like that cuz of some drug tricking the mind. Let\u2019s be honestly, you haven\u2019t been above tricking me before. I can\u2019t deny that, but no, this was, this was d. It wasn\u2019t real and I love you too much to take advantage of you like that.\t", "And I have to say, you, uh, you\u2019re pretty cool and fun and attractive, and some guy one day is going to be very lucky to have you in his life. For real. Well, thanks. And now you should go be with the woman that you love. There\u2019s no reason for you guys to be a part anymore. Right? That\u2019s right. Now that Lee Shin knows everything.\tYou are letting me go. You seem surprised. Of course. I\u2019m surprised you\u2019ve spent a year doing everything you can to try to hang on to me. I. I just thought that when you knew the truth about stuff and I, yes. I thought you\u2019d tried to punish me. Well, I can\u2019t deny that I was angry, but mostly hurt. It\u2019s obvious to me that you don\u2019t regret it.\tI don\u2019t.\tWell, I have regrets. Lots of them. You know, my, my whole life I was groomed to be the success at business, to be cold and calculating and take what I want, but I, I never learned the personal side, and I\u2019m afraid that, In my pursuit of you and and desperation to hold on to our relationship, I used tactics that were better suited for a hostile takeover than a marriage.\tAnd the worst part is that I hurt you.\tBut despite all. I hope you know I, I really did love you.\tI know you did, and yeah, I, I hurt you too. I, I made an agreement to honor our marriage for six months, and I did not honor that\tyou\u2019re trying to be with the man you. And keep ahold of the Demer shares. Can you blame a girl for wanting to have it all?\tGuess we have that in common, right? Yeah. Yes, we do. Well, I\u2019m gonna start fighting for. But I\u2019ll never stop believing that we could have been good together. We were good together. Right. You were so, uh, heels off,\tdeals off.\tThanks again for your help with me and e. You\u2019re welcome. And now that you and Gabby have joined forces to take over the world, I need to remember one thing. All right? You both owe me one. And when the time is right, I have every intention of collecting on that debt.\tI texted my lawyer, she\u2019s starting to draw up divorce papers. Yeah. Don\u2019t tell mine that this should be a smooth process. I appreciate that. We did have some really good times together, right? Yeah, for sure.\tYou know, since we did have good times and I\u2019d like to look back on them fondly,\tMaybe, maybe you consider letting me keep your Demari shares.\tHell no\tworth the shot.\tHow are you feeling? Bossun? Doing fine. Thanks. And how are you feeling? Me? Yeah. I told the mayor what happened between us while I was under the influence of drugs. Okay. Well, I\u2019m sure re explained to you that he was not in his right mind and a story. Hmm. So can we just, um, talk about the case now? Let\u2019s do it.\tWhat\u2019s the. Oh, well, I just came from sweet bits and unfortunately Chanel security cameras were not engaged last night. Oh, that\u2019s too bad. Yeah, but the lab called me on my way here. And the drugs found in your system as well as the DA\u2019s and your sisters all matched something that were in those biscuits.\tOkay, cool. What was it? A strong hallucinogen, something they hadn\u2019t seen before. Needless to say, Chanel did not put that in her own batter. Meaning someone\u2019s trying to destroy Chanel and her bakery and they don\u2019t care who they hurt to do it.\tWell, I turned on the security cameras. Better leave than never. Right. Hey, maybe Sloan will return to the scene of the crime and we can buster this time. Chanel, I am so sorry if I would\u2019ve just turned on those damn cameras. Stop blaming yourself. I can\u2019t tell you how many times I\u2019ve forgotten to turn them on.\tLook, I know you\u2019ve got my back. Your sister\u2019s gonna prove who did this and we are gonna make them pay.\tThis isn\u2019t fair. Because you know, I can\u2019t say no to you. It\u2019s one of my favorite things about you. Hey, why don\u2019t you go downstairs, grab us a table. I\u2019ll take a quick shower and be down there in a minute,\tNicole.\tNicole, are you there? I\u2019m, I\u2019m here. Uh, I was just calling to make sure that we were on the same page about what happened and after we talked when Sloan left, we decided that yeah, we were both out of our minds because of some kind of drug. Right. And I, I didn\u2019t tell ej and I don\u2019t want him to know, so it has to be our little.\tAgreed. Okay. Well, I\u2019m, I\u2019m glad we could come together on this. Anything else? No. No. That, that, that\u2019s it.\tWell, um, yeah. Have a great day. Yeah, you too.\t", "I mean, you believe me, right? Yes. You know, cuz you did. He did, um, suggest that I trashed plaintiff\u2019s office evil. I asked and you answered, you said you had nothing to do with. You didn\u2019t vandalize her office or send her threatening texts, and I believe you. You sure? Yes. I\u2019m sure you said you didn\u2019t need any of those biscuits.\tI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re okay. That\u2019s sweet, Eric. But you can save all your cares and concerns for Nicole. Wait, Sloan, wait. No, you promised me. You swore to me it was over between you two and somehow you find your way back to one another.\tAre you sure? The thing between you and Stefan isn\u2019t gonna get outta control. I appreciate that. You are concerned for me, but I can handle my Ba of brother. Hmm. Technically aren\u2019t you a bastard too? Damn, rod. I am. And Ste is going to learn that the hard way. Look Nicole, I appreciate having you in my corner.\tI really do. Like I established before, I don\u2019t want to spend all our time together plotting my brothers down for, so right now you. Have my full attention.\tWhat\u2019s\tLinda? For what it\u2019s worth, um, I\u2019m sorry. All this happened to you. I appreciate it and I\u2019m sorry I tried to murder you. Oh, maybe I had it coming. No, you didn\u2019t. You were always honest about. Why I was there and what you needed from me. I was the one who wasn\u2019t honest about my feelings to, to you or to myself.\tWell, it was still insensitive of me to ask you to help me out in this way. You know, for a demira, you\u2019re a pretty nice guy. Oh, don\u2019t let that make its way around. Oh.\tIs this your new strategy? That kept me to think that suddenly you\u2019re this nice guy. It\u2019s not a strategy, just facing reality. Talked to Jing Wen earlier before you had your episode, I was going to tell you when you walked in, tell me what I\u2019m giving. I\u2019m chasing after you. Gabby. You are giving up. Yeah, I\u2019m letting you go.\tYou\u2019re free. From our agreement, from our marriage, from all of it. You can be with the man you love.\tI am, I\u2019m sorry, I, I guess I\u2019m still feeling a little loopy from whatever was in those biscuits. You weren\u2019t feeling well? No. I\u2019ll be fine. I think I just need to go upstairs, take a shower and try to clear my head. Of course. Do what you need to.\tNicole and I are not together, could fool me. You said yourself. We were not clear minded. It was just random that the two of you ended up in bed together. I don\u2019t deny that we have history feels more like current events. Okay. What happened here was a one-time thing. And why should I believe that? Because Nicole and I are not together.\tEven when we\u2019re clearheaded, we can barely tolerate each other. That doesn\u2019t change anything for you or for her? Both. And I\u2019m hoping this doesn\u2019t change anything between you and me. Whatever. Like it\u2019s not like I\u2019m your girlfriend. So you keep saying, but you came here earlier to apologize. Correct? Look, I was hurt.\tOkay. Because you made me feel like you didn\u2019t trust me with the whole pulling and Chanel thing, and, but yes, I overreacted then. Yes, I accept your apology as I hope that you will accept mine. And what I\u2019d really like to do is for us to go downstairs and have dinner together. You wanna have dinner after all this dinner?\tYes. And then what? And then we\u2019ll see where it takes us.\tSo we called Sloan into the station so we could examine her phone. Sincere. She\u2019s the one sending those threatening texts to Paulina. Yes. And that\u2019s when she walked in on you kissing Jada Pat timing, huh? Yeah, he could say that, especially considering Sloan\u2019s insistence that she\u2019s innocent and the victim of police harassment.\tYou think she\u2019s gonna use this against you? I\u2019d be surprised if she didn\u2019t. Yeah. It\u2019s ironic. Sloan is probably responsible for that kiss even happening. So you think that she\u2019s the one who put the drug in the biscuits? Well, we both know that somebody\u2019s targeting, she knows bakery Sloan is the most likely suspect.\tLook, I don\u2019t need surveillance footage to know that Sloane Peterson is the rat in our. Only rides are smart and we still don\u2019t have any proof. She\u2019s right, Chanel. Until we find something that connects Sloane to those biscuits, there\u2019s nothing I can do. Damn, that bitch is ruining my life. I understand. But for now, both of you need to keep your distance from her.\tLet me do my job. And I promise you, we will find who did this and bring them to justice.\tYou sure you\u2019re gonna be okay from the poisoning or from you trampling on my heart. Both. I\u2019ll survive and goun. You don\u2019t want people to get the wrong idea about us, do you? I don\u2019t care what other people think and I have to say.

She brought out the best in people.\tNikki: Mm. I can see her now in an incredible gown, making her way through the crowd.\tEsther: Yeah. Every stranger a friend.\tVictor: Well, wait a minute. Every stranger was on guard because, as you know \u2014 we all know \u2014 katherine had a tongue as sharp as a knife, you know?\tEsther: Yeah.\tNikki: Endlessly entertaining.\tVictor: Yes.\tEsther: Yes.

How\u2019s it been for you having your dad and mother back in your life?\tKyle: Look, I don\u2019t know you, but I take it you never stop looking for trouble.\tLeanna: Why would I, my dear? It\u2019s what I do best.\tDiane: Tricking me into thinking kyle was sick? You know, that\u2019s a new low, even for you. No wonder you\u2019re alone tonight. You\u2019ve tried for months to unmask me, but the only thing you\u2019ve accomplished is letting everyone get a glimpse of your truly desperate existence.\tPhyllis: My goodness, you know so much about me, but you just don\u2019t know when to shut up.\tDiane: You\u2019re the problem, phyllis. You couldn\u2019t let it go. And now everyone sees who you really are.

Listen. The most important thing here is you and you being in my life. So, moving forward, if there\u2019s anything that could possibly jeopardize our relationship, it has to be gone.\tJill: Am I hearing you right? Are you telling me that you would consider walking away from chancellor-winters?\tLily: Well, let\u2019s just give devon some time to think about things, right? I mean, this is all happening really fast.\tJill: So, would tomorrow be too soon?\t[ Laughter ]\tDevon: How about we take one step at a time?\tJill: Well, can you blame me for wanting to get back to the fun stuff? You know, the buying, the selling, the taking over the world?\tDevon: Yeah, no, I can\u2019t blame you at all, jill.\tJill: Seriously, thank you so much for agreeing to end this hideous chapter.

[ Chuckles ]\tNina: How could you?\tAbby: I never meant \u2014\tNina: No, really. Please explain to me what chance ever did to make you think that he deserved to be treated like that.\tAbby: Nothing. Chance didn\u2019t do \u2014\tNina: You know, when I heard it, I thought, \u201cno, it\u2019s a lie.\u201d It couldn\u2019t be true. How could it be? You were the one who refused to believe the stories of his death when he was overseas. And you went there and you found him and you brought him back to his son and to his family, just to break his heart?\tAbby: That was never my intention.\tNina: Oh, you didn\u2019t mean to destroy his dreams of having a family with you? Well, that\u2019s nice to hear. I\u2019d hate to think what hell you would unleash if you meant to hurt him.\tAbby: I loved chance with all of my heart.\tNina: No, except the part that slept with devon. Devon! Dominic\u2019s biological father. It\u2019s like you went out and you found the one person to hurt chance the most.\tAbby: It wasn\u2019t like that.\tNina: No?\tAbby: No. And, look, I am sorry. I will forever be sorry for the pain that I caused chance. He didn\u2019t deserve that.\tNina: I really hope that he gets past what you did to him because I never will.\tNever.\tSharon: If I want to ask someone to dance, I will do so. I don\u2019t need you to do it for me.\tAdam: Of course not. But time is passing away. I just thought maybe you were waiting for gcpd\u2019s number-one detective.\tSharon: Chance? Yeah. You know, I \u2014 I thought he was gonna be here tonight.\tAdam: I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be here soon.\tSharon: Are you trying to set me up?\tAdam: What? I\u2019m not. But if you need a wingman, here I am.\tSharon: And you think it would be with chance? Chance was rey\u2019s partner and someone who loved him. Yeah, he\u2019s really handsome and attractive. So, maybe in another lifetime \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 I would let you play the role of the wingman, um, but we\u2019re just friends. That\u2019s it.\tAdam: Okay. I hear you. And I will back off. I just \u2014 I think you deserve\u2026\tSharon: What? Romance?\tAdam: You deserve to be happy, sharon. And, yes, you have a big, full life, absolutely, but\u2026\tSharon: No \u201cbuts.\u201d I do. I am happy. I mean, maybe some people think my life is a little bit quiet, but, trust me, I have had enough drama and chaos to last me a lifetime. A little peace and quiet suits me just fine right now.\tAdam: Mm. Then I stand corrected.\tSharon: And, besides, soon I\u2019m gonna have aria, and that will make things interesting \u2014 and loud.\t[ Chuckles ]\tAdam: I\u2019m gonna have someone interesting and loud of my own in a few months, too.\tSharon: Mm-hmm. Well, I think it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s important to be grateful for what you have and not stay fixated on what you don\u2019T. I think that\u2019s the key to happiness.\tDevon: God, I wish he was here. He would love this place so much.\tLily: He would. What do you think he would say if he were here right now?\tDevon: Oh. \u201cTurn up the music\u201d?\tLily: [ Laughs ] Oh, my god.\tDevon: Right?\tLily: He would. He also would say that the picture is really good, but that he\u2019s definitely more handsome in person.\tDevon: [ Chuckles ]\tLily: You know that, right?\tDevon: Yeah. And then he would probably ask you to dance\u2026\t", "Nate: I don\u2019t care about the method, just the results.

Is that what you want?\tPhyllis: No. No. You\u2019re not worth the trouble, diane.\tDiane: Yeah, and you\u2019re not worth my time. You see, there\u2019s an incredibly handsome man downstairs who adores me, and he is minutes away from making an announcement that will change our lives forever.\tPhyllis: Unless he\u2019s gonna tell everybody what a manipulative bitch you are, I\u2019m not interested.\tDiane: You will be. Phyllis, you have spent so much energy trying to get me out of your life. But guess what. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\tPhyllis: Oh, that is right.

I think I might have lost you.\tNina: I\u2019m sorry. Just random work thoughts.\tTraci: Oh, really? Are you writing anything interesting?\tNina: As a matter of fact, I am. It\u2019s about an overprotective mother who\u2019s obsessed with her son, who, on the most exciting night of the year, has decided to skip the party because he\u2019s afraid to run into the last woman he loved because she shredded his heart. He\u2019s such a good soul. He deserves to be happy. But he probably blames himself for what happened.\tTraci: Um, this sounds a little specific.\tNina: You know, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just figuring out chance may not be on a big stakeout at all.

Look, I know their breakup was really shocking, but I thought they were getting along.\tNina: Yeah, well, chance probably made it look that way because he\u2019s such a good person, but she broke his heart. She hurt him. He didn\u2019t deserve that.\tNikki: No, of course he didn\u2019T.\tNina: I think I\u2019ve got some things to say to her.\tTraci: Uh, nina, right now? I mean, seriously. Everyone is having a wonderful time. Do you think that\u2019s wise?\tNina: I came a long way to get here.

You two are talking? To each other? This is very unexpected.\tLily: I know. I think we both just realized that when two people think they\u2019re right, they stop listening.\tDevon: And so I decided to pay attention to what lily was actually asking of me. And I did what I knew our dad would want me to do if he were here.\tLily: And I think we both realized, too, that we were heading down a path where we were really damaging our relationship.\tDevon: Yeah. And family is way too important for that. So, as of tonight, I am no longer fighting the merger and I\u2019m going to drop the suit.\tJill: Oh, my god. This is incredible. Oh, I\u2019m so relieved. You know what? We need a special bottle of bubbly. What do you say we send somebody down the cellar and we\u2019ll get a really great vintage?\tDevon: Maybe we hold off on that for now.\tJill: What aren\u2019t you telling me?\tLily: Well, he\u2019s dropping the lawsuit, you know.\tDevon: Yeah. It hasn\u2019t resolved everything.\tNate: Look. Lily and devon are smiling with each other, all relaxed and maybe even happy.\tElena: They look like themselves again, the way things should be.\tNate: Thank god it happened, but I don\u2019t know what did the trick.\tElena: Well, the only important thing is that they\u2019re on the right path.

This father and son reunion is killing her. Just seeing her try not to work herself into a frenzy \u2014 it\u2019s a gift that keeps giving.\tSharon: Adam\u2026\tAdam: I know what you\u2019re gonna say. Okay? And you\u2019re right. We\u2019re not here to celebrate victoria driving herself crazy. Tonight is about genoa city\u2019s bicentennial.\tSharon: That\u2019s right.

Wh\u2013 did you just question my abilities as an answer?\tSally: I don\u2019t know. I have heard things.\tNick: Oh, no, no. You \u2014 let\u2019s go.

And, well, remember what valentin said. No matter what, don\u2019t take no for an answer. Um, can you smell something burning?\t[ Sniffs ]\t[ Door opens ] Anna. What are you doing? Just burning my past. Hey. Are you \u2014 are you warming his bottle? Um, you know, now that it\u2019s officially summer, I was thinking I\u2019d just make popsicles out of his formula, so I\u2019m freezing it. Please tell me you\u2019re joking. Obviously. I guess since laura and kevin aren\u2019t here, I\u2019ll have to share my good news with you. You\u2019ve decided to turn yourself in for your many crimes? I just got my first paycheck. Ohh! Spencer: Honest pay for honest work. How does it feel? It felt great. Until I saw the amount. I was hoping it would be more. Yeah. I\u2019ve been there. You worked? Mm-hmm. At kelly\u2019S. It is a shock at first, but you get used to it. Yeah, well, here\u2019s hoping. So how is the job? Um, well, you know, ace is loving daycare, and everyone at the daycare adores ace. I mean, who wouldn\u2019t? He\u2019s adorable. No argument there. And the invader staff seems to hate me much less now that I am transferring calls to the right people \u2014 mostly. That\u2019s great. What? I\u2019m just not used to you being nice to me. Well, uh, you know, grandmother asked the two of us to get along, at least while she and kevin are away, so\u2026 y-yeah, well, I mean, that\u2019s just it, isn\u2019t it? I mean, laura\u2019s the reason we\u2019re managing to get along even this well. I mean, and \u2014 and now laura\u2019s going to chechnya to track down ace\u2019s father. I\u2019m just afraid that this is all gonna fall apart.\t[ Ace fussing ] Where\u2019s ned? Brook lynn: Maybe they just took him for some tests. No, he\u2019s gone. No. He has to still be here! He doesn\u2019t know who he is, so he wouldn\u2019t even know where to go, right?! Right? How\u2019s carly handling this? Well, how do you think? She\u2019s ready to go to war for drew. War with who? I mean, look. This \u2014 even if \u2014 if ned\u2019s responsible, he doesn\u2019t even know who he is. Yeah, that\u2019s convenient for ned and the worst possible outcome for drew. Ava, I didn\u2019t plan for this to happen, but now that it has, I mean\u2026 there is a tiny part of me that almost \u2014 almost \u2014 feels sorry for carly. What is she going to do without drew for three long years? I know. It\u2019s just \u2014 I feel so awkward. A-ava. L-let me call you back, okay? Just the person I\u2019ve been looking for.\tAre you insane? Do you realize how rarely the wsb gives out commendations? Yes, but it\u2019s useless now, isn\u2019t it? No, it isn\u2019T. But you didn\u2019t burn this newspaper instead. Look. I\u2019m so sorry. I don\u2019t mean to be rude, but I really intended to spend the evening alone, okay? Or you could come along with us to the savoy and maybe have a good time? You haven\u2019t been out of the house in days. How do you know that? We\u2019ve been surveilling you. Valentin reached out to us. He\u2019s worried about you. Well, that\u2019s just because he feels guilty. You know, we\u2019re not spending his last night in port charles together, so\u2026 he told us that you insisted that he spend his last night with charlotte before he left for chechnya with kevin and me. Yeah, okay, so, apparently this is coming as a shock to all of you, but I am not very good company right now. Anna. Look. I have been enlisted to get you to come along to this club tonight. Now, the basic idea was valentin\u2019s, and you know how much I despise him. So why don\u2019t you come along and endure it? If I can do it, you can do it. That sounds like a lovely invitation. Just come with us. I don\u2019t want to! I want to stay here \u2014 with my thoughts and my fire, alright? And you\u2019re fine, right? Yes. Really? Yes. Then\u2026 what are you doing reading trash like this? Every word of it is true. I was a double agent. And innocent people were hurt because of me. And I really think that it\u2019s about time I dealt with that. I have not been seeing robert. You said \u201chave not,\u201d and not \u201chaven\u2019T.\u201d And when you do that, something\u2019s wrong. I just don\u2019t wish to discuss it. That\u2019s all. Alright. I\u2019m not gonna meddle. I\u2019m just gonna pry. What happened with robert? Absolutely nothing! He chose holly. Holly left town. And that, as they say, is that. So if he chose holly, why did she leave town? I have no idea. Well, did robert say that he chose holly? No. He just didn\u2019t call and he didn\u2019t write. Ergo, he was at home nursing a broken heart. And as you know, I am nobody\u2019s rebound. And as you know, I don\u2019t wait by the phone. Hell no, you don\u2019T. Mm-hmm. You deserve better.\t[ Chuckling ] Damn right. Okay. I\u2019m exhausted. Let\u2019s go. You didn\u2019t do anything! That\u2019s how I exercise. You didn\u2019t exercise! Let\u2019s go get something to eat. You can\u2019t eat! You haven\u2019t exercised! Well, wait for me! Watch me. Alright, alright, alright. Grandmother wouldn\u2019t have left us here alone if she didn\u2019t think that we could handle it, esme. I\u2019ve been doing everything that I can to share in this responsibility with you. Yes, you have been really helpful. I\u2019m just wondering, will your commitment be the same when laura\u2019s not here? I mean, what happens when it\u2019s just you, me, and ace?\t", "We couldn\u2019t! Am I in trouble? Did I forget something? No. You didn\u2019t forget anything. Oh. Okay. But I know how busy you\u2019ve been, and I thought maybe we can have a chill night in. And I-I even brought some snacks. Well, it\u2019s so good to see you, snacks or no snacks, but\u2026 are you guys gonna watch a movie? W-we \u2014 we haven\u2019t decided yet. Well, I mean, there\u2019s a lot of movies and shows on streaming right now. Yeah. Y\u2013 there \u2014 yeah. You guys don\u2019t mind if I join you, do you? Um\u2026\t[ Trina and spencer chuckle ] I\u2019m just kidding. Okay. I am going to go feed ace and then give him a bath, and then it\u2019s bedtime for both of us. Um, isn\u2019t that right, little guy? Want to go to bed?\t[ Cellphone beeping ] Oh, there\u2019s that timer. Sorry. I\u2019ll, um \u2014 I\u2019ll grab that. Oh, no, no, no. You have company. I\u2019ll do it. Okay. Yeah. Yeah.\t[ Sighs ] Wow. What? Just \u2014 it\u2019s just a shock to the system to see you and esme together like this. Like what? Just\u2026 on the same side, like you used to be.\tRight now I\u2019m a front man without a band. Need to get one together. You got representation? No, not currently. I\u2019m gonna put out some feelers, though. It\u2019s been a while. Yeah. I know how that is. I\u2019m sure \u2014 you know a few people in the music business, I\u2019m sure, right, dad? Yeah. I don\u2019t see why I can\u2019t reach out. You\u2019re not into music, are you? Uh, sure, yeah. Yeah. Really? Yeah. What was the last show that you went to? Uh, actually, phideaux. Right here on the stage. Phideaux. Never heard of him. Well, you should. But, then again, that was a long time ago. Since then, I\u2019ve been kind of busy taking care of my family and running the business.\t[ Chuckling ] Oh. Right. All business. You\u2019re all business, aren\u2019t \u2014 life is short. You got to live a little, kid. Right? Relax. How\u2019d it go? Uh, great. Uh, the issue is headed to \u2014 to the press. Issue? I run a magazine. So, eddie, what do you think of the savoy? After some of the dives that I\u2019ve played in, this place is a palace. And, look, you\u2019re the mayor of port charles. You should not be seen with me. What if someone were to take our photo? I don\u2019t care about that. Well, maybe you should. You know? You\u2019re a politician. Yeah, you know, I didn\u2019t get elected to office by trying to hide my past. And I am well aware of the complexity of yours. And I would be honored to have my picture taken with you. I would challenge anyone to compare the good you\u2019ve done against the wrongs they\u2019re writing. It\u2019s no contest, anna. I appreciate that. And I knew, of course, that you wouldn\u2019t turn your backs on me, no matter how much I want you to. But it isn\u2019t about what other people think of me. This is what I think of me. And I had come to terms with my past and even the crimes that I was part of, you know? Because of my work as an agent, I felt that somehow I was balancing the scales. But now I\u2019m no longer an agent, and I won\u2019t ever be again, I realize that I\u2019m not ready to let go of that part of my life. Because I feel like my work isn\u2019t done. I invested in a small record company back in the \u201990s. One of the co-owners was a friend of mine from the, you know, old neighborhood. Very ambitious. And she brought in two singers. One of them made it really big. Uh, I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing now. He\u2019s just living the crazy life, I guess.\t[ Cellphone chimes ] Oh. Uh, I am so sorry. I got another work call. Okay. You see? A beautiful woman like that, and she can\u2019t even enjoy a night out. Take my advice, michael. Don\u2019t let work consume you! Ned. Good to see you. Glad to see you out and about. I\u2019m sure olivia\u2019s delighted. Um, corinthos. A word? Hey, my friend. I\u2019ll be right back, okay? Right. How can I help you? Well, I\u2019m curious. Mm-hmm. Why does sonny corinthos need someone else to fight his battles for him? What battles are we talking about here? You\u2019re gonna have to narrow it down. Okay. No problem. Well, actually, it is a problem\u2026 when you start using diane miller \u2014 diane miller? What are you talking about? Excuse me, district attorney. You\u2019re not accusing my client of something without his attorney being present, are you? Esme and I are in no way on the same side. We\u2019re just trying to make the best of a very, very messed-up situation right now. That\u2019s fine. In fact\u2026 I\u2019m glad your living situation is more\u2026tolerable.\t[ Chuckles ] Unfortunately, it means that you and i have less time to spend with one another, and for that, I am really sorry. I felt terrible when I had to leave curtis\u2019 birthday party early.\t[ Sighs ] What? Something happen?\t[ Scoffs ] When is something ever not happening with my family? My family\u2026 which curtis is. Care to get more specific?\t[ Exhales deeply ] Curtis and I were just starting to get closer and learn how to talk to one another\u2026 and he did something that really upset my mom. Do you want advice, or do you just need me to listen? I don\u2019t think anybody can give me advice on this. Well, then, listening it is. Just an informal chat. Nothing official. I still don\u2019t know what we\u2019re chatting about, and at this point, I\u2019m starting to lose interest. I don\u2019t like the fact that you\u2019re using diane miller to get confidential information from me.\t[ Stammers ] Let me handle this. By all means. Where\u2019s ned? He\u2019s with sonny and michael. Alexis: Can\u2019t take you anywhere. Where is he? Nina, where is ned? You said he was with sonny and michael. Well, he was. He was just here a second ago. What, you lost him?! Olivia, he can\u2019t be far. We\u2019re gonna find him. Good evening, everyone, and welcome to the savoy!\t", "[ Knock on door ] Here. Will you please take him? I\u2019ll get that. No, no. I-I\u2019ll get it. Don\u2019t listen to her. I\u2019m not going anywhere. I thought you were staying in tonight. Here\u2019s ned\u2019s wallet. There\u2019s no cash. Do you know if he was carrying any? I-I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t know. Alright. I\u2019m gonna go talk to the nurses. Ned would not have left G.H. Eddie maine, however, is foolish, immature, and thoughtless. You know what? You know what? That is still my husband that you\u2019re talking about. Yeah, well, in the immortal words of eddie maine, \u201clady, I don\u2019t know you.\u201d Okay. Listen! If they didn\u2019t take dad for tests, maybe he just went for a walk or is raiding the vending machines, okay? We don\u2019t know that he left the hospital. Chase will find out for us. This is not a reason to panic. Give it time. You were looking for me? Yeah. Let me buy you a drink, and you can tell me all about this place. The savoy? Yeah. Well, like, what kind of talent do you bring in here? And how are the crowds? They\u2019re good, depending on the band. I-I\u2019m sorry. I just have to ask you. Aren\u2019t you supposed to be in the hospital? Ohh. You think you know me, don\u2019t you? Well\u2026 you don\u2019T. But you will soon. You and anyone else with a lick of taste and an ear for good music. My name\u2019s eddie. Eddie maine. Nina. Nina reeves. Pleased to meet you, eddie. Nice to meet you. Let\u2019s get that drink\u2026 nina reeves. Michael: At the moment, he doesn\u2019t even know who my mom and drew are or the fact that he turned them in to the sec for insider trading. I was a silent partner in l&b records when eddie maine was touring. Ned lived a double life, but he always knew who he really was. Yeah, and now he thinks he\u2019s eddie. How sure are the doctors? You think he\u2019s lying? I didn\u2019t say that, but I need to see it for myself. Well, here\u2019s your chance. Let the good times roll.\tuh, fine. They printed the truth. But it\u2019s all ancient history, and you\u2019ve more than atoned for all of it. Have I, though? I-I feel as if I threw myself into work so I wouldn\u2019t have to face the truth of what I did\u2026 and that if I ran fast enough or far enough, then my past wouldn\u2019t catch up with me. Right? And now it has. Oh, anna, you\u2019re not running from your mistakes. If anything, you\u2019ve owned up to your past. Laura: Look at it this way. Think of all the times you put your life at risk to help others. Now, were you doing that because you wanted to atone or because that\u2019s just who you are? Some people may never know, but the fact is those acts of heroism and \u2014 and all the good that you\u2019ve done, that can\u2019t be denied. Laura\u2019s right. You\u2019re still a hero. I\u2019m also a traitor. And you\u2019ve called me that. And I just don\u2019t want to involve you all in this by association. You know what, robert? Why don\u2019t you, uh, go ahead and get us a table at the savoy? That\u2019s a good idea. We\u2019ll meet you over there. I\u2019ll see you out. Yeah. What ever happened to not taking no for an answer? Yeah, well, we still haven\u2019T. Get us a good table. Not too close. Perhaps for drinks, too? Oh, of course. Yes. I know what this looks like. But I\u2019m not wallowing. Alright? I\u2019m not. I think you\u2019re taking stock. Yeah, I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. Thank you for understanding. Of course. But what I don\u2019t understand is why you\u2019re shutting us out. Ned: I\u2019ve been away from port charles for a while, so I\u2019m just trying to get my bearings. I\u2019m trying to find all the happening spots in town. What\u2019s going on? Nina: Hey, honey. T-this is eddie maine. And he was just asking about the music scene here in port charles. Eddie, this is my fianc\u00e9, sonny corinthos. Oh! Well, I must say, your fianc\u00e9 is one lucky guy. Yeah, I am. I apologize if I overstepped. What do you mean? Don\u2019t worry. You didn\u2019T. How about you let me buy you a drink? You know, I was just wondering why you\u2019re in a nightclub when you just got out of the hospital. Now, how\u2019d you know about that? Oh. Right. Well, sonny, hospitals are for sick people. Uh-huh. And lucky for me, I\u2019m not sick. Right, right. So why don\u2019t you let me buy you a drink? Michael, my son. We were j\u2013 michael. Eddie. Hey. Nice to meet you. Likewise. We w ant to hear all about yourmusic stories and everything. Weren\u2019t you gonna make that call for me? Yes. Yes. Thank you for reminding me. It\u2019s a business thing. I\u2019ll be right back. Right. Excuse me. Uh, so, what \u2014 what kind of music do you play?\t[ Line ringing ]\t[ Sighs ] Come on, olivia. Pick up.\t[ Cellphone rings ]\t[ Scoffs ] This is the last thing I need. It\u2019s nina. I can\u2019t even begin to think about the metro court right now.\t[ Cellphone rings ] Oh, my god! Just stop! Okay. I spoke to one of the nurses, and\u2026 don\u2019t panic, but ned checked himself out.\t[ Gasps ] How could they let him do that? He signed a form saying he was leaving against medical advice. What name did he use? If he signed out as eddie maine, they should have put him in a straitjacket instead of letting him run free.\t[ Cellphone rings ] Okay. It doesn\u2019t matter how he got out of here. The fact is that he\u2019s gone and we got to figure out where. Ned would not have left the hospital. Eddie maine is probably busking on a street corner somewhere. What? I just wish I could think you were wrong. Well, where do musicians hang out?! You guys keep brainstorming. I\u2019m gonna call this in to the station, see if they can help track down ned. Okay. That was nina. Oh, my god. She\u2019s calling you?! What is her problem?! She found dad. Where? Where is he? At the savoy. A nightclub. Why didn\u2019t we think of that? We better go before he tries to break loose again. Come on. Let\u2019s go. Well, can\u2019t nina just keep him there? Well, how?!\t", "[ Cheers and applause ] Alright. So, I have some good news and, of course, some bad news. First, the bad news. Unfortunately, our opening act, caterwaul, got stuck in customs.\t[ Patrons groan ]I know, I know. But the good news is, our headliner, the retrobates, will be out in just a few\u2026minutes. Um, excuse me, sir. You can\u2019t be up here. Well, if you need an opening act, I\u2019m the man. How are ya? Poor charles! How\u2019s everyone feeling tonight?\t[ Applause ] Yeah! Port charles! How are we all feeling tonight?! Come on! Make some noise!\t[ Cheers and applause ]\tOkay. Everyone having a good time? Let\u2019s get this party started! Ned! Come down from there! Oh, I don\u2019t know that song, but here\u2019s one you might recognize.\t[ Guitar strums ] Ned!\t[ Patrons gasp ] Ned! Ned! You\u2019re okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I\u2019m okay.\t[ All murmuring ] I\u2019m alright. I\u2019m alright. Nina. Thank you so much. If you hadn\u2019t called me, we would have never found him. I-I\u2019m just glad I could help. Well, thank god he\u2019s not halfway on his way to vegas by now. Ned\u2019s gonna be fine. He\u2019s sitting with michael. He\u2019s gonna be okay, I think. Just needs some water. Look. I\u2019m good, right? The crowd\u2019s all warmed up. I need to get back out there. No, no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey. Look. The crowd can wait. And so can you. Sonny, he won\u2019t listen to me. He thinks he\u2019s someone else. He thinks I\u2019m a complete stranger! It\u2019s that bad? Yes. He doesn\u2019t remember anyone. He didn\u2019t remember brook lynn or tracy. He denied leo to his face. I mean, my \u2014 my little boy was devastated. I\u2019m sorry. What do you want me to do? He doesn\u2019t trust me. He doesn\u2019t trust anyone in his family. Because you want him to be somebody he doesn\u2019t remember being. I was talking to him. He didn\u2019t seem all that \u2014 wait, wait, wait. Y-y-you didn\u2019t mention that you knew him before? Not yet. Is that right\u2026?\t[ Clears throat ] Sorry. I just came to grab ace\u2019s binky. Did you give him his bottle? Yes. And you turned on the noise machine? Maybe he needs to be swaddled. No, he\u2019s too old for that. I came here to grab a pacifier, not attend a forum on parenting strategies. If I need anything, I will call you, but don\u2019t hold your breath. So sorry about that. What were you saying? No. It\u2019s okay. No, it\u2019s not okay. I don\u2019t like the way that she just spoke to you.\t[ Sighs ] She\u2019s tired. And if someone who didn\u2019t have kids gave me unsolicited parenting advice, I would also be a little upset. Oh, no. Now I\u2019ve got you defending her, as well. I told you. It\u2019s alright. Except for that \u2014 okay. Yeah. Alright. Fine. I just don\u2019t like it. I don\u2019t like this whole\u2026situation. Yeah, neither do I. I don\u2019t, either. But this is how it\u2019s got to be for ace \u2014 for now. Until we can find a way to get rid of esme. Just in case. We just have to find real evidence, evidence that we can trust. And once we do that, esme will be out of our lives forever. What the hell was that about? I hate the fact that corinthos thinks he can use you to get to me. Use me? Like you and holly used me? Or is that different? My goodness. You think so little of me, don\u2019t you? No. It\u2019s because I have so much respect for you. Oh, do you, now? And I hate the fact that sonny uses you to do his bidding. Okay, well, let\u2019s get very clear. For one thing, I don\u2019t do anyone\u2019s bidding. I protect my clients. Like sonny. You know who I work for! For heaven\u2019s sakes! I needed some information, so, yes, I asked you for it. Did sonny corinthos also need that information? Well, that\u2019s attorney/client privilege. How convenient. And accurate. Besides, what do you care? I care probably a whole lot more than you realize. As an agent, as a cop, right, I felt that I had a purpose, like I-I was where I belonged. And now I don\u2019t have that anymore, I \u2014 I\u2019ve been asking myself the question\u2026 you know, what now? I completely understand. Felicia: So do I. In our own way, we all have had to reinvent ourselves. Yeah. Have you talked to valentin about it? I did, but, you know, I don\u2019t want to burden him because he\u2019s leaving with you. Um, I could tell him to stay here with you. No. Don\u2019t do that. Please. You need him. I mean, I know you\u2019re very capable, but a U.S. Government official isn\u2019t supposed to travel to chechnya. Valentin \u2014 he has a lot of contacts there, and\u2026 and he speaks the language. Yeah, I think you really need him. Well, to be honest, I was really surprised when he offered to go with me, and it actually meant a great deal to me, so\u2026 and right now I-I need all the help I can get. Good. That\u2019s settled, then. I\u2019m gonna come with you to chechnya.\tYou know how much I value our friendship. Our\u2026relationship.\t[ Chuckling ] We don\u2019t have a relationship, robert. Last time I checked, we were simply two colleagues who occasionally find ourselves on opposite sides of a courtroom and, even rarer, on opposite sides of a dinner table. It doesn\u2019t have to be like that. Would you be saying that if holly hadn\u2019t left town? You are absolutely right. I can\u2019t wait for that day. Sorry to interrupt again, but ace won\u2019t go down for bed. What is that silly song you sing to him? It\u2019s not a silly song, esme. You just don\u2019t sing it right. Okay, well, why don\u2019t you sing it to him and I will listen so I can try and learn it better? Or is it too much asking you to sing to your baby brother? You know what?

That is what I do. It\u2019s who I am, laura! And if I\u2019m not an agent for the wsb, who am I? You don\u2019t need the wsb to give you purpose.

And did you confirm or deny it?\tAshley: Mm.\tTucker: You confirmed it?\tAshley: I did not, of course. And victor didn\u2019t believe me. He thought I did purchase your debt so that I could punish you.\tTucker: And victoria?\tAshley: She believes that my motives are more benign, I think. But regardless, they\u2019re very anxious to get their hands on your company.\tTucker: That\u2019s not news.\tAshley: What is news is that they\u2019re willing to pay top dollar. Far, far more than it\u2019s worth. What do you think?\tIt\u2019s the most wonderful\ttime of the year.\tAshley: Selling to the newmans would put you back in control financially.\tTucker: Mm.\tAshley: You can start all over again, right? You wouldn\u2019t have a care in the world.\tTucker: No, not a care.\tAshley: Mnh-mnh.\tTucker: I could travel. I could, uh\u2026 I could have endless excitement. Fast cars. Fast women. When cold symptoms keep you up, You wanted to find out if i would abandon my plan to sell to devon and go for the big bucks instead, didn\u2019t you?\tAshley: Well, you, originally, were planning to sell to the newmans.\tTucker: Yes, I know, and if I did, I\u2019d have more money than god, but then I\u2019d be alone. Okay? So if I\u2019m going to make this deal, I choose whichever door leads to you.\tTucker: Being with you is worth more.\tDevon: I just \u2014 let me be clear about what you\u2019re saying here, \u2019cause I want to make sure I understand. Before, you would say that, by me removing hamilton-winters from this partnership, I\u2019d be devaluing both companies, but, in reality, you\u2019re just worried about me devaluing your accomplishments.\tLily: Why can\u2019t both things be true?\tDevon: Oh, they can be, but, I mean, if we\u2019re just trying to protect our businesses here, why am I the only bad guy?\tLily: Because you signed a contract. You agreed to the merger. So it\u2019s one company. So I\u2019m doing what needs to be done. And you know what? We are both going to lose money, we\u2019re both going to lose time, we\u2019re probably going to lose our dignity, but you know who\u2019s going to walk away with nothing? It\u2019s going to be you.\tDevon: Lily, I didn\u2019t want this fight. I didn\u2019t \u2014 I never wanted to fight with you. I just wanted my business and the company that I created with my father. That\u2019s it.\tLily: Devon, you have got to stop acting like you are the only one who can carry on his legacy.\tDevon: Well, why am I the only one trying to protect the company that he left behind?\tLily: Saving hamilton-winters is not going to bring dad back. And if it did, I would be right there with you, fighting. But it\u2019s not. So you\u2019re wrong. And if it takes a judge to prove that to you, then so be it.\tDevon: So this is you just saying you don\u2019t give a damn?\tLily: Actually, no, it\u2019s the opposite. My dad was more than a name, and he was definitely more than a company. He transcends that. So, you know what? Start a new company. Or take the money that we offered you and retire. I don\u2019t care. But if you go down this path, I guarantee you will regret it.\tDevon: I never thought I\u2019d say this in a million years, but I\u2019m almost glad neil isn\u2019t here to see who you\u2019ve turned into.\tLily: [ Scoffs ]\tElena: Um\u2026 nate and victoria have been friends for a long time. I think he\u2019s always admired her business acumen, and she hired him after he left chancellor-winters, so I think it\u2019s only natural that he\u2019d be grateful.\tAudra: Mm. Definitely a lot of gratitude going on.\tElena: Yeah, I think that he should be appreciative. Just like you seem to be since nate hired you after you were let go.\tAudra: Yeah, but I\u2019m hardly a neophyte in the business world. But, nate, now, I have to hand it to him. The way he\u2019s been able to close that hierarchy gap between him and victoria, they are so in sync it\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s like they were destined to be partners. Business partners, of course.\tElena: I\u2019m glad he has such a supportive boss.\tAudra: Yeah. It\u2019s a shame he didn\u2019t have that at chancellor when he was working with family.\tElena: I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s appropriate to discuss.\tAudra: You\u2019re right. Family dynamics can be tricky. Relatives don\u2019t always have the strongest bonds. But, you know, it\u2019s funny. When you have the right person by your side, just everything falls into place regardless of what their relationship is to you. Nate must be that person for victoria. The real deal.\t", "[ Knock on door ]\tAudra: Victoria. Good. I was hoping you\u2019d still be here. I hope I\u2019m not interrupting your meeting, but I have news about mccall.\tVictoria: What have you heard?\tAudra: Well, it appears he\u2019s changed course and wants to sell the company to his son.\tVictoria: Well, that confirms exactly what my father and i suspected. Ashley bought up tucker\u2019s debt.\tNate: Why? Is this a power move by jabot?\tVictoria: Sounds like more of a move by ashley alone. She probably wanted the debt acquisition so she could strong-arm tucker into turning things around with devon. Seems that she wants tucker to redeem himself, which is surprisingly noble, in a lopsided kind of way.\tAudra: If she\u2019s expecting him to change, I mean, she\u2019ll be deeply disappointed.\tNate: We\u2019re apparently gonna be disappointed, too, since this means we\u2019re losing out on acquiring mccall.\tVictoria: Makes things more difficult, but it\u2019s not impossible. Besides, I like a challenge.\tNate: What\u2019s your plan?\tAudra: We have to convince devon that buying mccall would be disastrous and that it would be a financial black hole from which he would never be able to extricate himself. And who better to relay that bad news than his cousin nate?\tAbby: Okay, I couldn\u2019t possibly have heard you right.\tDevon: Oh, you did, though. Lily has hired amanda to represent them in court.\tAbby: I thought amanda left chancellor.\tDevon: She did. She did, but she\u2019s the perfect weapon to aim at hamilton-winters \u2014 and to aim at me \u2019cause, you know, that\u2019s really what this is about. Let\u2019s not pretend like it isn\u2019T.\tAbby: Okay, I get that this feels like a personal shot, but why would lily do that?\tDevon: Because she wants to win. That\u2019s why. And she will obviously do whatever it takes. And she thinks it\u2019s gonna rattle me in court. I\u2019m just wondering what she and amanda have up their sleeves. You know? They\u2019ll probably have a damn hologram of neil and fill the courtroom with everybody else I\u2019ve wronged in my life.\tAbby: That would be a very short list.\tDevon: I\u2026 I\u2019m dreading this entire thing now.\tAbby: Tell me something. Are you worried that you\u2019re gonna lose the lawsuit? Or is this about having to come face-to-face with amanda again?\tLily: I am beyond mortified to have an argument like that in public.\tDaniel: The public will recover. How are you doing?\tLily: Not good. It\u2019s like every time devon and i are around each other, all we do is try to hurt each other. And I don\u2019t know how much more i can take.\tDaniel: Yeah, well, famil seems to have a way of pushing buttons like no other person can.\tLily: It\u2019s just, this merger was supposed to bring us closer together as a family, and it\u2019s torn us apart. Nate is gone. Devon wants nothing to do with me.\tDaniel: So, what are you gonna do?\tLily: [ Scoffs ] I don\u2019t know. I just \u2014 I have to stop believing that i can salvage things. It\u2019s like I have to fight to save chancellor-winters because it\u2019s all I have left. So I have to fight with everything that I have. Your heart is the beat of life.\tDaniel: Seems a little extreme. You\u2019re more than chancellor-winters. You have a lot of people in your life that love you.\tLily: Not really. I mean, my parents are gone. My relationship with billy is over. I don\u2019t know if devon and nate and I will ever fix anything. My kids are living their own life. Like, what\u2019s left but my career?\tDaniel: What about your friends? What about me?\tLily: Yeah, I mean, you\u2019ve been the better part of the past couple of months. If only you could make this lawsuit go away.\tDaniel: I wish I had that power.\tLily: I know things are gonna get really ugly.\tDaniel: I don\u2019t doubt that for a second. Are you sure it\u2019s worth the agony?\tDevon: It\u2019s not like I have a choice about facing amanda again, you know?\tAbby: Well, I have never really thought about this before, but I feel like I\u2019m the lucky one in the fallout of all of our breakups.\tDevon: What makes you say that?\tAbby: Because I have to see chance. I have to communicate with him because of dominic. And all of that awkwardness, everything that was difficult between us when amanda and chance walked in on us together \u2014 well, it\u2019s gotten a lot less. But you \u2014 you haven\u2019t seen amanda since she broke things off. I mean, you haven\u2019t crossed paths.\tDevon: Oh, I know. Believe me. And then now the next time I see her is gonna be in a courtroom. And it\u2019s gonna hurt.\tAbby: I\u2019m sorry. This stress is the last thing you need on top of everything else that you\u2019re going through.\tDevon: That\u2019s what lily\u2019s banking on. She wants this to be a painful process financially, professionally, and personally.\tAbby: Are you sure that this lawsuit is worth the destruction that it will cause? I think you should reconsider tucker\u2019s offer.\tAshley: Hey. I hope you\u2019re calling with good news.\tTucker: As in, I can\u2019t get you off my mind?\tAshley: As in, you got devon to sign on the dotted line.\tTucker: Uh, not quite.\tAshley: Tucker.\tTucker: Not yet, I mean to say. I\u2019m on a fact-finding mission.\tAshley: Okay, but you have to proceed honestly. No interfering, no manipulations of any kind.\tTucker: Fear not. I\u2019m simply collecting information on a person I might do a deal with. That\u2019s just good business practice. I want to make sure that when devon contemplates buying mccall that he believes it\u2019ll be the solution to all his problems.\tAshley: Okay. Call me when you get it done.\tNate: You want me to sabotage devon\u2019s purchase of mccall unlimited?\tVictoria: Yes, that is the mission. I assume that you\u2019re going to accept it.\tNate: I\u2019m not on good terms with either one of my cousins. I doubt I could even convince them that the sky is blue these days.\tVictoria: I\u2019m sure that you can find a way to put a stop to devon reconciling with tucker.\tNate: Still, that wouldn\u2019t feel right. My willingness to help you acquire a controlling interest in chancellor-winters via the company\u2019s ipo is what started all this tension in my family in the first place.\tVictoria: But you didn\u2019t cause the current conflict between devon and lily. It\u2019s not your fault that they can\u2019t decide whether or not to proceed with the ipo.\tNate: Still, I hate that they are fighting. And maybe this offer from tucker can help end this feud.\tVictoria: You want to bring peace to the winters, which will only happen if devon agrees to give up his claim in neil\u2019s company in favor of running tucker\u2019S.\tNate: Honestly, on a personal level, I\u2019d like to see that happen.\tVictoria: But professionally, it\u2019s not in our best interests.\tNate: [ Sighs ]\tAudra: Looks like you don\u2019t have much of a choice.\t", "Elena: And what do you mean by that?\tAudra: Well, nate may only be in charge of one division now, but it\u2019s pretty clear victoria has much bigger plans for him.\tVictoria: Must we discuss the elephant in the room?\tNate: [ Chuckles ] If we\u2019re going to get any work done. Look, I\u2019ll start. I feel a certain attraction to you, but I shouldn\u2019T.\tVictoria: Because of elena. What\u2019s going on between the two of you? Maybe whatever it is will clarify what\u2019s going on between the two of us.\tNate: That\u2019s the problem. Elena and I are in a good place, for the first time in a long while.\tVictoria: And yet?\tNate:I\u2019ve crossed a line.\tVictoria: Twice.\tNate: Yes. [ Clears throat ] Multiple times.\tVictoria: So that\u2019s a problem?\tNate: I think there have been some mixed messages.\tVictoria: Yes, it seems like the wires are definitely crossed. But not for me. I know what I want. However, I\u2019m unencumbered, and I\u2019m free to get involved with whoever I want. But, unfortunately, it\u2019s not the same for you.\tNate: I apologize for this.\tVictoria: Don\u2019t apologize. Just figure out what you want because whatever happens or doesn\u2019t happen is entirely up to you. (Vo) the shape that stole your heart\tNate: Look, I can\u2019t deny feeling an intense connection. As if the job weren\u2019t exciting enough, knowing I get to see you during the day\u2026\tVictoria: Yeah, it\u2019s a pleasant bonus for me, too.\tNate: But I ultimately lost my career as a surgeon because of an impulse I acted on.\tVictoria: So your concern is about your job?\tNate: My concern is about all the above. Business. Personal. The man I need to be.\tVictoria: A man who\u2019s faithful to his girlfriend. So who am I to you?\tNate: You\u2019re\u2026irresistible. Intoxicating. And you make me feel powerful.\tVictoria: But you\u2019re with elena.\tNate: And I can\u2019t hurt her the way she and I hurt devon.\tVictoria: Well, that\u2019s very admirable.\tNate: So no matter what I may or may not be feeling, we can\u2019t ever kiss again.\tVictoria: Did we kiss? I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve been so busy. It must have just slipped my mind. Was it good?\tNate: Unforgettable. But I would hate to see what kind of negative impact this could have on our personal lives.\tVictoria: Why would it? We won\u2019t tell anyone. And in the future, I will not kiss you, and you will not kiss me.\tNate: Agreed.\tVictoria: And we\u2019ll be sure to keep a safe distance away from each other and avoid eye contact at all times.\tNate: Contact of any kind.\tVictoria: You know, there\u2019s one other thing to consider. You say that what you and elena did caused you to leave your career in the medical field and come here. But maybe here is where you belonged all along. Maybe you need more than she\u2019s able to give you.\tElena: So what do you think victoria has in store for nate?\tAudra: I am not privy to that level of information. In fact, I was just kicked out of meeting with nate because victoria wanted to have a word in private.\tElena: About what?\tAudra: Uh, data, numbers.\tElena: But wouldn\u2019t you be included in that discussion since you are the coo?\tAudra: Yeah, I thought that was rude, too. But when victoria wants to meet with nate, I make myself scarce.\tElena: Hm. And, um, does has happen often?\tAudra: Look, all I know is that victoria must see something truly magnificent in him to give him so much one-on-one attention.\tElena: I suppose.\tAudra: He\u2019ll be moving up in the newman organization any day now. You should be so proud of your boyfriend.\tTucker: You expected to see my wheels turning as i formulated my grand plan to sell mccall to newman for millions more than it\u2019s worth, didn\u2019t you?\tAshley: I thought it was a strong possibility.\tTucker: I\u2019ve never been happier to disappoint you.\tAshley: Won\u2019t be the first time. I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be the last.\tTucker: Ashley, the only thing I\u2019m interested in at this point is to have a fresh start with the two people who matter the most to me in life, you and devon. That\u2019s it.\tAshley: Okay, tell me this. What happens if you can\u2019t convince devon to buy your company? And I\u2019m not convinced that you actually want to be a better man. What if we both turn our backs on you? What then?\tTucker: I would still forge ahead with my mission of self-improvement. Here\u2019s the thing. No matter who purchases mccall, the sale will provide me with the means of a fresh start. Uh\u2026 the way lived my life up until now, yes, has made me rich, but I\u2019m completely devoid of the things that matter, and a major loss has forced my hand, finally.\tAshley: So to be a better person, you need to be abandoned completely?\tTucker: Is that what you\u2019re planning to do? If I can\u2019t win devon over, are you just going to turn your back on me?\tDevon: It doesn\u2019t feel good, does it?\tLily: Sorry, the comment of dad being ashamed of me?\tDevon: Yeah. Same thing you said to me last time we got an argument about this.\tLily: No, I actually wish he were here to see what I\u2019ve become, because I know that he would be incredibly proud of me.\tDevon: Are you sure about that?\tLily: Absolutely. It is so easy to be a copy of him, but I am out of his shadow. I\u2019m forging my own path.\tDevon: Okay, so, what, is that a dig at me?\tLily: You can take it however you want, but you thought that you could make demands, and I would just roll over? Well, I am sorry, but, no. This lawsuit is going to define everything. It\u2019s going to change our companies, the way the business world sees us, our relationship moving forward. But in the end, you will see that I won.\tDevon: Right, you won by any means necessary, too, right?\tLily: Well, it\u2019s not personal. It\u2019s business. Remember? You kept telling me that.\tDevon: Yeah, you\u2019re ridiculous. You\u2019re unbelievable, actually.\t"], "answer": [0, 2, 4, 1, 3]}

No, there was a lot of harm and a lot of foul. But, you know, it\u2019s just like a clean break, josslyn. Well, I just wonder why he didn\u2019t tell me that when I was alone with him in his office. Why would he? He knows how you feel about nina. You\u2019re right. I haven\u2019t made that a secret. The secret here is why you went to see sonny in the first place. I told you.

Well, after all the craziness with linc, I was craving a little more stability, you know, less drama. But you really enjoyed being a manager, and you were damn good at it. I realized I-I want to write music, not manage artists. And working back at deception allows me the freedom to do that. Well, you\u2019ve got romance. You\u2019ve got freedom.

Tracy got you and chase back together, and now she wants you to feel like you owe her something, huh? Mnh-mnh! It\u2019s not always quid pro quo. There are such things as altruism and self-sacrifice. Mm. Mother, are you feeling well? Oh, trust me, ned. She\u2019s feeling just fine. Now, let me ask, tracy. How exactly does doing right by your granddaughter\u2019s heart become a sacrifice? What \u2014 what exactly did you give up? Or, by some chance, did you stand to gain something? Olivia, of course I am grateful for my grandmother helping me and chase get back together. Oh, sweetheart, you are more than welcome. But like my dad said, in this house, kindness usually comes at a price. Whatever the price was, I hope you can afford it. Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m back at work. Wait. What work? Oh, I didn\u2019t tell you? I\u2019m back at deception. What about your music? Well, you know I can\u2019t sing anymore. Yes, but I thought you were putting a list of artists together to manage. Things were going well, right? Why give that up? Diane: You know what, nina? Maybe I should just wait in the lobby until sonny gets back. W-wait, wait. Diane. Um\u2026 you know, now that sonny and I are engaged, I was hoping that\u2026 his friends can be my friends. You might just have to settle for \u201ccordial.\u201d Okay, well, in the spirit of cordiality, maybe we can get past our differences and try to get along. Our differences? You mean like the time I shredded you on the stand and got a judge to deny you visitation to see your grandson? Well, you were doing your job. It wasn\u2019t personal. No. No, it wasn\u2019T.

As one woman speaking to another\u2026 I\u2019m gonna be charging sonny for this conversation. This isn\u2019t legal advice. This is just a get-to-know-you thing. Mm. Now I\u2019m charging him double. Oh. [ Laughs ] I love my job at crimson, right? But it wasn\u2019t until I was in nixon falls that I realized that the magazine shouldn\u2019t be my whole life. Have you considered a puppy? I have a family, a small one. I have a daughter and two grandchildren who are in my thoughts. Is there someone in yours, diane? Is there anyone special in your life? If not, why? Sonny stopped by to talk to donna, and she insisted her daddy make her pancakes. Oh. Well, did he tell you that I stopped by his office? He did. He did not tell me why. Well, that\u2019s because it was a private matter between josslyn and me. Oh, well, I asked him for a favor, and he said no, so\u2026 well, I told you to tell your friend to come to me. But you know what? We don\u2019t need to rehash this. This \u2014 I got to go. So can you do me a favor? Tell michael and willow that I\u2019m praying for them. I will. I thought that there was a schedule for visitations. There is, but some things need to be said face-to-face. Like what? Like sonny and nina are engaged. Are you coming home?\tI\u2019m gonna do my best. Hey, tj, look, is there anything I can do to make things easier for willow? Looks like you\u2019re already doing it.

Well, it might be helpful for c-closure. Yeah, I\u2019m not sure I really believe in closure. Felicia only means that facing what you\u2019re really feeling can sometimes set you free.

And if so, I\u2019d like to keep my distance. Corbin. Gladys corbin. She\u2019s also involved with deception. So it would seem. For a minute there, you almost had me. I almost believed you.

You know that. But I didn\u2019t come here just for her. Carly, you \u2014 you already explained y-you were trying to protect willow. You didn\u2019t think that she would want to know that nina was her mother. But it wasn\u2019t my secret to keep. And I regret that. And I told michael and willow how sorry I am. Well, that\u2019s good. It\u2019s so important to make amends. But there\u2019s another apology that I owe, and that\u2019s to you. And \u2014 and I should have said it sooner. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so sorry that I went behind your back and that I lied to you because the last thing I want is for you not to trust me. Thank you. I mean, if the circumstances were different and willow\u2019s life wasn\u2019t on the line, I-I don\u2019t know if I would regret keeping the truth from nina. I mean, I\u2019m still processing all the pain that she caused my family, especially michael and willow. I never thought that you were obligated to tell nina. You know, that was always willow\u2019s call to make. And I see that now. And I\u2019m so grateful that willow has forgiven me. I\u2019m just wondering, hoping\u2026 can you?\tAnd michael may still want to take me down, but she \u2014 she did ask me if I would reconcile with \u2014 with michael. What? Yeah. You didn\u2019t tell me that. Well, I did\u2013 there was a lot going on in a couple of days, you know, so \u2014 but I think the situation has motivated her to encourage amends.\t[ Chuckles ] How about that? If willow feels that michael and sonny can let go of their past and reconnect, then there\u2019s hope that she would do the same with you. Yeah. Do you think? Maybe things are falling into perspective for her. Yeah, especially if I can give her the bone marrow that she needs. I just \u2014 I want to show willow that I will do anything for her. Of course you will.\t[ Cellphone rings ] Just give me one second. It\u2019s the lab. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s the lab. Alright. Nina reeves. Thank you for getting back to me. Chase and I are in a better place these days. That\u2019s good to know. Even if it\u2019s not what I asked. How do you feel? Only you would be in a hospital bed asking how someone else is doing. Chase is a hard man to forget. Impossible. What do I do? Should I hold out hope or just try to move on? So much of my life these days is about holding out for hope. Keeping the faith. Believing that the impossible is possible. My situation is different. Chase and I, our relationship is not life or death. Feels that way, though, doesn\u2019t it? If you can\u2019t picture your life without chase, don\u2019t give up. Miracles happen every day. I know things are tense between us, and I don\u2019t like being at odds with you, michael. Yeah, ned, none of that matters now. Agreed. What\u2019s important is seeing you and willow through this, which is why I\u2019m here. Because no matter what happens in business, we are, first, foremost, and forever family. Why don\u2019t you join mac and me? I really should be hitting the hay. It was a long night. Yeah. So what have you been doing these days? Keeping busy, huh? This and that. Anything to keep my mind off of\u2026you know. Maxie organized tomorrow\u2019s memorial for britt. Will we see you there? I know my assets aren\u2019t very liquid at the moment, but \u2014 but if you stake me again, I will break this losing streak. You\u2019ve exhausted your line of credit. You owe the house $175,000. 175 grand? A-are you sure? Very sure. I\u2019ve got an mba in finance. Really? When can I expect payment? I hold our love in the same esteem you held my dignity. Everything in order? Seems so. What\u2019s the catch? There\u2019s no catch. I just want to do right by you. No counter? Nothing you want from me? Just one thing. Of course. And what is that? I need you to listen. You\u2019re forgetting\u2026 I owe you nothing. You owe me. I grant you that. But since you seem to prefer to go through my uncle victor as an intermediary these days, this might be the one last time I get to speak to you directly. Well, unless you can tell me that you didn\u2019t sleep with esme and elizabeth, there really isn\u2019t much to talk about. Things aren\u2019t exactly as they seem. Spencer, I-I don\u2019t think you\u2019re really equipped for this. Financially, maybe, but emotionally? Raising a child takes an insane amount of responsibility, more than we can imagine. Yeah, my uncle sonny said something similar, but how am I supposed to become a more responsible person without first taking on more responsibility? You\u2019d be learning at the expense of the baby. Trina, that is literally how all first-time parents learn. Have you thought about what this will do to your social life? You\u2019re still young, spencer. Being an insta-father will affect your friendships and put a definite crimp in your future relationship. Are you saying that people won\u2019t want to be my friend or be my girlfriend if I\u2019m raising a baby? I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s one way or the other. Some might. Well, what about you?

Why do you care what happens to cody? Please don\u2019t ruin the moment. I\u2019m unwinding from the day. What do you want? I\u2019m here because of what you want. The divorce settlement agreement.

I just came to check on wiley. Ah, well, you, um \u2014 you just missed him. He went up to the main house with olivia for a sleepover with leo. Oh, that\u2019s great. Yeah.

Sonny was kind enough to invite me over, but it was willow who told me. What did she say about me? It\u2019s okay. You don\u2019t have to spare my feelings. Willow is reeling, same as you.

Well, let\u2019s hope that you\u2019re a match. I don\u2019t even want to think about what will happen\u2026 if I\u2019m not. Dad, just promise me one thing. Hmm. Be nice. I\u2019m always nice. Be nicer.\t[ Sighs ] You gave me what I asked for? Spoon island and everything on it? Including wyndemere and all the contents in it. You left me with nothing, ava. Not even my pride.

I can\u2019t believe there was a time I didn\u2019t see it. You saw me, ava. And you loved me regardless. Just like I saw you. We beat the odds again and again.

I\u2019m not worried about esme. She\u2019s not fit to parent a child. She doesn\u2019t even know who she is. Yeah, but she might remember.And that would be even worse. Let\u2019s not pretend that either of this baby\u2019s parents are moral, upstanding citizens. They\u2019re far from it.\t", "[ Scoffs ] Some might say the same of you. My father has a proven history of selfishness, immorality, and neglect. Diane miller thinks that I may have a chance. Sounds like you already got your mind made up. I want to do whatever it takes to protect this baby. You\u2019re looking at them again. I know you, mac scorpio. You care about cody. He\u2019s dominique\u2019s son. She\u2019d want me to look after him, whether he was mine or not. You can\u2019t kid a kidder. Oh, mac, you\u2019re such a good man. There\u2019s always room in your heart for more. And I\u2019m not just talking about robin and the girls. But all those rookies that you took under your wing on the force, giving them guidance and counsel. I know how much dante appreciates your mentorship. Cody might, too. Cody\u2019s made it clear that he\u2019s not interested in that. I just want to make sure that he doesn\u2019t get mixed up with the wrong people. And selina wu is definitely the wrong people. I know you weren\u2019t a fan of britt. Dr. Westbourne and i came to an understanding. My nephew\u2019s quite devastated by her loss, as I\u2019d imagine are you. I have sympathy for those grieving. Yeah, bet you\u2019re all choked up. People express emotions many different ways, much like you\u2019re doing now. If you\u2019ll excuse me. Ah. If it isn\u2019t my old friend gladys. So, did wiley ask about his mom? Yeah, there \u2014 there were some questions. You know, it was kind of tricky, to be honest. I didn\u2019t want to say more than willow and michael wanted me to share. He\u2019s a smart kid. Did the best I could. Yeah. I\u2019m sure you did great. It\u2019s a fine line, you know? I-it\u2019s tough to know what to tell him at this age. Hmm. It\u2019s a delicate balance, for sure. Yeah. Ultimately, honesty is the way to go. I really thought I was protecting willow. Truly. And look, I know that nina and sonny are determined to believe that this was all about revenge on nina. I don\u2019t think that, carly. I know you came to my defense earlier with sonny. But other than that, you\u2019ve been really quiet on the subject.

For the first time, ava and i are actually in agreement that neither my father or esme are fit to parent this child. Oh, that\u2019S\u2026really something. Are you surprised because we agree or because you don\u2019t agree, that is? I mean, it\u2019s not really my place to weigh in. But it is because I\u2019m asking you because I\u2019m curious about what your thoughts are, and your opinion matters to me, trina. Okay.

Well, you thought right, and I appreciate it. Hearing you lost someone is hard. Living with it is even harder. I know I should have come to see you immediately after the game, but I had to run to the restroom to, um, collect myself. Tough night, huh? Win some, lose some. Seems you\u2019re losing more and more. And it\u2019s time to cover your debt. I feel like the rug keeps getting pulled out from underneath me. First I had to let go of the idea of you as my daughter. Thank god now you\u2019re my friend. Then I found out that nelle was my daughter after she died. And willow, she\u2019s my child. And it might be too late to have a relationship with her. Don\u2019t say that it\u2019s too late. She hates me.\t[ Glass clinks ] Willow is alive, and so are you. It is not too late. Show up for her the way that you showed up for me. Be there and show her the nina that I came to love. And no matter how long or short the time that we have together, it\u2019s precious. And it\u2019s so, so worth it. I want that with all of my heart. But willow has made it very, very clear that she doesn\u2019T. Both she and michael seem hell-bent on punishing me. And sonny.\t[ Monitor beeping ] I hope you like them. Ned: We won\u2019t stay long. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve had lots of visitors. Everyone has been incredibly kind.

But he started talking about how we should declare a truce. How we should band together his brothers to protect Damara. Sounds like a bunch of crap. A hundred percent, but I agreed to it.\tWhy? Because he needs to believe that we\u2019re on good terms. It\u2019s gonna make it easier to oust him in the long run. Okay, but you better sleep with one eye open. I know what I\u2019m doing.

And I remembered all the months that you spent watching me make a fool of myself over Chloe.\tAnd you kept your mouth shut. I was breaking Gabby\u2019s heart. And you knew why, but you didn\u2019t give a damn. So you tried to make me look incompetent in front of way shin last night.

Ego zander, Alex, being related to you, had nothing to do with what happened. We met and had a few too many, and then I asked him to come home with me. That\u2019s it. Classic. Oh, you wanna talk to me about morality? Really you, you do know that Alex is just using you right?\tTo what end? Well, he was in the mood and you were there. You know he is shagged half the girls in town. Since he came back to Salem, you was just another notch on his bed quote. Really? What should I do then? Should I go have a little cry?

Butting romance with Gwen, my B fff.\tDo you remember saying that The Spectator is my father\u2019s newspaper and so that I should run it? Sure. I do. I still have half an interest.

I only did that because you patronizingly assumed that I was weeping over you all night. Do you know what Quinn? This is getting of snow miss. So let\u2019s just, right. Yeah. Finally there\u2019s something we finally agree on Zander. I\u2019m gonna work for more motel room.\tThe last thing I\u2019ve ever want to do is breathe down your neck. You know, maybe next time we see each other we can try to be civilized. Oh, you really civilized. Oh, . That would be a very refreshing change, wouldn\u2019t it?\tWill. I guess I\u2019ll, uh, try and catch up with Wendy. Word of advice. Let her call you. Seemed like she had something very important to talk to Chip about, but she told you that I picked up on it.

Why are you giving Johnny such a hard time? I don\u2019t trust that kid. He\u2019s a bad influence on Jing one. Oh, that\u2019s right. He influenced her to go to Jakarta and then figure out what you and Ralf were doing to Stephan. It\u2019s not just that he\u2019s pursuing Wendy while he is still involved with his ex-wife.\tHe and Chanel are just friendly exes and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Yeah, I still don\u2019t trust the guy. You have the nerve to judge somebody on their trustworthiness. I have a duty to look out for my sister. Wendy can look out for herself. Oh wait. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s not how you do things. So why don\u2019t you just call your buddy up, Rolf, have him brainwash Wendy.\tOut of caring about Johnny. Gabby. Wait, see what now? What? I have something.\tSomething you are going to absolutely love.\tYou know, I really gotta think of something nice to do for John about him.

He\u2019s got a lot of Brady in him. The honesty, strong sense of what\u2019s right, what\u2019s not\tYou do remember Samantha Brady is his mother. Nah, skip the generation. It happens. So what now? Ej? Hmm? You drugged me. I drugged you. Or even. Ostensibly, I don\u2019t think either of us wants to jeopardize Damara. I agree.\tSo I suppose I\u2019m going to have to accept the fact that you and Gabriela are intent on finding your way back to one another, which may result in my having to share the running of my father\u2019s empire with the two of you.

It was too much for her, wasn\u2019t it? It\u2013well, what happened?\tNo. Some agent from the sec hauled carly into the pcpd for colluding with drew on insider trading.\tNo, martin. I haven\u2019t changed my mind.\t[Dramatic music] Just the opposite. I want you to go all out and expose drew and carly for engaging in insider trading.\tJust make sure\u2026 to keep my name out of it.

I think the best plan is to head to the \u201chaunted star.\u201d\tYeah, but we don\u2019t know how many guards victor has on that ship or scouring the rest of the island. But we have to assume that victor knows that valentin didn\u2019t come by himself.\tOkay, curtis, I can go with you, help you get everybody off that boat.\tI think a two-pronged approach is probably best.\tOkay. Okay, so you want me to get victor\u2019s attention, get to him, keep his attention off the \u201chaunted star\u201d?\tExactly. Do you have any idea how to gain entry into the bunker?\t[Sighs] I mean, I\u2019m open to suggestions.\tI know how.\tWe give victor exactly what he\u2019s looking for: Valentin\u2019s accomplice.\t[Dramatic music]\tThere we go.

You gain entry by delivering me to victor.\tLaura, you\u2013you\u2019re here to rescue your grandsons. I can\u2019t put you at victor\u2019s mercy, especially when you and I both know he doesn\u2019t have any.\tYou\u2019re right. He doesn\u2019t have any, and I won\u2019t have any peace until I see that my grandsons are safe, and you\u2019re not getting past those guards without me.\tLaura, you and I have been friends a long time. We\u2019ve trusted each other with our lives.\tYeah.\tTrusting me with your life is one thing. Having faith that I can rescue your grandkids is something else completely different. I\u2019m promising you I will not leave the \u201chaunted star\u201d without them. I\u2019d rather die before I let anything happen to trina or your boys.\tI believe that.

He denied having anything to do with it. But if it wasn\u2019t ned, then who would have went to the sec?\t[Dramatic music]\tNina, we\u2019re talking about the sec, not wyndham\u2019S. They don\u2019t have a return policy for tips on criminal behavior.\tThat\u2019s what I figured. I just thought I would ask.\tNow that you have, it\u2019s my turn. What\u2019s with the second thoughts?\tThere are just some things that I hadn\u2019t fully considered with regard to potential fallout.\tWell, that might be, but I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s\u2013this is done deal.\tYou know, this could be a lot of hand-wringing for nothing. There\u2019s no guarantee that the sec is gonna act on your anonymous tip that you left anytime soon, or act on it at all.\tActually, I think you\u2019ll find the government has exceeded our expectations.\tWhat do you mean?\tGot a call from a friend of mine about carly spencer. She was there tonight at the police department being interviewed by the sec.\t[Tense music]\tPikeman was alarmed and dismayed to hear about the attempt on your life, and we want to assure you we would never be party.\tI know pikeman wasn\u2019t behind the shooter. I confirmed your lack of involvement.\tShooter was untraceable-\tno id, no fingerprints in any database.\tSo a professional.\tOf a specific kind. He\u2019s had military training, probably special ops.\tYeah, and that\u2019s-\tand that\u2019s not the kind of personnel that I deal with, which leads me to believe that I was just a means to an end.

Please, tell me that.\t[Dramatic music]\tHow dare you threaten willow. She\u2019s my family, my great-niece. She needs my help.\tOh, I\u2019m not threatening anyone. I\u2019m just stating facts. The longer it takes you to prove the efficacy of the antidote, the less time your niece has to undergo a life-saving procedure.\tDo I have your word you\u2019ll release me if I complete the project?\tThere\u2019s only one way to find out: Do your job.\tMr. Cassadine. Ambrose says somebody claiming to be your son is here on the island.\tWhat? Let me speak to him.\tMr. Cassadine wants to talk to the intruder.\tHello, dad.\tBring him here, now!\tI got a little news flash for you there, scorpio. After ashford left, what I did or didn\u2019t do-\tthat\u2019s really none of your business.\tOkay. Whether you believe it or not, scott, we are all working towards the exact same outcome. So you need to tell us if you relayed any information that you overheard here to the wsb.\tYou know what? I don\u2019t think we\u2019re all working for the same outcome-\twe are.\tAh, right. Just to be on the level with you, I haven\u2019t said anything to anybody. Yet!\tYou do understand people\u2019s lives are at stake?\tOh, for\u2013why would you say that to me? Liesl\u2019s being held by a madman who\u2019s trying to burn down the world.\tHey, look, we\u2019re all working hard to-\tworking at what?\tYou have information you could pass on to wsb that might be able to take out victor, and now you got the commissioner working with you and everything else. None of this is really making any sense to me. And okay, liesl\u2019s done some pretty horrible things in her day, but I will not let her be collateral damage for you two!\tCan you just listen to us?\tJust save it, will you? Because, you know what? If you don\u2019t tell the wsb, I sure as hell will.\t[Dramatic music]\tYou\u2019re saying that carly was officially questioned? I mean, I\u2019m kind of shocked here, martin. I had no idea that the sec act so quickly.\tActually, so am I. Turns out the government\u2019s flat-footed and backlogged in everything but insider trading. That and alimony payments. Yeah, just try to miss a couple of those suckers. See what\u2019s happen. Some are gonna end up in your business. Then again, it probably has more to do with my small herd of ex-wives than it does with the government.\tBut with carly, drew, and the sec, martin, what is next?\tWell, doubtless, carly will face some kind of investigation, as will drew.\t[Tense music]\tI\u2019m sorry, nina. At this point, it\u2019s in the attorneys\u2019 hands. You know? Now, if there\u2019s nothing else, I really would like to go see my sister.\tThank you, martin\u2013I think.\tYeah. Listen. I understand that you\u2019re worried, but there\u2019s no point in second-guessing anything. You didn\u2019t incite or entice drew or carly to do anything. If there was insider trading, they made that decision themselves. All you did was report it. Good night.\tHey.\tCarly.\tOh, my gosh.\tWe were so worried about you.\tOh, are you kidding? I am so sorry that the whole situation with the sec overshadowed your wedding.\tOh, no. Please. The wedding was over. I\u2019m just glad the police didn\u2019t hold you longer and that drew is safe.\tYeah. Sonny showed up, and he\u2013he told the sec that drew was on a plane to maui. So that did buy us some valuable time. Look, I\u2019m no fan of sonny\u2019s, but I am grateful that he showed up when he did.\tAs far as I\u2019m concerned, that\u2019s proof that we\u2019re still important to him.\tSeems to me, someone had a vested interest in preventing the shipment. So I gotta wonder if that has to do with what\u2019s in the cargo.\tThat was a third party trying to stop us. I don\u2019t see what the contents of the shipment-\t", "why it\u2019s relevant.\tSomebody tried to take my life. You don\u2019t think that\u2019s relevant? Now, I had the assumption that you were shipping weapons. Now\u2026 I\u2019m beginning to think\u2026 that you\u2019re moving something bigger than guns.\tWe were under the impression you wanted to minimize your involvement-\tprovide storage and facilitate shipping only.\tWell, your impression\u2019s wrong!\tAll right.\t[Dramatic music]\t[Crate snaps]\tWhat the-\tthis is one of the world\u2019s most powerful plastic explosives.\tHow powerful?\tOne brick can take out an entire city block.\tSonny\u2026 look. This stuff is in high demand. It\u2019s very hard to get. People like it because it\u2019s malleable and waterproof and a little goes a long, long way. The U.S. Military keeps this ordnance under tight control, real tight.\t[Tense music]\tIf this is the cargo you\u2019re sending through my docks, I\u2019m surprised more people didn\u2019t take shots at us.\tWhat can I say? Great rewards come with high risks.\tExcept, see, this is something you\u2019re not understanding. I feel like I\u2019m taking all the risk.\t[Dramatic music]\tOkay, putting aside my situation with sonny, I do know that he is worried about both of you.\tI think that the most important thing right now, obviously, is to bring liesl home safe and sound so that she can be a bone marrow donor for willow, and drew is the one who\u2019s making that happen, okay? Not my dad.\tSonny decoyed the sec to give drew time to go after liesl. Does that not count for something?\t[Dramatic music]\tLook, with regard to the contents of these crates, I can assure you that information is tightly controlled. Leaks are very rare, and, when they occur, those folks are dealt with swiftly. Are we going forward or not?\t[Tense music]\tPikeman can use my docks this time, but not again-\tnot until we renegotiate the deal. Now, by \u201crenegotiate the deal,\u201d you know what that means? I want information on who was behind the ambush.\tUnderstood. Close it up.\tThank you for taking care of the drew situation.\tMy pleasure.\tNow, can you take care of the rest of this? \u2018Cause I-\tnina\u2019s waiting for me. She\u2019s\u2013you know, obrecht\u2019s missing and she\u2019s nervous.\tNo problem. You know I got you.\tI appreciate you. Um, okay. So my associate will take charge of the shipment from here. Dex, can you come here for a second?\tYou just need to make sure that the cash exchange goes smoothly.\t[Dramatic music]\tGive me that walkie. Once you\u2019ve brought me my son, go check on our guests we left aboard the \u201chaunted star.\u201d\tAhh, what an intriguing turn of events. But, of course, you\u2019re the man who thinks of everything. I\u2019m sure you anticipated your son showing up.\tConduct a thorough search. There\u2019s no way my son came here alone.\t[Dramatic music]\tMove it.\tMove.\tThere\u2019s only one way to find out if it\u2019s safe for us to move.\tWe can\u2019t have you rushing off to the wsb with what you just heard.\tRight.\t[Scoffs] I don\u2019t need your permission.\tYes, but you have to understand, we have our reasons.\tOh, well, then I\u2019m all ears.\tOkay, well, first of all, we don\u2019t have incontrovertible proof, right?\tOkay, well, then I think I\u2019ll give the wsb a little call-\tif you make that call, the first thing-\t[Dramatic music]\tHere you go. It\u2019s all in there.\tMm. We\u2019re going to count this just to be sure.\t[Tense music]\tThe last thing pikeman would do is cheat mr. Corinthos. We\u2019re hoping this will be the beginning of a very profitable relationship.\tThat\u2019ll be up to mr. Corinthos.\tDeals this profitable aren\u2019t easy to come by. Mr. Corinthos will find his affiliation with pikeman will be life-changing.\tYes, I can see that sonny is making an effort, but that does not mean that he shouldn\u2019t be held accountable for his actions in the past that-\tcan we just focus on the future, please, or just try to?\tYeah. [Stammers] Tell us what happened at the police station.\tWell, I know the government has frozen aurora\u2019s accounts and assets.\tDamn it, ned. Though, I shouldn\u2019t be surprised that his games have, you know, impacted the family business. But what I can never forgive is how he hurt you and drew in the process.\tOkay. Do you really believe ned woulhe\u2019s always been so kind.\tNed is a quartermaine. He pus elq ahead of everything else. And I get that it\u2019s hard for you to see that because you always see the best in everybody.\tWell\u2026not always.\tHey. How you doing, kevin?\t", "[Walkie-talkie static buzzing]\t[Dramatic music]\tAnna, what are you doing?\tWhat? I\u2019m taking care of business.

I believe that I have a score to settle with victor.\tAh, you\u2019re one stubborn woman.\tI\u2019d say brave. But I do have to ask, anna, are you sure you\u2019re up to this?\tI have to see it through.\tIs this because of valentin? Is this\u2013is this guy really worth the risk?\tYou have to stop talking.

Not just because we have an unconscious man in my room.\tLook-\tI\u2019m with anna. If the wsb gets wind of what we\u2019re doing, you can buy us some time, and you can keep us posted on what\u2019s happening here at port charles.\tLook, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t have faith in the both of you. I do. Trust me. But this is probably the most dangerous mission you\u2019ve ever embarked on.\t[Stammers]\tDon\u2019t forget,\tI\u2013what?\tMy darling, anna and I were both married to you.\tYeah, but that\u2019s-\tand we survived that.\tThat\u2019s a terrible-\tbarely.\t[Laughs]\t[Pensive music]\tYou can get back to work.\tWhat\u2019s the point? Valentin found you. It\u2019s only a matter of time before others do too.\tAll the more reason to expedite your work.\tTime is not the only impediment here. The stabilizers, the surfactants, and the adjuvants are all sufficient. But there\u2019s no 2-phenoxyethanol here.\tAll right. All right. In layman\u2019s terms, what is going on?\tIn order for me to make this work, I need preservatives. Single-dose vials. Otherwise, the antidote is too easily\u2026contaminated.\tWell, that\u2019s precisely why i have you here, liesl. I know you can get past these problems.\tEven if I could solve this preservative problem, this endeavor of yours is zwecklos. Futile. Doomed.\tI seem to recall you saying this could be a crowning scientific achievement.\tScientifically speaking, I still do. But we can\u2019t make this happen if we\u2019re caught. I mean, it\u2019s time to retreat and regroup.\tIf I stop the process now, who knows how long that\u2019s gonna set me back.\tYou\u2019ve made a valiant effort, victor. And your brilliant plan just can\u2019t come to fruition under these circumstances.\t[Tense music]\tI suppose you\u2019re right. Just have to reevaluate part of my plan.\tGood. Thank you for listening to me.\tI have not been bested, not by my son or any doubt. I still hold all the cards, including you, liesl.\tThere\u2019s a possible location on your aunt liesl.\tW-w-where is she? Where did victor take her?\tI can\u2019t\u2013I can\u2019t say, \u2019cause I don\u2019t know. But what I do know is, drew went out to find her.\tDrew went searching for my aunt liesl?\tYeah, that\u2019s why he was missing from the wedding. So he went out to find your aunt. He\u2019s gonna bring her home and save willow\u2019s life. Don\u2019t worry about it. I threw the sec off the scent. I got brick to arrange for drew\u2019s name to appear in a manifest for a flight going from san diego to maui. They won\u2019t know he\u2019s not there until he doesn\u2019t get off the plane.\tBut\u2013but sonny, that was just a temporary dodge, right? I mean, eventually the sec will find out that that was a false lead and go back on drew\u2019s trail. What happens if the sec catches drew before he can bring aunt liesl home?\t[Dramatic music] What does that mean for willow?\tThis is all my fault. I mean, drew did everything he could to discourage me from investing in aurora, but I wouldn\u2019t listen. I mean, you did too. But I was so determined to support you both, and now look. It all came back to bite me. I lost my hotel. There\u2019s an sec investigation. Aurora\u2019s assets have been frozen. It-\tjust\u2013just forget about that.

So while everything\u2019s coming up, roses for you. My life is over.\tYeah. Well, okay. Thanks Jada. Keep me posted. Okay. Sounds like there\u2019s no news. Yeah, she says. They have no new lease. I mean, I don\u2019t get it. How does the mayor of a town just vanish? Beats me? What about that, that Colin Bedford guy, the one that put Abe in the hospital? I mean, he\u2019s in custody, right? No, he was just bl.\tWhen he said he had information about where Abe is, he\u2019d say anything to cut a deal with the cops. Yeah. Are they sure? Sloan Peterson is his lawyer and his sister and she says he doesn\u2019t know anything. Uh, you know, I wouldn\u2019t leave anything out of the two of them, his mouth, so. Well that is a good point, but Bedford\u2019s in a whole lot of trouble.\tIf he did have Abe stashed away, I do believe he\u2019d say so. I just, I, I think it\u2019s ridiculous. Okay. There\u2019s no way that Abe could have gotten out of that hospital on his own. So someone must have helped him. Someone must have seen him. That\u2019s what I keep telling myself. Yes. Yes. Julie, I\u2019m back in my hospital bed now.\tNo, no, no, honey, you don\u2019t need to come. No, I\u2019m fine. Well, I\u2019m, I will be once they find out who really took Abe and where he is. Oh,\tuh, I, I\u2019ll come back after your call. No, no, no, don\u2019t go. I need to talk to you.\tLike sand through the hourglass, so are days of our lives.\tWell, you know what, I, I can\u2019t sit around here twiddling my thumbs any longer. What are you gonna do? Well, I\u2019m gonna go talk to John and Steve and, uh, offer my help. Well, I don\u2019t see them turning you down. Me neither. See you later. Oh, no, no. Please be careful. Bring him home. Will do. Hey Michaels. Hello, Kate Roman, we heard you were back in town soap.\tAre you coming by for early lunch or no? No, I just, uh, wanted to see if you heard anything from Megan Hathaway. No, I haven\u2019t heard of Peep since she came by the other day. Fuck you, me. Well, Steve says that, uh, that\u2019s reading your bet. Yeah, I thought I would, you know, I thought I\u2019d keep an eye on her. Felt like it\u2019s the least I could do, but I\u2019m assuming that you would prefer it if I just stayed away in mind of my own business.\tReally? Do I have to remind you that it is not long before you turn 40? You mean for the umpteenth time? And the codicil to the will says that you, that if I am not married by the time I turn 40, I will not inherit a scent. Yes, mother. I know it has been emblazoned in my brain. Thanks to you not to mention that I read it all right here.\tWhere did you get that in your room? Where else, and you felt to mention a few pertinent details? Which details? Well, for one, that I need to remain married for at least a year. That\u2019s not all. Let me see. Where\u2019s my absolute favorite part? Uh, yes. Here it is. Now, if it is found that Mr. Von Leischner has entered into this marital contract under false pretenses, then he loses every penny, which means that not only do I have to marry this rice chick woman, but I have to remain married to her for at least a year, and I have to act as though I am besotted with her.\t", "Rizek and turn on the charm. Must I? Yes. Now. Okay. Okay. Look, the sooner you propose to her, the sooner we get all that lovely money. This is why I adore you, mother. You never sacrifice your own dignity upstairs. Okay, now. So what are your plans for all that lovely money?\tDon\u2019t you worry about your husband, all right. He\u2019s gonna be just fine. You can\u2019t possibly know that you\u2019re right. I can\u2019t, but I\u2019m a woman of faith and my faith has gotten me through so, And I know that you are a woman of faith too. I usually am, but then, oh, Frank, is there news about A, I\u2019m sorry, what? Well, then why are you here?\tI\u2019m here because I was told that Ms. King was here. I need to speak with her.\tWell, I must be, must be the guy who, who attacked me. I hope. Hope he\u2019s gone. I hope he\u2019s gone. But if not, I, I have to defend myself. Well,\toh,\tI guess I have to wait. Let\u2019s wait till Paulina comes home.\tCharlamagne,\twhat do you think you\u2019re doing here? Cassandra? You and I are gonna have it out once and for all.\tYeah. Dashing handsome strangers. Well, they only turn up in romance novels, don\u2019t they? I think we might be setting our sights too High pointer. No, no, no, no, no. I don\u2019t want you thinking that way. I believe, and it might just be the three cups of coffee I just had. That\u2019s making me feel frenetic and wound up in a good way.\tThat true love is just around the corner for both of us. Oh, so it\u2019s just the caffeine then talking, is it? No. No. Well, I mean, maybe the caffeine is helping me to feel optimistic, but it doesn\u2019t negate the fact that I am envisioning great romantic futures for both of us. Us. Oh, besides, we have a backup plan.\tIf neither of us find a man, we just marry each other. Resorting to Eves dropping. Now are we. Did you have a glass pressed in a wall? Oh no. Your voice carries. See, I heard it all the way out from the garden. Oh, into horticulture. Now, are you, I do have something of a green thumb, but guess what we\u2019re talking about?\tYou, Megan, and I already know about your plant to take over the world and, uh, how are you going to use the vonner money? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s time I learned what you\u2019re going to do with it?\tUh, okay. Um, let\u2019s define, get rid of, do I convince Megan to leave town or do we take it a step further? Okay. Well, first of all, I don\u2019t need you to play games with me. You\u2019re not going to make me feel guilty. Megan tried to kill me and then she sicked her brainwashed henchman on me. No offense. No none taken.\tAnd if though hadn\u2019t had a last minute change of heart, I would be dead right now. Okay. So I think you can imagine how I feel about Megan coming back into Salem with her demented wealth and putting down roots. I mean, obviously you think she\u2019s up to something or you wouldn\u2019t be keeping your eye on her, would you?\tDo you think that, uh, she\u2019s gonna try to kill you again? I don\u2019t wanna wait and see. I just wanna have her neutralized first. Okay. Why don\u2019t you just tell me exactly what it is that you want? Oh, I think you know what I want, and it\u2019s not just about my life. She had plans for Marlena and Kayla. Should you consult with them about your plan?\tThat would be a waste of time. Neither of them has the killer instinct. I\u2019m the only one ruthless enough to take care of this situation. Ah, yeah. Have you going mad? I want justice and I do it myself, so be it.\tAh, what are you raving about now? I know you read the ballot box. Charlamagne Delacroix. You are not gonna get away with stealing the election from me. Well, I don\u2019t know what you mean. Oh really? You can\u2019t stand. Rhett loves me and not you, and you\u2019re gonna do anything in your power to make sure that you are voted Woman of the year.\t", "There was that one night in Vegas with Chris Hemsworth, though. He spent the night with Chris Hemsworth. All right. It was an impersonator, but still he had no trouble raising his hammer, but even he was gone right after the breakfast buffet.\tHonestly, I do feel like there was something between Sonny and me, but then Will came back like he always does, and they made up like they always do. What was I thinking? Sonny is a married man. There was never any hope, but that\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about. Every guy I ever go for is either married straight or using me for my American citizenship.\tI hate to say it, but maybe Diana was right.\tIt was an honor taking care of a man like your husband for, as I said, I was just doing my job. Well, I think being a nurse is more than just a job. It\u2019s a calling. Oh, it was a joy taking care of the mayor, and I\u2019m just so sorry that all those terrible things happened to him and that awful attacker, who possibly is the one who kidnapped him?\tYes, yes. Colin, Colin Bedford. He\u2019s a sick, dangerous man, but turns out. He wasn\u2019t responsible for Abe\u2019s disappearance. How do the police know they do? That\u2019s all that matters. Oh, are there any, um, other suspects? No,\tI have no idea where my husband is. How he is, I don\u2019t know. I never even see him again.\tDear, dear.\tHello. Is anyone there?\tOkay, well I was just leaving to go help John and Steve look for Yeah, sure. Good luck with that. You will call me if you get any information. Will do. Yeah. Bye.\tHow about at lunch now? Uh, no thanks. I\u2019m, I\u2019m good. You know, now that I\u2019ve come back to Salem, I just gotta really, um, figure out my life. What\u2019s that mean? Yeah, well I\u2019m, I\u2019m staying at my parents\u2019 old place. Don\u2019t know how long I can stay there, so, you know, if I wanna get my own place or rent a place, I\u2019m just gonna have to figure out a job.\tWell, I might be able to help you with that one. Yeah. How so? I would happily pay you to get rid of Megan Hathaway.\tAre you listening to what I\u2019m saying? Yes, mother. I am. I am. I\u2019m just. I\u2019ll admit, I am not relishing the prospect of having to share my inheritance with a platoon of Damaris. There you go. You see, finding this corso was the best thing that\u2019s happened to us in a long time. Oh, see now there you go again with that US word.\tAnd yet, I\u2019m the one who is being forced to marry a woman that I just met. Now you listen to me. I have sacrificed plenty for you over the years. Just think opportunity to,\thow long have you and I been friends? Oh, let\u2019s see. We met in 2006, so if you take 23 and then you subtract the six. Oh, of course I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not asking you to do the math. You big knob. I was just pointing out that I know you really well. Yeah, and so I know everything your mother said about you is simply not true.\tEasy for you to say she\u2019s not your mother. Oh, come on mate. If we\u2019re playing bad mother poker here, we both have a winning hand in this.\tMy mother convinced me that my father didn\u2019t care if I lived or died. That\u2019s why I turned out like this. I drugged. My sister went after her husband. Thanks to dear old mom, I was convinced that if I were to get anyone to love me, I would have to trick them.\tSo you know what? Everything that our mothers have said about us, it is absolute rubbish. I love you so much, Gwynnie, and not a single trick made me feel that way. Just your genuine adorableness. I catch you Mady.\tDoesn\u2019t really help us in the romance department though, does it? No. What you and I need is for two handsome, well-heeled strangers with great asses to show up one day and sweep us off our feet. That doesn\u2019t happen very often though, does it now? Exactly. Should I repay you? Go upstairs, get dressed, have lunch with Ms.\t", "You don\u2019t have to act besotted, just turn on the charm. Romance a bit. Would that be the worst thing in the world? I just got out of prison. I am ensconced in this mansion. I thought maybe I could have a little bit of fun. That might prove difficult if I\u2019m playing the part of the devoted husband.\tOkay. Tell me, my darling, why do you think that your life is over? I went to see my mother in Statesville. Why on Earth would you do that? I honestly don\u2019t know. But you loathe her with good reason. I mean, what possessed you to go over there and see her? I mentioned her to that lady cop when she was grilling me.\tJada Hunter. Jada Hunter told you to go and see your mother? No. It just made me realize that I hadn\u2019t visited mommy dearest once since they put her in the slammer. And so you just thought you\u2019d take care of that today? Then did you get it over with mainly, gosh, I can see by your mood that it went swimmingly.\tDid you two have a row? Please. I learned a long time ago not to contradict Diana when she\u2019s ranting. Today\u2019s rant was entitled, why Leo Stark is a worthless human being that nobody could ever possibly love.\tI\u2019m gonna have to call you back, Julie. Um, oh, yes. Okay, bye. Oh, um, thank you for waiting. Yes. Um, what can I do for you? Um, My name is Paulina Price, but of course, I\u2019m sure you already know that. Yes, it\u2019s, it\u2019s, it\u2019s here on your chart. I know who you are. You do? Mm-hmm. My husband suffered a head injury a few days ago, and they brought him here, and while I was waiting to hear how he was, I saw you taking care of him, and I just want to say thank you.\tFor what? For everything that you did for Abraham. Oh, I\u2019m just a nurse. That\u2019s what we do. Oh yeah. I know that is not easy. Most people give credit to the doctors for saving people\u2019s lives, but it\u2019s you nurses that take care of people around the clock. I don\u2019t know what me and Abraham would\u2019ve done without you.\tMs. King,\tyou there? I know that voice. I really need to talk to you. It\u2019s important.\tMs. King is the police.\tI\u2019m gonna go now and I\u2019m gonna lock the door behind me. I want you to listen to me very carefully. I don\u2019t wanna frighten you, but that. Man that attacked you is still out there and he, he\u2019s been impersonating a cop, so it\u2019s very important not to open the door, especially if the cops show up. Okay.\tWell, you, uh, you probably hate me. Well, I wouldn\u2019t go that far. Look, Harris, I may have hated what went down with you and hope and my brother, but I\u2019m in your debt. You stuck your neck out. For my wife, you saved Katie from Megan and that son of hers and for that, for that I will always owe you.\tPerhaps Ms. Rizek isn\u2019t the woman of your dreams. But isn\u2019t inheriting a vast fortune worth being married for one tiny little year to a wife you don\u2019t love? And what exactly do I need this vast fortune for? We seem to be doing pretty well around here, Dimitri. This might look like a mansion, but it\u2019s actually a pool for sharks.\tYou and I have no choice but to share the demure fortune. With Tony, ej, Stephan, Kristen, Chad, and any other illegitimate child that shows up at the door\tand every single one of those sharks wants that fortune for themselves, but none of them can touch the von Leischner fortune. That my darling is all ours. Ours. That is right, my dear Ours. This was part of the plan when I married your father. You\u2019ll be sharing that money with your mother.\tCome on, Mattie. How many times have you told me that your mum is a conniving bitch? Honestly, why should you believe a single word that she says? Maybe because it\u2019s true. Stop that. I mean it. Nobody has ever loved me. Excuse me. What about me? You\u2019re my friend. I\u2019m talking about lovers. None of them have ever stuck around.\tWell, there was Darius. Yeah. Who was gone the minute he got his green card? And Craig, I was only in that one for the money. Well, yes, maybe at first. But then you developed feelings for him, didn\u2019t you? And look how that turned out.\t", "Woman of the year, that\u2019s what they\u2019re fighting about. Accuse me of whatever you want. You have no proof and I\u2019m going to be Woman of the year, whether you like it or not.\tYou wanna talk to me? Uh, you\u2019re a policeman, right? Commissioner? Commissioner Hernandez. And, uh, just came from your apartment. There was no one there. So I came here. I also left you a message yesterday and never called me back. Oh, I, I, I\u2019m sorry. I had my phone turned off. I\u2019m a little behind in my payments.\tI see. Okay. Well, um, it, what can I do for you, uh, commissioner? Well, it seems as though you may have been the last person to see Mayor Carver before he disappeared.\tOkay, lemme get this straight. You have the killer instinct, but you want me to do the killing? Well, it\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t done it before. If you\u2019re talking about the jobs I did for Megan, I wasn\u2019t right up here. I was brainwashed. Okay. Okay, but you still have it in you, right? You\u2019re a Navy seal, you have advanced combat training.\tYeah. Megan is evil, but she\u2019s not exactly an arm combatant. She isn\u2019t exactly a frail flower now, is she? She tried to ruin your life. She almost cost you your freedom, right? Yeah, pretty much. Okay. So we both know what she\u2019s capable of and we both know sooner or later she\u2019s going to be back at it and that could be a problem.\tMm-hmm. But your problem is money, and I have loads of it.\tWhy pay me or anybody else. Your husband was a cop. I\u2019m sure he would love the chance to get even with Megan. Okay. I love my husband dearly, but my take on morality is situational. His is absolute. He stopped to John and Steve from killing Orpheus, who\u2019s a monster. There is no chance I could convince him to kill a woman like Megan, even though she may be evil incarnate, which means I\u2019m left with you.\tI have done some far out stuff, but never plan to take over the world. So Megan, spell it. How are you gonna do it? Well, do I pass inspection? Oh, you clean up so well. Only a bespoke suit would do all the work for me. Now, how am I going to convince this reporter who is interviewing me that I barely know that I\u2019m mad about her and that she should marry me?\tYou\u2019re really gonna do that, is he? I am sure you have. Many ways to charm women. Yes, but my aim has never been marriage. What have I just told her? Why I needed to marry her? Have you forgotten about the clause that specifies you must be sincere in your intentions. What little clause is that? Do shut up.\tAnd it may not even be difficult. Apparently Ms. Rizek is desperate for a new man in her life, and I heard something to the effect that Xander Cook used and abused her. You see, she\u2019s primed and ready\tand now so are you. What\u2019s this? Well, it\u2019s everything you need to know about the fair mis wrist check. When did you have the time to put this together? I needed some background on my future daughter-in-law, didn\u2019t I? Especially if I was going to expediate the process. Oh, mother, when did you become such an incurable, romantic?\tI hope you know, I will be expecting a gigantic six Kara Diamond engagement ring from you. Oh, you think I\u2019m kidding? Of course I do. I\u2019m not. I seriously think you and I should consider tying the knot, then we can have a huge wedding invite everyone we know, invite everyone. We don\u2019t know. Why on earth would we do that?\tThe bridal registry gwenie with our taste. We\u2019d make a killing. Yes, except for nobody likes us enough to pay a single penny on gifts. Ugh, killjoy.\t"], "answer": [0, 3, 2, 1, 4]}

They\u2019ll probably talk to you. Why don\u2019t you\u2013 why don\u2019t you go find chance. He\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s happening.\tDaniel: Maybe. Yeah, um, why don\u2019t you come with me to the station?\tSummer: So you can keep an eye on me? Daniel, please. I don\u2019t need constant supervision.\tDaniel: Okay, fine.\tSummer: Good.\tDaniel: Listen, I will back off. That doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m not still worrying about you. And I will be around whenever. Okay? Hey. I love you.\tSummer: I love you too.\tDiane: Let\u2019s just look at this from a different angle. What if jeremy had an accomplice? Someone who kept his secrets and did his bidding.\tMichael: Just like you did when you were laundering money for him in L.A.?\t[ Diane sighing ] It\u2019s all gonna come out in trial. You better get used to people pokin\u2019 into your past and using your sins for their own private entertainment. But I digress, go ahead.\tDiane: Phyllis and jeremy conspired together before to get me to leave town. What if he was just using her to gain access to jack\u2019s house? I mean, phyllis walked in and out of there as she pleased. She visited summer and harrison.\tMichael: All right, talk me through it. Convince me.\tDiane: Michael, I found her in our home, alone, right before the gala. She could\u2019ve planted the letter then, and gained access to my credit cards.\tMichael: Go on.\tDiane: Look, phyllis could\u2019ve been part of jeremy\u2019s plan. And if this letter is in her handwriting, which I\u2019m assuming it is, then doesn\u2019t that prove that she was in on it?\tMichael: Hm. Why would she involve herself in a setup that requires her own death?\tDiane: Well, I\u2013 I\u2013 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know, but she was just so set on revenge that she would do anything to make me suffer?\tMichael: Look, I can\u2019t see her framing you for murder.\tDiane: Michael, if you\u2019re not willing to look at phyllis as the bad guy, then I have already lost this case.\tMichael: Look, I know you\u2019re searching for answers, but you won\u2019t win any points in court, or with your attorney, who\u2019s still grieving the loss.\tDiane: What if phyllis\u2019s death was an accident? What if they were just setting me up for an attempted murder, and then I\u2013 I\u2013 I don\u2019t know, the ambulance exploded before jeremy could give her the antidote. Or what if jeremy turned on phyllis at the last minute and gave her a lethal dose of poison?\tMichael: It\u2019s farfetched.\tDiane: Maybe. But what if phyllis\u2019s murder was a revenge plot gone horribly wrong? For bathroom odors that linger.\tVictor: Of course, you\u2019ll run mccall. It\u2019s yours to run. If you think you can make something out of it.\t[ Adam chuckling ]\tAdam: Look, if I agree to do this, I want some guarantees.\tVictor: What are they?\tAdam: Total autonomy. From newman. And from you.\t[ Victor chuckling ]\t[ Victor laughing ] In your dreams, son.\tAdam: Look, make it a reality or this deal is dead.\tVictor: And you come to your senses, son, before making another stupid, rash decision. Think of the legacy you could provide. For your sons, for your daughter, for yourself. For years to come. Or what would happen to you if you walk away from this?\tAdam: It\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s an amazing opportunity.\tVictor: Uh-huh.\tAdam: I\u2019ll let you know.\tNate: You\u2019re inviting me to go away with you to L.A.?\tVictoria: I\u2019m asking you if you\u2019d like to join me on a business trip.\tNate: Do you think that\u2019s wise?\tVictoria: Just a few minutes ago, you were telling my co-ceo that you are willing to go wherever I say, and now you\u2019re questioning me.\tNate: That is not what I meant.\tVictoria: If your hesitation stems from the other night\u2013\tNate: It does.\tVictoria: Well, that\u2019s not a problem then. I mean, you said that the incident was a mistake, and you don\u2019t strike me as the type of man who would make the same mistake twice.\tNate: I like to think that\u2019s correct.\tVictoria: And also, you\u2019re an adult. You\u2019re capable of vast amount of self-control.\tNate: True.\tVictoria: All right, so what\u2019s the problem? I\u2019m about to purchase some companies that might change the scope of your division. I\u2019d think you\u2019d be interested in that.\tNate: I am very interested in the business, yes.\tVictoria: Good. Then you\u2019ll join me.\tNate: L.A. It is.\tKyle: What does stark\u2019s death mean for mom? Is she any closer to getting released? It\u2019s not like she could\u2019ve had anything to do with whatever happened to stark.\tJack: That\u2019s what I tried to tell chance. They still don\u2019t have all the facts.\tKyle: Does mom know? Does michael know?\tDiane: I need to see jeremy. Can you figure out some way to get him in here?\tMichael: To what purpose?\tDiane: So I can get him to tell me the truth about what happened.\tMichael: He\u2019s on the run.\tDiane: What?\tMichael: The last time he was seen was shortly after the memorial. I mean, maybe when his little grift fell apart, he was afraid he\u2019d go back to jail.\tDiane: So he\u2019s just disappeared? No. No, no, no, no, we need more time.\tMichael: Listen. I\u2019ll do what I can on my end, but keep thinking of details. Anything that will help us clear you.\tDiane: All right, find him. Find jeremy stark, because he is the key to everything.\tMichael: All right, all right, I\u2019ll be in touch. Hey! Kyle, I\u2019m glad you called, I was just talking to\u2013\tKyle: There\u2019s something I need to tell you.\tMichael: Oh, why does this not sound good?\tKyle: Stark is dead.\t[ Summer sighing ]\t[ Summer sighing ]\t[ Footsteps approaching ]\t[ Summer gasping ]\t", "Michael: Christine\u2019s gonna have your family testify against you.\tDiane: I know.\tMichael: I saw you and phyllis fighting. They heard you threaten phyllis\u2019s life.\tDiane: Jack and kyle will understand. They\u2019ll downplay it and explain the extenuating circumstances. They\u2019ll do everything they can to help.\tMichael: And what about summer?\tDiane: Summer will do everything she can to see that I spend the rest of my life behind bars.\tKyle: Give me two minutes. Can you do that? Just talk to me. What\u2019s going to bring us closure?\tSummer: Answers. That\u2019s what I need. That\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s gonna bring me any peace or quiet\u2013\tKyle: I want that too. I want morning espressos at our place in milan and harrison correcting our italian. We were so happy.\tSummer: Are you saying that we should just run off to italy to escape our problems? I\u2013\tKyle: I meant what I said at the door last night, summer. And I know you heard me. I meant every word. No matter what happens, you and I will always belong together. I don\u2019t care how long it takes, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\tSummer: Answers, kyle. That\u2019s what I need, and then we can work on us.\t[ Front door closing ]\tKyle: Dad.\tJack: Hi.\tSummer: What\u2019s wrong, jack?\tJack: It\u2019s stark. He\u2019s dead.\tNikki: Darling, whether you admit it or not, I know you\u2019re still smarting for losing mccall to your father.\tVictoria: Yes, it would\u2019ve been nice to add mccall, but having adam tethered to it made the idea untenable.\tNikki: I totally agree with you. You made the right decision.\tVictoria: Unfortunately, now I have to live with adam lording it over me until his predictable demise.\tNikki: Hm. Well, this acquisition is gonna be big news. Lots of fanfare. Press releases.\tVictoria: Yeah, I know. I\u2019m sure dad\u2019s gonna wanna make a big splash to help adam.\tNikki: Might be a good time to get away.\tVictoria: What do you mean? Like, as in a vacation?\tNikki: Well sure, why not? You know, take a few days for yourself. Just relax a little bit.\tVictoria: Well, I do have that trip to los angeles coming up.\tNikki: No. That is for business.\tVictoria: I know that, mom, but I could add a few days for vacation. I mean, you and I both know that I would probably turn it into back-to-back meetings, but for me that\u2019s fun. And I promise you, I would get a massage and I would see the ocean. I mean, it would probably be from a window, but I would see it.\tNikki: You are only happy when you\u2019re multitasking, just like your father.\tVictoria: Mom, that\u2019s not true.

How\u2019d you find out?\tVictor: Your brother told me.\tAdam: Hm.\tVictor: How nice, man. Makes me very happy.\tAdam: Sally and I, we are\u2013 we are very happy.\tVictor: Mm-hmm.\tAdam: But I also know that you don\u2019t care for her, so I\u2019m not really buying how pleased you are about the situation.\tVictor: Well, I gotta tell you, another newman. She\u2019ll live to be in the next century, be a shaker and a mover, innovate things. Makes me very happy. It really does. Okay? I have some news of my own.\tAdam: All right. Let\u2019s hear it.\tVictor: I bought mccall unlimited. I\u2019m the new owner. And you will start working there tomorrow morning.\t[ Adam exhaling ]\tAdam: You bought mccall?\tVictor: I bought mccall. For you, your sons, your daughter. It\u2019s a legacy that will go on forever.\tAdam: Wow, that, um, that escalated quickly.\tVictor: What do you mean by that?\tAdam: My new baby with sally. It went from potential embarrassment to now being used as leverage to get me to take a job. Makes me wanna avoid mccall altogether.\tMichael: The only thing that will bring summer some semblance of peace is clearing your name, and hopefully in the process, discovering the person responsible for her death.\tDiane: Which seems close to impossible now that I see this evidence.\tMichael: Including, but not limited to, trying to explain the fact that an unconscious phyllis was holding your engagement ring.\tDiane: Oh, no, no, that was in jack\u2019s pocket. And then jeremy bumped into him on the dance floor and he must\u2019ve taken it.\tMichael: You have no proof of that.\tDiane: Well, no, because it was all happening so fast, and there were a lot of people.\tMichael: Okay, okay, we can revisit that. Right now, we have to discuss what might be the most damaging piece of evidence against you, provided by me.\tJack: Yeah, stark\u2019s death definitely adds a whole new layer of mystery to all of this.\tKyle: Summer? Hey, hey, are you all right?\tSummer: I guess I\u2019m just gonna have to live with all of these questions going unanswered. I\u2013 I\u2019ve gotta go.\t", "Kyle: Hey, can you stay for a little while? We can talk about this.\tSummer: I don\u2019t want to talk about jeremy stark.

Do you think victoria has the ability to relax outside the work environment?\tNate: I say she\u2019s the boss. And if she says she has that ability, then I say she does too.\tNikki: Oh boy, it\u2019s disappointing to hear you kiss up to her like that.\tNate: I mean it. I\u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say it if it wasn\u2019t true. Victoria is a great boss. And she wouldn\u2019t be where she is today if she didn\u2019t excel at prioritizing or having impeccable instincts.\tNikki: Fine. There\u2019s no point in talking to you when you\u2019re going to team up against me.\t[ Nate chuckling ] So, if you don\u2019t mind working those extra hours, and clearly you don\u2019t, have at it. I mean, it\u2019s paying off. Newman enterprises is poised for world domination.\tVictoria: Nose to the grindstone.\tNikki: And on that note, I shall leave you. Buzz me if you need me.\tVictoria: Thank you, mom. So, what brings you by?\tNate: I was hoping we can go over some ideas I had for langston, but if you\u2019re busy, I can wait.\tVictoria: Oh, one second. Hey. Would you, um, make sure that all of the contracts are uploaded for the whitsett meeting? Thanks. So, you were saying?\tNate: What\u2019s goin\u2019 on? Whitsett?\tVictoria: Oh, yes. Um, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m headed to L.A. For a shopping spree.\tNate: Ah, rodeo drive?\tVictoria: No, I\u2019m just in the mood for something a little bigger. Streaming platforms.\tNate: Wow, that wounds media-related. Strange I\u2019m just hearing about this now.\tVictoria: Ah, well, better now than after it\u2019s all said and done.

So, you first.\tPhyllis: Michael, um, it\u2019s phyllis. Listen, diane is out of control. I\u2019m terrified. She tricked jack into proposing to her. She\u2019ll get rid of anybody or anything that might stand in her way. I know you probably think I\u2019m being overly dramatic, I\u2019m really serious this time. Please listen to me, that woman just attacked me and threatened to kill me. God help me, michael.\t[ Phyllis panting ] I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this. I\u2019m actually afraid of that crazy bitch.\tDiane: She sounds terrified.\tMichael: Because of you?\tDiane: No. The phyllis that trapped me in her hotel suite was anything but scared. She was accusatory. She was goading me into fighting back.\tMichael: Hm, that sounds on brand for her\u2013\tDiane: Yeah, you saw phyllis the night of the gala. How did she seem to you?\tMichael: Fiery, on the attack. You saw her.\tDiane: Right, right, so why would she leave that message if she was really scared for her life? Why\u2019d\u2013 she would leave you a voicemail? Does that make any sense?\tMichael: She wasn\u2019t thinking clearly.\t[ Diane sighing ]\tDiane: [ Chuckling ] Okay. What else don\u2019t I know about?\t[ Diane scoffing ]\tMichael: When the police searched jack\u2019s home, they found a letter from phyllis among your things.\tDiane: What letter? She never sent me a letter. What?\t[ Scoffing ] Michael, I have never seen this before in my life. W\u2013 where was this found?\tMichael: In your bedroom.\tDiane: Someone planted it there.\tMichael: Mm. So, someone made their way into your very secure home and left that letter there?\tDiane: No, I\u2019m not saying that jeremy could have gotten access to jack\u2019s house. But someone else could have.\tMichael: Who? Who?\t[ Diane sniggering ] Oh, you\u2019re kidding me. You\u2019re accusing phyllis of being an accomplice to her own murder? Moderate to severe eczema\tChance: This was a lot better than I expected.\tSharon: You know, the food here is the same as in the dining room, it\u2019s just smaller portions and tinier plates.\tChance: Well, the food was great, but the company was just outstanding. Thank you, sharon. This has been a, uh, a perfect distraction for me right now. Sorry. Ah, hell. Hey, uh, I gotta run and take care of this. I\u2019m so sorry. Thank you. This has been a very amusing afternoon.\tSharon: The pleasure was all mine.\tChance: Let\u2019s do it again sometime. You know, maybe make it a proper dinner with, uh, with big plates and everything.\tSharon: I would really like that.\tChance: Can I walk you out?\tSharon: Um, you know, actually, I think I\u2019m gonna stay, just for a little while. Finish my drink and have someone wait on me for a change.\t[ Chance chuckling ] But you go. Go get some bad guys.\t", "Victor: Don\u2019t be so cocky. Adam has changed.

Don\u2019t work too hard.\tVictoria: He\u2019s gone overboard. He has. Has he forgotten what adam is capable of? He has no idea how hideously this venture is going to fail.\tNikki: You\u2019re disappointed that you lost mccall, aren\u2019t you?\tVictoria: No\u2013 [ Scoffing ] I walked away.\tNikki: Because you\u2019re afraid that when your competitor is your father, you\u2019ll never win.\tChance: The timing of stark\u2019s death is definitely concerning.\tJack: Oh, I\u2019ll say.\tChance: It doesn\u2019t erase all the evidence that points directly to diane, though.\tJack: Oh, I think it puts a rather big question mark on every aspect of the case against diane. Thank you, detective. I\u2019ll be in touch.\tChance: [ Sighing ] Gee. Hey. I\u2019m, uh, I\u2019m sorry.

I guess you\u2019re right. But you know what, coffee\u2019s not gonna do it for me right now.\tSharon: Hm. Well, you\u2019ve come to the wrong place then.\tChance: No, I just mean I\u2013 I need somethin\u2019 a little bit more substantial. You know, you did agree to let me take you to dinner sometime. And I know it\u2019s, uh, a bit early, but I think now is the perfect time.\tDiane: Michael, I can\u2019t thank you enough for taking my case.\tMichael: Thank me when the murder charges are dropped.\tDiane: And I can\u2019t imagine what this is costing you.\tMichael: I think you\u2019re misunderstanding our business relationship. This is actually costing jack quite a lot.\tDiane: No, not financially. I mean it. At least 90 percent of the people in this town wanna see me fry, and I\u2019m sure that includes lauren.\tMichael: Yeah. Lauren\u2019s not happy, no. But this isn\u2019t a popularity contest. You think phyllis gave a damn about how many people cared about her? What we cannot do is get bogged down on how people feel about us. We deal in facts. And the first thing we do is focus on the problem that\u2019s right here in front of us: Building a strong defense.\tDiane: So, tell me all the evidence they have against me.\tMichael: All right, well, we\u2019ll discuss that later. First, you walk me through exactly what happened the night phyllis died. The bad, the ugly, the potentially embarrassing, all of it. Because if you withhold anything from me, even the slightest detail, you can find yourself another lawyer.\tKyle: You\u2019re not gonna tell me where you\u2019re going?\tSummer: Do I need to check in with you before I go somewhere? I\u2013 I\u2019m running an errand.\tKyle: Wait, let me come with you.\tSummer: That is very unnecessary. Just like it was unnecessary for you to track me down at neil\u2019s jazz lounge and yell at chance.\tKyle: Hey, hold on. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s the healthiest thing in the world for you to be hanging out in the place where your mother died.\tSummer: You know what, kyle? My mom was unpredictable. And yeah, she drove me crazy, but we\u2019re a lot alike. So, if I need to mourn her in this crazy, unpredictable way, then you just need to understand that.\tKyle: Okay, okay. I get it. Just be careful.\tSummer: Besides, this errand, it could bring us all some closure. I used to wait to run my dishwasher\t[ Michael sighing ]\tMichael: There\u2019s a gap in your timeline.\t[ Diane scoffing ]\tDiane: I have to account for every second the night of the gala?\tMichael: You were alone for a period of time between wishing that you could strangle phyllis to death and her collapse in the lounge.\tDiane: So, christine wants to prove that I wasn\u2019t putting myself back together after phyllis attacked me. What does she think? That I ran out and grabbed some poison and somehow slipped it into phyllis\u2019s champagne?\tMichael: Actually, no. The poison wasn\u2019t in phyllis\u2019s drink, it was found inside of her mask.\tDiane: Her mask? I didn\u2019t even know that was possible.\tMichael: I mean, why would you? You\u2019re not a murderer. Were you alone at any time in phyllis\u2019s hotel room?\tDiane: Yes, then. After everyone left.\tMichael: Ah, see, there. There\u2019s your opportunity.\tDiane: To what?\t[ Michael sighing ]\tMichael: The empty vial of poison was found in that suite.\tDiane: Michael, that doesn\u2019t make any sense. How could I run out and get some poison in the amount of time that it took me to brush my hair and put on some lipstick? W\u2013 what\u2019s that?\tMichael: It is an online receipt. According to this, you purchased the toxin online a few days before the gala.\tDiane: What? Absolutely not.\tMichael: You know, using your credit card.\tDiane: Michael, I didn\u2019t do that.\tMichael: A crime of passion is one thing, but christine\u2019s gonna try to say that this was premeditated. That you had a plan.\tDiane: The only thing on my mind before the gala was jack announcing our engagement. I didn\u2019t buy any poison! Online or otherwise. Michael, look at me. I am telling you the truth. I had nothing to do with phyllis\u2019s death. Find jeremy stark. He\u2019s the one behind all of this.\tMichael: All right, all right, I\u2019ll find everybody.

What about the \u2014 the valor, the bravery she displayed in the last two weeks alone. She got out of a hospital bed to take on victor cassadine, stopped him from deploying a pathogen that might have wiped out millions. Martin, just stop. Just stop. You\u2019re wasting your breath. The new head of the wsb can no longer turn a blind eye to the agency\u2019s past. If agent devane chooses to dispute the charges, the bureau might need to take a closer look at robert scorpio or annie donely or any other colleagues who might be stained by her misdeeds. Just hang on a minute. If I\u2019m being asked to do what I think I\u2019m being asked to do, then I need assurance. Well, no \u2014 no, no, no. We\u2019re not in the business of negotiating with double agents. Oh, really? That\u2019s a shame. Because what if my file is incomplete? Suppose there are other missions I undertook \u2014 other black ops that didn\u2019t make it into my dossier, didn\u2019t make it into the wsb official books. Suppose I have evidence of these hypothetical ops hidden in some secure location \u2014 evidence of activities that would seriously embarrass the wsb far more than whatever news is being tallied around. Is that a threat? Oh, no. I think what anna\u2019s saying is \u2014 what I\u2019m saying is if anything happens to robert or annie or anyone else I care about, I am taking the bureau down with me! Okay, so my mom has the chance to avoid these insider trading charges if she gives evidence against sonny. Would she do it? No, of course not. She won\u2019t even consider it. But she doesn\u2019t have to, because I can do it for her. Do you regret taking the dna test? No. Not at all. I just miss my family the way they were. Mm. Well, you\u2019ll find your way back to them. It\u2019ll be different, but the bottom line is that you and your mother have always had a great relationship. You know I\u2019ve always been jealous of it. Yeah. I mean, it could be way worse. At least everyone\u2019s healthy and safe and relatively sane. Spencer. Hm? Where\u2019d you go? I\u2019m sorry.

He said\u2026 he said something about having to safeguard my family, but all he left me was a key to a safety deposit box. Have you opened the box yet? No. No, come on. Not when I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna find in there, considering everything that he did when he was still alive. Safeguard your family. He meant ace, right? I think so. So the next question is\u2026 safeguard your family from whom? Of course I can forgive you, but I understand why you were so confused. I\u2019ve been all over the place. With good reason. I hate that you\u2019ve been in pain and that you went undiagnosed. I should have pushed it with that old ob/gyn. That\u2019s the doctor\u2019s responsibility. I should have listened to your experience, asked for details. That\u2019s the first thing they teach you in med school \u2014 you listen to your patient. You respect them. That didn\u2019t happen for you. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve thought about it. Yes, it was isolating \u2014 scary, even \u2014 to be told that your pain was all in your head. I\u2019m so sorry. Molly, I promise you, I never have and I never will say that to anyone under my care. I know. That\u2019s why I love you so much. I thought I had to deal with this diagnosis on my own, like always. But now that I\u2019ve told you and my mom and my sisters, I know that that\u2019s not true, because I\u2019m not alone. And if I\u2019m not alone, anything is possible. Trina and I are making progress, but it is not easy. I can\u2019t imagine it would be. So I am just trying to take it slow and make it abundantly clear that I am not trying to replace taggert. And I trust that trina and i can one day develop our own special relationship. You will. May I ask you about ho[ Sighs ] I\u2019m not sure, auntie. I am not sure. But you moved back in. I mean, that\u2019s progress, right? It\u2019s possible. Well, what made you move back? A situation arose between jordan and me. Jordan? Yeah. We had been spending some time together. She was helping me through all of this, and, um, it happened. Oh, my goodness. Auntie, I quickly realized that, uh \u2014 that I needed \u2014 that i wanted to give my marriage to portia a chance. So I came back home. I\u2019m glad to hear that. I truly am. How did jordan take it? Honestly, I don\u2019t know how curtis is doing either. We knew that he could be trina\u2019s biological father, but now that it\u2019s been confirmed, now that we know the truth, I just\u2026 at least stella stopped by. So I\u2019m hoping maybe he\u2019ll be able to talk things out with her. Stella is back in town? Yeah. Yeah. She came back to check on trina after everything that happened in greenland. So I\u2019m hoping that when I get home from work, that maybe curtis and stella will have made some progress. Uh, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m a little confused. What do you mean, home? I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not being clear. I\u2019m all over the place. It\u2019s the one good thing that has given me some hope. Curtis decided to move back home.\t", "spencer: Finally. Do you have an y idea how hard I had to work to defend your chaises \u2014 the dirty looks that I\u2019ve gotten, the oh-so-polite questions from the staff about when the rest of my party will be joining me? Well, I-I-I\u2019m sure it was a hideous strain, but thank you for enduring it on our behalf. How can we ever repay you? For you? I\u2019ll think of something. Joss doesn\u2019t owe me anything. She doesn\u2019t? No, I wasn\u2019t saving the chaise for her, but I knew that she would be with you and that you\u2019d want her to have one. Spencer. Don\u2019t worry. I still get a chaise out of it.\t[ Chuckles ] Oh, my god. Are you two gonna do this all day? Possibly. Just like old times. Before the dna test results.\t[ Laughing ] Before the sec charges. Before greenland. Okay, I\u2019m gonna get a towel.\t[ Sighs ] Only one missing is cameron. Can you not make this weird? I won\u2019t make this weird. He might, though. Oh. Hey. Oh.\t[ Chuckles ] There\u2019s a fresh pot of coffee on. And I got some fresh fruit. There\u2019s eggs in the fridge if you want them. It\u2019s not \u2014 I\u2019m not a houseguest. I can make my own breakfast. Yeah. I-I guess I\u2019m just adjusting to you being back home. I really wasn\u2019t sure that you would come back home after learning that, um, trina is your biological daughter. May I ask what made you decide to stay?\t[ Doorbell rings ] Good morning. Mom. Thanks. I needed this. Clearly, you do. Mm. You forgot we were meeting for coffee.\t[ Sighs ] I-I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019S\u2026 it\u2019s been a rough morning. It completely slipped my mind. Molly spent the night at her mom\u2019s house. Did something happen? Mom, I really messed up.\t[ Knock on door ] Hello, laura. Valentin. I believe you have something that belongs to me. Why am I under arrest?\t[ Door closes ] Do you read the sun? I don\u2019t read that rag. You should. The wsb got wind last night that you made the front page. Agent devane, any idea who would have blown your cover? Victor\u2026\tQuite a welcome. Well, I\u2019m excited to see you. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d show up. Well, I can\u2019t say no to you, but I\u2019m not sure your plan\u2019s gonna work. Spencer hates my guts, and I don\u2019t see that changing. Doesn\u2019t he have some crimes to commit? Kneecaps to break? Suckers to punch? Joss invited him. Uh-huh. And when is she gonna realize that he\u2019s a dead-end loser and dump him? Dex is important to her, and we\u2019re all spending time together, unless you want to lose josslyn as your friend. It wouldn\u2019t be the first friend that I\u2019ve lost to dex. Cameron got a soccer scholarship at stanford. Dex\u2019s relationship with josslyn didn\u2019t force him to leave. No, but it certainly made things easier, didn\u2019t it? Look, I know that if push came to shove, josslyn would choose me over dex.\t[ Chuckles ] Oh, yeah. Josslyn is definitely dumping dex to stay friends with you.\t[ Laughs ] Whatever. Look, josslyn may forget about cameron, but I won\u2019T. Spencer. No hard feelings? Stella. Please \u2014 please, come in. I was just heading off to work. Stella: Oh. Is marshall here? I just came by for his gumbo recipe. Oh, he\u2019s out. But I can tell him that you stopped by. Is that why you came by, auntie? To chat about gumbo? Marshall called me last night, and he told me about trina\u2019s paternity. I thought it was time for you and I to clear the air. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to open a vein. Feel free to unload on me anytime. What\u2019s going on with you and molly? Or is it none of my business? You know molly and i have been talking about starting a family? We met with dr. Navarro. We\u2019re having some fertility issues. Oh. Honey, I\u2019m so sorry. Things got really tense between us. I said some things that I-I shouldn\u2019t have. Molly raced out of the apartment and went to her mom\u2019S. I spent the night pacing. I\u2026 I just want her to come home. She will. You and molly have the kind of partnership everyone dreams about. You\u2019ll get through this. I hope you\u2019re right. I feel like, just when she needed me the most, I pushed her away. You sure about that? You missed the reading of your father\u2019s will. Uh, no, I didn\u2019T. Martin grey filled me in on the details. Oh. So you received your inheritance, then? What, the finger? Yeah, that was cute. I laughed myself silly. Too bad the man\u2019s still dead. Yeah. He managed to get his point across even from the grave, didn\u2019t he? Uh, did you see what he left for anna? He said that he left her the truth, which didn\u2019t make any sense, until I got up and read the morning paper. Yeah, I saw that, too. Anna\u2019s been arrested by the wsb. I didn\u2019t know that. A source of mine at the bureau says that victor obviously stole a copy of anna\u2019s personal file before going missing all those years ago, and he made arrangements to have it made public in the event of his untimely death. The paper claimed to have obtained classified documents from the wsb. Yeah. Well, it\u2019s obvious that my father\u2019s not done ruining people\u2019s lives. Luckily, he won\u2019t have any influence on the younger generation of cassadines. Anyway, I digress. You said that he left something else for me, aside from the finger. It\u2019s not for you. This is for charlotte. I don\u2019t need to read any more of that. It\u2019s my life, after all. Your cover is blown. There is nothing in that article the bureau didn\u2019t know about already. Don\u2019t go any further. We\u2019re doing this by the book. What are we doing? Bring him in. What\u2019s happening? What the \u2014 what are you doing here, martin? Valentin called me late last night after he heard you were arrested. You\u2019re gonna have to forgive my appearance. Bureau kept me waiting for hours. So, this arrest is a mistake. Someone overreacted without talking to the higher-ups. On the contrary, agent devane. You\u2019re being accused of a crime against the state. What crime? Treason.\t", "Even though it\u2019s meant for charlotte, I thought it was best to give it to you. The cassadine crest? Yeah. I hate that thing. I can\u2019t say I blame you. I kept mine in a box for a lot of years, waiting until I came forward to claim what I thought was my rightful inheritance before I put it on my finger. My first instinct was to throw that thing into the harbor. I mean, it represents everything I loathe about the cassadines, everything that i don\u2019t want my grandchild to be, but, I mean [Sighs] It belongs to charlotte. And you\u2019re her father, so you get to decide. Well, I don\u2019t know that throwing it in the harbor will make charlotte any less a cassadine. And my father\u2019s gone, and with him, his influence and his expectations. So it\u2019s my hope that charlotte can create a new legacy for her family. You know, maybe I could move things around at work and stay. No. Thank you, portia. But this conversation between curtis and me is long overdue. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s responsible for the tension between the two of you. Maybe I should stay and be a part of this. Do I wish you had been honest from the beginning? We both know the answer to that. But you\u2019re not entirely to blame. Curtis is a man that wants the truth, and there are some hard truths that I need to tell him. So go on. We\u2019ll be fine. Okay.\t[ Door closes ] Okay. So, aunt stella\u2026 thank you. So, now that we know that trina is my daughter, do you want to finally explain why you kept that information to yourself? So very glad you could join us. Um, me, too. Can I get anyone any snacks, any drinks? Orange juice. Thanks. Make that two. You got it. I can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m being forced to spend time with that thug. I\u2019m only gonna say this once more \u2014 let\u2026it\u2026go. Heller is the one who punched me. I did let it go. I shook the man\u2019s hand, didn\u2019t I? Like he was diseased or something. Okay. I spent enough time taking care of my little brother. Don\u2019t you think that I deserve one single morning with my friends? Maybe you should think about your brother. You are the one that took the first swing at dex, right? Yes. So? If you start another fight, it could possibly blow up into something even worse. You think a judge would be happy to know that you got in trouble again? Is that what a responsible guardian would do? Treason? Are you insane? Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Agent hursley, listen. Now I\u2019m finally in the room, would you mind giving us some time alone? I\u2019d like to speak to my client in private. Of course.\t[ Door opens ]\t[ Door closes ] What is going on? The media. And you\u2019re officially a sitting duck. They\u2019re particularly interested in one aspect of that file victor had released, namely your history as a double agent. The bureau knew about this already. Yeah, well, maybe they did, but the public didn\u2019T. And now the sun\u2019s got hold of it, your name \u2014 hell, your entire history \u2014 is about to be splashed across the front page of every newspaper, website, cable news broadcast in the entire country. This is bad, anna. Somebody knew how to poke that bear just right. Public\u2019s gonna want answers. They\u2019re gonna think they want justice. How am I supposed to defend myself against accusations that are true?\tCoffee? Thank you. You\u2019re welcome. Um, you know, I-I was wondering if you might be able to help me with something. Have you by any chance seen the cassadine property in chechnya? On the terek river? Yes, I have. Several years ago. I had to see it for myself. It\u2019s been in the family for 200 years at least. I\u2019m a little surprised that the soviets didn\u2019t confiscate it, and why it isn\u2019t in the possession of the current government. Well, it seems that victor has left it to nikolas. I think this may be where victor took nikolas to recuperate from\u2026 \u2026from when you shot him. That was in self-defense, laura. Let\u2019s not revisit it. Okay. You think that nikolas is at the terek property? I don\u2019t know. It could just be wishful thinking. Well, anything\u2019s possible. But if he is there, given the current political climate, it would be tough for him to leave the country without raising red flags. That\u2019s assuming he wants to leave. Well, I\u2019m sure that he doesn\u2019t, but I have to find him and bring him home. Fine. I will play nice with that, um, dex, but I\u2019m not gonna forgive him for what he did to cameron. We may never know exactly what happened between joss and cam, but everyone could see that it wasn\u2019t working at the end. But now cam has a scholarship at stanford, and joss and dex, they seem really happy together. Dex: Thank you. Doesn\u2019t joss deserve that? Aww, thank you. Josslyn: Here you go. Thank you. I\u2019m sorry about the punch yesterday. I\u2019m sorry I hit you in the face. Yeah. Yeah, you got me pretty good. You don\u2019t seem to have a mark on you, though. Well, I can teach you how to block. Never mind. No, go ahead. Dex: It\u2019s like, when you swung the way you did, right? You shoot this gap here\u2026 josslyn: Oh! \u2026Then if you throw up here, you can block that, too. And then your right\u2026 spencer: Oh, I see. Molly. It\u2019s been a while. I know. It\u2019s been too long. We have to put something on the calendar. I\u2019ll text you with some dates. And, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I, uh, need to check in with the station. Be good. I\u2019ll try. Did you get a good night\u2019s sleep at your mom\u2019s? I tossed and turned all night. What about you? Same. Spending the night apart is not fun. I\u2019m sorry I spent the night away. I-I just needed some time to think. You have nothing to apologize for. I was the one who was totally inconsiderate. My words came out wrong. I don\u2019t blame you. I never would. Can you forgive me? No word from the wsb on anna devane\u2019s arrest? Let me know if you hear anything. Thanks. I hope I\u2019m not interrupting anything. No, not at all. What\u2019s on your mind? I was just wondering if you had spoken with \u2014 with taggert at all recently? No. Why? Because he might need a friend right about now.\t", "[ Sighs ] The dna results came back. And curtis is trina\u2019s father. Yeah. Why didn\u2019t I tell you that I suspected trina might be your daughter? Fair question. One I have been asking myself lately. Were you able to find the answer? I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m just trying to get back to the day of your wedding and why I couldn\u2019t officiate at your wedding. You said something about your conscience. Yeah. I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t in good conscience marry you and portia, knowing that portia hadn\u2019t told you that you might be trina\u2019s father. And I didn\u2019t feel like I could be the one to tell you. I convinced myself of that, that I shouldn\u2019t interfere because\u2026 you and portia just seemed so happy, and I didn\u2019t want to get in the way of that. Okay. So, what changed? Why now? Ultimately, I caused more pain and heartache by keeping silent. And I\u2019m sorry. I hope you can forgive me. Early in my career, you know I was compromised by the dvx, specifically cesar faison.\t[ Sighs ] I thought I could outwit him, but I couldn\u2019T. And so I ended up leaving here for a bit, and, uh\u2026 and then I came back, eventually. And I gave them full disclosure. I told them everything. And I was reinstated. And I have had a clean record ever since. The bureau has trusted me for decades. And none of that\u2019s gonna make any difference to the general public. Anna, that article does a good job painting you as a total judas. Trusted agent, somebody with clearance, access to privileged information \u2014 somebody who turned around and betrayed her own agency. This is all ancient history. The only difference now is the media spotlight, and the fact that frisco has been replaced as director, yeah. And now the bureau wants to distance themselves from my actions. They\u2019re charging me with treason to cover their own asses. Exactly. That is exactly what they\u2019re doing. Which is why valentin was right to call me. It\u2019s time for me to protect you. This isn\u2019t cloak and dagger. It\u2019s public. It\u2019s federal. And that story is not going away.\tDo you want to go to chechnya to look for nikolas? Didn\u2019t we do that for charlotte? No. Charlotte was in a boarding school in switzerland, not exactly a war-torn country, and charlotte wanted to come home. We don\u2019t know what nikolas would want. Yeah, well, I-I\u2019m not that concerned about what my son wants. He is needed here. Oh, he\u2019s certainly wanted by the pcpd. And I\u2019m sure that he\u2019s going to face some very unpleasant consequences for his behavior. He held a pregnant woman in a tower at wyndemere. At least he\u2019ll be back in port charles. He\u2019ll be near his sons. Okay. What about the people in port charles who need you? That\u2019s not a very safe part of the world. What happens if you don\u2019t come home safely? You know, I just can\u2019t think about that. I feel like\u2026 I feel like a part of me is missing. I need to find that part, just to\u2026 just to be whole again. Okay, I understand. And if you\u2019re not gonna worry about your safety, then somebody has to. So if you\u2019re going to go to chechnya, I insist I go with you. You understand \u2014 I know. I know. You said you were gonna do this. Alright, you gotta hear me out. Just hear me out. Alright? Please. We have different rules and procedures here. Listen to me. Listen to me. I\u2019m sure you do, and right now, I really don\u2019t care. I\u2019ve been sitting out there growing old, drinking bad coffee, waiting to do my job, and you\u2019re going to let me do it.\t[ Scoffs ] I don\u2019t know a whole lot about the inner workings\u2026 you don\u2019t know anything about how it works here. But I know you need legal representation. Valentin was crystal clear. I\u2019m sure he was. Now, you\u2019re not the only person in the world who\u2019s good at their job. I\u2019m already on retainer to valentin. He\u2019s ordered me to protect you, and I will comply. Fine. Fine. We\u2019re ready for you.\t[ Door closes ] Agent devane, I trust your lawyer has brought you up to speed? Yes. That the bureau is hanging me out to dry. Yep, I\u2019m aware. Agent hursley, there\u2019s something I don\u2019t understand. Perhaps you can help me out. Now, she\u2019s been perfectly honest about her history with the dvx for years now, and since that time, she\u2019s proven over and over again that she\u2019s shrewd, loyal, courageous \u2014 hell, she\u2019s a solid-gold asset to the bureau. Why, all of a sudden, is her dedication being called into question? It doesn\u2019t matter that we appreciate agent devane\u2019s work. Our hands are tied. Her entire dossier has been released, and the public knows that she\u2019s never been held accountable for her crimes. Not until now. Don\u2019t dunk me. Don\u2019t splash me or immerse any part of my body. Is that the trina robinson pool rules? Set in stone, my friend. Set in stone. Thank you for what you did before. Getting trina an orange juice? No, not punching spencer. Mm. Mm-hmm. He\u2019s not so bad. He\u2019s crazy about her. I think they might actually be in love. For spencer, that means showing off, which is counterproductive, because trina hates when he does that. But he knows you\u2019re ex-military, and I think he just wanted to prove that he was tougher than you and couldn\u2019t, so he\u2019s embarrassed. Well, I figured. But look, we\u2019re gonna be spending a lot of time together, hopefully poolside, and I want your friends to like me. I like you. The feeling is mutual. I was surprised you wanted to do this today. I thought you\u2019d want to be at the hospital. No, um, there is something that I have to talk to you about, though. With willow? Is she okay? No, no, no. She\u2019s great\u2026 considering everything. Her doctors are super optimistic. It\u2019s about michael. Things are pretty bad between us right now. Because of me? No, because of everything. Everything\u2019s just gotten spun out of proportion. I\u2019m really sorry. How can I help? We should\u2026 go somewhere private. To talk. Thank you. For what? For making an effort. I know it wasn\u2019t easy. Well, as long as we don\u2019t have to hang out all the time. Probably not. But I know joss appreciates it. So do I. Joss? No, no. I\u2019m doing this for you. Thank you. With everything else going on in my life, I don\u2019t want to worry about my friendships. Yeah. I didn\u2019t want to pry, but if you want to talk, I\u2019m here. I honestly don\u2019t know what to say or how to feel. I knew that it could be a possibility that curtis could be my father. But now I know the truth, and it makes me wonder if I should have even asked the question in the first place. It\u2019s been a huge shock for everyone. But taggert, I can\u2019t imagine how he\u2019s feeling right now. Like, he lost his daughter. Not that he would ever, ever say anything like that. Well, taggert doesn\u2019t care about dna. He only cares about trina. Still, I\u2019m really worried about him. I mean, his relationship with trina is just \u2014 it\u2019s just so special. I just think that he could really use someone to talk to right now, and I\u2019m so glad that he has a friend in you. Sure. I\u2019ll talk to taggert. Okay. Not to intrude, but\u2026 how is curtis handling the news? Auntie, of course I forgive you, but I\u2019m not trying to sit here and listen to a lecture about family. I know. Not right now. Okay. I know we have a lot of issues to work through, and I\u2019m gonna do everything I can to make things right between us again. But right now, I need you to know how much I care about you. You just had life-changing news, and you need the support of your family. Because it\u2019s not only about you. You are a father. You have a daughter now. And believe me when I say that changes everything.\t", "You want to go to chechnya with me? Do I want to? No, of course not. But if you are determined to go, I\u2019m not gonna let you go alone. Besides, I know a little russian. I honestly don\u2019t know what to say. Thank you. You don\u2019t have to say anything. Just say you want to do this incredibly dangerous thing and then let me know when we\u2019re leaving. I haven\u2019t spoken to jordan yet. Jordan doesn\u2019t know that you moved back in with portia? It\u2019s not \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces, auntie. Look, I-I\u2019m in no position to tell you what to do, but, curtis, please don\u2019t wait. You need to talk to jordan, and you need to do it now. Curtis moved back in? Yeah. Yeah. We both decided that it\u2019s the only way to really make our marriage work. What do you mean, \u201canything is possible\u201d? Well, if you\u2019re open to it, there\u2019s more than one way to start a family. What\u2019s it gonna be? Because unlike the wsb, I do not make idle threats. Your friends are safe. What the hell just happened? Is he gonna go ahead with the charges or not? Not. Why? What was all this about? What did he want? He didn\u2019t want anything. I don\u2019t even think the bureau did. This is all just victor. He wanted my resignation. I\u2019m no longer an agent. Nor will I ever be again. You taking off? We\u2019re going to the bank. What? We need to see who victor thinks is the biggest threat to your family. No, forget it. I don\u2019t exactly trust my not-so-dearly departed uncle. Who would victor see as the biggest threat to your baby brother? How do you expect me to know that? By opening the deposit box now. You\u2019re not gonna take no for an answer, are you? What do you think? Your mom doesn\u2019t want to make a deal with the feds, so you\u2019re going to make one for her?

I seem to recall you not necessarily leaping to get your bone density checked.\tOkay, okay, we\u2019re not doing tit for tat right now. Do as I say, not as I do.\tYeah. I hear you, mom. It took me a while to realize that each month was getting worse. And honestly, when we decided to have a baby, I was looking forward to getting pregnant right away so that I wouldn\u2019t have any periods at all.\tYou\u2019d have a whole lot of other things.\tYeah, well, it didn\u2019t happen, so I\u2019m back to dealing with this.\tIs there a treatment?\tDr. Navarro says usually hormone therapy is prescribed.\tOkay, so that\u2019s bad because\u2026\tthe hormone is estrogen.\tThe treatment stops ovulation, mom, which means I wouldn\u2019t be able to get pregnant.\tWe were told that trina made contact. Yeah?\tYes, yes, she found a satellite phone. And she was able to relay the ship\u2019s heading.\tYour daughter is a very brave woman.\tI would rather her be cowardly and safe at home. And I\u2019m sure you can imagine how terrified I am right now not knowing what\u2019s going on with her, whether she\u2019s safe, whether they found her or not. What about jordan? Has she reached out to you at all, or maybe your agency?\tNo. Sorry, there\u2019s been no updates on victor\u2019s whereabouts. Listen, I really understand how you\u2019re feeling, \u2019cause I\u2019ve been in your position.\tI have too. And if we hear anything, we will tell you directly. You have my word.\t[Tense music]\tWhat?\tIt\u2019s ned again.\tI think that you really need to take that call.\tOkay. I will. I\u2019ll be back in a minute.\tDr. Robinson-\tanna, please, please, I\u2019m here as-\tas a mom right now, not as a doctor, a mother who\u2019s very terrified for her child. And I hate to ask you this right now, but I need to know, how much danger is my daughter really in?\tIs victor cassadine, is he-\tis he capable of harming trina?\tI\u2019m sorry I took so long to get to you.\tI\u2019m sorry victor used me to make you do his bidding. You were in prison too. Besides, the mess was entirely of my own making. I should have seen victor\u2019s men coming.\tIt seemed there were quite a few participants at that digital auction. You had quite a following, none of whom were admirers.\tYou know me. Rob from the rich and give to the poor, plus a small commission for personal expenses. The poor are fine with the arrangement. But the rich tend to be sore losers.\tAny particular charities you are benefiting these days?\tA couple of orphanages and a wildlife sanctuary in zimbabwe. I\u2019ve been out of commission for a while, so they\u2019re definitely gonna need some funding.\tBefo re you go running backto monte carlo or wherever, you\u2019re going to need some time to recuperate. Please reconsider.\tI\u2019m sorry, mom. I can\u2019t stay with you in port charles. Too many people after me. It\u2019s best that I continue to australia, where I know the players, who\u2019s got deep pockets, and equally important, who not to cross. I need an influx of cash to continue my charity work and pay off a couple of the bastards who want to kill me.\tI don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s any point at all in asking you to be careful.\tI will if you will.\tWho are you to tell me what luke spencer would or wouldn\u2019t want for me?\tI\u2019m his friend, someone who knew him and knows that he genuinely loved you, tracy. And he wouldn\u2019t want you spending your time and your money trying to avenge him. I think it\u2019s good that you\u2019re coming back to port charles. You need your family around you right now.\t[Laughing] Have you met my family?\tValentin, you really are alive. I was starting to wonder.\tNed, knock it off. What do you want?\tNeed I remind you that since you are not dead, you\u2019re still the ceo of elq.\tYeah, I have other priorities at the moment.\tDid you even listen to the messages that I left you?\tNo. Listen. Anna has been in the icu. She\u2019s been fighting for her life. You\u2019re the chairman of the board. I figured you could handle anything that comes up.\tI have been for months. But that was when you were dead. Now you\u2019re very much alive. Is it too much to ask to put out a statement? The shareholders, the board members, the general public are all very curious as to why you pulled that stunt.\t", "Okay, it wasn\u2019t a stunt. My daughter\u2019s life was in danger. Victor cassadine had to be stopped.\tYes, let\u2019s talk about your father, who I understand is now a wanted man. Not a good look on the heels of your disappearance. No one understands what the hell is going on, let alone our ceo\u2019s involvement in it. Look, from our shareholders\u2019 perspective, you have perpetuated a major fraud.\tMy attorney will be handling that.\tCut the crap, valentin. You need to step up and do your damn job.\tWherever you go, you have to keep in touch. No disappearing off the face of the earth this time.\tHey, that goes for you too. Look. Victor knows you weren\u2019t really burned in that fire you and robert staged. He knows you tricked him. He\u2019s not likely to forget.\tGood.\tSatisfying though it may be to know you got the best of a megalomaniac, is going back really good idea? I mean, is there anything left in port charles for you now?\tI realize how frustrating this is.\tThe wsb won\u2019t act because of jurisdictional issues?\tWhen has that ever stopped them before, robert?\tThere must be someone you can call, robert.\tIt\u2019s all about the increased scrutiny on intelligence agencies that we have to put up with these days.\tYou said there was nothing on that island. What difference does it make what nation it belongs to?\tLook, four innocent people have been kidnapped, and one of them is an infant.\tAnd another is a bone marrow donor for a woman with stage four leukemia.\tExactly. I just don\u2019t see how anyone could object to sending out a rescue team under these circumstances.\tNobody hates red tape more than I do, and I\u2019m doing my best to plow through it, but it just takes a bit of time.\tThey don\u2019t have time.\tAnd neither do I. The hell with the wsb. I\u2019m getting our families home now.\tthat you could never get pregnant?\tNo.\tThe hormone therapy is not permanent. Once molly stops taking the medication, ovulation will resume. And that\u2019s probably why dr. Navarro wanted to wait. Until we know exactly what we\u2019re dealing with, it\u2019s all speculation. And worst case scenario, baby, this might be a speed bump, not a dead end.\tBut what if it is? I mean, I\u2019ve already done a search on endometriosis. I know that it can cause infertility.\tIn some cases, definitely not all.\tRight. Okay. I know you\u2019re right. We just need more answers. You know what? I\u2019m gonna note some questions. I\u2019ll do research and ask dr. Navarro also.\t[Tense music]\tHey, there\u2019s an er patient I needed to check in on. Will you be okay for just a bit?\tI got this.\tYeah, sure, go.\tOkay. It won\u2019t be long.\tI\u2019ll be okay. I need to check my messages. I\u2019m waiting on discovery for a case.\tOkay.\tTalk to me.\tI\u2019m just being irrational.\tYou\u2019ve got nothing-\tpossibly. You know, feelings are not always rational. Tell me how you really feel.\t[Crying] I feel like I just got told that I\u2019ll never be a mom.\t[Sighing] Oh, baby.\tI\u2019m just realizing what a ridiculous question that was for me to ask. I\u2019m asking the woman who victor cassadine shot if he\u2019s capable of harming someone. Oh, trina. I\u2019m sorry. I really don\u2019t know what I was thinking. I\u2019m so sorry.\tYou\u2019re not thinking. You\u2019re feeling helpless, aren\u2019t you? Because your child\u2019s in danger.\t[Machine beeping] And I\u2019m feeling useless because I can\u2019t be out there to help bring trina and spencer and ace back safely.\tWell, don\u2019t even think about getting out of that bed, \u2019cause that\u2019s not happening. As much as I would love for you to be out there leading the charge.\tI\u2019ve been told I can\u2019T. You\u2019re not gonna get any answers out of these agencies. You know, they\u2019re just-\tthey have to be really careful about the information that they put out there. But I\u2019m gonna be very straight with you. Victor is ruthless. He hates me, but he is very smart. And he knows that trina is his leverage over spencer. So he\u2019s not going to hurt her. You see, because then he would lose spencer.\tOkay, but see, what I\u2019ve heard about victor, I mean, does he really care about his family?\tI believe he does. He could have killed valentin, but he didn\u2019T. He went for me, and he let his son live.\tPortia, there are some very good people out there on that man\u2019s trail. And we\u2019re gonna get a break soon. I feel that.\t", "I pray that you\u2019re right. And I pray that they find victor. But I\u2019m also getting the feeling like it might be too late.\tNed, I\u2019m not gonna get into it right now, but there\u2019s more at stake than elq stock.\tMy point exactly. If our stock doesn\u2019t rebound, there are real world consequences for our employees. It\u2019s our responsibility to protect not only our shareholders, but our employees\u2019 livelihoods.\tOkay, ned, what do you want?\tI want you to either get back to work or step down so I can officially take over.\tNed, that\u2019s not gonna happen. I am not stepping down. Once my father\u2019s been apprehended, I will recommit to elq. In the meantime, I trust you can handle whatever might come up. Goodbye, ned.\tValentin, valentin!\t[Dramatic music] Unbelievable.\tThank you, we\u2019ll be there. Okay. We\u2019ve got a charter plane fueled up and ready to go. I\u2019ve got a helicopter coming here in less than an hour. We can use the helipad on the roof.\tOh, that\u2019s great. That gives me just enough time to get home, update the family, and then get what I need.\tRight, and for me to check in at the club.\tYeah, I have to check in with kevin too.\tI\u2019m in.\tNo, no. You\u2019ve got to stay here and keep putting pressure on the wsb to act quickly.\tI can do that anywhere.\tNo, you can\u2019T. Listen, my friend, you and anna and valentin are the only ones who are going to know exactly what\u2019s going on. So I need you here as backup.\tLaura-\tlisten, this is the right way to do it. You know that.\tStay in touch.\tOkay. Lean on the wsb. Okay? Meet me back here in less than an hour.\tYou got it.\tI am gonna head to the club and brief n\u2019neka and retrieve a little something.\tYeah, you do that. And what about portia?\tYeah, I\u2019ll see portia before I go. She\u2019s still upstairs in her office trying to distract herself with work.\tWell, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s gonna appreciate the fact that we finally have a lead.\tYeah.\tHow many roses did you get?\tEnough to fill the baskets, of course.\tI can\u2019t believe we were able to pry these baskets away from donna and avery. Donna has been practicing nonstop. She can\u2019t wait for avery to get here so they can practice together.\tOh, that is adorable.\tAnd donna insists that her big brother deserves the best flower girls ever.\t[Laughter]\tI really appreciate how hard the whole family\u2019s working to make this day so special for willow.\tAnd you, michael. We all love you for some reason.\t[Laughter]\tI know, I\u2019m just being stupid.\tStupid? My daughter? Impossible. Honey, it\u2019s very normal to be upset when you think something\u2019s not right with your body, and especially if it\u2019s something that you were counting on that you might not be able to do, like get pregnant. It\u2019s very upsetting.\tI mean, logically, I know that I could still be a mom even if I am infertile. Being a parent is so much more than just biology.\tAbsolutely. But we\u2019re also getting ahead of ourselves here, right? We don\u2019t even know if you have endometriosis until the biopsy comes back, yes?\tDr. Navarro seemed pretty certain. And I have all of the classic symptoms.\tOne step at a time.\tRight.\tAnd stop looking-\tI\u2019m taking this. Do not look at the internet to get your medical information. It\u2019s just gonna leave you terrified.\tI know, but mom, sitting around and waiting is just not in my dna.\tI know, it\u2019s not mine either. I\u2019d be all over this thing, looking and trying to face the worst news head on.\tYeah, exactly. Knowledge is power.\tSo they say.\tYes, petite, she\u2019s doing a lot better. Oh, you know what? I\u2019m gonna let you go. I\u2019ll give anna your well wishes. I love you too. What\u2019s going on? What happened?\tWe think we know where victor is.\tWhere?\tA small island off the coast of greenland.\tGreenland? What\u2019s in greenland?\tAccording to the satellite, the haunted star and nothing else. But robert thinks that there was some kind of a lab there that was abandoned in the \u201950s.\tMikkos preferred his underground bunkers. They were easier to conceal.\tOkay, do you remember anything about a cassadine holding in greenland?\tNo, not at all.\tOkay, well, I guess I\u2019m about to find out. I am leaving with curtis and drew in less than an hour.\tI\u2019m going with you.\tOh, good. Great.\tNo, wait. I can\u2019t do that.\tOkay, I understand. Anna needs you. I\u2019ll keep you updated as much as I can.\tLaura, good luck.\t[Dramatic music]\tLook, the situation is critical. I need the director to authorize an operation now. Okay? It\u2019s critical. I\u2019ll be waiting for the call.\tRobert, someone bothering you?\tNot for long.\tI\u2019m sensing this is a bad time.\t", "okay, I think that we\u2019ve got the entr\u00e9es covered. I just hope we have enough appetizers.\tAre there 50 more guests coming that I don\u2019t know about?\t[Laughs]\tWe can always order pizza.\tAh! Bite your tongue. If you weren\u2019t the groom, I would throttle you right now.\tOkay, hey, hey.\tWhy aren\u2019t you dressed?\tThe same reason you\u2019re not dressed. The wedding\u2019s not for hours.\tYeah, but I\u2019m cooking.\tOkay, I will do you a favor. I will stay out of the kitchen. But there has to be something else I can do to help get ready.\tYou\u2019re supporting willow. That\u2019s more important than anything. So how is she?\tShe\u2019s sleeping soundly, and so is amelia. How are you?\tJust trying to be cool, pretending to be checking his work on his phone.\tMichael, you\u2019re not working.\tNo, no, no, I just had to make sure that a project was on track for later. Putting it away now. Besides, I am getting married today.\t[Laughter]\tYou are.\tYou are.\tAll right. I\u2019m gonna head down to the gatehouse soon, help willow get her things ready when she wakes up. And it\u2019s tradition, remember? I was the one who helped her get ready the last time she married you.\tOh, yeah.\tThat\u2019s right, you did. And she looked lovely then, and she\u2019s gonna look lovely today.\tShe\u2019s gonna blow you away, michael. Just wait till you see her.\tOh, I bet. I can\u2019t wait to see my beautiful bride.\tMoll, what did dr. Navarro say?\tIt\u2019s highly likely that I have endometriosis.\tHow likely?\tIt\u2019s an unofficial diagnosis. We won\u2019t know for sure until the results of the biopsy are back.\tOh, a biopsy.\t[Dramatic music]\tMother, I\u2019m not gonna disappear. I\u2019m not even wearing a parachute.\tYou\u2019re gonna have to indulge me. I searched the globe looking for you. And now you\u2019re next to me. I\u2019m not letting go.\tHey, I appreciate the save.\tMm. Much though I hate to admit it, tracy is the one who saved the day.\tI still can\u2019t get over you showing up at a black market auction dressed in all white. You do have a flair for the dramatic, don\u2019t you?\tWell, wardrobe critique aside, I couldn\u2019t very well let luke\u2019s son get executed. Although, I didn\u2019t expect to spend that much money to save him. What was holly thinking driving the price up to 10 million?\tYou only paid 4.\tIt should have been 2.\tWell, I think it\u2019s incredibly kind of you to save luke\u2019s son, no matter what the price.\tThat\u2019s easy for you to say. But to tell the truth, I only got involved because victor cassadine was behind the auction, and I will not rest until I prove that man killed luke.\tAny news on your father?\tYou mean have I had any updates in the five minutes it took me to get this cup of coffee?\tYes, that\u2019s what I mean.\tNo.\tOh. I can\u2019t just lie here, do nothing.\tLook, take it easy, will you? You just got out of the icu. Doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re ready for dancing.\t[Machine beeping]\tI\u2019d settle for a little walk.\tLook, I know how frustrated you are.\tSo frustrated.\tYour job is to heal. Victor will be caught, and he\u2019ll be dealt with.\tReally? Haven\u2019t we been saying that for the last six months?\tOkay, but now he\u2019s overreaching. He\u2019s getting close to his goal, and he\u2019s overconfident. He\u2019s making mistakes-\tletting me live, for one, and kidnapping laura\u2019s grandsons for another.\tI think we\u2019re making some pretty big jumps. Just because victor wanted information on project demeter doesn\u2019t mean-\tit\u2019s not a guarantee that he\u2019s headed for the spot right here on the map.\tRobert, thank god you\u2019re here.\tI pulled in to see anna. What\u2019s happening?\tWe have a lead on victor.\tShow me.\tYeah, so this is a map I think my seal team used when we were working on project demeter.\tDemeter, demeter\u2026 victor was interested in that.\tExactly.\tWell, what are all these locations?\tWe\u2019re not sure, but we think they\u2019re connected to mikkos cassadine.\tLook at that one right there. You recognize that?\t1981. [Chuckles] A good year for stopping mikkos.\tRight, and then that\u2019s cassadine island right there. So I think it stands to reason that all of these different sites are somehow related to the cassadines, right?\t", "But why are they spread out? There\u2019s no logic in that.\tTrina was able to provide us with the heading from the haunted star. If we combine that heading with this map of circled locations, there\u2019s one shared point.\tIt\u2019s that island right there, right off the coast of greenland. That\u2019s where we think victor is headed.\tIt\u2019s a long shot, but that\u2019s all we\u2019ve got.\tHe\u2019s a cunning bastard. I think I\u2019ve figured out how to find them.\t[Dramatic music]\tLet me guess. Valentin?\tHe\u2019s not answering my calls. And now his voicemail is full, probably from all the messages that I\u2019ve left already or from members of the board with whom I\u2019m in constant contact with.\tSorry, dad. I know valentin\u2019s at the hospital. Maybe I could head over there, ask him to give you a call?\tNo, it\u2019s not your responsibility. It\u2019s his responsibility. Elq\u2019s stock has taken a major hit, and our ceo is mia. Michael and drew were right. Only a quartermaine will truly make elq a priority, and only a quartermaine should run elq.\tIs it drew?\tNo.\tOh, ned. He wants to talk about elq. You\u2019ll have to call him back eventually, you know?\tYes, I will, but not right now. I\u2019m trying to stay focused. I\u2019m racking my brain. What my father told me about his master plan, I just wish we\u2019d cracked the code.\t[Knock on door]\tHi. I\u2019m so sorry to bother you. How are you feeling, anna?\tYeah, I\u2019m actually feeling better, you know? Are you all right?\tSince the demented man that has my daughter is your father, I\u2019d like you to tell me everything that you know about victor cassadine.\tAnna and I always suspected that luke\u2019s death wasn\u2019t an accident. But how did you find out?\tThe longer I lived with it, the less sense it made. Luke spencer dying in a random accident, in switzerland of all places. What was he doing there? Certainly not there for the chocolate or for the skiing. He used to go to switzerland, zurich, do his banking, and get out. So I went to see that twit jennifer smith in prison. Something about her having the ice princess diamond just didn\u2019t add up. She\u2019s a schemer, but she\u2019s a nincompoop. Certainly couldn\u2019t mastermind a theft from luke spencer. So when I looked her straight in her vapid eyes and she told me she\u2019d been framed, I knew she was telling me the truth.\tThe wsb just wanted to tie it all up. As far as they were concerned, they got the diamond back. Case solved, except it wasn\u2019T.\tToo bad nobody ever bothered to tell me, luke\u2019s widow.\t[Stammers] We thought you were getting on with your life. We didn\u2019t have actual proof.\tNo, you didn\u2019t want me in on it. You wanted to do it your way. And meanwhile, I spent 14 months trying to prove that luke has been murdered by myself.\tOh, tracy, luke wouldn\u2019t want that.\tIf the site belongs to the cassadines, wouldn\u2019t victor already know about it? I\u2026\tyes.\tWe\u2019ve been assuming that the code etched into the diamond has been a set of coordinates. But what if it\u2019s completely unrelated?\tThe best information we got is the heading from trina. And that site in greenland is directly on that heading.\tYou know, we have so many pieces of this puzzle, but we\u2019re missing that one crucial piece that just brings it all together.\tRobert.\tHey, did your contact help?\tSatellite imagery has a ship parked in the cove there just off greenland. Interesting point is there\u2019s not supposed to be anything there. But there was a research station back in the \u201950s, and then they abandoned it. What\u2019s even more interesting is that the ship is running in the dark, no transponders.\tThat\u2019s it. That\u2019s the haunted star.\tWe got them. We got victor.\tOkay, how soon can you get the wsb there?\tWell, I can\u2019T. There\u2019s a problem.\tWell, the way dr. Navarro explained it, endometriosis develops when the tissues that usually line the inside of the uterus grow on the outside of the uterus. They\u2019re usually non-cancerous, but these growths can cause painful periods, which I have definitely experienced.\tAnd how long has this been going on?\tI don\u2019t know, a few months maybe. But mom, I mean, remember, I\u2019ve always had bad cramps. But lately they\u2019ve just gotten more and more intense.\t"], "answer": [3, 4, 0, 1, 2]}
{"content": ["[ Sighs ] \u2026What if the police were to find out what you did? They already know. They know? Then how are you still walking around free? Because I voluntarily came forward and gave a statement. Is that why nikolas disappeared? Because he knew he\u2019d become a wanted man? I assume that\u2019s the reason. Look, all of this is gonna become public knowledge soon enough. I just wanted you to hear it from me. I do owe you that much. Hang on. There\u2019s one more thing I need to know. I\u2019ll answer if I can. Did I want my baby? W-was I trying to get rid of it, and that\u2019s why nikolas locked me away? Now that esme\u2019s serial killer father is dead, her remaining family consists of heather webber, who murdered a very near and dear family friend of mine, as well as attacked my lawyer who\u2019s standing across from me. So do you really think that that\u2019s in the best interest of the child? Spencer, just\u2026 rein back the rhetoric a little bit. You\u2019re not winning any points with child\u2019s services. Janet, what happens now? The baby will remain here in the nursery until his mother is transferred to spring ridge. I\u2019ll take your brother back to the nursery now \u2014 no, no! I\u2019m not giving him up. Spencer. Spencer, you don\u2019t want to upset the baby, do you? Yeah, for once, I agree with your grandmother, spencer. Listen, don\u2019t worry. This \u2014 this isn\u2019t over yet. This all has to be argued in family court in front of a judge, but until that time, it is essential that you comply with all the court orders. Uh \u2014 okay, okay. But I would just like to go on record and say that this goes against everything that I want for my baby brother. Okay.\tof nikolas returning to port charles? My guess is that you still have a thing for him. Even though your marriage ended badly, that if he came back, you \u2014 you would be tempted to get back together with him. Uh, am I \u2014 am I \u2014 am I close? Mnh-mnh. No. I learned my lesson. It was hard to learn, but I learned it. Never again. Well, I\u2019m happy for you, but I still, you know, it\u2019s like, why wouldn\u2019t he contact you? Especially after everything that\u2019s happened with ryan chamberlain? Well\u2026 my relationship with nikolas was always very tempestuous. And our marriage didn\u2019t stand a chance after ryan decided to use esme to destroy it. Is that what he told you? Mm. Told me. [ Laughs ] He bragged about it right up until I shot him. And thankfully, mac ended his life altogether. I still think it\u2019s strange that you haven\u2019t heard from nikolas. Say what you want about the guy, \u2019cause I don\u2019t like him. But between the \u2014 the birth of his new kid and finding out that ryan chamberlain ended his marriage, you would think that he \u2014 he would come back running to you. You\u2019d think. But he hasn\u2019T. So I\u2019m gonna ask you. What\u2019s stopping him? Liesl, I\u2019m, uh \u2014 I\u2019m incredibly grateful for your kindness. It just feels like there\u2019s another reason why you\u2019re doing this. Is michael right? Your fianc\u00e9 is correct, and I appreciate him being so direct. I will return it in kind. It\u2019s no secret how the two of you feel about nina. But my niece was devastated when it turned out she wasn\u2019t a match to be your donor. And so, willow, I appeal to you as a mother. I know you\u2019re not ready to think of nina as your mom right now, and maybe you never will be. All I\u2019m asking for is for you to imagine a time when nina is not your enemy. If you can open your heart to that possibility, that will be all the thanks I need. Okay. Well, this was fun. You\u2019ve had your fun, mason, but I\u2019m out of here. Oh, go on, have a chit-chat with your partner-in-crime, ava. You know, I searched her online. She\u2019s been around the block. She knows, uh, when it\u2019s time to fight and when it\u2019s time to, shall we say, negotiate. All right. Av department has it up and running, so there shouldn\u2019t be any more problems. Oh, thanks, nina, I\u2019ll let the organizers know. There you go. And if there\u2019s anything else, you give me a call. I\u2019ll be at gh. Of course. I got it. Thanks. Hey, austin. Hey. How are you? Uh, ava \u2014 she\u2019s right over there if you\u2019re looking for her. I \u2014 I was. You know what? I have to say, you two have almost been inseparable these days. And it \u2014 it makes me wonder, what brought you two together? Janet, if you don\u2019t mind the company, I\u2019d like to go with you to fill out the necessary paperwork. Of course. Spencer, we will do everything in our power to make sure that your little brother gets the best possible care. Victor: I\u2019m gonna do everything I can within the law and even outside of it, if necessary, to secure you custody of our newest cassadine. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m sorry, too. My little brother shouldn\u2019t be in a hospital nursery. And he certainly shouldn\u2019t be shipped off to prison before he\u2019s even a month old. But like uncle peter said, this isn\u2019t over. I can\u2019t tell you what was in your heart, esme. There was a time when I thought you were incapable of loving anyone but yourself. If what you\u2019ve told me really is true and I did jump off of that high tower at wyndemere, I can only imagine that I was pretty desperate, and I certainly couldn\u2019t have been thinking about the baby by doing something so dangerous. We may never know. But when you surfaced, you seemed to have left the old esme behind you. In a way, you\u2019ve been given a blank slate, a fresh start. It\u2019s up to you what you do with it. I could not have said that better myself.\t", "What do you want?To keep playing me so you can take my baby away from me? You have a lot on your plate now that you\u2019re returning to spring ridge. Yeah, well, the difference is, now I know what you didn\u2019t tell me. What is she talking about? I\u2019m gonna let the two of you work this out, but I hope you both can put aside your own needs for the sake of that baby.\t", "have you heard from liesl? No, I haven\u2019t heard anything. It\u2019s driving me crazy, and we\u2019re super busy here. There\u2019s a convention in town. I have a million things to do. Okay, I know you\u2019re anxious waiting to hear from liesl, if she\u2019s done everything she needs to do to be a bone marrow donor for willow.\t[ Elevator bell dings ] Sweet girl, you didn\u2019t have to be here for this meeting. Yeah, that\u2019s what I told her. Well, if we\u2019re being honest, you didn\u2019t have to be here either. I see it differently. I owe it to my dear departed britta. I couldn\u2019t save my daughter\u2019s life, but if I can help save yours\u2026 I will be forever grateful. Remember what I told you? Like it or not, you\u2019re one of us now. Hey, have a seat, cuz. You know, I\u2019d love to, but I just can\u2019T. I\u2019m meeting someone. Mm. If you\u2019re referring to the lovely ava cassadine \u2014 or is it \u201cjerome\u201d again? Well, either way, you better make time for, uh, both your sakes. Those people at the convention, they can amuse themselves all they want. But you know what? Hmm? You need a distraction.\t[ Chuckles ] Yeah? And I see someone who needs distracting just as much as I do. Come here. Aw. Hey, ava. You know what they say about drinking alone? Austin: You told me that nikolas was dead. He was! Did you take a pulse? No, I just took my chances. Of course I checked his pulse! Okay, so\u2026 one time, in medical school, they told me that a dead body doesn\u2019t just up and walk away. I was in shock. Right? I mean, I\u2019m sure I was in shock. But I can tell you one thing for certain. Nikolas\u2019 heart was not beating. I\u2019m sure of it. Then, ava, where the hell is he? Ava, you\u2019re not waiting for nikolas to show up again, are you? Okay. I just need a couple of signatures. Then you can take the baby home. Okay. Excuse me, but I\u2019m afraid there\u2019s been a change of plans. What do you mean? I\u2019m sorry, spencer, but that baby\u2019s not going anywhere. Excuse me, but do you know who you are speaking with?\t[ Scoffs ] My client. Spencer, honey, it will be okay. It\u2019ll give us a chance to reconsider our plan. Grandmother, there is nothing to reconsider. My baby brother belongs with me. Unfortunately, his mother disagrees.\t[ Door opens ] Nurse baldwin! I\u2019m so glad to you. Can you \u2014 can you bring me my baby? Yes, I-I can. But first, we need to have a talk. Oh, I-I hope you\u2019re gonna walk me through the mommy manual. I can\u2019t think of anyone I\u2019d rather have teach me how to be a good parent. Yeah. You may not feel that way after you hear what I have to say. Really? I can\u2019t imagine that. You need to know how you ended up here. Well, thank you for your input and for coming by on such short notice. Any time. Not only do I enjoy the work, but you\u2019re a friend. I can tell that you mean that. I do. Then why are you lying to me? Excuse me? Wha\u2013 what did I lie about? You told me that you couldn\u2019t take this job at \u201cthe invader\u201d because you were bound to your teaching gig at pcu. Yes, it\u2019s called a conflict of interest.

Once upon a time, before jill said yes. She learned she had ibs-c and could treat it with linzess. That\u2019s why some things helped, but her constipation with belly pain would often return. Maybe there was another way? Or something left to learn? When her doctor connected the belly pain, discomfort, and bloating to ibs-c, it made sense to jill. So did learning that she could treat it with a once-daily pill. And that\u2019s why she said yess to adding linzess. Linzess is not a laxative. It helps you have more frequent and complete bowel movements. And is proven to help relieve overall abdominal symptoms-belly pain, discomfort and bloating. Do not give linzess to children less than two. It may harm them. Do not take linzess if you have a bowel blockage. Get immediate help if you develop unusual or severe stomach pain. Especially with bloody or black stools. The most common side effect is diarrhea, sometimes severe. If it\u2019s severe, stop taking linzess and call your doctor right away. Other side effects include gas, stomach area pain, and swelling. Could your story also be about ibs-c? Talk to your doctor and say yess to linzess.

Because if there\u2019s litigation involved, I will back off. \u201cAlexis davis backs off\u201d \u2014 now, there\u2019s a headline. Gregory. I want you to work here. You wanted to work here.

Were you fired? Talk to me. Maybe I can help you. Unfortunately, you can\u2019T. No one can. I can\u2019t believe this. I-I-I thought that it was bad enough that I had to serve time in prison. I was actually guilty of a crime. Now you\u2019re telling me that my innocent baby brother could end up there, too? In certain cases and in certain facilities, the state of new york allows for a mother to keep her child with her for the first 18 months while she\u2019s incarcerated. Oh, my god. Uncle victor, this \u2014 my little brother is your family, too. He deserves to be at home with us. Ah, spoken like a true cassadine. Look, if it\u2019s a matter of proving that spencer has the ways and means of providing for a child, then you have my personal guarantee. Yes. Well, I\u2019m afraid here your personal guarantee might do more harm than good. Nikolas\u2019 baby is also my family. Now, listen, whether we like it or not, we can\u2019t just take esme out of the equation. She is, after all, the baby\u2019s mother. At the time, i\thad every reasonto believe you were a threat, and I-I didn\u2019t know what nikolas was gonna do to you after you had the baby. I only have your word for that.\t[ Sighs ] Trust me, I know what it\u2019s like to have gaps in your memory. Gaps? You just told me that I was locked in a tower like some princess in a fairy tale. I mean, wha-what else don\u2019t I know? How \u2014 how did I escape? Did I let my hair down and climb out like rapunzel? No, you jumped from a turret into the harbor. I jumped? I could have died. A-and my baby\u2026 but by some miracle, you didn\u2019T. And yes, y-you lost your memory, but, esme, you saved your baby. Yeah, no thanks to his father. Or you. Okay, I \u2014 I don\u2019t blame you for feeling like this at all. But if you think I owe you an apology, you couldn\u2019t be more wrong. An other martini, please,glass of champagne, and some sparkling water. Of course. Thank you, thank you. Thanks, trish. You know what, ava? I think you have as much to celebrate as nina and willow. Do I? Yeah, and the way I see it, you hit the trifecta. Uh, you helped capture the hook killer, ryan chamberlain is dead, and nikolas cassadine is nowhere to be found on this earth. I mean, I\u2019d say that\u2019s a lot to celebrate. Yes, um, I see your point. And good riddance to ryan chamberlain, for sure. But, nikolas, I \u2014 I know how much you loved nikolas. So, uh, who knows what the future is going to hold? Don\u2019t give up hope. He might realize what he\u2019s missing and then come back and try to make things right.\t[ Chuckles ] Oh, uh, I doubt that. As a reminder, I am a doctor, too. What kind of hoops must I jump through to make this happen? Well, being identified as a potential match is a crucial first step. But before we go ahead with the transplant, we need to make sure that it\u2019s safe for dr. Obrecht to donate. It\u2019s imperative that we run additional tests and then weigh those results against things \u2014 against my age and my medical history, in case something comes up that will disqualify me as a donor. Why on earth would you\tTo anyone about this? Is it that severe? Alexis, as one friend to another, I\u2019m asking you to let this go, and we\u2019ll forget the whole thing. I\u2019m so sorry. Gregory, I am so sorry. I can\u2019t do that\u2026\t[ Sighs ] \u2026Because in friendship, there\u2019s trust. And if I asked you to trust me, to know what\u2019s good for me\u2026 is it good for you to keep something that seems to be this critical from somebody that cares about you? I mean, if that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m gonna have to re-evaluate our friendship. And by \u201cre-evaluate,\u201d you really mean end it. I\u2019m so sorry. I-I \u2014 I-it\u2019s hard for me to just sit here and do nothing knowing that aunt liesl might be the one to save willow\u2019s life. And I know the last thing I can do is stop you, so\u2026 also, michael and willow don\u2019t want to see me by your side. Just go ahead and go. Okay. Thanks. Thank you for understanding. All right. See ya. See ya. Nina, I hate to bother you, but the av is out, and the convention people are complaining. Okay, okay, let\u2019s solve the problem. Okay. Let\u2019s go. It\u2019s obvious how much she enjoys being in the hotel business, huh? You having a good time? Hmm? Being single? Uh\u2026 I\u2019ve only been single for like a minute. Why do you ask? Well, when nina said that, you know, you should hold out hope for nikolas to come back, it seemed like you were afraid there was a chance that might happen. Dr. Obrecht, are you on any medications we should be aware of? It\u2019s listed in my chart. I\u2019m taking an anti-coagulant. Well, then we\u2019ll need to consult with your prescribing physician. I will go set things in motion. I\u2019ll give you two some privacy. Ple\u2013 uh, please stay. You never answered the question. You mean what\u2019s in it for me? Yeah. When you lose a child\u2026 well, in my case, two adult children \u2014 nathan and britta \u2014 it forever shapes the world\u2019s perspective. My son jonah died of sids, and I still grieve for him every day. I can\u2019t imagine the pain you\u2019ve suffered losing two grown children. That\u2019s why I was so pleased when I heard I had a new family member in you, willow. You were in need of help. And it \u2014 it never occurred to me not to volunteer to be a donor so that I could give you the kind of life my own beloved britta can no longer enjoy. Just tell me what you want. What I\u2019ve always wanted. For you to remember your responsibilities. I know exactly where I\u2019ve come from, and I know how far I\u2019ve come. Nothing, nobody will make me go back. Well, I\u2019m not gonna make you, austin. You\u2019re smart. You\u2019ll figure it out on your own. And in the end, you\u2019re gonna do the right thing. You helped nikolas keep me prisoner. And I was so desperate that I jumped off a turret into a harbor. But you don\u2019t think I deserve an apology? I know I went about it all wrong, but I honestly thought I was protecting the people I love, as well as keeping you and the baby safe. I don\u2019t know what to believe anymore. I-I-I thought that you were on my side. But now\u2026\t", "trouble- reading? Exactly. They sort of make me feel\u2026 like I\u2019m the most fabulous thing you\u2019ve ever seen? Exactly.

Shingles strikes as a painful, blistering rash that can last for weeks. And it could wake at any time. Think you\u2019re not at risk for shingles? It\u2019s time to wake up. Because shingles could wake up in you. If you\u2019re over 50, talk to your doctor or pharmacist about shingles prevention. Ot? I wanted you to work at \u201cthe invader\u201d. You told me that you wanted to work here and that pcu had a conflict of interest, which didn\u2019t make any sense to me. So I called dean jeffries, hoping that I could convince him that you could do both, which is what you said you wanted to do, right? Yes, I said that. So I ask you again. Why did you lie to me? No doubt you\u2019re wondering if my willingness to participate comes with a price tag attached. Well, I mean, since you \u2014 you brought it up \u2014 uh, michael, let\u2019s just be grateful that liesl is a match. It\u2019s all right. It\u2019s an honest question that deserves an equally honest answer.\t[ Footsteps approach ] Oh, hello. Thank you all for waiting. Shall we go to my office and we can discuss next steps? Great. We\u2019re eager to get started. So your aunt liesl is a bone marrow match. That\u2019s incredible. I\u2019m so relieved. I\u2019m thrilled for you and for willow. Yeah, thank you. It\u2019s not a sure thing yet. I-it\u2019s definitely a step in the right direction, though. Yeah. You know, after I lost kiki, I \u2014 I swore that I would never lose avery. And, you know, after your loss, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m really rooting for you to have a chance to have a relationship with willow. Yeah. I\u2019ll give you a moment. You know, if nikolas were here, esme wouldn\u2019t make such an outrageous claim. No, she wouldn\u2019t, would she? But unfortunately, my son\u2019s not here. Yes, but I am. Esme\u2019s headed back to spring ridge while she awaits trial. And when she is convicted, which she most certainly will be, she\u2019s going to be sent the pentonville. Now, you cannot tell me that the court, even on its cruelest day, thinks that that\u2019s a good environment for a baby. Hello, janet. Everyone, this is janet kershaw from child\u2019s services. Right. I \u2014 I think we\u2019ve met before. Mayor collins, good to see you again. Yes, nice to see you, too. And I\u2019m so relieved to know that you\u2019re involved with this case. I\u2019m sure that we can reach some kind of a decision that will be best for this child. That\u2019s not my call. It\u2019s up to the court to decide. Esme prince has filed a motion to maintain custody of her baby once she\u2019s transferred back to spring ridge. Okay, I\u2019m listening. How did I wind up here?\t[ Sighs ] You\u2019d been missing for a while, and everyone, including the police, thought you were the hook killer. And one night, I was on the pier waiting to go to wyndemere, and you showed up. So of course, I called 911. But then you went for my phone, and we struggled, and I fell down and hit my head. A-a-are you saying that I-I pushed you down? No, uh, no, I\u2019m saying we struggled over the phone, but when I fell, I went unconscious. And I\u2013 it wasn\u2019t until the next time I saw you that I realized you were pregnant. And being a nurse, I felt like it was my obligation to protect the baby. What do you mean, protect my baby? How? Whatever you have to say, mason, just say it fast. It\u2019s impolite to keep a lady waiting. Right. You\u2019re a gentleman. The kind of guy who can\u2019t resist a damsel in distress. Say, if you knew ava was all alone on that island with no one there to help her, you\u2019d make it your business to cross the water and be there to rescue her, am I right? I \u2014 I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about. Is that so? Look, if you\u2019re worried about the ex-mrs. Cassadine, I guarantee she\u2019s on her second or third martini by now. Though, I can\u2019t really judge her, not with everything you guys have been through lately. I followed you that night to spoon island, cuz. I saw everything. Nikolas needed someone to care for you until you gave birth. When he came to see me at spring ridge with those papers that would give him sole custody, he never said anything about that \u2014 a-about you taking care of me. Why didn\u2019t he tell me that?\t[ Sighs ] He was keeping it a secret. And to do that, he kept you under lock and key in a tower in his home. Wait. You\u2019re telling me that I was his \u2014 his prisoner? And that you helped him? Yes.\tKnowwhat it is you think you saw, but ava hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. And neither have I. Well, you said that with such conviction. And I do mean conviction. But I\u2019m sure if you tell any judge that story, they\u2019ll go easy on you and your lady friend.

You get your lives back. As long as he behaves himself. What if somebody comes looking for us while you\u2019re gone? You said Chad and Stephanie were, were here and, and Hope and Michael, no one is coming. How can you be so sure? Because someone stopped by yesterday and they won\u2019t be coming back.\tDo you have something to tell me? It is. It,\tuh, just, um, you know how much I, I care about you. I\u2019m. You\u2019re sorry for what? Well, I, um, I just feel like you know, what you and your family are going through is at least, it\u2019s partly it\u2019s my fault. Harris,\tyou, you\u2019re doing everything you can now to help us.\tYeah, well I better get dressed standing here. Oh, hold on a second. The cop at the station last night, he gave me the most basic description as use kidnapper, brown hair, brown eyes, a medium build, and that could be almost anyone, right? I hope the plays artist is back at the precinct today.\tIf we can get a decent sketch of this guy then, then we\u2019ll know who we\u2019re looking for.\tSure. You, you saying that Kate was alive and now she\u2019s. I\u2019m so sorry. I I would\u2019ve tried to help her. I, I couldn\u2019t do anything. Well, I know you would have if you could have, but the Isha in not iron if they\u2019re not hers. Who\u2019s it? We don\u2019t know. And her body, well, the ISA searched the island. They haven\u2019t been able to located,\tI dunno. Why is this hitting me so hard? I mean, I had already accepted the fact that she was gone. It\u2019s a lot to process. First you saw me alive and then, then you heard that Kayla\u2019s alive as well, but I wasn\u2019t there when she died. She had to be so frightened. Why? And God\u2019s named and May didn\u2019t have to kill her.\tWell, well, and she said she didn\u2019t, said it was someone who worked for her. This is who you think has Kayla. No, we\u2019re not sure about that. Megan said that Thomas Banks is the one who took killing. Thomas Banks is in custody in Greece. He\u2019s denying everything. Well, of course he is. Apparently he has an ironclad alibi and Brady said Kristen sold him a bill of goods about Megan Recanting in the Nu Recanting.\tYour story. So all this is tracking. There\u2019s something else you should know. Steve went to look for Kayla. Now he\u2019s missing as well. Damn. So Megan took Kate from me now once, but twice. And now she\u2019s the reason that Kayla and Steve are missing. What is she? She cut a deal to do her time in State\u2019s film. Okay, good.\tI don\u2019t have far to go to choke the truth out her. I did not.\tThe, the word he is arrested Thomas Banks and he insists he didn\u2019t kidnap Kayla. That he didn\u2019t kill Kate Roberts. Well, what else is he gonna say? Shirley, you didn\u2019t believe him? I did because he has an alibi for when Kate was killed and when Kayla disappeared. He was a Aristotle\u2019s retreat. The sex club.\tDing, ding, ding. You got it. And there\u2019s an orgy full of people who can verify his whereabouts. I can\u2019t imagine Thomas going at it with even one person, let alone in orgy full. That is the most ridiculous alibi I can imagine. Hmm. Well, it all checks out. But back to us, our deal was based on you supplying information that would lead us to Kayla, but you didn\u2019t supply information.\t", "We should hedge the police station.\tThere\u2019s no reason to go to the police station. I know it\u2019s a long shot, but we, there\u2019s just something that, that I have to.\tI have to tell you. Okay.\tYou need to go to Victor\u2019s childhood home. You already searched it. You told me there was nothing. There was nothing there. I know I lied.\tOh, what the hell do I do?\tThis place seems deserted. So there\u2019s one more door.\tSorry, little brother of mine. No one is standing in the way of me getting back to my family.\tPlease. You can\u2019t send me away. Actually, I can and I will. I\u2019ll get you the formula. You\u2019ll be rich. I\u2019m not interested.\tThat\u2019s right. You\u2019re from the Law and Order branch of the Brady Bunch, aren\u2019t you? All I want is to find my aunt and uncle. Your uncle Steve went to Greece to look for Kayla and now he\u2019s missing too. You wanna keep our deal then? Tell me the. Tell me who really took Kayla. Then when and if we find her safe, I\u2019ll let you stay here in Statesville, but if we don\u2019t find her safe, you\u2019ll find out firsthand that the Law and Order branch of the Brady Bunch can be pretty ruthless when exacting revenge.\tSo you better start talking right. Why did you lie? Why didn\u2019t you want us to find Kayla? That\u2019s not it, Steven. Hope so. Happy to go chasing after Thomas Banks.\tAnd finally they knew who really took Kayla,\tthat it wasn\u2019t about to give hope, the satisfaction knowing that her beloved bow, he\u2019s alive again.\tIf that\u2019s not it, then what is\twe are going to find this guy with or without your. How do you know it\u2019s a guy? He showed up at a police station in Greece, impersonating my dad. That\u2019s when he took Steve. Oh. And those, uh, prisms, you were ready to kill for prisms. We have a general idea of where he is and a general description of what he looks like.\tSo if we figure this all out before you help us, your leverage is gone. So what\u2019s it gonna be here in Statesville or the seventh circle of hell?\tYou lied? What do you mean? I\u2019m.\tUh, this, this isn\u2019t, um, it\u2019s not making any sense. Why? Why would you lie about that? You said you wanted to help. I, I, I did. I do.\tYou\u2019re just gonna have to go and see for yourself. I am not understanding any of this. You will when you get there and I, I go with you, but it\u2019s something that you have to do on your own. That\u2019s all you\u2019re gonna tell me.\tOh, oh God. Oh. Oh my God.\tLook at you. Are you okay? I\u2019m. Fine, thank God. Where\u2019s dad? Is anyone out there?\tHey.\tHello.\tAnybody here?\tMichaels. Yeah, I\u2019ll take the call.\tWhat the hell do you want? Listen to me. If you want a chance with hope, any chance at all, you will take her right now and you will go far, far away. That\u2019s too late for both of us.\tOkay? I know D I S A D program, Michaels, and I know what a big party he played in tracking down. But are you sure he is not playing both sides? Him. You work with him? She\u2019s convinced he is no longer under Megan\u2019s influence. Okay, good. And he\u2019s looking for Kayla and Steve because, cause he knows that he has a lot to make up for far to impress hope.\tMo\u2019s gotta be turning over and he could look, I was under Megan\u2019s and fonts, so I know what it\u2019s like to be in Michael\u2019s shoes here, and I think he deserves a. I agree, John. I do agree, and like I said, I know how big a part Michael\u2019s play in tracking down menu. Are you going, well, I\u2019m going to Greece or Statesville?\tI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not gonna sit around here and do nothing. Oh, oh my God. Look at that thing. Let\u2019s find out. Hey, Andrew, I just, uh, saw your lights were on and you\u2019re gonna want to hear this. Uncle Roman. Andrew didn\u2019t know you were back. What are we gonna want to hear? I just came from Statesville. Now that we have Tom Spanks, Megan Hathaway has changed her story.\tWell, what is, so, how do you know she\u2019s telling the truth this time? What she said seemed well. Unbelievable. But I\u2019m actually inclined to believe her. Believe what she said, that the person who took Kayla was Uncle Bo.\tHello?\tAnybody here?\tOh dear God.\t", "Like Sands through the hourglass. So are the days of our lives.\tWhat the hell time? Is it time for you to have a visitor at this hour? Who is.\tSpecial agent Andrew Donovan Isa. Hello, Ms. Hathaway. We need to talk\there. Ru, I think you better sit down. Yeah. Hey buddy. Come on. Take. Come on. It\u2019s her. Pardon? Where the hell? That was what I was just about to tell you. When we tracked Megan down, we not only found Marna, but we found Kayla too. Of Yes. Yes. Alive.\tI, I don\u2019t understand. We were right. Megan is the one that stole the orchid from Kristen. She, Dr. Ralphs manufacturer serum to cure them, and then he kept them in a cryogenic state. Okay. It\u2019s a lot to take in. Yeah. My God. Funeral. She\u2019s alive. My God. That\u2019s wonderful. That\u2019s incredible. Hmm. Oh my God. But what about Kate?\tIt was just so real. Andrew came and he, he told me my parents were dead.\tI know what nightmares are. When I lost Abby, I, uh, I was afraid to close my eyes. Chad, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to No, no, no. Don\u2019t I That\u2019s, I, I, I\u2019m just saying that I know how scared you must be. I really do believe we\u2019re gonna find them alive. That\u2019s weird. What is, you said that in my nightmare, you\u2019re.\tEven in a nightmare. Thank you. I couldn\u2019t get through this without you. I wouldn\u2019t let you think about this. We\u2019re making progress. We\u2019re getting closer. Are we? I mean, now that we know that it wasn\u2019t Thomas Banks who took my mom, to me it feels like we don\u2019t even have a clue of who we\u2019re dealing with, let alone why.\tWhere are we going? Not you? Just her. She\u2019s not her. She\u2019s your sister. Okay. Beautiful. Sister of mine. I have found a Titan Research Lab, brand new. I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s used it, but it has everything you say. You need to create the formula for the sear. So, yep, we\u2019ve got the orchid, the prisms, everything we need.\tLet\u2019s go over my dead body. Hmm. That could be arranged.\tNot yet, nothing. What, what\u2019d he ask? Uh, because you look like you haven\u2019t slept. Yeah. It\u2019s just, you know, it\u2019s uncomfortable and I, I can\u2019t stop worrying about Steven, Kayla. Yeah, me too. I, last night I was racking my brain trying to figure out why banks was telling Stephanie and Chad. He said he wanted them to lead him to Kayla, but why does he even care about Kayla?\tAnd why did Megan lie to us about her? Really did take her, she must be protecting someone, right? The question is, who does she care enough about to protect? The fact is that she is crazy too. Yeah, very crazy. But she\u2019s definitely not stupid. She never does anything without reason. A self-serving reason.\tHarris, it\u2019s so frustra. There are so many questions and no good answers. Listen, hope\tthere\u2019s something I have to tell you.\tYou know, I really do think it\u2019s, it\u2019s good that it wasn\u2019t Thomas Banks that took your mom and that guy is extremely dangerous. He tried to kill hope, but whoever has her and my dad may be worse. I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019m whoever did this was sophisticated enough to waltz into a police station, impersonating Shane Donovan, and walk out with your dad without raising any suspicions.\tChad, that\u2019s terrifying. That means that he\u2019s really, really good at being a criminal. Yeah, I\u2019m, I\u2019m, I\u2019m not so sure. I mean, if it\u2019s the same person who took both your parents, he let your mom get to his cell phone. He hasn\u2019t made any random demands. So then what does he want? I don\u2019t know. I mean, that\u2019s the question.\tHe can\u2019t be taking orders from Megan Hathaway. If he ever was because she\u2019s in prison. Isa swept the island and found her Ralph and a whole lot of jungle, and there aren\u2019t a lot of people that it could be when you get your detective badge. Well, your dad taught you how to pick locks. Mine was a master criminal.\tYou ask yourself, what would Stefan out do? Something like that. Yeah. And like I, I, I still think the best clue we have is the one your mom gave us when she said Victor\u2019s name. I think she\u2019s gonna be at one of his properties. I mean, we. You still have a few to check out? I really do believe we\u2019re gonna find them today.\t", "Yeah. Who the hell is that at this time of night?\tWhoa. And you\u2019re home. Home. You were in Bed Man\u2019s, your. I forgot. I\u2019ll go. No, no. I\u2019ll, no, no, no. Get your butt in here. Come on, man. I\u2019m nowhere near going to bed. You now you look beat. Have a seat. Yeah. Well, yes I am. Uh, the, uh, flight got in late to here. I, uh, couldn\u2019t sleep on the plane. I, it\u2019s way too late. I shouldn\u2019t, I\u2019m doing some work here.\tEating a sandwich. You want some food? I\u2019m, I\u2019m getting you a sandwich. You want a drink? I\u2019m good. Good. All right. No, I\u2019ve, um, been trying to get ahold of you buddy. Yeah. I was in Ireland to, uh, you know, scatter Katie\u2019s ashes. Yeah, I know. And then I spent a few days with Carrie and Austin and, uh, Billy and Chelsea.\tSo that was good. Yeah. Few days, huh? So what you um, lost track of time. You\u2019ve been gone a hell of a lot longer than that. Yeah. Well, I. Went out the grid for a while. I just needed some, uh, time to myself to kind of, you know, get it together before I came back home without Kate. Yeah, I get that.\tA few things I need to tell you. First of all, Steven, I, we found Megan Hathaway. Did you kill her? No. No, but she\u2019s in custody. She\u2019s paying for what she did. Not enough. Roman, there\u2019s something else that you need to know, and this is, this is kind of complicated, John. I thought I heard somebody.\tSure. You don\u2019t want something to eat? No, I, I wanna get. As soon as I get this list of Victor\u2019s properties in order so that we don\u2019t keep doubling back. Some of these places are up in the mountains. This could take forever.\tOh God. Jen, how can this be happening? Hey, listen. Look at me. Your parents are fine. I\u2019m sure of it. How can you be? How can I be? Well, cuz what we\u2019re talking about, Steven, Kayla. The meanest sons of bitches in the valley.\tMaybe that\u2019s Andrew.\tYou found them? We found where they were being held. Steph, when we stormed in to try to rescue them, there was resistance. Resistance. The people who were holding them were armed and they fought back. Steph, they were caught in a crossfire. Both of them. I\u2019m sorry. They died. No, no, no. What, what? What was a nightmare?\tHe said they were dead. Who? No, nobody\u2019s. Nobody\u2019s dead. They\u2019re not dead. They\u2019re okay.\tIt\u2019s best for both of us. If you think about. For hope too. She started a whole new life. She\u2019s moved on with you and you guys, you, you have a good thing going. Why break her heart again? So she\u2019s all yours. You get the girl, I get my new life without her win-win as long as you keep this little conversation of ours.\tBetween us, so I\u2019m, we\u2019re supposed to pretend I never saw you deceive hope and let her believe that her husband\u2019s dead. Yeah. But the way I see it, you\u2019re not really deceiving her from my point of view. That husband is dead.\tYeah. I started on the list. I, I went to Victor Kiki\u2019s, uh, childhood Home. Oh funny. Paris, did you find anything? No, uh, nothing at all. It was, uh, place was deserted.\tHi, did I?\tHow can you tell the days are just running into each other? Oh, it won\u2019t be much longer. Now why do he say that? Well pause. Bringing to that lab equipment, right? So you can make that serum he\u2019s so obsessed with, which would be a nightmare. You don\u2019t have to worry about that because when we get that equipment, it\u2019ll be a game changer.\tHow so? Because we\u2019ll be able to arm ourselves. There\u2019ll be chemicals, some metal instruments. Steve Bo has a gun. Yes. Well, listen, I\u2019ll draw his fire white. No, no, no, no. I am not gonna hurt him. He\u2019s my brother. I\u2019m not gonna hurt him. Just disarm him. We\u2019ll get the hell outta here and then we\u2019ll get Beau the help he needs.\tFries and shine. Oh, only one ball this time, huh? Yeah. Didn\u2019t wanna be wearing your meal again. So thanks to you. You have cold leftover fish stoop. Come on, Kate. Get up. We\u2019re leaving.\t"], "answer": [4, 3, 1, 0, 2]}

She\u2019s hurt a lot of people. But unlike you, I believe people can change, people can grow, people can transform and I think diane has changed. And I think she is incapable of murder.

You know, if you wanna pretend like what happened here between the two of us, it didn\u2019t happen, then I\u2019d understand.\t[ Pours drink ]\tBilly: Here you go. Cheers to you because you\u2019ve been burning the candle on both ends.\tKyle: Yeah. I\u2019m doing everything I can to help my parents. I\u2019m fielding media requests and whatever else I can do to help my dad free up his time because he needs to be spending it proving my mother\u2019s innocence.\tBilly: Have you talked to her lately?\tKyle: Briefly. At the arraignment. Dad went to visit her this afternoon. She told him not to come back. She doesn\u2019t want us to visit her, supposedly for her own good.\tBilly: I\u2019m sorry, man. That\u2019s tough.\tKyle: I\u2019m hoping she\u2019ll change her mind. She needs to know we\u2019re in this together, doing everything we can to get her out of there.\tBilly: Look, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re supporting her and of course, you would and jack for that matter, but you cannot neglect your own life in the process. You know, you\u2019re telling me that this situation is affecting your marriage. Take it from the king of failed relationships, you\u2019ve got to fix that problem before it\u2019s too late. You cannot lose summer.\tJack: Maybe this is not a good day to take jabs at diane. I thought on maybe some basic human level, you might actually sympathize with her plight.\tAshley: Why would I?\tJack: She\u2019s being locked up for a crime she didn\u2019t commit. That doesn\u2019t resonate with you? At least you know what it feels like to be wrongly accused.\tAshley: Oh, I do, indeed, because of diane. And just for the record, I think she\u2019s rightfully accused.\tJack: Wow. You take some pleasure in saying that, don\u2019t you? Like you won something. You are wrong. She is innocent and she is suffering and because she has been denied bail, she refuses to even see me.\tAshley: Okay, well that\u2019s the wisest decision she\u2019s ever made. Listen to her and move on, please.\tJack: Even if you actually believe diane was guilty of murder, the level of spite in this conversation is outrageous. She was framed, ash.\tAshley: You keep saying that. But the way I see it, she had every reason to want phyllis out of the picture so she could have everything. So she could have the loving relationship, the job at marchetti, the home in the abbott mansion and your ring on her finger.\tWhat are folks 60 and older\tup to these days?\tTucker: I have no reservations about selling my company. I\u2019m done with this town and I\u2019m done with mccall unlimited. It used to be my passion, now it\u2019s just a burden I no longer wish to carry.\tVictor: Oh, my god. How touching, tucker. You expecting my sympathy or what?\tTucker: I think I know you a little better than that.\tVictor: All right. If it makes you feel better, I just want you to know that your company will continue to thrive, you know. Although, I may change its name.\tTucker: I couldn\u2019t care less what you call it. I just\u2013 I\u2019m looking forward to it not being my problem anymore.\tVictor: Well, then why don\u2019t you put that pen to paper.\tTucker: Just for due diligence, I would like to look it over one last time.\t[ Victor laughing ]\tVictor: Do I need to remind you that you are the one who came running to me?\tTucker: Mm. I know that. And I\u2019m gonna sign it soon. You have my word.\tVictor: Well, in that case, I\u2019m looking forward to the confirmation of your signature.\t[ Both sighing ]\tKyle: Summer moved into a guest room.\tBilly: Uh-oh. Separate rooms is the first step towards separate lives. Are you two fighting?\tKyle: That\u2019s the thing. We\u2019d almost be better if we were. She\u2019s just completely shut down. She said she\u2019s moved rooms because she didn\u2019t want to wake me with her tossing and turning. But I think she can\u2019t bear to look at me. She\u2019s convinced my mother killed hers.\tBilly: That\u2019s a relationship dilemma I\u2019ve never dealt with.\tKyle: Yeah. And the only solution I see is to clear my mother\u2019s name, not only for her innocence but for my marriage. Summer is so inside her head right now.\tBilly: What do you mean by that?\tKyle: She only comes out of her room when she wants to spend time with harrison. And when she does, she puts on a good front, laughing and smiling and reading stories. But once she\u2019s alone again, she completely shuts down.\tBilly: Sounds like she\u2019s dealing with grief in her own way.\t", "Daniel: That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do.\tKyle: Billy, you\u2019re not listening. I have tried every approach. She doesn\u2019t wanna be around me. She doesn\u2019t wanna look at me or be in the same room as me, so pushing her isn\u2019t going to work.\tBilly: Kyle, you\u2019re a good person, okay? Of course, you\u2019re gonna respect her time and her space, but you take that too far, those wounds, they become scar tissue. The distance becomes a chasm. Trust me, it\u2019s really difficult to get back to where you were.\tKyle: What are you suggesting?\tBilly: You gotta get her to listen. You go home. You make sure she knows how much you love her. You don\u2019t mention diane, you don\u2019t mention phyllis, you don\u2019t mention any of the noise that\u2019s swirling around you. You reassure her that you are not going anywhere. And when she\u2019s ready to open up that door to you, you are standing there waiting with open arms.\tAudra: Drinking alone?\tTucker: No, I\u2019m here with all my friends.\tAudra: [ Chuckles ] Well, that\u2019s what happens when a guy burns every bridge.\tTucker: Hmm. Did you drop by just to rub it in?\tAudra: Not necessarily. So, what are we, uh, drinking and thinking about?\tTucker: That\u2019s funny you should ask. I was just thinking about the difference between being alone and being lonely. You know, I spent months in that ashram alone.\t[ Laughs ] I never felt as lonely as I do right now.\tAudra: Hmm. Look, I\u2013 I know I gave you a hard time about ashley, but I\u2019m sorry it didn\u2019t work out.\tTucker: I have no idea how I got here. Sure has been a long and winding road though. You know when I never felt lonely when I was young, just starting out in the music business.\tAudra: Yeah. I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m sure a young tucker mccall was really alone.\tTucker: No, but it was all exciting, being around engaging, interesting people and managing bands, signing new artists.\tAudra: All right. All right.\t[ Chuckles ] Those glasses are pretty damn rosy. What you loved was signing artists to contracts they didn\u2019t understand so they could make hits for you without getting properly compensated.\tTucker: Yeah. The good old days.\tAudra: Okay.\tTucker: You and I had some good times, didn\u2019t we?\tAudra: We had our moments.\tTucker: Hey, I\u2019m gonna go back up to my room. Would you join me?

Just grabbing some takeout.\tLily: Yeah. Yeah, we\u2019re gonna eat as well.\tBilly: How you holding up?\tDaniel: As good as I can be, I suppose.\tBilly: Yeah. I thought I should let you know that the media scrutiny around diane\u2019s case is only growing, especially now that leanna love\u2019s article published today. I really hope you don\u2019t have to deal with any of that garbage, but you might.\tDaniel: Mm. Thanks for the heads up.\tLily: We\u2019ll get the pr team to draft a statement.\tDaniel: I appreciate it, but that\u2019s not necessary.\tLily: No, I know, but you\u2019re an employee now now at chancellor-winters, so just direct any questions to us.\tDaniel: I can handle it.\tLily: I know. Just let me do this for you.\t[ Chuckles ]\tDaniel: She\u2019s hard to say no to.\tBilly: Really? I hadn\u2019t noticed. You\u2019re in good hands. Lily knows how to take care of people.

This could be very rewarding for you.\tTucker: Hey, but you wanna know the best part? Check this out. It\u2019s victor\u2019s pen. I stole it from him.\tAudra: This is a big change. No wonder you were ruminating on your start in the music business. It\u2019s the foundation of your empire.\tTucker: It was the foundation.\tAudra: You said you wanted to be free, right? There\u2019s your ticket.\tTucker: It wasn\u2019t supposed to end this way, audra.\t", "Audra: Okay.

I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t approach him then.\tBilly: You know, I picked up on a little something between the two of them.\tChelsea: Really?\tBilly: Mm.\tChelsea: Something romantic? How do you feel about that?\tJack: You won\u2019t allow me to marry the woman I love. That is ridiculous. My relationship with diane has nothing to do with you, and it will hardly bring down the family name.\tAshley: You know you had a problem with me going on a date with tucker, but it\u2019s okay for you to marry a murderer.\tJack: Okay. I\u2019ve had enough of that conversation. Diane didn\u2019t kill anyone.\tAshley: You don\u2019t know that for a fact! And what about the fallout? What about when word gets out that you\u2019re marrying a woman that\u2019s going on trial for murder? You don\u2019t think people are gonna be affected by that one, jack? People like summer, like daniel. You don\u2019t think jabot\u2019s reputation is gonna take a huge hit trying to survive that?\tJack: I\u2019m doing everything I can to exonerate diane before this ever goes to trial.\tAshley: Well, good luck. Let\u2019s just push the physical evidence aside. What about the\u2013 the\u2013 the history diane has with phyllis, the hatred that goes back decades. She faked her death. Remember that? Diane faked her death. Let innocent people be arrested for it. When the word gets out about that, people are gonna understand that she\u2019s absolutely capable of killing phyllis.

Don\u2019t fight it, grandson. It\u2019d be a losing battle. Okay. I\u2019m let, let\u2019s do it. Okay. Thank you.\tI\u2019ll be right back. Hey, hey, hey. Hey. Wow, you just got here in time. I was about to break out the chocolate truffles to cheer up your grandma. Hmm. But you are the perfect bomb. Oh, I don\u2019t know. She loves her truffles. So, uh, why didn\u2019t you tell us that you were coming? I wanted it to be a surprise. Ray and I, we\u2019ve been in constant contact about a, but it\u2019s, it\u2019s just hard with me not being here.\tSo I had a couple days off, so I figured I\u2019d show up and see what I can do to help. Well, you\u2019ve helped already just by being here. Oh yeah, darling. Ooh, thanks. Thank you, grandma. You\u2019re welcome. So where are my beautiful, great-grandchildren? Uh, they\u2019re with my mom in DC but I, I promise next time I\u2019ll bring \u2019em with me.\tIt won\u2019t be months and months from now, I hope. No, no, no, no. I\u2019ll bring it back soon. Hopefully Abe will be here as well. Yeah, well, we\u2019re all praying for that, but, but unless, unless you\u2019ve heard something from Ray or, or somebody, the, the police don\u2019t have any leads. No, no news, unfortunately. But I did hear that they ruled out Colin Bedford as a suspect.\tYeah. Well we heard that. Abraham is such a good and decent man. You know, he does not have an enemy in the world, and for him to be kidnapped, actually, he still hadn\u2019t recovered completely from that last assault. Why? Oh, why Lord? Who in the world would do this to him? Well, what do you mean, Abe? What? What would I have to tell you?\tWell, I was sitting here watching. Body and soul and Cassandra and Rhett were celebrating their second anniversary, their second anniversary of their fourth wedding. That is, And all of a sudden came back to me. What did Paul, today is our wedding anniversary, isn\u2019t it,\tbaby? I wish I could say happy anniversary and happy Juneteenth too. But I know this is a tough time for you, so I\u2019m just gonna say I love you and I\u2019m here for you. Bless your heart. That means so much to me. But mama, why\u2019d you call and tell me you were coming because I wasn\u2019t gonna let you talk me out of it.\tBesides, I had to see with my own two eyes that my baby was okay, well, she\u2019s a lot better. Not a choice.\tI had these fires printed. I wanted to do something to help find your stepfather. Yeah. Well, Abe is the mayor, so everyone pretty much already knows he\u2019s missing. So all of this is just performative. Chanel, wait, look, I know I should have said this yesterday at the hospital, but thank you for what? Calling the cops and saving me from Colin.\tAnd I\u2019m sorry about all the terrible things I said about you. Why did you say them? Because Colin was listening to every word I was saying. He had a gun. I had to say whatever I had to to save your life. And yours. Look Chanel, I didn\u2019t want you to get hurt. More than I already hurt you.\tYeah, I wish I would\u2019ve known you were coming. I would\u2019ve asked EJ to send that yet. Uh, no. It\u2019s, it\u2019s cool. I actually bought a ticket months ago. My dad is supposed to give this big speech for the Juneteenth celebration and, um, my wanted to surprise him. Right. Well look man, it\u2019s really good to see you.\t", "You went along with his plan to destroy our lives. Look, I know it doesn\u2019t make sense and it doesn\u2019t even make sense to me. Okay. But I\u2019m working through it. I went to go see Dr. Evans and she made me realize that. I was in an abusive relationship. Colin abused you? Yeah, emotionally. I mean, he never hit me or anything, but he had this power over me that I can\u2019t even explain.\tAnd I know it sounds crazy to somebody as strong as you. Not crazy really. When I was with Colin\u2019s father, he was my professor and well, He had all the power in our relationship, and even though it was totally consensual, there was just something that made me feel like I had no choice but to be with him.\tIt\u2019s always easy to see looking back at it, right? And I know that my situation is way different from yours, and I\u2019m not trying to make any excuses for what I did at all. But you and your mom were so good to me, and a part of me felt like I needed to stop Collin\u2019s plan right then, but, but you didn\u2019t. But I didn\u2019t know how Chanel, when he asked me to seduce you and then break your heart, look, I didn\u2019t think that it would happen.\tOkay. I didn\u2019t think that you would feel for me, cuz I knew I wouldn\u2019t feel for you. I never even thought about being with a woman before Chanel, but when we got close I did feel something.\tYou want me to believe you had real feelings for me? Is that what you\u2019re saying? Look, look, no, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying. Chanel, I, I just knew that I didn\u2019t expect to feel so connected to you. Okay. After that, I knew I had to stop lying and I just had to tell you the truth. Yeah. Or are you sure you weren\u2019t just trying to get out of sleeping with me?\tI don\u2019t think so. Look, before I left Colin that day, I made him promise me not to hurt you or your mom. Yeah. I guess he wasn\u2019t keeping that promise. No. Unfortunately not. Look, when I saw him on top of that roof pointing that gun at you, I knew I couldn\u2019t let him. Everything after that, I don\u2019t know it. It was a blur on instinct.\tI lunged at him, and before you know it, I was falling off the side of the roof. You saved my life and you almost lost yours in the process. Look, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t take credit for that. Okay. Cuz I know that I could have stopped it way earlier. Okay. But you did stop it and could have been worse. A hell of a lot worse.\tHe was gonna kill me and then he was gonna kill my mom next. So I owe you a thank you.\tWhy would you want the gory details of our wedding day? Why were they gory? I mean, weren\u2019t they happy memories? Oh, yes, yes, of course. I mean, well, the wedding part was amazing. It was perfect. But right after we said I do, our daughter confessed to murder. What? Chanel killed somebody. Oh, no, no. Chanel\u2019s my daughter.\tWith my ex. I\u2019m talking about our daughter Lonnie.\tWhy am I just hearing about this? I haven\u2019t wanted to overwhelm you with details since When is having a daughter a detail, Helena, why is this the first time I\u2019m hearing about her daughter and, and why haven\u2019t I seen Lonnie? Well, because she\u2019s in prison. In prison. I\u2019m sorry, I just didn\u2019t wanna spring all of this on you at once.\tWell, do I have any other children I don\u2019t know about. Yes, actually. You have a son.\tAll right. So, uh, what do you, uh, do you need some help writing your speech? No, I, I have the speech my dad wrote, but there\u2019s another way that you could help me. Okay. Whatever you need. So, um, back in the day, my speech therapist used to have me line up all of my stuffed animals and just practice having conversations with them.\tOkay. So you will, I can go back and get some of Thomas and Charlotte\u2019s stuffies for you. No, I I, I\u2019m kidding. I\u2019m kidding. I\u2019m kidding. You want me to be your audience? Yeah. If, if you wouldn\u2019t mind, fine. I would be honored. Okay,\tyou grab this.\tGood afternoon. I\u2019m Mayor Abe Carver. No, I\u2019m a mayor. Hip Carter\u2019s son, Theo. I know. He wishes you were here today. But I wanna start by talking about what brings us together on this special day\ton June 19th, 1865, where it finally reached Galveston, Texas, that the Civil War had ended two months earlier, or importantly, it was a day that the last enslaved people in the United States learned that they were free. That next year, the first Juneteenth celebration was held in Texas. But soon as the families moved elsewhere, they took that tradition with them,\tuh, Juneteenth spread all across the country. And finally, last year, Juneteenth became a federal holiday. This day has been known in various parts as Jubilee Day. Emancipation Day and even Black Independence Day. It\u2019s also the day that I, um, no, it\u2019s also the day that my dad calls his anniversary. And today as every day, we celebrate with a mixture of joy, for freedom, sadness, for our years of hardship, and for those still struggling.\t", "I know for a better, brighter future.\tAnd darling, you gotta have faith. Faith in the good Lord. I do have faith Mama. In both the good Lord and in Abraham. Well, you hold on tight to that faith. Okay?\tAnd honey, I know this is supposed to be a day of celebration, but as I recall, your wedding day was not exactly a day of sunshine and roses. No. No it wasn\u2019t. It was the best day of my life and it turned into one of the worst when Lonnie got arrested. And what does that tell you? That today isn\u2019t just about celebration.\tIt\u2019s about taking the good with the bad, looking to the future, and holding onto that faith. You must never stop believing that a will come back to you. You hear me? I hear you.\tPlease, no need to thank me. I\u2019m just really happy that you\u2019re okay.\tWell, um, I should go. I made teacakes for my mom\u2019s anniversary. Oh, wow. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll love them. I used your recipe. So does that mean the bakery\u2019s back open? No. No. Um, but I\u2019m working on it. I\u2019m, I\u2019m sorry. Yeah. Well, for what it\u2019s worth, I hope Abe\u2019s found soon, and I know you don\u2019t think it\u2019ll do anything, but I\u2019m gonna continue to knock on some doors and I\u2019m gonna hang up some flyers.\tOh yeah. Look, I\u2019m not gonna give up. Okay. Chanel,\toh my stars. Look at the time I promised Thomas and Charlotte I was gonna take them to the park to meet Chad for the Juneteenth celebration. I\u2019d like to go with you, sweetheart, but I\u2019m still feeling a little wiped out. My darling here went 10 rounds with the flu last week, and one as always. Yeah. See, thank God.\tWould you like to come with me to the park? Yeah, absolutely. Maybe Paulino will be there too. Yeah. You know, Abraham was supposed to give the speech today, wonder who\u2019s gonna take his place as if anybody could\tto quote President Obama. Juneteenth has never been a celebration of victory or an acceptance of the way things are. It\u2019s a celebration of progress. It\u2019s an affirmation that despite the most painful parts of our history, change is possible and there\u2019s still so much work to do.\tOn behalf of my dad, we thank you. Happy Juneteenth. Happy anniversary that\tit\u2019s perfect. You\u2019re gonna the park.\tI\u2019m ready.\tMama, aren\u2019t you supposed to? Big mama. Hi. Hey. Hi. I am so happy you\u2019re here. So good to see you. It\u2019s good to see you too. We have missed you so much. Well that\u2019s good because I missed you too and I know it means a lot to mama that you\u2019re here. So please tell me that you\u2019re staying for a long time. Just a few days.\tOh, well, we\u2019ll have to see if we can talk again into staying longer, a lot longer. We will definitely work on that. And aren\u2019t you supposed to be at the Juneteenth celebration? I was gonna bring some teacakes by afterward, sweetheart. My heart is just not in it today. Not without Abraham. What\u2019s my son\u2019s name?\tHis name is Theo. Theo. Why haven\u2019t I seen him? Well, um, he lives out of the country, uh, South Africa actually. Oh, he, he is even calling me. Does he know I\u2019m injured? Does he, I mean, I would at least,\twhat, what, what is it? I think, uh,\tI think I\u2019m close to a memory. Well, don\u2019t push it, baby. You don\u2019t wanna upset yourself and delay your recovery. Um, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll get that you just rest.\tHello, may I help you?\tHi, I, I\u2019m so sorry to bother you, but I\u2019m, you know what? I don\u2019t want my cat to come out, so let me come outside with you here in the hallway there. That\u2019s better. How can I help you? Um, I\u2019m trying to find a missing person. So what, you just canvassed the whole neighborhood? No, actually, my sister\u2019s a cop and she scrubbed on this address when she was following up on leads.\tSo I thought I\u2019d start here first. Huh,\tmama. I know it\u2019ll be tough for you, but. You should probably get out so that you can not stay here staring at us in these four walls all day. You know she\u2019s right, Paulina. I know, but sitting here is staring at my sweet mom and my daughter and these four walls. That\u2019s all I\u2019m feeling up to today.\tI get that. Okay.\tJulie. Hi. Hi. Chanel. Oh, oh, oh, my Miss Olivia. Oh, what, what a beautiful surprise. So good to see you. So good to see you too, Julie. Thank you. Well, I, I, I know I\u2019m interrupting a lovely family gathering, but. Colleena. I wanted you to know we missed you at the park. I know I wanted to be there, but, oh, I understand.\tI do understand. So, I brought something back for you from the park, Julie, now come on.

My passion is in music, or do you not remember telling me as a kid not to follow in my dear old dad\u2019s footsteps when he was singing as eddie maine? You know, it\u2019s a good thing I didn\u2019t take your advice, because not only have i reclaimed the rights to my songs, but all these opportunities are opening up for me now, you know, to produce music and\u2013and rep musicians.\tUh-huh. Well, you can write all the songs you want after you do this for me.\tWhat part of \u201cI quit\u201d is unclear to you?\tUn-quit. Tell maxie that you, uh\u2013 you miss working with her. Make nice to sasha. And, god forbid, flatter lucy coe. Tell her you wanna learn from her.\tThis doesn\u2019t make any sense. Why do you care if I work at a cosmetics company? What are you really after, huh?\t[Suspenseful music]\tI want you to be a standout employee. I want you to make yourself indispensable.\tI always try and do that.\tAnd while you\u2019re at it, keep your eyes open. I want you to find out what\u2019s happening at research and development.\tResearch and development?\tI don\u2019t wanna know what the next hot thing for summer is. I don\u2019t wanna know what\u2019s gonna sell in the fall. I wanna know what\u2019s down the pipeline.\tI don\u2019t get it. [Laughing] You don\u2019t care about elq, and all of a sudden, you\u2019re all into the cosmetics biz?\tLet\u2019s just say I\u2019m curious. From time to time, I will check in with you, and you\u2019ll tell me what the next big thing is. You can do that for me, can\u2019t you, after what I did for chase? Does that sound like a fair deal to you?\tWhat it sounds like is corporate espionage. Are you asking me to be your personal spy?\tSure, I made my share of mistakes, but stealing expensive jewelry isn\u2019t one of them.\tThat\u2019s good.\t[Chuckles] It\u2019s also good to have you back where you belong.\tWell, I didn\u2019t do it on my own. I had help.\tRight. Right, so you and brook lynn\u2013\tyou know, if you would have asked me before the nurses\u2019 ball, I would have said no way.\tUh-huh. But then she did that thing where she stood up to her dirtbag ex-manager?\tSaved me the trouble from smacking the guy again, not that I would have.\tNo, no. You\u2019d never. Never.\tIt\u2019s like you said with cody. Sometimes a person does the wrong thing for the right reason.\t\u2013 You vouch for me, the other players will come around.\tWhat keeps the poker games running smoothly and profitably is avoiding the curious eyes of authorities. And yet you expect me to allow a common jewel thief to sit down at the table? How could I explain that to my guests? How could I retain their trust?\t", "You can tell them the truth.\tAnd what is that?\tThat I\u2019m not a thief. I was framed.\tI\u2019m sorry, maxie, but I can\u2019t let you use my daughter-in-law to sell some newfangled beauty product, not when her mental health is at stake.\tGladys, thank you for standing up for me, but I know that maxie only means well.\tWell, maybe if it was a different show or at a different studio, but to go back to the same place where you had your breakdown? I won\u2019t agree to that.\tYou\u2019re actually kind of proving my point, gladys. It is sasha\u2019s well-being that I\u2019m thinking about, and she needs to face her fears by doing the same show.\tOh, and what if she\u2019s not ready?\tIsn\u2019t that for sasha to decide?\tMaxie, are you sure there is no one else to make this presentation?\tYou and I are the only ones that have been following the deceptor since its planning stages. Nobody knows how to sell it like we do. I wish I were up to the challenge, but my sinuses are holding me back. But you\u2019re up for it. I know you are.\tMaybe you\u2019re right. Maybe the only way to conquer my fear is to face it.\tYou asked if it\u2019s up to sasha to decide. Legally, it is up to me, and I won\u2019t let her do it.\t[Suspenseful music]\tAre you sure that you don\u2019t need to see a doctor or\u2013\tno, it\u2019s just cuts and bruises. Really should have seen the other guy.\t[Laughs] I wasn\u2019t only afraid for trina. If anything had happened to you\u2026\tportia.\tI don\u2019t know\u2013\tit\u2019s over.\tIs it, curtis?\tHi, it\u2019s laura. Listen, we\u2019re all here at the hospital. I think you\u2019d really wanna be here.\tI promise you, little brother, this exam is not going to hurt.\tHey.\tHey.\tHow\u2019s he doing?\tHe\u2019s good. I was just telling them that when you used to take me to the doctor\u2026 [Laughs] You told me that if I was good, then I would get a lollipop. And I don\u2019t know, I still wish that things were that simple.\tYeah, they\u2019re not that simple because things change, but some things never do.\tOkay, so it\u2019s just the two of us. You need to tell me something about this spencer boy?\tNo, no, no. This isn\u2019t\u2013 this isn\u2019t about spencer. This is about you and me. And I wanted to tell you first what I\u2019ve decided because it could impact you more than anyone else.\tOkay. So what are you deciding?\tI changed my mind. I wanna take the dna test and learn the truth.\t[Suspenseful music]\tI wanna be absolutely clear. No matter what that test results say, you\u2019re always gonna be my dad.\tLike I\u2019d ever let you forget that.\tDad, I\u2019m serious.\tYeah, I know. I know. I just was\u2013 just trying to make it easier for you. Um\u2026\t[Sighs] But can I ask you why you changed your mind? [Sighs heavily] Because of the last few days and everything I\u2019ve been through. When things were at their worst, I saw how spencer loved his little brother, and it reminded me that there\u2019s nothing more important than family. And that\u2019s when I made the decision that if I made it through, that I wasn\u2019t gonna let secrets come between me and my family ever again.\tLike your mom did.\t20 years ago, my mom swept things under the rug because she was afraid to face the truth. And one day, in the future, hopefully, I\u2019ll forgive her. But I\u2019m not repeating her mistake. We all need answers, and I\u2019m the only one that can get them.\tWhen you walked through the door, my heart, it just\u2013 it skipped a beat because I wasn\u2019t sure\u2026\t"], "answer": [1, 0, 3, 4, 2]}

Well then I\u2019ll just have to fly to Greece and make sure that doesn\u2019t happen.\tYou still here? Huh? I told my mom what you said. Fortunately, we\u2019re already in the process of my father to a long-term care facility where he can continue his recovery. It seems like progress is a little slow. Yeah, well, we were trying to move him to Montreal so he could be near my mom\u2019s home, but obviously that\u2019s the first place that Megan\u2019s gonna look.\tSo we need to find someplace else, someplace that\u2019s secure, someplace where nobody\u2019s gonna be able to track him down. You know, like know Megan or, or Dimitri or Wolf, a roof, or even you\twork for you. Are you serious? Of course I am. Have you forgotten us? I\u2019m co-owner at The Spectator now. I mean, you don\u2019t have to go on step back so that Gwen could run the day-to-day operations, but I have an ownership stake with the power to fire and hire. Okay. Well, I\u2019m not qualified to do anything at the newspaper.\tAs long as you could do for us, we could use you in advertising, in marketing. You\u2019d be an amazing arts editor. You\u2019re already a, an expert in in music and fashion. You\u2019d be perfect. Oh, okay. Slow down. You don\u2019t know that I can do any of those things and you don\u2019t even know if I can write. Of course I do. I saw the letter that you wrote to Landlord about the rent increase and it was masterful and effective.\tSo that hardly qualifies me to write for the Spectator. If Leo Stark can do it, why can\u2019t you or anyone else for that matter. Good point. But uh, should I accept, which you absolutely should. For us living and working together. Isn\u2019t that a bit much? Oh, well, no. I mean, we can handle it, right? It\u2019s not like we\u2019re sleeping together.\tDid Xander sleep with you? When he was working for you? I don\u2019t think so. So why don\u2019t you just shut your mouth about the subject. Okay. Oh, I\u2019m sorry, Brady. I know this must be painful for you. Of course you do. That\u2019s why you said it. I said it because you need a dose of reality. You and Chloe have been on again, off again for what, 20 years?\tAnd it never lasts. It never will. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It\u2019s kinda like the toxic relationship that I\u2019ve been in with you in and out and in and out. But you know, fortunately it\u2019s been more out than in, you know, it\u2019s actually, it\u2019s been a nightmare. If you want to really think about Chris, please, please.\tThat is not true. We have had some good times, Brady, and unlike Chloe, you and I share a daughter. We do share a daughter, and sometimes I wish we didn\u2019t. And sometimes I wish that you would just say the hell out of my daughter\u2019s life. Your daughter. Your daughter. How dare you call her your daughter. She is as much mind as she is yours.\tAnd that\u2019s a shame. It is a shame because that little girl has no idea how bad you are for her, how bad you are for all of us. If you think you\u2019re gonna stay here and put Marlena through hell again, think again. It\u2019s not gonna happen. She\u2019s not gonna put up with your crap anymore. Wow. You\u2019re blaming this all on Marlena.\tTo get me out. I mean, what I\u2019m guessing you can\u2019t do it yourself, can you? And guess what, Brady, that is why I know you\u2019re gonna come around again, because you always do.\tYou, uh, Mr. Scott, be my guest. Ugh, you know what? I might just go ahead and, uh, get as a housekeeper pronto rather than do a crappy job. Well before you do that, uh, I have, I have a question for you about the job at The Spectator, and it\u2019s kind of a personal one. Okay. Well, I was wondering if Gwen is running the day-to-day operations, doesn\u2019t she get a say on new hires?\tI mean, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s not happy that we\u2019re living together and. She probably hates me. I\u2019ll handle Gwen. Well, what if you can\u2019t handle her? I just left a really toxic work environment and I can\u2019t deal with anything like that Again. She won\u2019t be a problem, I promise. All you have to focus on is all the lovely dinners and concerts that you\u2019re gonna be enjoying at the spectators expense.\tI mean, You\u2019ll be able to make your own hours 99% of the time and work from home and be your own boss. Wow, that sounds too good to be true. Let me prove to you that it isn\u2019t right. You go get changed. I\u2019ll hang the rest of these up and then I\u2019ll give you a tour around the office. What\u2019d you say? Okay,\tsureand. Thank you.\tYou kidding me? You don\u2019t think I have it in me to kick your ass outta here. Tell you what. I\u2019ll do that and then I\u2019ll ring your neck as an Encore Brady. You can\u2019t keep me away from my daughter. See, that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. See, I have full custody, don\u2019t I? My little girl took a ride share all by herself to come visit me in Statesville.\tWhat do you think she\u2019s gonna do when she finds out I\u2019m back in Salem? You can\u2019t keep us apart, Brady. She\u2019s gonna hate you just as much as she hates me. No, not if I make her understand that her mother is a mentally disturbed, destructive person who needs therapy and just refuses to get it. Damn you, Brady.\tI don\u2019t want you near her. You may be her biological mother, but you forfeited all of your parental rights when you became this evil conniving person. You know what? I\u2019d be considered an abusive father if I let her around you for a minute right now, and I will see you back in court to revisit our custody arrangement.\t", "Thank God, uh, about that. Um, she\u2019s been sprung from prison. That is as has Auntie Kristen, who you mean you. Yeah. We got a very good deal for the three of us, although it did get a little risky adding Kristen to the mix. Then why would you do it? Why would you risk your deal for, for somebody like Kristen?\tMy, my mine? Not a very nice way to talk about your own sister. Who I happen to think\u2019s a lovely woman. Talk about smart and brave shut. Oh, you don\u2019t even know Kristen. You, the, the only thing you know about her is your fight with a, with a manie peacock. Yeah. Actually I do know her relatively well. That is, you see, my mother befriended her in Statesville.\tI had the means to help and so I did. And now the two of us can head back to Salem and we can all be one big happy family. What do you say? Well, I must say you are looking rather refreshed considering you were re. Leah Garner. Oh, did Megan give you a dose of her fountain of use serum that she was telling me about?\tUh, maybe it\u2019s just Botox.\tWhat do you want? What do I want? Well, I came to tell Grandma Marmar that she was no longer the chief. Maternal figure in my daughter\u2019s life. You see, mommy\u2019s home to stay. This is not your home. Yes, but it is Rachel\u2019s Brady. Surprise\tthere, huh? Alright, I, I can take it from here now that I\u2019ve done all the work, well, not quite all. See that\u2019s perfect. According to the king of due deaths, what are you doing? I\u2019m gonna hang this other picture. You can clean up. I know. I mean now that you show me the correct technique, I\u2019ll finish up and you can just clean.\tWhy? Because I\u2019m supposed to stick to the woman\u2019s work. No, that\u2019s not, that\u2019s not what I meant. I mean, it\u2019s, all I meant was, you know, you are a better, cleaner upper than I am, so, That might be even worse. You, you know what? Just forget it. I will clean up. I a better cleaner uper than you are after spending years in foster care and then living in an orphanage, I learned very quickly how to make places sp and span.\tSo honestly, I guess I just have a little bit of p t s when it comes to cleaning. Oh, well, you know, after my stint schlepping manure for my uncle, I can, I can totally relate to that. But look, forget about it. I\u2019ll just clean up after I finish hanging everything. No, it, it\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll do it. I promise to do the housework until I found gainful employment.\tSo just let me do it. And for the record, I don\u2019t usually lounge around all morning in my pajamas.\tXander, I I\u2019m sure you thought I would have a job by now and be able to pay my own way. I, I mean, I certainly did, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair that you pay the rent all on your own. So I\u2019m, I\u2019m just starting to think that maybe this was a mistake, me moving in here with you.\tBrady, I\u2019m, I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t have time to warn you, but apparently Kristen was able to cut a deal. Yeah, I, I heard on the news, I figured she\u2019d be here. Wow. And you came looking for me. How sweet. I came here to Warren, Marlene, and my father that you\u2019d be coming. I guess you\u2019d beat me to the punch, didn\u2019t you?\tWell, I was eager to see my daughter. Well, your daughters in pe, which you would be aware of. If you had any involvement in the day-to-day life of your daughter? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s been what? Maybe a, a couple months, maybe a year since you had Oh, and, and, and, and whose fault is that? Okay. Okay. That\u2019s enough.\tYou do, look, Kristen came to see her daughter. She\u2019s not here. So you\u2019re welcome to go now. I\u2019m not leaving until I know when I get to see my daughter. Damnit Brady, we had a deal. You, you told me to write that letter urging Rachel to give Chloe a chance and I did. As much as it did it, it made my skin crawl.\tI wrote that. I know you wrote the letter, Kristin. The problem was your daughter didn\u2019t believe a word of it because you\u2019ve been poisoning her mind with lies about Chloe for months now get the word lies. Oh my God. Oh, case in point, I knew that Chloe was going to leave you for the next red blooded male who came along and look what happened.\tShe\u2019s already moved in with Xander. Oh, how\u2019d you find out about that? Rachel wrote me a letter. She wrote you a letter about Chloe\u2019s love life. Oh, all sorts of Salem happenings. I think her and Sandra make a great couple, don\u2019t you? I mean, they both have no substance, no morals, and are utterly detestable to boot.\tI don\u2019t think you\u2019re in a position to lecture anybody about morals. Says the woman who has been possessed by the devil twice. Xander and Chloe are not together. Kristen, they are roommates. Okay. Oh, just roommates. Mm-hmm. And how long do you think that\u2019s gonna last? Xandra will get any woman he knows into bed sooner or later, usually sooner.\tEven the ones that claim they hate him\twrong. Chloe, is it the apartment a decor or is it the roommate you\u2019ve gone off of? No, it\u2019s not any of those things. It\u2019s me. It\u2019s not the apartment, it\u2019s me. That\u2019s anyone. No, what I\u2019m saying is I guess I just wasn\u2019t being very realistic about my prospects on the labor market. Look, it\u2019s just, I guess there are plenty of jobs out there.\tYou wanna flip burgers or drive a ride share, but it turns out there\u2019s not a lot of job opportunities for opera singers in Salem. No surprise or fashion merchandisers for that fact outside of Dara C Couldn\u2019t you like give voice lessons? Voice lessons here with the paper thin walls, like you said? Look, I guess I just, I had this idea that I was gonna reinvent myself and try something new, but no one\u2019s interested in what I have to offer.\t", "And in the meantime, Brady go to hell.\tMegan, believe me, you do not wanna go near my brother. I suppose there\u2019s no reason for me to rush. Rachel\u2019s letter made it clear that Beau is being quite unresponsive. I\u2019ll just delay my trip to Greece until he\u2019s close to waking up. There\u2019s a lot here for me to accomplish. In the meantime, destroying more lives.\tMy family\u2019s here, and not only will I want to get to know them better, but I\u2019ll be claiming my rightful place a Amira.\tI get it. You don\u2019t trust me and I don\u2019t blame you. Well, I\u2019m glad you understand. Now we\u2019re done. Here we are. But I thought I should. Give you a heads up. When I leave Greece, I\u2019ll be flying home to Salem.\tDamn it. Why is this happening again,\tBrady, I\u2019m so sorry. No, you don\u2019t. Don\u2019t be sorry. I\u2019m sorry. Everything she\u2019s putting you through we\u2019re just fine. It\u2019s you and your daughter that are suffering. If it\u2019s any consolation, there was not a judge anywhere who would allow Kristen full custody of that girl. I hope not. Still still what? Marna, she\u2019s right.\tKristen\u2019s right. Our, our little girl\u2019s gonna want to see her mom, and I\u2019m gonna end up looking like the bad guy if I try to put any kind of reasonable distance between the two of them. You\u2019re in a tough place and it\u2019s, and it\u2019s so hard to talk to Rachel right now. She\u2019s so stubborn. I mean, she\u2019s really hard to reason with.\tI wish she is just a little girl. Yeah. She\u2019s just a little girl. She\u2019s just a little girl that wants a normal family, that she wants her parents to be together. She wants her parents to be in love and it\u2019s not gonna happen. And it\u2019s really, really sad. And I know. I know. I know. That\u2019s part of the reason why I can\u2019t reason with her right now.\tBut I think another big reason is that she is, Just her mother\u2019s daughter. She\u2019s just so, Kristen,\tone of the reasons I worried about her, but I\u2019m also worried about you. Me. Why are you worried about me? Because I know how much you love your daughter. And I know how much you wanna make her happy. No, no. I, I know you\u2019re going with this. You think I\u2019m gonna get sucked back into Kristen and I would get back together with her just to make Rachel happy.\tNo, can\u2019t do it. I, I look. It\u2019s as heartbreaking as it is for Rachel. I know that I need to keep her away from Kristen just as much as I need to keep myself away from Kristen, okay? Hell is gonna freeze over before I get back together with Kristen Damara on my life, on, on my daughter\u2019s life. It\u2019s not gonna happen.\tI\u2019m not gonna change my mind about that.\tWhat the hell? Some newspaper reporter you wore. Zander. All right. How is it that I know about your living situation and you know nothing about mine? Kristen, whatever you\u2019re doing these days and whoever you\u2019re torturing, we don\u2019t care. And if you want Brady, he\u2019s all yours. Oh, he will be. And Chloe, I really hope that you and Sandra are very happy together.\tAnd I mean that from the bottom of my heart.\tI don\u2019t have the demer yet at my disposal. Sorry. Oh. Uh, that\u2019s not a problem. Yeah, I, I would, I\u2019ll even fly coach if I could spend that time getting to know my uncle and, um, I would, I would really appreciate if, uh, if you could gimme any insights on how to be accepted into the, to the bosom of the family.\tUh, look. N um, none of us grew up in the, in the bosom of the family. It\u2019s a really creepy, creepy word. Um, in fact, you know, we all sleep with one eye open when we\u2019re around each other. Most of the time it\u2019ll be both eyes with you weirdo around. So, like I said, you know, I don\u2019t care if we\u2019re related. I don\u2019t want a relationship with you ever.\tWell, okay. Well, whether you want to or not, we are still family, so there will be holidays and uh, weddings and funerals. So we\u2019re gonna be spending quite a bit of time together.\tYeah.\tAnd, um, there\u2019s no escaping that Uncle Chad.\tI don\u2019t get it. Why would you go to Salem? I, I grew up there, you know, after joining the Navy, I just never really felt settled and Salem is the closest thing I\u2019ve ever had to a real home. Okay. And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re thinking that I have an ulterior motive. I admit I do. I wanna keep my eye on Megan Hathaway.\tI feel it\u2019s my responsibility after everything I did when she was pulling the strings. Yeah, but it really isn\u2019t though. I mean, you were a victim too. Yeah, but I owe it to your mom. Okay. So your mom can move bow to a secure facility and I\u2019m gonna make sure that Megan does not hurt them. Yeah, well, I doubt you\u2019re gonna be the most popular guy in town.\tSays the guy who put his dad in a coma. No one blames you for that, my grandfather does. But look, you know what? There\u2019s enough blame to pass around in this whole mess. Right now my top priority is to make sure that my dad gets moved to his new location safely. So again, Thank you. Thank you for the intel.\tNo problem. Uh, guess I\u2019ll see you in Salem.\tYour eggs are cold. I can warm them up. No, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve lost my appetite. I think I just wanna get over to Statesville to see Lucas.\tThis is from Shine. Michaels told him that, uh, Megan had been released, so Hope is making plans to keep Bo off her radar. Well, good luck to them. Good luck to all of us Now that Megan\u2019s back in town who knows what she has in store for us.\tHi daddy.\t", "I find that very hard to believe. Chloe. Look, I guess I also kind of leapt into this living situation, partly because I wanted to piss off Brady. Yeah, it worked, didn\u2019t it? Yeah, it did, but it, it wasn\u2019t as satisfying as I thought it would be. I mean, here we are. He and I are, are still apart, and. And you\u2019re still in love with him.\tI just, I feel like I\u2019m at loose ass. Well, that\u2019s exactly why you shouldn\u2019t make any big decisions right now in moving. That\u2019s one of the major life decisions, Chloe. Not to mention that, I\u2019ll be really sad if you move out. I mean, let\u2019s just about to hang a another wall anchor there so I can put the, the dart board on that wall.\tWhat dart board, the one I picked up this morning. If you move out where I\u2019m gonna find another roommate that has your killer dart instinct, come on, stick around a bit longer, please. We\u2019ll split the cleaning even though you are better at it than me and I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll give you space. I won\u2019t bother you. Lucas.\tHave fun. We can play darts and. I don\u2019t know, do puzzles. I just bought a 2000 piece jigsaw puzzle that I will definitely need your help finishing, so, okay. Okay. I will give our living arrangement a little bit more time.\tAh, with that being said, I am gonna go get dressed and go pound the pavement. Oh, I just had a. I dunno, I didn\u2019t think of this sooner. I mean, I, I guess I thought maybe it isn\u2019t the kind of thing that you\u2019re into or you haven\u2019t really done it before and it doesn\u2019t pay great. Plus, you\u2019ve never really been my biggest fan, have you?\tAlthough you have learned to tolerate me a bit more recently, but still in all, still in all. Would you like to come work for me, Chloe?\tSo you are deit two\u2019s mother. Well, that really makes sense. Same shifty eyes, same cold heart. You\u2019re so ungrateful. Dimitri pulled you dripping from the sea. He saved your life just as much as I did, and you haven\u2019t bothered to thank him either. He pulled me from the sea on your order so you could torture me.\tWell, I could have told him to let you drown, but instead you were treated like royalty in the end. In the end, after I cut the heads off a thousand fish. Okay, wait a minute. So this was all planned, Megan. I thought you believed that Kate was really dead. Well, I did it first, but then I figured out what must have happened and I acted accordingly.\tI\u2019m always one step ahead of you, Roman. You should know that by now. Really? Okay, so how do you know so much about what happened on that boat you were in Statesville. My son adores me, so of course he tells me everything. Now you have one of those mama\u2019s boys as well, don\u2019t you, Kate? Poor Lucas. It must be so hard on you that he\u2019s behind bars.\tKeep my son\u2019s name out of your mouth fine. I\u2019ll just keep talking about how grateful I am that my precious Dimitri is free as a bird. Megan, if you\u2019re just here to glow time\u2019s up. I\u2019m not just here to gloat Chris. Oh, that\u2019s strange. For some reason I keep wanting to call you that. I don\u2019t know why. No, Roman.\tI am not here to gloat. In fact, I have pressing business with you.\tSo you\u2019re telling me that Megan Hathaway is Dimitri Ventilation\u2019s mother. Yeah. Now Dimitri refused to accept the immunity deal unless we included Megan and Kristen. Oh God. But Kristen\u2019s out too, and I wanted you in hope to be the first to know, because knowing Megan, she\u2019s gonna have her sights on your father.\tCould you just, could you ask your mom if I could just talk to her for one minute and listen, Sean, from here on out, I\u2019m gonna do whatever it takes to protect your parents, keep them safe. Look, no offense, but I think you\u2019ve done enough. I\u2019ll take.\tOne big happy family. Yeah. One big happy family. That\u2019s insane. It\u2019s all insane. Wilson. Wow. Compared to the Von Leischner, the mayor seem like a, a pretty merry bunch. Yeah. Yeah. That\u2019s what they say. The more deras the merrier. I\u2019ll DJ Throwy and Stephan, they\u2019re all gonna feel exactly the same way. Boy, I hope so.\tYeah. So then, um, you and your mom, and. Kristen, you\u2019re all gonna, you\u2019re all gonna move into the Dememer mansion. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Well, that\u2019s a good thing. I moved out when I did then. Now is that the, the right attitude to have? Okay. Look, I think that maybe we got off on the wrong foot, uncle Chad, but I suspect that you and I have a lot more in common than you think, especially because we both grew up outside of the family.\tSo what do you say? You call up the Damer Chen and you and I can get to know each other on the ride home.\tLook, if you just, uh, here to make more threats, there\u2019s a door. Okay. You can get it out. Alright. I can call the police and they can come and haul you out for trespassing. Hmm. Funny, you used to be one of those cops that you\u2019re now threatening to call. But instead you\u2019re slinging hash how the mighty have fallen.\tOh, what do you want, Megan? You already said that I, I\u2019m no longer any use to you. What do I always want? My little brother, Kristin got a letter from Rachel in prison. In it she wrote that Beau was shot by his idiot\u2019s son, and he\u2019s now in a coma. How is he? His condition is unchanged, but don\u2019t blame Sean about that.\tAll right. If anybody\u2019s the blame, it\u2019s you. Of course it is, because if it weren\u2019t for me, Bo wouldn\u2019t even be alive. If it weren\u2019t for you, Bo would\u2019ve been here with his family for months. But no, you had to keep trying to make him love you and damn Megan, what an epic fail that was cuz just a little time with hope and no love, which just as strong as ever before her son put him in a coma, poses a fighter.\t", "What is that God awful noise. Oh, sorry. Did I wait you, are you kidding? You could have woken the dead. What are you doing? What went to the hardware store and per your sage advice? I got some of those wall anchors you were talking about and now I am rehanging this picture. Sorry. What\u2019d you think? Is this straight?\tHmm. It\u2019s a little\tKristen. Well, hello Marna. Did you miss me?\tOkay. So this is your first full day back in Salem, so whatever you want to do, we\u2019re doing it. I can make you an appointment for a massage. We could take a walk in a park. Pink. I can chill. The choice is yours. God, it all sounds so lovely, but honestly I would really love it if you could drive me over to Statesville.\tOkay. I know. I just, I need to see Lucas and he needs to see his mom see that I\u2019m alive and well and. Roman, I really wanna know how he\u2019s doing. Yeah, no, I get that. That will be a big relief for Lucas. And a thrill. Well, I don\u2019t know how thrilling it could be considering the situation he\u2019s in. And also, I wanna pay a visit that.\tBitch Megan in Hathaway, and give her a little peace of my mind. Oh, it looks like I\u2019ve saved you the trip.\tAll right, take a closer nap. Well relax, cowboy. I\u2019m not gonna lay a finger on your wife. She\u2019s of no use to me. Now, besides, I wouldn\u2019t wanna do anything to jeopardize my newfound freedom. How the hell are you free? How did you get outta prison?\tWell, I, I decided not to go back with Roman and Kate because I, I just, I need to see this thing through.\tWell, I have my doubts about Dimitri\u2019s story that he\u2019s holding Andrew Hostage, and I think that he\u2019s, he\u2019s trying to use it for leverage. You know, it was a bargaining chip for Unity.\tWell, I don\u2019t know, after what he did to Kate, I need to make sure that his frog marched back to that Amania prison where he belongs.\tHey, Steph. Uh, I think, uh, my room service is here. Yeah, I ordered, uh, ordered lunch a little while ago. Yeah, I\u2019ll call you tonight. I miss you too. Okay. One sec.\tDeit. Just gonna feel like I\u2019m gonna jump outta my skin bound, sitting around just waiting to see if my dad\u2019s gonna twitch an eyelid or, or move a finger or something. I just. No, I would give anything to be able to turn back time and make it so I didn\u2019t pull that trigger. Let me call you back, okay?\tMichaels, what the hell you doing here? I need to see your mother.\tLike Sands through the hourglass. So are the days of our lives.\tPaper, thin walls. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the wall\u2019s fault. Look, I\u2019ve just never been into putting up do dances on my own walls. You know, do dances. Isn\u2019t that what your Americans say? Look, if you think you can do a better job, be my guess. Hand me the drill. Thank you. Do you have a stud finder? Excuse me. Have her mind.\tYou\u2019re not getting anywhere near my mother. She made it very clear that she doesn\u2019t want anything to do with you. I bet you understand. Okay. I\u2019m not here because I want hope back. I\u2019m here to warn her. Actually, I\u2019m here to warn all of you. Warn us about what,\tI don\u2019t know how you got out of Statesville this time, but I\u2019m calling 9 1 1 and having you dragged back. Ah. Do you really think that I\u2019d come knocking at your door in my city\u2019s if I had broken outta prison? What do you say? You got another pardon? Well, actually I, um, I got granted full immunity, courtesy of my newfound sister, Megan, Megan.\tShe doesn\u2019t even know you. Why would she help you? Because family is the gift that keeps on giving. Oh, Megan and I met and bonded in Statesville two long lost sisters reunited at last. And, uh, here are my papers to prove it. Read \u2019em and\tI must say, I do miss the fish market. It was so quaint. Hey, I don\u2019t suppose I could still buy some live lobster. Go to hell, Kate. I did save your life. You could at least show nominal gratitude. How did you get immunity anyway after what you did to me and to Marlay and Tela, Dimitri Van Leitner?\tMay I, I wanted to share the good news in person. I\u2019ve been free, so I see. So you kidnap Andrew Donovan, and you are, uh, rewarded with immunity so much for justice, huh? Well, I understand your disappointment misplaced as it might be because I know that you think of Caden\u2019s family and you want to see me pay for what happened to her.\tI did. I do. And I will make you pay. Noted, but I would urge you to reconsider where your loyalties lie for one, Kate is happily reunited with her husband in Salem. So no harm done. No harm done. You put her through hell, you son of a bitch. Okay, well, I will amend that to no lasting harm. But seriously, Chad, I mean this, uh, this outrage on Kate\u2019s behalf.\tIt\u2019s a little over the top, don\u2019t you think? I mean, she\u2019s, she\u2019s not even a true family member. She\u2019s not blood relations. I mean, not like, well, I am. Huh? You, we we\u2019re not related. Oh, yes. You see, we are, you\u2019re, uh, your sister Megan. She\u2019s my, uh,\tMy mom, you\u2019re the hi.\tOkay, so what should I call you Uncle Chad? No, no. You shouldn\u2019t call me. Um, no. Uh, I don\u2019t like you. We\u2019re not related. I want you to leave, leave. So this news is of no interest to you. Nope. Now, I understand that you only know my mother through reputation, but please try to have an open mind. I assure you she\u2019s a fascinating woman.\tShe is smart, she is brave. I\u2019ve, I\u2019ve heard how, uh, smart and brave she is. Um, I\u2019ve also heard that she\u2019s a crazy bitch with the heart of stone, who, uh, who belongs in either, uh, a straight jacket or in prison. And, and in fact, since she is in prison, I won\u2019t have to get to know her, uh, for a very long time.\t"], "answer": [4, 1, 3, 0, 2]}

I could have warned her, right then, what was going on, to be careful. Maybe then, she would have run the other direction when cameron approached her in the park. I thought that I was protecting her. I was\u2026 leaving her to be vulnerable.\tNick: Well, she knows now.\tSharon: I told her about everything that happened with cameron after you and chance left.\tNick: Well, I\u2019m sure that wasn\u2019t easy, but faith needed to know.

I know that I was young and stupid, but I\u2019m still ashamed of what I did.\tNick: You were confused. And hurt.\tSharon: My choices brought that madman into our lives.

We have another situation.\tPhyllis: What is it?\tSummer: I told grandma and grandpa that you\u2019re alive, and about stark.\tPhyllis: Summer! Victor and nikki?

Was she\u2013 I mean, I shouldn\u2019t feel bad because she\u2019s living her life free and clear, blah, blah, blah, right?\tDaniel: So you told them, but you didn\u2019t tell kyle?\tSummer: Daniel, you\u2019re the one that already told everyone, so yeah, I just\u2013 I would rather them hear it from me.\tPhyllis: So you know what this means, huh? I mean, victor is gonna get his personal security on me. I mean, they\u2019ll find me immediately. I\u2013 I should just turn myself in.\tDaniel: That would be the right thing to do.\tSummer: Oh, my god, stop with the whole \u201cright thing.\u201d The right thing is to protect our mom until we can clear her of stark\u2019s murder.\tPhyllis: I agree with summer on that, daniel.\tDaniel: Cool. Great. You agree with summer on that. Do you have a plan, then?\tPhyllis: I actually do. So, I hacked in to all of stark\u2019s personal records and accounts. I just need to find a paper trail to show what a horrible person he was. He was gonna keep me as a prisoner in that room, daniel. He was gonna keep me as a prisoner. Honestly, it was his life or mine!\tDaniel: Did you have any luck with it?\tPhyllis: I need to find the emt. His name is carson.

I was just thinking that the night of the gala, kyle lost his phone in here, and that set off the whole chain of events that became a nightmare.\tJack: I\u2019m sorry, I did not mean to bring all that up. That is over now. Good fortune is on our side from here on out.\tDiane: And, I\u2013 I know, and I\u2013 I\u2013 I do feel fortunate. But jack, I just worry about what this has done to kyle and summer. I mean, I\u2013 I watch them, I listen, and they don\u2019t seem to be connected. It\u2019s like they\u2019re living separate lives.\tJack: None of this has been easy for either of them. None of this has been easy for us.

I\u2019m so glad to see youback in port charles.\tI\u2019m glad to be back, especially since there was a moment where I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be back here, or anywhere else for that matter, ever again.\tSince you\u2019re here safe and sound, I wonder if you\u2019d be open to doing a little more business. Our last venture proved fruitful to us both, did it not?\tIt certainly did.\t", "Oh, wow, wow, wow. You know, you must be as morally bankrupt and deranged as your boss to think that sasha would trust you, or this show, or anybody here anymore.\tLucy, it\u2019s ok. I can handle it. Patch it through.\tHey. No stunts. Do you hear me? No, ok.\tIt\u2019s not a stunt.\tYou swear no stunts?\tYes, yes. Ok. Yeah. Ok. You\u2019re live.\tThis is sasha.\t\u2013 Sasha?\tSasha gilmore?\tIt\u2019s me. What can I do for you?\t\u2013 You\u2019re back. I\u2019d heard your baby had died and then your husband died. Such a tragedy for a young person like yourself.\tYes. It was a tragedy. But thanks to the support of my family and friends, I am doing much better.\t\u2013 Isn\u2019t that a miracle?\tIt is. And you know what else is a miracle? A new device we call the deceptor.\tI know better than to think that you would accept my apology.\tIf you were me, would you accept your apology?\tYou know what I would do, carly? I would at least acknowledge it.\tYou want acknowledgment, a blue ribbon for self-awareness? You talk about what you want from willow, but you don\u2019t talk about what you want for willow. Now, me, I want willow to be safe, happy, and healthy. Can you say the same?\tand willow pulls through, I want my daughter to have a happy, long, healthy life. That\u2019s all I want, and\u2026 even if I\u2019m not part of it.\tI almost believe you.\tBut if there is a way that I can be part of it, if there\u2019s a way that I can repair our relationship, I\u2019m just telling you that i am willing to do anything.\tNina, you just don\u2019t get it, do you? You just don\u2019t get it.\tGet what?\tThe more you push, the more you drive people away. And what do you mean, repair your relationship? What relationship? What is there to repair?\tYou\u2019re right. When I first met willow, when she was charlotte\u2019s teacher, I made her life miserable, I did. And I should not have done that, even if she wasn\u2019t my daughter. But when I found out that she was mine, I tried and I\u2019m trying to heal our relationship. But of course, that\u2019s after I scorched the earth ten times over. And we all know that. And that\u2019s why\u2026\t[Soft music] In hindsight, I\u2019m relieved that she had you, carly, because willow needed a mother, and I couldn\u2019t be that for her.\tBut you could. And you did. And for that, I am truly thankful.\tYou don\u2019t waste any time. I like that.\tWho wants to go first?\tMay I?\tPlease.\tI apologize for kissing robert in his office. Obviously, we had no idea you were there.\tAnd by that, I shall infer that you know. All right. Robert and I had been on exactly one date. And I don\u2019t ask for exclusivity until well into the second. As such, my relationship with robert, whatever it may be, is still in the nascent stage, so there\u2019s no apology necessary.\tWell, still, it wasn\u2019t appropriate.\tWell, that\u2019s between you and robert. Here\u2019s where I stand on things. And I have told this to robert as well. I will not compete with another woman for a man\u2019s attention.\tFair enough. And you should know that i have strong feelings for robert.\tAnd you have told robert of these feelings?\tWhy hold back? I mean, robert and I have been dancing around each other for 30 years.\tAnd you believethat robert has these feelings for you as well. That\u2019s what you\u2019re trying to say, isn\u2019t it?\tRobert and holly are two of my oldest friends. I just want what\u2019s best for them.\tYeah, I want what\u2019s best for diane.\tOf course you do, but you know, with holly, she knows what she wants or what\u2019s next.\tYou sound like you don\u2019T. That doesn\u2019t sound like you.\tWell, I\u2019m not exactly lost and aimless.\tOh, I am. Trust me. It\u2019s not fun.\tWell, actually, I\u2019m looking for a new project, something I can get excited about, kind of like with you and \u201cthe invader.\u201d I mean, you\u2019re on a mission to serve the community and make real positive change.\tThat was the plan from the start.\tNot now?\tWell, it\u2019s still the plan. It\u2019ll always be the plan. If I\u2019m going to be perfectly honest with you, \u201cthe invader\u201d actually isn\u2019t what I wanted it to be.\tYou were just amazing. You know, you seized the day. You beat them at their own game. I\u2019m so, so, so happy.\tGood news, ladies. The deceptor is flying off the shelves.\tOf course it is because it\u2019s a wonderful product. But also, you know, pain sells. But you already knew that, didn\u2019t you? Listen, you wimpy little weasel, you and haven, and \u201chome and heart,\u201d you\u2019re going to make this right. You hear me? You are going to make this right!\tWell, well, well, cody bell. What are you, a big fan of the \u201chome and heart\u201d shopping channel?\tHow else could I add to my porcelain cat collection?\tYou didn\u2019t see those inflammatory tweets that the show had people post?\tI do not understand. What are these tweets you speak of?\tI saw you talking to that pa. You got her to stop that sound effect.\tIf you say so.\tRight. Well, anyway, we\u2019re gonna go celebrate at the savoy. You in?\tI want to pull out haven\u2019s hair. If I had any idea this was going to happen, I wouldn\u2019t have put you through it ever. But you did\u2026\tI got a thing. Next time.\tYour loss.\tBut hey, make sure sasha has fun. She deserves it.\t[Soft music]\t", "You have options. There are things I value more than money.\tSuch as?\tAssets, of which you have many.\tNot really. I mean, I guess I could finally unload my house back in bridgeport.\tI\u2019m referring to your connections.\tConnections? You think I have connections?\tDon\u2019t sell yourself short. You may hold knowledge of certain business dealings, certain arrangements that could prove useful to me and my organization.\tBusiness dealings? Oh, you want the skinny on what goes on at deception because I can\u2013 wait. Are you talking about my cousin sonny?\tI can\u2019t tell you what to do.\tWell, tell me what not to do. That\u2019s the next best thing.\tUm, I don\u2019t know. I mean a new person is always very exciting, whereas an old love is kind of comforting.\tHolly and I certainly know each other inside and out.\tYes, you do.\tOn the other hand, diane takes the law very seriously, and you do also.\tAnd holly looks upon it at best a challenge, at worse an obstacle.\tIt\u2019s very exciting though, isn\u2019t it?\tI\u2019m back to square one.\tOk. I mean, I can totally understand why you don\u2019t know how to make this decision because you never thought that you would ever be in a position like this, right?\tNo, I didn\u2019T. But for what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m not surprised. You\u2019re quite the catch. You do have your moments, you know, rare as they are.\tOh, I got to go. I got\u2013\tare they just quite\u2013\ttell what\u2019s-his-face goodbye.\tYou mean good night.\tYeah, that too.\t[Sighs]\t[Soft music]\tI thought he\u2019d never leave.\tMy god.\tRobert and I fell in love decades ago. And those feelings never went away, certainly not for me, and I don\u2019t think for robert either. But to answer your question, in typical robert scorpio fashion, he has neither confirmed nor denied.\tWell, good to know that\u2019s his mo.\tExactly. And I wanted you to know this because\u2013 and I realize this is going to sound patronizing.\tBut you\u2019re gonna say it anyway.\tI don\u2019t want you to get hurt.\t[Laughs] Well, thank you for your concern, but, really, I\u2019ll be fine. As I said to robert, I have no intention on going to war over a man, especially one who, at this stage, is still just a friend.\tAnd you should remain friends. I would be completely comfortable with that.\tWould you? Well, that\u2019s good to know. That\u2019s very generous. So let\u2019s say I bow out, and you and robert pick up right where you left off.\tThe ideal situation for me.\tYes. So here\u2019s what i don\u2019t understand. What makes you so confident that your relationship will work out this time?\tThe news that I want to report is just a fraction of the news that needs to be reported. And there\u2019s administrative and economic issues. Well, \u201ct he invader\u201d may not beexactly what you envisioned when you started there, but I mean, it\u2019s become a respected publication. And that\u2019s because of your leadership.\tThank you. I really do appreciate that perspective.\tAm I wrong?\tI think you\u2019re very kind. I spend most of my time finding advertisers, managing investors, managing staff. And to be perfectly honest, it\u2019s a little disappointing that my dream for \u201cthe invader\u201d just really hasn\u2019t entirely come true.\tYet. But if anybody can make it happen, alexis, it\u2019s you.\tN\u2019neka, your best bubbly, ok? We\u2019re celebrating.\tOk, I promise. I promise you I was very, very polite when I cornered the \u201chome and heart\u201d producer. I just said russell, russell, russell, I mean, intentional infliction of emotional distress, et cetera, et cetera, lawsuit, lawsuit. Guess what. We ended up with five more spots for deception\u2013 primetime.\tThat\u2019s amazing, lucy.\tOf course, comes with one condition, mine, not theirs.\tOk. What is it?\tI want you to be deceptor\u2019s spokeswoman.\tOk. I\u2019ll help with willow.\tOh, my god. Thank you so much. That\u2019s more than I even dared to hope. Of course, we don\u2019t want to do anything to make willow feel uncomfortable, right? So I was thinking that maybe you could set up a phone call.\tNina.\tThen if that goes well, carly, we could maybe\u2013\tok, stop, please. I want to be really clear here. I will help you with willow by supporting whatever decision she makes for her family. If she decides to let you in, I promise you I will not stand in the way. But if willow decides she wants nothing to do with you, I won\u2019t advocate for you.\t[Soft music]\tI should have known that you weren\u2019t going to help.\tI don\u2019t know anything about sonny\u2019s business.\tBut you\u2019re close.\tNo, not really. Sonny doesn\u2019t like me that much.\tEven so, you might know more about his business than you realize.\tI\u2019m telling you I don\u2019T. Trust me. That\u2019s asking for trouble that neither of us wants.\tI don\u2019t understand why you seem so bothered by the suggestion. After all, it\u2019s one way for you to settle your ever-increasing debt.\tI can get the money. I just need a few more days.\tYou have until tomorrow. Noon.\tThat\u2019s not enough time.\tI grow tired of making allowances for someone who won\u2019t take a gift when offered.\tOh, listen. I am so thankful for your patience.

And if you can\u2019t pay, perhaps sasha will.\t[Tense music]\tThank you both for being so supportive.\tNever doubted you for a second.\tI did. I mean\u2013sorry. If I\u2019m being honest, I did actually have some doubts. I was fearing the worst, but then\u2013I don\u2019t know.

Well?\tWell, like I was telling you at the hospital, I\u2019ve been doing some soul searching, carly. And I realized that I have been acting from a place of fear and that fear has led me to make some poor decisions. I hurt people, most of all willow. And in that fear and jealousy, I blamed you for the distance between me and willow, and that was wrong. But I think it\u2019s easier for me to hate you than accept the consequences of my own actions.

Sasha might have questions. But I suppose it\u2019s not impossible. I just need to be subtle about it.\tI understand your quandary. Availing yourself of sasha\u2019s money to pay off your growing debts could put you in an awkward position, with sasha certainly, but legally as well. But like I said, there are other ways for you to make good. After all, money isn\u2019t everything.\t[Baby crying]\tThere\u2019s a problem, I think, with my earpiece.\tA problem?

I don\u2019t think either one of us are really in a place of starting anything new right now. I don\u2019t know. I think that we just shouldn\u2019t put any unnecessary pressure on each other. There\u2019s no need to label anything. And I think that the most important thing here is our friendship.\tLily: I agree. And I don\u2019t wanna do anything to damage that.\tDaniel: No. What we did the other night didn\u2019t damage anything.\tLily: [ Laughing ] No, it was lovely.\tDaniel: It was more than lovely.\tLily: [ Laughing ] I agree. So, are we good?\tDaniel: Yeah, why wouldn\u2019t we be good? Hm? Why are we even talking about this? Did I\u2013 I brought this\u2013\tLily: Yeah, you brought it up.\tDaniel: Yeah, I brought this up. Now I\u2019m the idiot. You know, I\u2019m gonna go. I\u2019m gonna let you get back to work.\tLily: Okay. Well, thank you for the coffee. And I\u2019ll check in with you later.\tDaniel: Okay.\tLily: [ Laughing ] Bye.\tDaniel: Bye.\tDevon: Hey. Hey.\tDaniel: Hey. I was just heading out.\tDevon: All right, see ya.\tDaniel: Yep.\tLily: Hi.\tDevon: Hi. How is everything going in the omega sphere? Or do I even have to ask?\t[ Lily sighing ]\tMariah: You always talk about cassie with so much love.\tSharon: She was such a shining light. Just like you. And I never wanna stop talking about her because it\u2019s a way of keeping her spirit alive. But when a stranger or a new acquaintance asks about her, I have to weigh how much I wanna say. And there\u2019s no way I can respond to that casually, but if I do say what happened to her, it can get awkward. Hearing about the loss of a child makes people uncomfortable.\tMariah: Well, if you ever want to talk to me about cassie, I would love to listen. You know, I think about her a lot too. I do. I wonder if we would\u2019ve had our own language like twins sometimes do, or if we would\u2019ve dressed alike or been the complete opposites.\tSharon: Probably the latter.\t[ Both laughing ] Look, I\u2019m not saying our situations are exactly the same. Yours is complex, but it has a happy ending.\tMariah: Yeah, that\u2019s true. I mean, everybody\u2019s happy and healthy. And I know when people are\u2013 are striking up conversations, they\u2019re just trying to find a way to connect. Like, hey, we\u2019re both moms. But I don\u2019t know, it still catches me off guard.\tSharon: You know what, someday, someone is probably gonna say, \u201caria looks just like you or tessa.\u201d\tMariah: Oh, my gosh! That has already happened. I mean, she has no hair and her eyes were closed. But hey, sure. Yeah, we look alike.\t[ Both laughing ]\tDiane: My last chance for freedom died with jeremy.\tJack: Wait, that is not necessarily true.\tDiane: Forget. Forget getting a confession. They can\u2019t even question him now. Now that jeremy\u2019s gone, the only person they\u2019re gonna come after is me.\tJack: Slow down. Look, chances of getting a confession out of jeremy stark was always slim to none. Now that they know it\u2019s a murder investigation, they have to investigate. Here\u2019s what we hope for. In the process of searching for his killer, they find proof that he was behind phyllis\u2019s death.\tDiane: Oh, my god. That\u2019s an even longer shot than a confession. And I doubt that jeremy left behind any proof.\tJack: Oh, I\u2019m not so sure about that. A guy as cocky as that is going to probably want a few mementos of his accomplishments.\tDiane: Jack, I love how you always hold on to hope, but I need to be a realist. And right now, most of genoa city wants me to go away for this crime. I don\u2019t have a strong defense. And the case against me is growing stronger every day.\tJack: Think of all you have already overcome. You came back to this town, you thought you would never see your son again. You thought your life was over. You can overcome this too. I will help you do that.\tChance: Okay. I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to imply anything. I was just saying. If you come across anyone suspicious or threatening, you can come to me.\tSummer: I haven\u2019T\u2026 yet.\tChance: Okay. And I hope, you know, I\u2019m not trying to put ideas in your head like kyle mentioned. I just wanna help.\tSummer: Thank you. Look, I\u2019m sorry for snapping at you. Kinda barely holding it together, in case you haven\u2019t noticed. My brother thinks that I\u2019m losing my mind. And you know what? Maybe\u2013 maybe he\u2019s right.\tChance: No, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re in pain. You know, given how stressful all this is, maybe wandering around town alone isn\u2019t the best idea right now.\tSummer: Maybe for both of us.\tDaniel: Hey. Summer, what are you doing here again? I used to pre-rinse dishes cause my old detergent\t", "Lily: I know. It makes me realize how much I miss him and how much of our lives he hasn\u2019t been a part of.\tDevon: Yeah. I actually think that he hasn\u2019t missed anything in our lives. Think he has a front-row seat to it all.\tLily: Well, hopefully not everything.\t[ Lily laughing ]\tDevon: Yeah, I\u2019m sure he covers his eyes every now and then.\tLily: No, but I agree. I think dad is rooting for us, every step of the way.\tDiane: Kyle, like I told you and your dad, I didn\u2019t want you visiting again.\tKyle: You can tell me to go, but I won\u2019T.\tDiane: I don\u2019t want to ruin your life again.\tKyle: You\u2019re not ruining my life. I\u2019m capable of doing that on my own.\t[ Diane laughing ] Believe it or not, I\u2019m stubborn just like you.\tDiane: I think you get that from your father.\tKyle: I think you would beg to differ.\tDiane: Mm. That\u2019s right because he\u2019s as obstinate as a rock.\tKyle: [ Laughing ] Mom, seeing you in here like this doesn\u2019t cause me pain. What would hurt me is not seeing you. I know you are innocent, so we\u2019re gonna figure out a way to prove it.\tDiane: That means the world to me, and I appreciate you saying that, but I know the toll this is taking on you and your marriage.\tKyle: I admit that things aren\u2019t great with summer right now, but this will pass. We\u2019re strong enough as a couple to work through it. She\u2019ll deal with her grief and we\u2019ll get you out of here and then life will go back to normal for all of us.\tSummer: Can you please just leave this alone?\t[ Daniel chuckling ]\tDaniel: How do you suggest I do that? We\u2019re talking about our mother, her and stark are connected. The fact that the two of them were killed can\u2019t just be a coincidence. I mean, that\u2019s exactly what you were saying to me last night. And now you\u2019re just doing a 180. Why? Why? What\u2019s going on?\tSummer: I wasn\u2019t thinking clearly last night, okay? I\u2013 I was\u2013 I was doing what you said that I was doing. I was looking for answers that aren\u2019t there.\tDaniel: So you just guessed that stark was murdered and then it turned out that he actually was.\tSummer: He deserved to die. For who he is and\u2013 and what he did and I\u2013 I just, I wanted it to be true, okay? Doesn\u2019t mean that I\u2019m psychic or that I know things. It just means that\u2013 that I don\u2019t know how to do this. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know how to be in a world without mom and it\u2013 and I\u2019m sorry, okay? I\u2019m sorry.\tDaniel: I\u2013 I don\u2019t need an apology, summer. What I need is to know that you\u2019re gonna be okay and I\u2019m not sure that you are. I mean, I talked to kyle. He told me that you ran off on him without a word. I tried calling you over and over and over again. I came here as just a\u2013 a last resort and sure enough, here you are with chance in the exact spot where you said you saw mom.\tSummer: I don\u2019t know what was going on with me last night, but I\u2019m not imagining mom, okay? Not really. I\u2019m not seeing her or I\u2019m not thinking that she\u2019s alive. And I\u2019m definitely not talking to a police detective about any of that, okay?\tDaniel: Okay. Fine.\tSummer: I just\u2013 actually, I just wanted to get some information about stark from chance, but he would not give up anything about the stabbing or the scissors.\tDaniel: What did you say? Summer, if chance didn\u2019t say anything about a stabbing or scissors, how the hell do you know about it? (Music throughout)\tKyle: Harrison has moved on to building entire cities. And when we told him his dee-dee used to be an architect and her job was to build things, he lit up like a christmas tree.\tDiane: Oh, I love that. And it kind of hurts at the same time.\tKyle: Oh, I was just trying to say he loves you. That\u2019s all.\tDiane: And I love him more than I can say. I\u2019m just\u2026 I\u2019m just terrified that his little heart will be broken if I don\u2019t make it home.\tKyle: Hey, I didn\u2019t mean to make you feel that way.\tDiane: No, no. It\u2019s not you. It\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s the truth.\tKyle: Dad, michael and I are working on a plan to get you out of here. So, just try to hang tight until we figure it out.\tDiane: Yeah. Hey, thank you for coming even though I told you not to. And for the pep talk, but I think we all need to face facts. There\u2019s a very strong possibility that I am going to be wrongly convicted and spend the rest of my life behind bars.\tJack: Afternoon latte? They don\u2019t have coffee at the station where you should be working on phyllis\u2019s case?\tChance: I am working, jack.\tJack: Oh, then you\u2019re looking for evidence that jeremy stark killed phyllis here in the coffee house.\tChance: You know what? I just had a meeting with the da. That\u2019s none of your business, so why don\u2019t you stay out of it?\tJack: Jeremy stark is dead. Whatever his plan was has gone awry. There\u2019s gotta be more to this than what we all see on the surface. It\u2019s up to you to dig up all of his deepest, darkest secrets and tell us what happened. I am going to hold you to account. Look, if you do your job, it is the only way diane is exonerated.\tSummer: I must have read about the way that he died and the\u2013 and the murder weapon in the news.\tDaniel: I\u2019ve read every story there is to read about stark. The story about his murder just came out today, and it specifically said that no details were released.\tSummer: Well, there must have been more articles than the ones that you read.\tDaniel: Okay, well, which one did you see then?\tSummer: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember. Why are you being like this?\tDaniel: Because I need you to be honest with me. That\u2019s why. It doesn\u2019t make any sense how you would have information that isn\u2019t public knowledge, summer. I mean, unless you had something to do with it. I\u2013 I can\u2019t even believe I\u2019m asking you this right now, but did you kill stark?\tSummer: Oh, my god. You can\u2019t be s\u2013 don\u2019t be ridiculous, daniel.\tDaniel: Well, then tell me something that makes sense.\tSummer: None of this makes any sense. Don\u2019t you see that?\tDaniel: Okay. Maybe I should go ask chance.\tSummer: No, don\u2019t bring him into this.\tDaniel: Why not?\tSummer: Fine. Fine.\tDaniel: So there is something.\t[ Summer sighing ]\tSummer: If I tell you, you have to swear to me that you\u2019re not gonna tell anyone else, daniel. It is life or death.\tDaniel: Summer, I\u2019m your brother. I wanna be here for you. I want to protect you. I mean, it\u2019s obviously something that you feel like you can\u2019t tell the police.\tSummer: Everything I said last night was true. I thought that I could handle this on my own, but I can\u2019T. I\u2019m not crazy. I know what happened to stark because I heard it from the only other person who was there. The person who stabbed him to death. Mom. She\u2019s alive.\t", "[ Mariah sighing ]\tSharon: Just what I needed.

So funny.\tSharon: I\u2019m just kidding. You are wonderful also.\tMariah: Ah, no. Well, aria is a lot more popular than I am these days. As she should be.\tSharon: Look at her sweet little face. She\u2019s just an angel. Can I pick her up?\tMariah: I love you, but no. This angel wailed the whole car ride until she fell asleep. So, just give her a few minutes?\tSharon: No problem. I can wait. I think.\t[ Chuckles ] Meantime, why don\u2019t you fill me in? What\u2019s been going on?\tMariah: I really, really wanna dish, but first I need coffee. Anything before caffeine is just gonna sound like gibberish.\tSharon: Okay. Wow. I hope you\u2019re not pushing yourself too hard. Going back to work. You\u2019re taking care of aria. That\u2019s a lot to take on at once.\tMariah: Tessa has my back. And I\u2019m only in the office like two days a week. I mean, I spend the entire time wishing I was with aria. But then she woke up three times last night, so.\tSharon: Sounds like a recipe for insomnia.\tMariah: Oh, sleep? Who needs sleep?\tSharon: Wait, am I sensing there might be something else going on?\t[ Knocking ]\tDaniel: Hey, am I interrupting?\tLily: No, not at all. What is this?\tDaniel: Well, I thought you could use a little afternoon pick me up.\tLily: Thank you. It\u2019s very sweet.\tDaniel: Not totally selfless. I was actually hoping to talk to you about something. Do you have a minute?\tLily: Yeah, of course. What\u2019s up?\t[ Daniel sighing ]\tDaniel: God, I don\u2019t mean to keep leaning on you, but you\u2019re kind of my go-to person when it comes to this.\tLily: Is it your mom? Did you have another nightmare or?\tDaniel: Yeah, something like that. Only this one is happening in real life.\t[ Summer sighing ]\tPhyllis: Listen to me. You\u2019re the only one who can know that I\u2019m alive. I mean it.

I told you not to come here. Why don\u2019t you listen to me?\tJack: Because I love you. Because the last time I was here, I left you with a question that you never answered.\tDiane: It was a crazy question.\tJack: That is still not an answer. I\u2019ll ask again. Will you marry me?\tDiane: Before I go on trial for murder? Is there nothing I can do to drive you away?\tJack: No. No. Now is when you need me most. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\tDiane: So that\u2019s why you\u2019re here? To marry me right now? That\u2019s not romance, jack. It\u2019s denial. And it breaks my heart.

And then I got embarrassed that I didn\u2019t know how to handle it better and that\u2019s kind of just how things go in my world sometimes. It\u2019s really\u2013 it\u2019s not a big deal.\tSharon: Well, it\u2019s still on your mind. So, why don\u2019t you just tell me? Was it something at work?\tMariah: No. No. Someone today asked me if aria was my first child and I didn\u2019t really know how to respond.\tSharon: Because of dom.\tMariah: It really flustered me and I was just struggling with all of these different thoughts. And I didn\u2019t wanna say, \u201cyes, I\u2019ve been pregnant before, but not with this baby and the one that I was pregnant with before has a different mom.\u201d But I also didn\u2019t wanna deny dom because that was such an important time in my life and I will always adore dom. But I mean, aria is my first child and I wanna tell the world how amazing she is.\tSharon: It\u2019s complicated, for sure. And I think that I can relate to it because when people ask me how many children I have, I have to stop and think. And I\u2019m sure that must look strange because people think, \u201clady, you don\u2019t know how many kids you have?\u201d But you know, it\u2019s complicated for me too.\tMariah: Because your mind instantly goes to cassie.\tDaniel: I\u2019m not really sure where to start.\tLily: It\u2019s okay. Just take your time.\tDaniel: Yeah. Well, I feel like I need to be careful here \u2019cause I don\u2019t really wanna betray summer\u2019s trust.\tLily: So, it\u2019s about summer.\tDaniel: I had this strange conversation with her. I mean, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s probably already regretting most of what she said.\tLily: Okay. Well, look, I promise you that whatever is said here, it will not leave this room.\tDaniel: Yeah. I mean, I know that.\t[ Daniel laughing ] I trust you. It\u2019s just difficult for me to talk about.\tLily: What happened?\tDaniel: I ran into summer last night. She was a mess. You know, she was hanging out at the park all alone. I\u2013 I don\u2019t know, you know, I\u2019m having a tough time dealing with this, but summer is falling apart. She\u2019s looking for answers that just aren\u2019t there and because she can\u2019t find them in real life, she\u2019s making them up in her head. And it\u2013 I don\u2019t know, scares me.\tChance: I didn\u2019t mean to startle you. No, I don\u2019t wanna intrude.\tSummer: No, you\u2019re not. I mean, it\u2019s a public park, right? It\u2019s open to anyone and plus, it\u2019s named after your family, so you have more of a right to be here than anyone.\tChance: I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how it works.\tSummer: I don\u2019t mind the company. Can I ask you though, what are you doing here? Shouldn\u2019t you be out looking for stark\u2019s killer?\tChance: It\u2019s not supposed to be public knowledge yet. Yeah, I guess word must be getting out that his death wasn\u2019t an accident.\tSummer: Hard to keep that kind of thing quiet.\tChance: Yeah. Well, I am just consulting on this case.

It\u2019s been a minute.\tDaniel: I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m doing okay.\tChance: I understand this is a rough time for both of you.\tSummer: Yeah, we\u2019re\u2013 we\u2019re getting through it.\tChance: So what happened here before?\tSummer: Nothing. It was just, it was a\u2013 a family thing. Chance, could I have a\u2013 some alone time with my brother?\tChance: Yeah. By all means. And don\u2019t worry, we will find whoever\u2019s responsible for stark\u2019s death.\t[ Daniel clearing his throat ]\tDaniel: So, turns out that stark really was murdered. Just like you were talking about last night.\tSummer: I didn\u2019t say anything to chance about any of that or about how mom is alive. And you shouldn\u2019t say a word either. Look, I\u2019m doing a lot better now. I promise you. And you just forget I said any of that.\tDiane: As much as I\u2019d like to, it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s hard to find comfort in what you\u2019re saying because the reality tells a different story.\tJack: So what\u2019s the option? Giving up? That is not even a possibility. Oh. Looks like you have another visitor.\tDiane: Well, it better not be a minister or justice of the peace.\tJack: Actually, he has been ordained and I think married a couple of people, but that\u2019s not why he\u2019s here.\t[ Diane chuckling ]\tLily: Oh, who are you now?

I love that you could just pop in my office like this again.\tDevon: I know, right? I miss being able to do that.\tLily: Are you easing in or do you feel a little overwhelmed by things?\tDevon: I\u2019m not overwhelmed. I\u2019m playing a little bit of catch-up, but it\u2019s not too bad. Things already feel better than they did before.\tLily: We\u2019re gonna keep it that way.\tDevon: I\u2019m glad to hear you say that \u2019cause I have a plan that is already in motion.\tLily: Okay.

That\u2019s exactly what we should do.\tDevon: Good.\tChance: Did you get a chance to check out the jeremy stark report?\tChristine: I did\tChance: And?\tChristine: It\u2019s still not our case, chance.\tChance: Look, I hear you. But he did not drown in that lake, christine. He was stabbed to death. He was wrapped in a damn shower curtain and moved after he was killed. So that means the murder could have taken place right here in genoa city.\tChristine: It is possible. Or it could have happened anywhere else.\tChance: I hear you, but I have a gut feeling it was closer to home. I mean, come on. This is not a coincidence. Phyllis is poisoned, and then days later, her brand new husband washes ashore stabbed to death? No, I have to look into this. I have no choice.\tChristine: I mean, even if jeremy stark had something to do with phyllis\u2019s death, we can\u2019t negate the evidence we already have. There was a plan to kill her with poison purchased by diane. So, even if stark was an accomplice, the case against diane is still airtight and I intend to try it. Diabetes can serve up a lot of questions,\tSharon: You don\u2019t have to follow this advice, but I would just take each comment as it comes, you know, on a case-by-case basis, depending on who you\u2019re talking to and your mood and how much you feel like sharing. There\u2019s no reason why you have to make a decision about who you can or cannot talk to about your child\u2019s life.

She\u2019s the mother of my son. So, us all together as a family feels good to me. And having her and dominic under this roof makes all the sense in the world. (Imitating chicken clucks)\tSharon: Wow. Giving abby the okay to move in with devon, that must have been hard.\tChance: You know, the more I think about it\u2026 it really wasn\u2019t that hard.\tSharon: Well, that\u2019s good. Maybe this could mark the end of that. You can put it in the past and that could be really freeing.\tChance: Yeah. You know, it\u2019s tough. There\u2019s never gonna be a clean break with abby. We always have dominic connecting us, you know?\tSharon: Well, you can continue to resent abby for what she did and who she did it with. But abby\u2019s out there living her life and she\u2019s not gonna feel the sting. The only person your anger is gonna affect is you. So\u2026 it seems to me that the sooner you let that go the better.\tChance: Well, the way I see it, sharon, is you got two options here. I either pay you for this excellent therapy session or I take you to dinner.\tSharon: And those are my only two options?\tChance: Yeah, those are the only two options.\tSharon: Okay. Dinner.\tDevon: Pretty lady.\tAbby: Hi.\tDevon: Hey.\tAbby: Can I come in?\tDevon: You know, you don\u2019t have to ask me that question.\tAbby: Um\u2026\tDevon: What\u2019s up?\tAbby: So, I haven\u2019t been able to get your offer out of my mind.\tDevon: Well, I don\u2019t want to put any pressure on you to make a decision. Okay?\tAbby: No pressure, but, you know, my biggest concern was chance.\tDevon: Yeah.\tAbby: So, I went and talked to him.\tDevon: Really? How did that go?\tAbby: Well, he wasn\u2019t ecstatic, but\u2026 he gave us the go ahead.\tDevon: Really?\tAbby: Mm-hmm.\tDevon: Well, that\u2019s the best news, isn\u2019t it?\tAbby: Yeah. I mean, I think now that that\u2019s handled, the rest seems doable.\tDevon: So, are you saying what I think you\u2019re saying?\tAbby: I love you. And I would very much like to make a home with you and our son.\tVictoria: If we succeed in buying mccall, I am not gonna be able to stop my dad from handing it to adam. But if the acquisition is a failure, then my company takes a hit. And that means it\u2019s a no-win situation for me.\tNate: Makes sense to me. Personally, I\u2019m happy you\u2019re backing off because it leaves the door open for devon to purchase it. If he chooses.\tVictoria: Oh. Win-win for everyone, then.\tNate: Victoria, your instincts are always spot on. I admire your ability to pivot when it\u2019s called for.\tVictoria: Yes, well, being nimble is a business secret of mine.\tNate: Thank you for sharing your secrets with me. It\u2019S\u2026 nice to be in your inner circle.\tVictoria: You\u2019re an asset. I would definitely be a fool not to recognize that.\tNate: Good to hear. Though, I realize that most of the time that circle is you.\tVictoria: I can reach out for help whenever the situation arises.\tNate: Yeah? So, you\u2019re thinking of expanding this inner circle of yours?\tVictoria: Just by one.\tNikki: It went that badly with adam?\tVictor: Well, let me put it this way. He\u2019s still as obstinate as always. He insists that I\u2026 force victoria to acquire mccall unlimited.\tNikki: Oh, well, you\u2019re not considering doing that, are you?\tVictor: No, of course not. But that answer didn\u2019t sit well with him.\tNikki: Well, I take it as a good thing. Now, we can finally get past the pursuit of a company that tucker clearly wants to sell to devon.\tVictor: There\u2019s only one problem. Devon is no longer interested in acquiring another company.\tNikki: What happened?\tVictor: Devon wants to rejoin chancellor-winters.\tNikki: Wow, that\u2019s an interesting turn of events.\tVictor: It\u2019s not surprising, to be honest with you. After phyllis\u2019s death, I guess everyone is rethinking their relationship with their family. I certainly am not gonna waste any more time being away from my family, including adam. So as far as I\u2019m concerned, mccall unlimited is still on the market.\tAdam: Thank you\u2026 for always knowing the right thing to say. It\u2019s part of the reason you\u2019re gonna be an amazing mother to our little boy.\tSally: Wait, what? Little boy?\tAdam: It\u2019s my track record. All boys, so far.\tSally: Okay. Well, maybe that means you\u2019re overdue for a daughter.\tAdam: Hey, I would love a little girl. I mean, I\u2019m gonna be thrilled either way.\tSally: Well, the way this kid refuses to let me enjoy a meal. I\u2019m not sure how either of us comes out of this healthy.\tAdam: Are you still having morning sickness?\tSally: No.\tAdam: Are you taking the prenatal vitamins? I mean, do we need to go see a doctor?\tSally: No, I\u2019m fine. No, it\u2019s not morning sickness. It\u2019S\u2026 it\u2019s just a little nausea. Nothing that chamomile tea can\u2019t fix. Besides, I heard somewhere that indigestion means the baby\u2019s gonna have a full head of hair.\tAdam: I have not heard that one.\tSally: Well, look it up. I\u2019m really sorry I worried you.\tAdam: It\u2019s unavoidable. I\u2019m the kid\u2019s father and you\u2019re right. That bond is unbreakable.\tAnnouncer: Next week on the young and the restless\u2026\tJeremy: Phyllis. Are you here? How is it that you\u2019re here right now?\tSummer: I need your help.\tChance: All right. What can I do for you?\tSummer: You and I are gonna expose my mom\u2019s murderer.\t", "Chance: Dominic does. He\u2019s a chancellor, right?\tAbby: Yes, he is and\u2026 and maybe one day, it\u2019ll all be his.\tChance: Yeah, of course. It\u2019s his birthright.\tAbby: You know, I just\u2013 I really don\u2019t feel comfortable living there without you and I get the feeling that nina doesn\u2019t want me there.\tChance: Yeah, she may have mentioned something like that to me as well. I tell you though, it\u2019s jill you need to worry about.\tAbby: Okay. Well, um\u2013 I\u2019ll leave. But um, maybe I can just keep dominic\u2019s things there and keep his room the same. He loves it there and then everything can just be exactly the way it is now, you know, when he visits you and I won\u2019t have to disrupt his life more than I already have.\tChance: That\u2019s fine with me. I\u2019m gonna do what\u2019s best for dom, whatever I think that is.\tAbby: Well, thank you, chance. Um\u2026 I hope you have a great rest of your day.\t[ Knocking on door ]\tNate: Hey.\tVictoria: Hi, come in.\tNate: I just got your text. Thought I\u2019d stop by before I bury my nose in these quarterly reports. What\u2019s going on?\tVictoria: I know that you did everything that you could to help phyllis last night.\tNate: Yeah. Thankfully, my medical training kicked back in.\tVictoria: Did you and elena figure out what was wrong with her?\tNate: No, and the lack of answers has been weighing on elena. She\u2019s been trying to figure out what we missed, wondering what we could have done to save her before she got into that ambulance.\tVictoria: What about you?\tNate: I have questions too, but I can let go in a way elena can\u2019T. Holding other people\u2019s lives in my hands is no longer my responsibility. So, yes, I do wonder what happened to phyllis, truly, but my focus is here at newman. Man: I\u2019m not slowing down anytime soon. ch?\t[ Adam sighs ]\tSally: Oh. Where are you rushing off to?\tAdam: Um, I\u2019m not sure. Um, nowhere?\tSally: Oh, well, you sure are in a hurry to get there. I\u2019m just here for some chamomile tea.\tAdam: Ah. What\u2019s wrong? You all right?\tSally: We\u2019re fine. Uh. But if going nowhere could wait a few minutes, maybe you\u2019d like to sit with me?\tNate: Did you have something specific you wanted to talk about when you sent me the text?\tVictoria: Yes. I wanted you to be the first person to know, outside of the family of course. That I am no longer pursuing mccall unlimited.\tNate: I thought that acquisition was the top priority for you. What changed?\tVictoria: Can I confess something to you, completely off the record?\tNate: Of course.\tVictoria: Well, I denied it to my father, but he was right. The whole mccall thing, it is about adam. Not just for me, but for all of us. If we do manage to acquire mccall, my father is determined to install adam as ceo. And I just keep asking myself if that is the case, why would I\u2026 and the company I run, hand adam an empire?\t[ Sally sighs ]\tAdam: I assume that you heard about phyllis.\tSally: Yeah, it\u2019s pretty awful.\tAdam: Yeah. How\u2019s nick doing? I know it can\u2019t be easy for him. I know there\u2019s a lot of\u2013 a lot of history there.\tSally: Uh, he\u2019s pretty torn up, especially for summer.\tAdam: I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d be able to console connor if chelsea\u2026\tSally: Yeah, he\u2019s struggling with not knowing how to make things better for her.\tAdam: Ah. That\u2019s one of the hardest things about parenting is accepting that you cannot protect your kids from everything. No matter how much you want to.\tSally: Well, I\u2019m about to find out what that\u2019s like.\tAdam: You will love your child like nobody else.\tSally: I am sure. Yeah, he\u2019s coping with his own grief too. I mean\u2013 I mean, he loved phyllis for a really long time.\tAdam: And you\u2019re not jealous of that?\tSally: No. I mean, he fell out of love with phyllis long before we ever got together and she is the mother of his child. And like you just said, that is a bond that nothing can break. (Male announcer) important information for viewers age 50 to 85.\tSally: Sounve but th a good sign,\tSally: You seemed pretty discombobulated when I first ran into you\u2026 heading out of here with no clear direction is never a good sign, where you\u2019re concerned.\tAdam: Yeah. Well, um\u2026 I thought that I was running towards something positive but those plans came to a screeching halt.\tSally: You care to elaborate?\tAdam: Victor was gonna buy a company that I was going to head.\tSally: Sounds promising.\tAdam: But then he pulled the rug out from under me.\tSally: Well, that sounds like victor.\tAdam: I\u2019m frustrated. Not only because he chose victoria over me, but, um\u2026 for a brief moment, I thought he might choose me.\tSally: Well, I\u2019m sorry that he hurt you again. I mean, we always want to believe the best in the people that we care about. That\u2019s why it is so devastating whenever they let us down. Look at it this way. If victor handed you a company to run, you would have to answer to him and you would be in a never-ending competition with victoria. Is that what you really want?\tAdam: Maybe not.\tSally: Everything I said to you when you were ceo of newman media still stands. You are intelligent and highly capable. You have one of the sharpest business minds I have ever seen. You do not need victor to succeed. All you need is you.\tSharon: So, I saw you with abby earlier. Is everything all right?\tChance: I don\u2019t really know how to answer that question. Yes. No. I mean, nothing\u2019s wrong, but\u2026 that wasn\u2019t exactly what you would call, uh, small talk, you know?\tSharon: Yeah. I\u2019ve been there. Marriage dissolves and you just try to remain civil and pleasant.\t", "Devon: I\u2019m being very logical about it. The only thing that matters to me is protecting our relationship, as brother and sister and as colleagues, I just want to hit the reset button.\tLily: Yeah. I mean, I want that too, of course, I do, you know, but I\u2013 I\u2019m scared, right? Like, what if we end up in the same place? Like, what if it happens again?\tDevon: It\u2019s not gonna happen again, we won\u2019t let it. And in order to do that, we have to have open communication between each other at all times. And have total honesty, even if it hurts each other\u2019s feelings.\tLily: Yeah. I mean, listen, I agree. I think last time we both had our own agenda, and we weren\u2019t honest with each other.\tDevon: Exactly. So, can we do that moving forward? Have total honesty?\t[ Lily sighing ]\tLily: Okay. Well, in light of total honesty. I mean, are you just doing this to mend things with me or because you\u2019re afraid of losing hamilton winters?\tDevon: Well, of course, I want to hang on to my company, but no, it\u2019s\u2013 the main part of all this is not losing my sister because we\u2019re all we have.\tLily: That\u2019s exactly what aunt mimi said.\tDevon: She\u2019s a smart woman. Now, I wanna be partners with you again and I wanna make something out of chancellor-winters that we can both be proud of. And that catherine and neil would be proud of.\t[ Lily inhaling ]\tLily: All right. Well, I gotta take yes for an answer.\tDevon: Yeah. Good. Cheers.\tLily: Cheers.\t[ Lily chuckling ]\tChance: Dom is fine, right?\tAbby: Yes. Yes, he\u2019s fine. I\u2019m sorry. I should have led with that.\tChance: Um. Okay. Well, I\u2019m not sure what else there is to talk about.\tAbby: Chance, I want to be um, completely transparent with you and this isn\u2019t gonna be easy to hear. Devon asked me and dominic to move in with him.\tChance: Hmm.\t[ Chance exhaling ] What do you want me to say here, abby?\tAbby: I haven\u2019t made any final decisions. I\u2013 I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do yet, but I just\u2013 I wanted to talk to you first because I don\u2019t want to make visitations any more uncomfortable than they already are.\tChance: Uncomfortable? How are they uncomfortable?\tAbby: They just are. You know that. And I don\u2019t want to do anything to add to it. And also, this is a pretty small town. People talk, so I know it\u2019ll be a point of gossip.\tChance: Well, I think everyone has other things on their mind at the moment.\tAbby: I know. And I know how busy you are. I just, um\u2026 I wanted to talk to you before I make a final decision.\tChance: You\u2019re actually asking for my opinion on this?\t[ Heavy footsteps ]\tVictor: Hey, son. I assume you heard about last night\u2019s events.\t[ Adam sighing ]\tAdam: I just found out from sharon. Uh, I mean, it\u2019s\u2013 what a tragedy.\tVictor: Yup.\tAdam: Phyllis and I, we weren\u2019t exactly close, but\u2026 she was never boring. There was times I thought we had a lot in common but, uh, obviously, um, I don\u2019t feel the loss others do.\tVictor: Well, I appreciate your candor.\tAdam: Well, then let\u2019s, uh, let\u2019s get to the point. What\u2019s going on with tucker\u2019s company?\tVictor: Well son, it seems we have hit the roadblock, you know.\tAdam: Another one?\tVictor: Yeah. Victoria is no longer interested in acquiring mccall unlimited.\tAdam: If I\u2019m not mistaken, newman enterprises still belongs to you. So, override her.\tVictor: Son, I put victoria in charge for a reason. And I\u2019m not gonna disrespect her decisions.\tAdam: Right. Because whenever it\u2019s a choice between me and victoria, it\u2019s not really a choice, it\u2019s game over.\tVictor: Son, please don\u2019t go there, all right? I have not given up on acquiring mccall unlimited. I just want us to rethink our approach.\tAdam: I don\u2019t think I\u2019m up for that, okay? Nothing is gonna change in our family hierarchy. Oh, I was just\u2013 I was fooling myself thinking that anything was gonna change. I think it\u2019s best that we go our separate ways, okay? I\u2019m gonna figure out my future on my own.\tDevon: How is, uh, daniel doing?\tLily: Well, I mean, he\u2019s distraught, obviously. He just kept talking over and over about how all of the ways that phyllis could have been saved.\tDevon: Yeah, that\u2019s what you do. Your mind goes in 100 different directions.\tLily: Yeah. Absolutely. And he kept beating himself up because, you know, they were in a bad place in her last days. And then he kept thinking maybe he contributed to the stress that made her pass out.\tDevon: He can\u2019t do that. He just has to take himself through it. I\u2019d like to think that I\u2019m more at peace with losing neil and hillary, but\u2026 you know that hole in your heart never goes away.\tLily: No. And unfortunately, daniel is just at the beginning of his journey.\tDevon: This whole thing with phyllis just reminds you that you gotta embrace life. And that\u2019s exactly what I intend to do and not just when it comes to business either.\tLily: Well, what else is going on?\tDevon: Well, I asked abby to move in with me.\tAbby: I\u2019m not as much asking your opinion on this as I am\u2013\tChance: Just go for it. I\u2019m sure dominic would love it. I assume that you and devon would too. So, no reason not to, right?\tAbby: I want to consider your feelings.\tChance: Let me worry about my feelings. And I\u2019m fine with it. Really.\tAbby: Okay. Well, um, if I do move out, then you should move back into the chancellor estate. It\u2019s your birthright.\tChance: It\u2019s just a house, abby.\tAbby: It\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s not just a house. It\u2013 it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s the chancellor house, a chancellor should live there.\t", "Sally: [ Big breaths ] Nate.\tNate: Hey.\tSally: Hey. Hey.\tNate: How\u2019s it going?\tSally: Um, not great. Actually, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m really sorry to bother you, but I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m not feeling very well.\tNate: Okay. Uh, in\u2013 in what way? What\u2019s the problem?\tSally: I think something might be wrong with my baby.\tDetective chancellor: Yeah, this is detective chancellor. I was hoping to find out when I could expect the toxicology report on the blood that was drawn from phyllis summers. I apologize for the rush request. I understand that these things take time. I could just really use this one as soon as possible. Okay. Thank you. Thank you for understanding. Yeah, I\u2019ll be expecting your call. All right.\tAbby: Hi, chance.\tAdam: Hey sharon. Can I, uh, get my usual?\tSharon: Uh. I\u2019m sorry, what?\tAdam: Uh, I was just trying to order some coffee. Everything okay?\tSharon: Yeah. Um\u2026 I\u2019m just having a hard time focusing this morning. I guess I\u2019m still processing. Wait, you don\u2019t know.\tAdam: Uh, apparently not. What is it that I don\u2019t know?\tSharon: Well, there\u2019s no easy way to say this, but\u2026 last night phyllis passed away.\tDevon: Hey.\tLily: Hey.\tDevon: Thank you for coming over. Yeah. I\u2013 I know it\u2019s been a heavy morning. How you doing?\tLily: I mean, I don\u2019t know. I was with daniel last night. I will say I know phyllis wasn\u2019t everyone\u2019s favorite person, but she loved her kids, and her kids loved her.\tDevon: Yeah. Of course. They have to be in shock right now.\tLily: Yeah.\tDevon: There\u2019s just\u2026 nothing ever prepares you for losing a parent this young in life. I\u2019m sure daniel\u2019s grateful though to have you around since, you know exactly what he\u2019s going through.\tLily: Yeah. Well, I wish you and I didn\u2019t know it so well.\tDevon: Me too. But\u2026 when you deal with loss, they can make you put things into perspective and realize that you can\u2019t wait around to right the wrongs in your life. You have to do it now while you\u2019re here, and while you can. Which is one of the reasons why I asked you to come over, actually. I want to continue our conversation about chancellor-winters.\tVictor: Thank you, sweetheart.\tVictoria: I can\u2019t stop thinking about nicholas.\tVictor: Yeah.\tVictoria: How\u2019s he doing?\tVictor: I think he needs some time.\tVictoria: Poor summer. My heart goes out to her.\tNikki: Thank you. I know. We saw her this morning. She seems to be teetering between being too composed and on the verge of a breakdown. And she\u2019s insisting on planning phyllis\u2019 memorial.\tVictoria: Well, she shouldn\u2019t have to deal with that right now. I can help her.\tNikki: No, she doesn\u2019t want any help.\tVictoria: Well, that\u2019s crazy. She\u2019s in no shape to take that on.\tNikki: No, she\u2019s not. But those are her wishes. So, I just told her that we\u2019re there for her and ready to help her with whatever she needs, and we\u2019ll give her her space.\tVictoria: Well, then I guess I shouldn\u2019t go see her today.\tNikki: It might be better if you wait for her emotions to settle down a bit.\tVictor: By the way, sweetheart. You saw tucker? How did that go?\tVictoria: Oh, well, that\u2019s very easy to answer. Nowhere.\tVictor: What? You weren\u2019t able to make any headway with him?\tVictoria: I withdrew our offer to buy the company. I\u2019m no longer interested in mccall unlimited.\tVictor: Why would\tVictor: Why would you withdraw the offer?\tVictoria: It\u2019s already been too much of a headache and I can only see more migraines in the future.\tVictor: You know damn well that a deal of this size brings with it headaches.\tVictoria: Well, in this case, the\u2013 the pitfalls outweigh any upside, both for the company and for the family. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it, dad. And I told tucker myself last night.\tVictor: This was not your decision to make alone. You should have consulted with your father.\tVictoria: I am the ceo of newman enterprises, aren\u2019t I?\tVictor: Are you forgetting who put you in this chair?\tVictoria: Then I take it that you don\u2019t agree with my decision.\tVictor: No, I don\u2019T. And all this nonsense about headaches and obstacles. The real issue is adam, isn\u2019t it?\tVictoria: You\u2019re mistaken. Adam is your concern. For me, it\u2019s all about the business and what\u2019s best for the business.\tVictor: That\u2019s what you keep on saying.\tVictoria: Yes. Well, I\u2019ve reevaluated the pros and the cons and the potential risks. Now, you know what? I just changed my mind. Yes, dad. And you know what? There\u2019s no potential room for growth. There\u2019s just not. I would be so happy to show you the numbers.\tVictor: And I\u2019m sure you called all the numbers to support your position. What I\u2019m questioning is is your motivation.\tVictoria: I always have this company and our family\u2019s best interests at heart. That\u2019s my motivation, dad. And if you don\u2019t believe that, then why did you trust me to be the custodian of your legacy?\tVictor: Why are you so reluctant to have adam reunite with his family? Why are you so against him having his own success?\tVictoria: How is handing him a company a success of his own? Look, if you want to acquire mccall unlimited and hand it to adam, well, by all means, feel free to do so. But do it independent of newman because this company should have no part of it.\tVictor: Don\u2019t ever forget who handed you this company.\tAdam: In the blink of an eye, phyllis is gone. What was she doing marrying stark of all people? That sounds off. I\u2019m sure.\tSharon: Sadly, we\u2019ll never be able to ask her.\tAdam: Uh, have you spoken to nick about it?\tSharon: Well, not since last night. I was with him when all of the information was rolling in and then when phyllis\u2019 death was confirmed, obviously, he was very focused on summer.\t", "Adam: Hmm. Well, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll reach out to you when he gets the chance to.\tSharon: I hope he does. You know, he was really there for me when ray died and I want him to know that I can be that person for him now, especially since the situations are so similar.\tAdam: You two have been through something like this before. Together. I\u2019m sure that he will reach out.\tSharon: Losing cassie and ray, I feel especially qualified to help people through this. I know what it feels like when fate reaches out and snatches the person you love and the inevitable guilt of things that were said, things that were left unsaid and how that weighs on you.\tAdam: Sharon, nick will reach out. Okay? And you will be a great comfort to him. But you can\u2019t be everything to everyone all the time, even though you try. You have to take care of yourself too.\tSharon: I will, if you will.\tAdam: [ Laughs ] Deal.\t[ Sighs ] I, um, have been summoned. Can we pick this up later?\tSharon: Yeah, of course.\tAdam: Okay. I\u2019ll check back in with you.\tSharon: Yeah.\tAbby: The news about phyllis is sickening.\tChance: Yeah. Um, I feel sorry for summer and for daniel.\tAbby: Yeah. You never expect that it\u2019s gonna be the last time that you see someone. But thank you so much for your hard work. I know the family really appreciates it.\tChance: Just doing my job. Anyway. Nice to runing into you.\tAbby: Wait, chance. Um\u2013 I don\u2019t want to intrude at a time like this, but I\u2019ve been looking for you. There\u2019s something that we need to discuss.\tDevon: Everything changed for me last night. Just being in that room and seeing those pictures on the wall and hearing his favorite music all night long.\tLily: I know. I felt like he was there with us.\tDevon: Yeah. And I\u2019m sure he was. And then, hearing about the news of phyllis this morning, it reminded me about that day that we lost him all over again. And made me think about how we really don\u2019t have a lot of time here on this planet. And the most important thing is keeping the people that you love close to you.\tLily: I agree. I do. I mean, time is a really valuable resource, and I really don\u2019t want to waste any more of it.\tDevon: Yeah. Neither do I, at all. You know, you\u2019re my sister. I love you and there should never be anything that\u2019s bigger than that. Oh, I wanna give our partnership at chancellor-winters a second shot.\tNate: I gotta say, I\u2013 I thought you looked a little different at the gala. But, uh, I learned a long time ago to never assume a woman is pregnant.\tSally: Good call. Yeah, I\u2013 I haven\u2019t told a lot of people and I promise I\u2019m not in the habit of just flagging down doctors as they\u2019re casually walking by. So, I thank you, uh, for stopping and listening. Um. Sometimes after I eat, I get nauseous, and I get this, like, fluttering feeling in my stomach and I just am not really sure it\u2019s normal.\tNate: Okay. Well, I can\u2019t be 100% certain and this wouldn\u2019t be an official diagnosis. Okay? Uh. Who\u2019s your obstetrician?\tSally: Dr. Chandler.\tNate: Good, good. She\u2019s the best. You should probably schedule an appointment with her just to be sure. But from what you\u2019ve told me, I\u2019m confident I know what\u2019s going on.\tSally: Okay. Can you connect the dots for me?\tNate: Well, that weird fluttery feeling happens after you eat, right?\tSally: Mm-hmm.\tNate: And then you tend to get relief once you walk around a bit.\tSally: Yeah. Yeah. That\u2019s right.\tNate: Is it possible you get this feeling after you\u2019ve eaten a little too much?\tSally: Uh. Well, an omelet, toast, and double hash browns. So, yes, it\u2019s possible.\tNate: And you\u2019re feeling mild nausea but nowhere near morning sickness.\tSally: Yes.\tNate: Well, I think what\u2019s happening is a cause for celebration.\tSally: What exactly am I celebrating?\tNate: The baby is starting to move.\t[ Laughs ] -What\u2019s he doing? -He\u2019s cleaning the trash cans. I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m playing catch up now.\tSally: So, when I eat, the baby eats as well and the food\u2019s not only providing me with energy, but the baby too.\tNate: Someone was napping in biology class.\tSally: Is it that obvious? I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m playing catch up now. It\u2019s just there\u2019s something new every day.\tNate: So, you\u2019re right. The nutrition gives the baby a little boost, which in turn contributes to your queasiness.\tSally: So, when I get up and I move around, it\u2019s like I\u2019m rocking my little guy or girl to sleep, which is\u2013 soothes them, so the fluttering eases up.\tNate: That\u2019s pretty much it.\tSally: Thank you, nate. You have excellent bedside manner for a media executive.\tNate: I would take that as a compliment. Well, it looks like my take-out order\u2019s here, if you\u2019re good.\tSally: Uh. Yeah, please go enjoy some nausea free carbs for me. And if you wouldn\u2019t mind keeping this to yourself.\tNate: It\u2019s not my news to share. But, um, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to leave you with some words of advice. Just three things. Try to eat frequent smaller meals, opposed to fewer large ones, okay? That should lessen the discomfort of sharing a full stomach with a growing baby. Two, chamomile tea helps with digestion.\tSally: Ah, good to know. What\u2019s the third?\tNate: Cherish these moments. They don\u2019t last forever.\tLily: Ah. Okay. Um, you wanna come back to chancellor-winters?\tDevon: Mm-hmm.\tLily: Have you thought about this enough?\tDevon: I don\u2019t need to give it a lot of time. I can feel like it\u2019s the right thing to do.\tLily: Well, is this because of what happened yesterday? Because I mean, that was a lot for everyone.\tDevon: What do you think? This is just like an emotional decision I\u2019m making?\tLily: Well, I just wanna make sure that it\u2019s not, you know. Our\u2013 our company, our relationship has been through a lot of turmoil. So, I wanna make sure that we\u2019re being logical about this.\t"], "answer": [3, 4, 2, 1, 0]}

Thank you. Now, would you mind swearing to that in front of a judge and jury? [ Laughs ] I mean, it couldn\u2019t hurt, right?\tMichael: Well, I think we\u2019re gonna keep daniel\u2019s support of our case kinda safely tucked into our back pocket until we figure out a way to fit him into our narrative. I mean, there are a lot of moving parts, and elements of this case are changing every day.\tDiane: I know, I know. Let the professionals do their job.\tKyle: You sure there\u2019s nothing we can do, dad, to make this more bearable for mom?\tJack: We have the very best lawyer. With any luck, we will find the evidence we need.\tMichael: Yeah, and\u2013 and the proof we\u2019re looking for, uh, it can be a bit slippery. That\u2019s why we didn\u2019t wanna raise your hopes.\tDiane: Oh, well, I\u2019m sorry to disappoint you, but you already have. I have daniel in my corner now. So good things can happen. I\u2019ll just\u2026 I\u2019ll just keep hoping for more. All right.\tKyle: See that? The way she latched on to daniel\u2019s support?\tJack: I am not going to break her heart with more false promises.\tKyle: We need phyllis.\tMichael: We\u2019ve gotta get her to come back home.\tDaniel: And make it safe for her to turn herself in. No prison time.\tMichael: I can\u2019t even begin to touch that case. I\u2019m focused on diane. And we say nothing to her until we have phyllis in hand.\tNate: Truth is, I\u2019m not the same man I was when elena and I met. I want different things.\tVictoria: You were both doctors.\tNate: Those hours, that lifestyle, it was so easy to just fall into a rhythm. Everything became so routine.\tVictoria: That\u2019s natural. But it just seemed like your heart wasn\u2019t in it anymore.\tNate: Mmm. Once this went, the passion for the job did too. And after that, the relationship. But\u2026 coming here, it made me see my world in a new light. Who I am. The man I wanna be.\tVictoria: And who is that?\tNate: Who they say I am in the papers. Unstoppable and exceeding expectations.\tVictoria: You\u2019re on that road.\tNate: But when it comes to relationships, I am lost.\tVictoria: Maybe I was right when I said that you needed more than elena could give you.\tNate: She wants the version of me that doesn\u2019t exist anymore. And she just couldn\u2019t understand it or accept it. But\u2026 I never wanted her to get hurt.\tVictoria: No, of course not.\tNate: But I wouldn\u2019t have allowed myself to act on this connection I feel toward you if I hadn\u2019t been looking for something else. Something more.\tSally: [ Sighs ] You can\u2019t say things like that, adam.\tAdam: Look, that\u2019s not what I meant. Okay, maybe it came out the wrong way. You\u2019ll have to forgive me.\t[ Sighs ] Sometimes when we were together, it\u2019s like nothing has changed between us.\tSally: Yeah, but everything has. And I don\u2019t want you to lose sight of that, \u2019cause\u2026 I haven\u2019T.\tAdam: Okay, wait. You\u2013 you think what I said was some grand romantic pronouncement?\tSally: I think it just slipped out, which makes it even more dangerous than if it was a planned attack. Look, we\u2013 we have boundaries. And I think you need to do a better job of paying attention.\tAdam: You think that I need to watch what I say?\tSally: If that\u2019s what it takes. Look, I want you to be a part of this child\u2019s life and to be the best father that you can be. But that is all that I want from you.\tAdam: Um, look, I\u2013 I realize that you were trying to do the right thing\u2013\tSally: You need to stop accidentally saying things that you shouldn\u2019t say to someone who isn\u2019t yours.

Just give yourself time to breathe.\tElena: Yeah, and what about the podcast I\u2019m supposed to do with newman?\tNick: You can do whatever you want. I\u2019m serious. It\u2019s your call. You can keep it. You can kick it to the curb. We can find some workaround. We can make sure you will never see nate if you want. You could even work remotely if you\u2019d like. But you never have to see him.\tElena: Must be tough for you. Not having the same luxury, with your family expanding in unexpected ways.\tNick: [ Chuckles ] Ah.

Uh, well, I have some wonderful ideas that I think you\u2019re gonna love\u2013\tSally: No, no\u2013 the answer is no.\tNick: Well, it\u2019s great to put a face to the voice on the other end of the phone.

She and summer need to know. We need to get them here.\tMichael: No one can know. End of story.\tKyle: My mother\u2019s get-out-of-jail card is out there somewhere, alive. Why do we have to keep this under wraps?\tMichael: Oh. You\u2019re that guy.\tKyle: What guy?\tMichael: You know that one guy who\u2019s never kept a secret from his mother or his wife? Give me a break. And give that guy a medal. You\u2019re a saint, kyle. Oh, but you\u2019re also the one that we\u2019ll point to when the judge asks, \u201cwho unleashed a fury of this magnitude?\u201d\tKyle: Phyllis is alive. Summer needs to know so she can stop grieving her mother and treating mine like she\u2019s a murderer.\tMichael: That\u2019s the warm and tender version. But in the real world, where we live, you\u2019ll pay now and for the rest of your days.\tKyle: Michael, I don\u2019t see how that may be.\tMichael: Well, if diane finds out that phyllis tried to frame her for murder, she will gnaw off her ankle, hunt phyllis down, and there won\u2019t be anything left to bury.\tKyle: Summer needs to know that daniel saw phyllis.\tDaniel: No, she doesn\u2019T.\tJack: I promised diane\u2013\tMichael: Gentlemen, gentlemen. Sometimes secrets are kept out of kindness, or to avoid false hopes or massive bloodshed. This is definitely the latter. So leave it alone until we can come up with solid evidence.\tDaniel: Yeah. Total silence. We all need to be quiet until we can be sure that we can bring my mom back safely.\tMichael: Diane!\tJack: Hey there.\tDiane: Hello. I thought I heard voices.\tJack: I hope we didn\u2019t disturb you.\tDiane: Is there news about the case? Is there something I should know?

I just thought he would be the one to make such a reckless decision.\tSally: Reckless?\tAdam: I\u2013 I don\u2019t know. Brave? Crazy? Call it what you want. I\u2013 I\u2019m giving you a chance to write your own ticket, sally. To choose your own job, to create your own culture. It\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to design the job of your dreams.\tSally: Just so we\u2019re clear, just because I\u2019m with your brother doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t make my own decisions.\tAdam: Okay. Of course you do. That\u2019s why I gave you carte blanche. Hasty of me. I\u2013 I guess I was just excited about the idea of us working together again.\t[ Adam sighs ] You know, it wasn\u2019t that bad at newman media, was it?\tSally: We had our moments.\tAdam: We can have them again. But this time on our own terms, answering to no one.\tSally: We were lightning in a bottle, adam.\tAdam: You can\u2019t tell me that you don\u2019t want that again.\tSally: I want different things now. And I have made my decision. There isn\u2019t a newman alive who will ever sign my paychecks again.\tElena: So, how long have you known about nate and victoria?\tNick: For reasons I hope you understand, I cannot talk about that or answer any questions on the topic.\tElena: Fair. I am in a kill-the-messenger kinda mood.\tNick: I will say, we can start with \u201cnate is a complete jackass.\u201d\tElena: True.\tNick: And you deserve so much more than him.

Ice cream. What do you say we crush some mint chocolate chip or cookie dough? Whatever you want.\tElena: You\u2019ve got yourself a deal.\tNick: All right.\tDiane: Michael, I didn\u2019t realize you were coming by.\tMichael: How are you, diane?\tDiane: So\u2026 who\u2019s going to be the one to tell me what this is all about?\tJack: We were just brainstorming.\tDiane: Oh!

Thank you.\tSally: And I will see to it that you receive a regular report of the baby\u2019s health and growth.\tAdam: That\u2019s very considerate of you.\tSally: Okay. Maybe we both can find a level of contact that works for us. For all four of us. It\u2019s for the best. And you\u2019ll agree with me\u2026 eventually. Goodbye, adam.\t[ Sighs ]\tNate: Wow. That\u2019s a hell of a question.\tVictoria: Was that too forward?\tNate: I didn\u2019t say that. I just wasn\u2019t expecting it. Where do I want things to go?\t[ Exhales ] Huh\u2026 you first.\tVictoria: All right. Well, to put it simply, I want more of you. More time with you. I wanna get to know you more.\tNate: Well, we want the same things. We just have to be careful on how we go about getting it.\tVictoria: I understand that. I know that you need time to mourn your relationship. And I\u2019m definitely gonna keep a respectful distance.\tNate: Oh, and you think that\u2019ll make a difference? That I\u2019ll want you any less?\t[ Chuckles ] If anything, avoidance will make things worse. Waiting and wanting you?\tVictoria: There\u2019s no rush, right? Neither one of us is going anywhere. Besides that, anticipation is fun, I think.\tJack: I know you are frustrated. I\u2019m frustrated too. But we have something we didn\u2019t have before: The key to saving diane and ending summer\u2019s grief.\tKyle: But what good is it if we can\u2019t tell anyone?\tJack: We will, when all the pieces are in place. Look, it isn\u2019t perfect, but, look, there have been improvements. Summer no longer feels she has to wage war against diane. And you saw how touched she was by daniel\u2019s support.\tKyle: Yeah. And think of how great they\u2019ll feel when they find out the truth.\tJack: Think how great they will feel when they find out the irrefutable proof that we have. We have no idea where it is or when it will ever come back to town. We can\u2019t give them false promises.\tKyle: But we can\u2019t keep this a secret forever.\tJack: No, of course we can\u2019T. You\u2019re right. There\u2019s gotta be another way. Uh\u2026 I\u2019m gonna call christine. Can you give me just that much time?\tKyle: Christine? Michael\u2013\tJack: No\u2013 I\u2013 yeah, I\u2019m gonna ask if she will meet with me. If she will, I\u2013 I will meet with her and come right back to you.

Yeah.\tSally: Why are you telling me now?\tNick: I was with someone tonight who reminded me that things are complicated. And they really are. I\u2019m crazy about you, sally. I, uh\u2026 I think about you every minute of the day. You\u2019re the best thing that\u2019s happened to me in a very long time.\tSally: Even though your family is ready to disown you or lock you away until you come to your senses?\tNick: There isn\u2019t anything or anyone that is gonna keep me away from you.\tSally: Promise?\tNick: You\u2019re stuck with me.\tSally: Good.

About where we are?\tNate: Hmm. Part of me is thrilled. The other part of me feels like we had a contract negotiation about our relationship.\tVictoria: Well, I do prefer to keep my drama in the bedroom. And occasionally in the office.\tNate: Ooh. Well, your secret\u2019s safe with me.\tVictoria: I know. All right. Come on, hastings, let\u2019s get your private life in order.

Unless, of course, you have to work later.\tElena: No. I got my shift covered for a favor I did for a friend. Which, you know, is really reassuring. It\u2019s nice to know that there are still people in the world that believe in fairness and honoring commitments.\tNick: Yeah. You know what? Tonight\u2019s on me.\tElena: No. You\u2019re not paying anything. It\u2019s not your fault that nate has no moral compass. But\u2026 if you do want to make up for your sister, you could cover my hotel bill.\tNick: Really hate what she did, but that is not gonna happen.\tElena: \u2018Cause she\u2019s family. I get it. And I promise I will not trash her in front of you. At least not right now.\tNate: Is that the good stuff?\tVictoria: [ Chuckles ] It\u2019s the decent stuff.

Will you respect my decision?\tAdam: Sally\u2026 what don\u2019t I respect about you?\tDiane: Jack, you were about to tell me why daniel is sure that I\u2019m not going to prison.\tJack: I think daniel just meant that if he thinks you\u2019re innocent, it should be very easy to persuade a judge that you are.\tMichael: Isn\u2019t that right, daniel?\tDaniel: Um, yeah.

I\u2019ve always known he was involved.\tDaniel: I\u2013 I think it\u2019s a shame how he used you and my mom just to build his bank account and get revenge.\tDiane: So you really believe me?\tDaniel: I do.\tDiane: Really? I mean, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just my life has been such a nightmare lately, and I\u2019ve almost given up hope. I mean, I\u2019m wearing this ankle monitor, but\u2026 but now I have your belief in me. And, I mean, if you can believe me with all the manufactured evidence that\u2019s out there, then anything\u2019s possible, right? Look, I know how passionately summer believes that I\u2019m guilty, so I can only imagine what this is costing you. I mean, I\u2013 I know it\u2019s just so hard to figure out the right thing to do when your whole world is turned upside-down. So your secret\u2019s safe with us, daniel. You\u2019re a good man.

She knows coming back here, she could be charged for stark\u2019s murder.\tJack: She should be arrested as soon as they find her, for her security, for our safety. She needs to testify or sign a sworn statement.\tKyle: Summer will run out there and find phyllis herself.\tDaniel: It\u2019s one of the many reasons why we agreed that we have to hold off on telling her.\tKyle: Hey, you\u2019re not the ones who have to look into her eyes every day.

I\u2019ll be in touch.\tJack: Okay, go ahead. Say it. I know you have very strong feelings against my decision.\tKyle: I hate it. Summer needs to know.\tJack: Well, she will know eventually. We can\u2019t tell her\u2013\t[ Stammers ] Why are you being so insistent on this?\tKyle: Because I know what it\u2019s like to have people tell you that your mother is dead. I look into her eyes and I know what she feels, how much she misses her, how much it hurts. How she wants to hold her one more time, make more memories. Thing is? She can do all of that, because her mother is out there somewhere, alive. But I have a wife who is crying herself to sleep and blaming my mother for phyllis\u2019s supposed death. We could be out there living our lives again. I\u2019m not doing this any longer. I am telling summer.\tNate: I\u2019m not sure what I was looking for. This is all uncharted territory for me.

It\u2019s wonderful for the skin, uh, as is, uh, Mediterranean heat. Yeah, I heard that, uh, you were apprehended on an island off Greece. We\u2019re a host of international crimes. Oh, news travels. Fires. Mm-hmm. So what are you doing here in Salem?\tI cut a deal with the, is. So that I\u2019d be incarcerated here. And why would the ISA even consider giving you a deal with everything you\u2019ve done? They were desperate to find Kayla Johnson. And I told the feds that a former associated mine, Thomas Banks, was the one absconded with her. Thomas, Ugh. That disgusting little creep.\tI mean he masqueraded as me in Monte Carla. I can\u2019t even believe some SAP actually believed that that hideous little creature was yours. Truly,\tI God, everyone\u2019s at the desk. Good.

I just wanted some quality time with my. Yeah, I understand and thank you, and still I know that it was my fault that she didn\u2019t have the opportunity to say goodbye to her mother. She was so upset. Not that she didn\u2019t have every right to be, she did, but I\u2019m just explaining to you why we broke up and now she\u2019s with Chad.\tYeah. Anyway, when I heard this news about Kayla being alive, I realized that maybe I didn\u2019t rob Stephanie of her last moments with her mother after all, and I know they still have to find her. It\u2019s either that or I live with this guilty conscience forever.\tWe didn\u2019t get anywhere at the Dive Verna last night, but we will continue looking for banks today. We\u2019ll keep you updated. You know, it\u2019s really too bad we didn\u2019t have much success last night at the. I wouldn\u2019t say that. I mean, we didn\u2019t find Thomas Banks, but we had some fun, especially during our dance.\tYes.\tOh, it\u2019s room service. Throw some clothes on. Could you? Oh, uh, yeah, yeah, I got it.\tSo why would Thomas Banks kidnap Taylor Johnson unless. Did you order it? Why would I do that? Kayla is of no use to me now. Right. Oh. And just what we planning to do with her back at the ranch with Dr. Ralph, she, Marlene and Kate were going to be Ralph\u2019s human Guinea pigs. It was going to be a monumental scientific breakthrough for all of humanity.\tHmm. Let me just take a wild guess here. You were mostly interested in what it could do for you. Am I right? No comment. Fine. All right. Then answer this. If someone was going to bite it, why couldn\u2019t it bend? Marlena Yk. If it had been my choice. Oh, it wasn\u2019t? No it wasn\u2019t. One of the employees went a bit rogue Thomas.\tIt had to have been. I mean, they didn\u2019t find anyone else on that island except for Rolf. Right. Tell me where are you getting your information from? It sounds like you\u2019ve downloaded the ISA intelligence report. I am aware of everything that concerns my family. Listen, change the subject you just threw Poor Thomas under the bus and that is a.\tNature major breach of the Damer Code of ethics for maintaining loyal employees. Look, I had to give the ISA a, and they knew that Thomas had been one of my hired guns, so, so you lied. Why? Hmm. I\u2019m for whom? If Thomas didn\u2019t take Kayla, then who did? Huh?\tSis hatch. Oh, don\u2019t mind the gun. It\u2019s just an insurance. Where were you, Bo? Fishing. Fishing. Yeah. You\u2019re kidding. Right? Go. I made you some stew with fresh sea bass. Beats the anchovy rations we had when we were in the merchant marina. You are holding us hostage here and you are out fishing. Yeah, indeed. I asked for your help.\tYou didn\u2019t give it willingly, so, so what about Steve? Why is he here? Got in my way. What about hope? Why don\u2019t you wanna see her? Oh my God. Okay. As I recall, she hated and really kind of misunderstood why I grew to love and admire my father. So since that\u2019s the direction my life is, No reason to have her in it.\tNo. That may be the story you tell yourself, but it\u2019s a lie. It\u2019s not that hope misunderstands you, it\u2019s that she understands you too well, and you don\u2019t like that you\u2019re afraid she\u2019s gonna break through to you and that scares the hell outta you, doesn\u2019t it?\tNow enough talking more work. I don\u2019t see much of that going on down here. I wonder why you wanted the prism. I went and got it for you. You told me that you\u2019d get the information off of it. I told you. That\u2019s what I thought. Okay. You don\u2019t seem to understand. The clock is ticking. Your daughter has found her way to Greece.\t", "What? What? Stephanie\u2019s here and it\u2019s just a matter of time before she or hope. Find out that you are missing. I can\u2019t keep putting them off. And if either one of them gets in my way,\tcome on. How can you say it\u2019s ir? Of course you want Marlena, buy your side every second because she\u2019s the love of your life. And it\u2019s like, you just, it\u2019s like you just got her back, you got a second chance with her. And then dad, everyone\u2019s happy for you. I\u2019m happy for you. Hell, I\u2019m, I\u2019m envious of you. Ah, come on, come on, come on.\tNo. Hey, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m comparing my relationship with Chloe, yours and Marlene\u2019s. It\u2019s just that, hey, you mean even though your love for Chloe hasn\u2019t gone on for decades? Still doesn\u2019t use the pain when things go wrong, and yeah, doc told me that it\u2019s. It\u2019s a rough go right now with, uh, with, with Chloe and Rachel.\tRough. Yeah. Rough, rough. R That doesn\u2019t even describe it. What makes me so infuriating? It\u2019s all because Kristen manipulated the whole scenario to her advantage. She set out to make sure that Rachel hated Chloe, and she did it. She succeeded in it and that I don\u2019t have a clue how to fix it. Not a clue. I never deny that Thomas was the one who took Kayla and you never confirmed it.\tWhy don\u2019t you just tell me the truth? Why would I, why would I tell you anything? I don\u2019t know. You having heard of sisterly bonding, my sister Renee died before I knew her, so I\u2019ve never actually had a sister. Mommy neither. I mean, there was Lexi, but I barely knew her. On the other hand, so many male siblings, aka brothers, I don\u2019t know them either.\tNo, I do want to come on. It\u2019s obvious that you haven\u2019t talked to anyone in decades. I mean, except for misfits, hostages and dead people. Yeah, I Where you can find it. Someone normal, someone you\u2019re related to. Come on. I mean, not only. Can we be sisters, but we can be sisters in crime? Well, there\u2019s definitely at least one thing that we have in common, a desire to get out of this place.\tRight? So why don\u2019t I scratch your back? You scratch my, what do you say sis?\tSo this urgency to find out about Kayla, it seems to be about more than just assuaging your guilty conscience. Well, I mean, of course I want Stephanie\u2019s mother to be alive. She\u2019s an amazing person, a well-respected doctor. So many people love her just like you. So you came all the way over here. Say what a wonderful doctor Kayla is and what a wonderful doctor I am.\tI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting at. It seems to me that Stephanie broke up with you because she felt you had cost her the last moment she would\u2019ve had with her mother, and now that now that her mother\u2019s alive. I wonder if you\u2019re thinking perhaps. You have a second chance with her?\tUh, Stephanie Chad, please come in. Uh, Seth. Where\u2019s your dad? We don\u2019t know. Yeah, we went to his room. It wasn\u2019t there. Oh. Uh, Harris, this is my niece Stephanie. This is Chad Dara. This is Harris Michaels. He\u2019s helping us look for. Yeah, I know who this man is. He was back in Seattle that he delivered pizzas to me and my family.\tOne of them literally blew up in my face. Stephanie, I\u2019m, I\u2019m, I\u2019m sorry. I really am. I can\u2019t tell you how much I regret my actions during that time. I assume you weren\u2019t seriously injured. I ended up in the hospital, but I recovered pretty quickly. Thank God for that. I just hope you couldn\u2019t accept my apology.\tWell, I do understand that you weren\u2019t yourself. My dad went through something very similar a while back, so yes, I do accept your apology, especially because you\u2019re helping me look for my mom. I\u2019m grateful for your understanding. I\u2019m grateful for everyone\u2019s efforts in trying to find my mom, but now I\u2019m worried about my dad too.\tWhy? He just texted us, said that he was with you. What? But he isn\u2019t, obviously, and we haven\u2019t heard from him since before we left Salem. My God, my dad\u2019s in trouble listening.\tAre you okay? Fine. Jesus. Don\u2019t pull that crap again. What? Huh? Come on buddy. Pull that trigger. No, stop it. I know. He just had plenty of chances to kill me and he hasn\u2019t done it yet. That can be arranged. Oh, I don\u2019t think you have it in yet. Stop it. Don\u2019t prove me wrong. Come on, stop it. No, I\u2019m waiting. Pull the trigger.\tDo it.\tDr. Evans, this was so good of you. I\u2019m gonna pay you for a session. Absolutely not. Oh, yes, yes, yes. You just got back in here. You are trying to help me. You deserve to be compensated. No, I\u2019ve been away for a while and right now it feels really good. It\u2019d be working. Are you sure? I\u2019m sure. But\tyou could answer my question.\tOkay. Um, well, I guess I haven\u2019t thought that much about getting back with Stephanie. Um, I guess maybe because, uh, As confident as I may seem, you know, being a halfway attractive guy, um, Stephanie was the only woman I truly loved and, uh, being rejected by her really painful.\t", "Yo, I\u2019ll tell you one thing though. It was great meeting the famous Dr. I know\tMarlena said that she would keep working with Rachel. I mean, not, not, not officially working with her, but she\u2019s just talking things through with her. Yeah. She\u2019s really the only mother figure that Rachel has. Right. Well, we really adore that little girl.\tSo have you, have you taken Rachel to see Kristen lately? No. No. The only, the only time she\u2019s seen her mother recently is when she took that solo adventure to Statesville. Kristen keeps hounding me, but Dad, I don\u2019t want Kristen poisoning her mind any. I just declined her call a little while ago. Oh, I see.\tSo you think it\u2019s okay to, uh, to freeze her out? I, I, I, I mean, I mean, if, if Rachel. Thanks that you\u2019re trying to keep her from seeing her mother here. She\u2019s gonna dig in even more. You know that. Yeah, I know that. I don\u2019t. As much as we would like it not to be true in this particular case, there\u2019s a strong bond between mother and daughter.\tI am not so sure that can be broken.\tLook, uh, we may be sisters, but even so, it does take a little time to trust someone. Don\u2019t you agree? What the hell are you getting at? Just not quite ready to play True confessions. Well, it\u2019s time for me to go get settled into my new home, away from home, cuz it looks like I\u2019m gonna be here for a while.\tTheoretically, at least\tno one controls me. Megan just woke me up to who I am. No, this is not you, Bo. Oh yeah. What do I have to show for that pansy ass? You say I was? How about a son and two daughters and two beautiful grandchildren, Bo and another one on the way. What? Is he pregnant? Yes. Do you hear that? Isn\u2019t that wonderful news?\tI mean, it\u2019s a blessing Bo, isn\u2019t it? Bo? This makes what I\u2019m doing that much more important. What are you talking about? I\u2019m gonna build an empire like my father did. Make something on myself, bro. They want you. They don\u2019t want some kriyas to want to be, it\u2019s like I told you before, whether the Brady\u2019s were lacking in wealth.\tWe made up for how much we\u2019ve loved each other. Come on. You know that, you know, the most valuable thing is that not just a bunch of numbers in a. You have to see that. What I see is that you\u2019re wasting my time.

You have Thomas and Charlotte to think about. Nothing is gonna happen to me. Okay? And I\u2019m not letting you do this alone. We\u2019re gonna be fine. We got each other.\tOh, hey Doc. Oh, hi. Hi. Yeah, you got some flowers, but you know what? Mine are better. They are because they\u2019re my favorites and because they\u2019re from you, I love. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

He didn\u2019t shoot me. He won\u2019t. But he could have. And now Stephanie\u2019s here. Don\u2019t, don\u2019t worry about Stephanie. If he can\u2019t hurt me, he\u2019s not gonna hurt his own niece. He\u2019s not as dangerous as he pretends to be.\tBaby. Listen, hope and Michaels have to be wondering where I am now. Okay? Hope is gonna follow the breadcrumbs. They\u2019re gonna find us. You hear me? They\u2019re gonna find us.\tThis warehouse is huge. There\u2019s a lot of places for someone to be soaking around. What was that? Oh my God.\tI\u2019m Hope Brady Isa. I\u2019m looking for a colleague. He was supposedly here yesterday, but hasn\u2019t been seen since. Name\u2019s Steve Johnson. Doesn\u2019t sound familiar. You give me. Actually, I can do better than that. Ah, yes. The director of the ISA said he was an imposter, took him into custody. Shane Donovan took him into custody.\tNo. Okay. What, hold on a second, just to be clear. This, uh, this is the man who took Steve Johnson to custody. No, that, that\u2019s not him. But this is Shane Donovan. So who\u2019s the man who took Steve? Mr. Johnson\u2019s custody.\t", "So I guess maybe I\u2019m, uh, just afraid getting. Again,\tyou\u2019re feeling vulnerable because you have very deep feelings for her. I do. I guess all this, um, discussion is just bringing all these, um, subconscious thoughts to the. That\u2019s how therapy works. Right? Right. I am realizing as I sit here with you, um, part of me is hoping that if they do find her mom, maybe Stephanie will be able to get past what happened.\tShe and I could be together again, straight to voice. Damnit. Hannah, what are you thinking? That it\u2019s possible someone else has your dad\u2019s phone because they\u2019ve taken him and they want us to think that he\u2019s okay, which means that he\u2019s not. It\u2019s, it\u2019s, it\u2019s, it\u2019s Okay. Wh where and when did you last see him?\tWell, we, we split up yesterday. Yeah. Helping, I follow the lead on Thomas Banks. That was the dead end. Steve went to the local police station to take a look at Wolf\u2019s personal effects to see if that could give us a clue on your mother\u2019s whereabouts. Did it? Well, we don\u2019t know. We haven\u2019t seen him since then.\tLet\u2019s go to the PD for now. That\u2019s the only lead we\u2019ve got. No, it\u2019s not the only lead.\tWhat the hell is the matter with you Bo? Next time it\u2019s your brains. Oh man. It made me go on ways to perfectly good red. No, he didn\u2019t do anything. This is all you Bo, because you\u2019re trying to be somebody that you are not. Who I\u2019m not is Sean Brady\u2019s son. The one who never fit in was never a Brady. No, that is not true.\tOf course, you were. You still are. And if you\u2019re not proud of that, if you think it\u2019s better to be a curus, corrupt and greedy, selling your soul and your heart for money and power, and you\u2019re a damn fool and a co. You don\u2019t think I\u2019m capable of killing? That\u2019s why you keep pushing me. I put a bullet in Kate Roberts.\tOh, you need to listen to me. You don\u2019t need to do any of this. What you\u2019re thinking, what you\u2019re feeling right now is because of what Megan Hathaway did to you. For your information, Megan Hathaway\u2019s been captured. She\u2019s in Statesville Prison as we speak. Are you gonna let that crazy woman control you from an ocean away?\tOkay. Since we\u2019re sharing secrets, how about you star?\tOh, you were chatty Cathy a minute ago. Now you\u2019re not willing to share. I see how this works. Oh fine. Don\u2019t tell me who has Kayla. I will figure it out on my own. Good luck with that. Oh, screw luck. I\u2019m excellent at deductive reasoning. And you know what, you just give up. Thomas Banks, your trusty right hand man.\tBull. See whoever took. Is someone that you\u2019re protecting. See, I think I\u2019m getting close. She\u2019s better than Sudoku. See, whoever you\u2019re protecting is someone that you care about. And as I know, you never cared about anyone in your entire life. I mean, maybe father, but he\u2019s dead. Oh, Brady, of course, but he\u2019s dead too.\tYes. Poor Beau died of a brain tumor just as I was dead before the unceremoniously dumped me into a hot tub and fried me to crisp. And yet here I sit before you.\tWhat are you saying, Megan? You\u2019re saying that Bow Brady is alive.\tHow long is that list of properties? It\u2019s long. Everything from Titan\u2019s headquarters to Victor\u2019s child at home? Of course, we have no idea if my mom\u2019s even at any of these properties. Let\u2019s just stay positive. All right. All we gotta do is get out there and start looking. I think we should split up. Good idea.\tI\u2019ll go to the police station. I\u2019ve been working with the isa, so they\u2019ll talk to me. Stephanie, Chad, you speak together and Harris,\tthere you go. All right, let\u2019s do this. You two. Be careful. Keep your phones on. Okay? I do. Hey, um, you be careful too. I\u2019m going to the plays. Safest place in town. Uh, Steve possibly disappeared from there. That\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna find out. Thank you for helping my family. You gave me my life back. Just hope I can return the favor.\tWow. What that, just, this whole getting in touch with your feelings thing. You know, I, I always mocked it, but it\u2019s really helping. I\u2019m glad to hear that.\tYou think I need therapy. Therapy is what I do, so I\u2019m predisposed to think that every. Can be helped in therapy. Ah. See I\u2019m predispose to think I just don\u2019t need it sitting around talking about my feelings and emotions. It\u2019s not really my vibe.\tHave you changed your mind? Well, I mean, I, this did help. A a lot right now,\tbut no, it didn\u2019t change my mind, I don\u2019t think. I wanna continue. I\u2019m good. Not really. I\u2019m, I\u2019m, I\u2019m, I\u2019m fine. Really good. If you do change your mind again, you can call me. Oh, thank you. Appreciate that.\t"], "answer": [0, 1, 2, 4, 3]}
{"content": ["You\u2019re not thinking this clearly, carly. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve been thinking about, sonny. I\u2019m willing to roll the dice. I\u2019m not! What am i supposed to do, just let the mother of my children go to prison? It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to pentonville. I mean, even if I go down for insider trading, what? It\u2019ll be a minimum-security situation for a couple years? It won\u2019t be fun. I\u2019ll hate it. I\u2019ll hate being away from my kids. But what the hell? I\u2019ve been through worse. Okay? So it\u2019s either/or. Unless diane pulls a rabbit out of her hat, you\u2019re gonna have to either turn me in to the feds or do time, carly. There\u2019s another option. What is that? Turn on drew. Ava: Are you really willing to risk the possible consequences just to get revenge? Ava, my friend, have you not been listening to what I\u2019ve been saying? It\u2019s not about revenge. I mean, okay, so maybe when it first all started, it was about revenge, but it\u2019s not anymore. It\u2019s about \u2014 because it\u2019s such a mess \u2014 me just trying to hold on to my relationship and trying to build a foundation with my daughter. Unless you don\u2019t want that for me. Stop it. Of course I do. You know I do. I\u2019m on your side. Okay. Thank you. It\u2019s just I have made some very hasty and regrettable decisions as of late \u2014 decisions that have had real ramifications \u2014 and I just want to be sure that you\u2019re considering what yours might be. I know. I know. If \u2014 if the end result is for my daughter to not turn to carly but, god willing, turn to me, then any ramifications are worth it. I feel terrible. Well, don\u2019T. You were just trying to encourage her. I get it. And I\u2019m sure molly will, too. Sam, I\u2019ve never seen her like that. I know, but fertility issues are\u2026 a whole different beast. It\u2019s like being dropped down into the most barren, inhospitable place, and then you\u2019re thinking it\u2019s your fault you\u2019re there. I forget sometimes that you struggled to get pregnant. Yeah, that\u2019s something I\u2019ll never forget. But \u2014 okay, but this is crazy. I mean, she can\u2019t possibly blame herself\u2026 but she does. I mean, you\u2019re right, she shouldn\u2019t, but she does. Her body is betraying her, and it\u2019s the worst, most isolating feeling ever. So our rational, level-headed molly isn\u2019t gonna be so rational and level-headed about this. It\u2019s just not possible. Molly, this is not your fault. I know that, intellectually. But feeling it is another thing, huh? W-what if I\u2019d gone to the doctor sooner? What if I had taken charge of my health the same way I\u2019ve taken charge of everything else in my life? I mean, maybe this \u2014 this \u2014 this wouldn\u2019t be happening. Maybes aren\u2019t going to help anything right now. Because the truth is, you just will never know. So the important thing is to try to just stay in the here and now. Well, I despise the here and now. I know. How\u2019s tj handling it? Oh, god. Just another area where I screwed up. Honey, there is no sure way to navigate this thing. Tj\u2019s worried about me. He\u2019s surprised I suffered in silence for so long, which is when I obviously got super defensive, and that\u2019s when I came here. Darling, this is raw, right? This is going to take some time. You need to give it some time. And I know that you and tj together will figure it out. You know something strange? A few months ago, this was something I wasn\u2019t even sure I wanted. To be pregnant? Sure, we had talked about having kids, but it was down on the list. So why am i so devastated? So what can I do for you? You can distract me.\t[ Chuckles ] What brought you back to town? Family, of course. How\u2019s curtis? You haven\u2019t been to see him yet? No. You \u2014 you were my first stop. Getting the lay of the land, I see. Am I that obvious? Only to me. I just felt so badly about the conversation I had with trina the night of the wedding. The whole reason I skipped the ceremony was so that I wouldn\u2019t complicate things, and then [Scoffs] I end up complicating them anyway. It\u2019s not your fault, auntie. The truth was bound to come out. Sorry that I ran off at the worst possible time. First all the upheaval with the family and then the craziness with trina being kidnapped? Inadvertently, but, yeah. Well, once I read what happened on that ship, I had to come back. Well, thank god everyone\u2019s in one piece, except for victor cassadine. Yeah. Good riddance. So did the ordeal bring everyone closer together or\u2026? Trina\u2019s back at home. Things seem to be thawing between her and portia. What about curtis and portia? That\u2019s another story. Oh, my god. You guys kissed?\t", "Molly. Molly. Molly, molly. Listen. I\u2019m sorry. What I should have said is, I love you and I\u2019m here for you for anything you need. -We all are. -Always. Thank you. And I\u2019m sorry for being so on edge. Do not apologize. What you\u2019re going through is real and heavy, and you get to feel all the feelings. Some more pleasant than others. Well, we\u2019re in your corner. Yeah. Davis girls unite. Come on. Yes. I pray that tj and i have a family, but whatever happens, I\u2019m so grateful for the family that I already have. Hm! I am so happy you\u2019re back. Yeah, well, here\u2019s hoping your uncle feels the same way. Of course he will. Well, I\u2019m not so sure. But I do know this \u2014 whether it\u2019s you and molly, curtis and portia, or this family that needs mending, love is always worth fighting for. Coming back home? Unless you have any objections. Objections? No. I\u2019ve been hoping and praying for this. Then I\u2019ll move my things in right away. I\u2019ll be staying in the guest room. If that\u2019s what you think is best. I do. But if that\u2019s not enough for you\u2026 it\u2019s plenty. I just want you back home, and I\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make it happen. This isn\u2019t about pride for me. It\u2019s not gonna happen overnight. I can be patient. Because I know it\u2019s just the first step to us becoming a family again. Jordan: Thank you for listening. Oh, god, yeah. Of course. Any time. I hope I didn\u2019t make you late for your meeting. My \u201cmeeting\u201d? Oh, my goodness. You make it sound so civil, so mutual, as if I have a choice in the matter. Hm. Are you worried? Well\u2026 I\u2019ve skated this line with the wsb before, and I\u2019m thinking that, um, an association that\u2019s gone on this long isn\u2019t so easily broken. So I\u2019m realizing. What do you think you\u2019re gonna do? Well, I have two choices, right? I can either bow out\u2026 or I can go after what I want. But \u2014 [Sighs] Do I even have the right to do that\u2026 if it means destroying the life of another woman? I think you have your work cut out for you there, nina. And do you really see a stand-up guy like drew cain flipping on his girlfriend, sending her to prison, no matter how much she deserves it, no matter how guilty she is? I can, under the right circumstances. Okay. Which are? Which are \u2014\t[ Sighs ] Okay. First, we need drew to know that he didn\u2019t do anything wrong. I mean, we don\u2019t even know if he was the one who gave carly the information about the merger. It could have been michael. I bet drew didn\u2019t even want her to invest in aurora. But carly probably did what carly always does \u2014 she barged in, she went after what she wants. She doesn\u2019t think about anyone else\u2019s feelings. Stop it. Stop. Ava. Getting off track here now. Now, look, I\u2019m not trying to rain on your parade. I\u2019m really not. I\u2019m just questioning how realistic it is to expect drew to give up carly. It\u2019s not unrealistic to think that carly would give him up. I mean, if it was sonny or jason, I would say absolutely not, but with drew, there\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s room for doubt. Their relationship is relatively new. Maybe, threatened with serious prison time, yeah, maybe carly would would give him up, but it\u2019s not certain. Well, you know what? It doesn\u2019t matter. That part doesn\u2019t matter, if carly would turn drew in. What matters here \u2014 the only thing that matters is drew believes that she would. Okay. Alright. What we need, we need drew to get this information from someone he trusts, that carly is planning to turn state\u2019s evidence against him. Neither of us fits that description. No. But I can think of someone who does. Drew has a plan. Is it a good one? It\u2019s a long shot, and I still may lose everything.\t[ Footsteps approaching ] Wow! Look at your outfit! I love it. You look sharp!\t[ Laughs ] Can we make pancakes? Yeah, we can, if you\u2019re serious, because I need your help. Yeah. Those chocolate chips are not going to make it in on their own. You can count on me!\t[ Laughs ] I know we can. I know we can. Because you\u2019re such a big girl. And because of that, your daddy and I need to talk to you about some changes that are coming. Fun changes? Uh, everything\u2019s going to work out, I promise. Yeah. What daddy said.\t", "[ Sighs ] And it would have gone even further if I hadn\u2019t stopped it. Wow. What do you think this means? That\u2019s the problem. I don\u2019t know. And even worse, I don\u2019t think curtis does, either. We\u2019ve been in limbo for a while now, and, uh, I don\u2019t want it to go on any longer. Okay. What does that mean? That you\u2019ve decided to forgive me? Or are you saying that you\u2019re officially ending things?\tSounds like your mind is made up. It is. Okay. Well, then, what\u2019s the plan? How are you gonna make things worse for carly than you\u2019ve already made them? Well, I\u2019m still \u2014 I\u2019m still kind of figuring it out. And you\u2019re gonna think I\u2019m callous. Doubtfully. Okay. Um, well, from what I understand, diane is only carly\u2019s attorney. Okay, so then drew has separate representation? Right. Right. And so it\u2019s going to be tough to present a united front when you\u2019re being advised by different attorneys. So I think that\u2019s fertile ground for miscommunication, mistrust to grow. Oh, you \u2014 oh, you \u2014 you want to break up drew and carly? Yeah, well, it\u2019s bigger than that. It\u2019s \u2014 I want drew to believe that carly will turn on him so he turns on her first. Look, you\u2019re definitely the biggest get, but a ceo from a big company and a quartermaine? I mean, drew has a target on his back, too. Too bad you won\u2019t consider it. No, not for a second. I mean, come on, sonny. Look. I\u2019m guilty. That\u2019s never mattered before. I did it. I received insider information and I acted on it, despite michael and drew telling me not to. Probably because they told you not to. I\u2019m not gonna let someone else pay for my mistakes. I\u2019m not gonna do it. Okay, so where does that \u2014 where does that leave you? Because, when it comes to prison, I don\u2019t care what level of security, it\u2019s not an option. I hate that I made molly feel worse. But you didn\u2019t mean to. Yeah. Maybe not consciously, but if I\u2019m being honest, I think I was still licking my wounds from our previous conversation. You know, molly would never do something like this. She would never try to execute a half-baked plan like this. And I\u2019m envious of that. Well, we\u2019re envious of how big you dream. Really? Really. Molly and I wish our imaginations stretched as far. Well, we\u2019re envious of how strong you are. I mean, by far the most resilient davis sister. Oh, I don\u2019t know about that.\t[ Laughs ] Come on. It\u2019s true. We\u2019ve all had our moments. No. At least you and molly aren\u2019t the only ones keeping mom up at night. Well, I can assure you, as a mother, you worry about all your kids all the time. It\u2019s part of the job. What if molly never gets to do that job? Then we\u2019re gonna have her back, like we always do. If I could take the pain away from you, I would. But unfortunately, I can\u2019T. I am your mother. But I was a lawyer. And that\u2019s relevant how? As your mother, I can console you. But as a co-chair, I can help you game this out. So you tell me, who do you need more right now? So mommy it is. So do you think curtis and portia are over? I\u2019m not sure. All I know is he still hasn\u2019t moved back home. Oh. I was afraid of that. Curtis has always placed a high premium on transparency. That\u2019s basically why he and my mom got divorced. Speaking of jordan, was curtis upset to find out she knew about trina? He was hurt. But he understood it wasn\u2019t my mom\u2019s secret to tell. Huh. Sounds like curtis is on better terms with his ex-wife than his current one. Curtis was so insistent I not tell portia about our kiss. It\u2019s like [Sighs] I\u2019ve gone from being his ex-wife to being his dirty little secret. Oh, wow. I can see how that would sting. But I \u2014 my instinct is telling me that this whole situation is very confusing for everyone involved and that curtis is trying to navigate it without hurting anyone. It\u2019s impossible, anna. Whether he decides to give our relationship another chance or chooses to go back with portia, one of us is gonna get hurt, deeply. I know I made a monumental mistake. I can\u2019t \u2014 no, no, no. I won\u2019t accept the end of our marriage. Portia \u2014 no. Marcus recently told me that I need to fight for what I want. And what I want is you. I want us. I want what we built together. Please don\u2019t throw it away. I don\u2019t intend to. You don\u2019t? There\u2019s a lot to sort through. I can\u2019t guarantee there\u2019s a way forward for us, but\u2026 we\u2019ll never know unless we try. Really? Really. So what does that look like? Dating? Therapy? Well, let\u2019s, uh\u2026 let\u2019s start with me moving back home.\t", "daddy! Hey, girl. You just wake up? What have you been doing? What do you think?\t[ Laughs ] Uh, watching cartoons? Yeah. You like that, huh?\t[ Laughs ] Do you wanna have breakfast with me and mommy? Well, that depends on what\u2019s on the menu. You know. Something from a box? Well, why don\u2019t you get dressed, make the bed, and we\u2019ll think of something else. How\u2019s that? Go. Go, go.\t[ Laughs ] Oh, you know what? I should have \u2014 I should have asked you first if that\u2019s all right. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine. So, I have news. Let me guess \u2014 you\u2019re getting married. Oh, you heard? I saw. I was at the metro court last night. I guess congratulations are in order. Ava, oh, my god. I have no choice. I just \u2014 I have one option. It\u2019s time for the gloves to come off. What? What the hell does that mean? It means I-I can\u2019t continue to let carly come between me and my family. Right, which is why you stupidly and impulsively sicced the sec on her, which could definitely backfire and tank not only your relationship with sonny but any potential relationship with your daughter. I know, I know, I know. I just \u2014 I have to make sure that these charges against carly, they stick and she goes away for a good long time. Hey, molly. It\u2019s me again. Uh, look, I won\u2019t keep blowing up your phone. I just \u2014 I can\u2019t remember if I said \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d in that last message, but I am. And I love you. Just call me back, okay? Or, even better, come home.\t[ Knock on door ] Aunt stella. This is a surprise. And judging by your face, not a welcome one. No, no, just the opposite. You\u2026 you\u2019re exactly who I need.\tThe role of molly lansing-davis is temporarily being played by holiday mia kriegel. Hey, hey. Oh, honey, honey. Molly, what\u2019s wrong? Everything\u2019s falling apart. You know I am always happy to see you. Maybe. But something\u2019s weighing on you. I can tell. What is it? You are giving me way too much credit. No, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m actually not giving you enough credit, jordan. Portia, stop.\t[ Sighs ] I\u2019m not the person you think I am. Well. [ Scoffs ] That\u2019s dramatic. I just mean\u2026 I don\u2019t deserve all this praise\u2026 especially considering what I\u2019ve done. Why? What have you done?\t[ Elevator bell dings ] Hi.\tMolly, what did the doctors say? Wait. Doctors? What are you talking about? You said that everything was fine. Everything will be fine, right? This is not life-threatening. It\u2019s going to be fine. Molly, what\u2019s wrong? I\u2019ve been diagnosed with endometriosis. So the biopsy confirmed it. How bad is it? It\u2019s not good. I mean, it\u2019s not gonna kill me or anything, but it\u2019s where the tissue from the uterus grows outside the uterus. Yeah, I\u2019ve heard of endometriosis. It\u2019s really painful. Isn\u2019t it? It can be. Comes and goes. Ohh. Molly, I\u2019m so sorry. Yeah, me too. Me three. Well, w-what can we do for you? That\u2019s just it. There\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s nothing to do. The doctors can give you something for the pain, right? Yeah. The pain is manageable. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s the rest. Tj and I may never be able to have a baby. Molly and I have \u2014 we\u2019ve been trying to get pregnant. Oh, tj, that\u2019s wonderful! But I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re having a hard time. We just learned that\u2026 medical challenges means it might not happen for us. So\u2026 baby, I\u2019m so sorry. I can see you\u2019re heartbroken. Oh, and I imagine molly is, too. And I didn\u2019t help. I was just thanking jordan for all that she did for trina. But, of course, she is too humble to accept it. Um, I do appreciate you running interference while we were on the island. And while I was safe in port charles, you were the one in harm\u2019s way. Well, I thank you both.\t[ Laughs ] It\u2019s, you know, because of your teamwork. That\u2019s why trina\u2019s home. Dr. Robinson, I had a question about the patient in 1004. Oh, of course. Of course. Excuse me. What did I walk in on? What do you mean? You looked like you were about to say something to portia. About our kiss? I considered it. Jordan, promise me you won\u2019t do that. Why? Because you\u2019re still not sure what it meant? Or because you\u2019ve decided it didn\u2019t matter? Hey. Curtis. Hi. Hi, anna. Hi, jordan. I should get going. Whoa. Air\u2019s a bit charged in here. You need me? That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve been trying to figure out. I\u2019ve bee n assured by martinthat no one is going to find out that I was behind the anonymous tip. I\u2019M\u2026protected. Well, from the government finding out, maybe, but, I mean, people in port charles, you know, they can put two and two together. No, I get that. I get that. That\u2019s why I need carly gone. Don\u2019t you see? Without carly looming over everything, I have a clear path to be with sonny and to try to forge a relationship with my daughter. Oh, you\u2019re dreaming big. Why not? Why not? Don\u2019t I get to be happy, ava? To be with the man that I love and try to get to know my daughter? Why does carly get the storybook ending while the rest of us are left with nothing? I know nina\u2019s not your first choice.\t[ Scoffs ] Good thing it\u2019s not my choice, then. It\u2019s your life, sonny, and you got to live it. Yeah. That\u2019s the plan. Yep. So why\u2019d you come by? Just to fill me in? Well \u2014 no, I wanted to tell donna, but I don\u2019t know if you want me to do it by myself or you want to do it together. Well, what\u2019s the rush? I mean, did you and nina set a date? No, nothing like that. It\u2019s just that, uh, avery saw nina\u2019s engagement ring. Oh. Yeah. Well, we all know how much avery likes to spread the good news, right? Yeah, she likes to spread the news. But I\u2019m gonna tell all my kids, obviously. But I would not tell donna without talking to you first. No. I get it. I understand. It\u2019s up to you. I\u2019ll just follow your lead. I think you already folded that one. What? The towel. I\u2019m just really distracted right now. Do you want to tell me why?\t", "you just missed diane.She was here discussing the sec\u2019s case against me. Yeah, I asked josslyn about that. Where\u2019d you see josslyn? Listen. Um\u2026 does diane have a-a good defense teed up? Well, unfortunately, the case against me is very strong, so even a lawyer as skilled as diane has an uphill battle ahead. Carly, there\u2019s a chance that the sec was pointed at you to get to me. We\u2019ve both been blindsided. We went from this vague idea of wanting to start a family in \u2014 in the future to\u2026 realizing we wanted a child now\u2026 to finding out we can\u2019T. At least not the old-fashioned way. This is a delicate subject matter, that\u2019s for sure. Even for partners like you and molly who have been together forever. Yeah, I feel like I keep sticking my foot in my mouth. Oh, yeah. So\u2026here\u2019s the thing. Yes, this is happening to both of you, but right now molly can\u2019t see that. This is agony for her, tj. That sensible woman you\u2019re used to, she\u2019s there, still, but, baby, it\u2019s gonna take her a while to find her way. So what can I do? Nothing but pray. Molly: Because of the severity of my condition, the likelihood of conceiving is incredibly low. But not impossible, right? I mean, they never actually say that, but it was strongly implied. I\u2019m so sorry. Sweetie, tell us what we can do. Well, us?\t[ Laughs ] Nothing. Right, molls? You\u2019re the one who always has everything figured out. -Not this time. -Well, I\u2019m sure the doctor gave you other options that you and tj can have a family, right? Alexis: Honey. Honey. Like adoption, ivf, surrogacy\u2026 honey. \u2026Is another \u2014 you \u2014 not a good time to discuss this. It\u2019s molly we\u2019re talking about. Please. She identifies a problem, and then, boom, she comes in with a solution. Kristina, w-would you just stop?! Wha\u2013 wait, wait, wait. Molly, I \u2014 molly. Co\u2013\t[ Scoffs ] What\u2019d I say? You want to talk about it? I don\u2019t want to keep you from whatever you came here to do. Well, sure. That\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve already finished with my phlebotomy, and\u2026 I have a little time before I have my next debrief with the wsb. How are you feeling, by the way? You were still recuperating in the hospital when you charged off to greenland. I feel like a million bucks. But you don\u2019t look so good after that \u2014 whatever that thing was with curtis.\t[ Groans ] You know, I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve really tried to move on, to get over curtis and put the whole marriage in the rearview. How\u2019s that working for you? Well, I guess what they say is accurate \u2014 \u201cobjects in mirror may be closer than they appear.\u201d Why is everybody talking in riddles today? What do you mean? Well, I was talking to jordan, and she alluded to having done something wrong, and I asked her what it was, and she didn\u2019t want to say. Yeah, well, you know how by-the-book jordan is \u2014 or at least tries to be. You know, she bent a lot of professional rules to help trina. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe. You gonna leave me hanging, too? No. I, uh\u2026 I want to talk about you and me.\tgo. I\u2019ll go.\t[ Door opens and closes ] Go ahead. What? Come on. Tell me what I did wrong, since you\u2019ve become so skilled at it. Krissy. I\u2019m sorry. You were really excited about your project, and I \u2014 completely rained on my parade?\t[ Clears throat ] Yes. You did make\tsome decent points. I know, but still it was the wrong time and the wrong place, and I think I actually learned something from mom \u2014 that sometimes encouragement is better than a fix. Which is exactly the mistake I just made with molly.\t[ Groans ] She meant well. Her execution left a little to be desired. That\u2019s all. I know. Krissy isn\u2019t the problem. So talk to me. I\u2019m just feeling really overwhelmed right now in the most unfamiliar way, and I hate it. Because you feel out of control. Because I feel like a failure. This is one of those situations where that\u2019s all you can do. No action to take. Certainly no one to blame. I feel like molly\u2019s blaming herself. Right now she is. Right now she\u2019s up, she\u2019s down. She\u2019s all over the place. She\u2019s ur a dream. I know you are, too, baby. I\u2019m not trying to minimize that, but\u2026\t[ Inhales deeply ] But as a woman\u2026 it\u2019s different. Oh. Yes. So the best advice I can give you is to know that. Know that molly is going through something really difficult that you can\u2019t fully understand. But you can love her. And please keep reminding her of that. Just be there, tj. That I can do. You remember when I came to you for advice last summer? Yeah. You asked me if I would ever come clean to an ex if I knew something that would impact his relationship. So I\u2019m assuming that whatever it is that\u2019s going on between curtis and portia, that that information came out? You suggested I question my motivation for revealing the truth. Right. And? Yes, I wanted to protect curtis, but that wasn\u2019t the only reason. So ultimately I didn\u2019t tell him. Oh, but someone did. Is that why things are tense between the two of you? He\u2019s angry with you that you stayed silent? Oh, curtis is far from angry. And now there\u2019s a new secret weighing on my conscience. Do you have time to talk? Curtis, you\u2019re my husband. If I don\u2019t have time, I\u2019m gonna make time. It\u2019s just, um, that my experience in greenland got me to thinking. I was so scared that I was never gonna see you again. Yeah, same here. Portia\u2026 I don\u2019t want to leave anything between us unsaid. Carly may be on her way to prison for insider trading. I\u2019d hardly call that a storybook ending. Oh, come on, ava. You know, a couple of months in club fed, that would just be a blip. Carly needs to do some serious time. And let\u2019s not forget \u2014 she\u2019s going to prison for something that she actually did. Mm-hmm. And she will be conveniently out of your way. Yeah, finally. I mean, she won\u2019t be swooping in every time I\u2019m trying to have a conversation with willow. Look, nina, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t have an issue with \u2014 with carly going away. My issue is with you blowing up your life to make that happen. Sonny: I have business dealings with a group of people who have very powerful enemies in government, I think, and they\u2019ve targeted me, like, at least once that I know of. Now I think they\u2019re coming after you to get to me. How would that work? The sec only started investigating you after I started working with these people. Well, that explains the timing. I mean, why months after the failed merger the sec started asking me questions? Somebody\u2019s playing the long game. They\u2019re threatening you so you\u2019ll flip on me. Once I\u2019m out of the picture, it compromises the people that I\u2019m working with. Okay. I get it. I get it. Except for ned. I mean, sonny, sometimes the simplest solution is the truth. Ned threatened to turn drew and me in to the sec, and he did it. Well, at some point, the justice system is going to figure out that you being in trouble is the easiest way to get to me. Well, diane says that\u2019s already happening. Based on what? Unconfirmed intel here in the da\u2019s office. We\u2019re talking on a \u2014 on a federal level, right? U.S. Attorney. Ahh\u2026 they cut a deal if I turn state\u2019s evidence against you. Do it, carly. Do it. What? Do it. Do it. Yes. I\u2019m going to \u2014 look, just \u2014 I can get through this. I\u2019ll be in court. I\u2019ll fight the charges. No. You don\u2019t know that. You can\u2019t control the narrative, sonny. I have diane. She\u2019s fantastic. She\u2019ll get me through it. No! I appreciate your nobility, but no. This has nothing to do with being noble. Yes, it\u2019s noble. I appreciate that you\u2019re trying to step up for me, especially given our recent history. But no. It\u2019s still \u2014 but it\u2019s still gonna be a no, right? Yes, it\u2019s a no. It\u2019s a hard no.\t"], "answer": [3, 4, 0, 2, 1]}

Yeah, I wish I could do what they\u2019re doing and just throw myself into the search and then give myself away to take my mind off all this grief, you know, in a way that\u2019s productive.\tBut you know, even if they do find Megan and she does end up behind bars forever, it doesn\u2019t really change anything for me. What do you mean? I mean, no matter how much Megan pays or Orpheus pays, I don\u2019t get what I want. More time. My mom. Where the hell is Megan? And what has she done with Kate? Such anger.\tYou\u2019re damn right. We\u2019re angry and we\u2019re worried about our friend. You didn\u2019t be really. Why is that? Because she\u2019s been given a great honor. Thanks to her contribution, I will be able to determine if my scientific genius has been successful yet again. And what contribution is that? Well, due to our doctors as well.\tCertainly you are familiar with the concept of a test subject. Yeah. But in legitimate medicine, a test subject, volunteers. I\u2019m pretty certain that Kate did not volunteer to help you. Well, actually she was fortunate enough to be chosen. As I said, it is a rare and coveted opportunity. What?

Well, she\u2019s obviously just as vindictive and deranged as she ever was. It all started with her obsession with Bo. You know,\there\u2019s the thing. All the doors in this place, they flock automatically. It\u2019s, it\u2019s like this. You go into a room or whatever and door closes behind you, and it\u2019s locked. Okay. Well, I was just able to let myself out of this room, so, oh, well. When is a door, not a door? When it\u2019s a jar, it must have been open a little bit.\tWhat are you trying to tell me? That, that we\u2019re not gonna be able to get out of here? No, we just, we have to go back in there and get Megan\u2019s. Okay, fine. Let\u2019s just do it. Okay.\tWell, there she is, right where I left her. What\u2019d you do to her? Exactly what I told you. I knocked her out. Let\u2019s get those keys and get out of here,\tMegan. Hey, wake up. Okay.

No, no you don\u2019t. Not that I wouldn\u2019t get how terribly difficult this is for you anyway, but um, I mean, having gone through this with my dad, I know how much you still miss him. You know, he\u2019d be really proud of you, of everything you\u2019ve accomplished. I mean, you dedicated your entire life to protecting people and not just family and friends, but everybody.\tYou honor him every day by doing that. I know there, I can\u2019t help but think about all the things that he\u2019s missed out.

Your dad and my mom. There\u2019s a day that goes by that I don\u2019t think about him, but. I made peace with the fact that he\u2019s gone.

Well then who should we ask? You should direct any inquiries regarding the serum to Madame Hask. But trust me when I tell you, it could be life changing or not. Just for her. What is that supposed to mean? Most people get over their high school sweethearts, not her.\tMegan never did. So this all goes back to Megan and Bo going steady in high school. Yeah. She thought that Bo had broken up with her and he thought that she had done the same to him, but in fact, neither were true. So what happened? Megan\u2019s mother, she caused the breakup. She manipulated both of them. And when Megan found out she lost it, she, she\u2019s, something broke inside of her.\tThat\u2019s when she became obsessed with ball and desperate, really desperate to get him back.

I, I\u2019m just wondering, maybe, maybe this is, maybe this is not a good idea. Do you not want to No, no. I, I do. I I definitely do. But i\u2019s just like what we just talked about, you know, we tried this before and it didn\u2019t work out. I dunno, maybe we\u2019re just setting ourselves up for more disappointment.\tI see your point. Well, I, I, I, it\u2019s like we really had, I mean, we really do. We have such a strong connection and, and I would love to see where that takes us. But the last time around, I mean, finding time for each other was such an impossibility. I don\u2019t know, maybe, maybe we should just be smarter if we just cut our, cut our losses now.\tMm. And before we get in too deep. Probably right? I mean, we live so far apart. Our lives are so busy. I mean, there\u2019s a really good chance that this won\u2019t work, but there\u2019s a chance that it might, it\u2019s a chance I\u2019d like to take. Would you.\tSo your serum is meant to be life changing and not just for Megan. So who else\u2019s life is it going to change? So many questions. And did the answers have anything to do with that? Is Marlina Wright is it also gonna change the life of whoever the former occupant of that tube? Ah, yes. Well, my earliest prototypes, the technology was far more limited back then on, yet it was a very successful project.\tSuccessful how I was able to keep the subject in a cryogenic state for nearly a decade.

Now, where is that vile?\tYou mean this?\tYou know, we really don\u2019t give a damn what Megan\u2019s motivation is. We just want to track her down and make her pay.

Well, we didn\u2019t, but the person we did pry it out of took a little convincing, especially considering what Megan did to us last summer. Yeah. See, the agency thought that maybe we were still under her control, but we\u2019re definitely. But I got a question for you. How did you find out where to look for Megan?\tYou know, luckily she didn\u2019t mess with my head. So the agency didn\u2019t have the same concerns really. Well that, uh, Intel is still highly classified. I mean, you couldn\u2019t just walk in and get that information unless you got it from Shane. Well, let\u2019s, let\u2019s just say I still have a few friends in high place.\tThat\u2019s why don\u2019t we? But hey guys, I. No matter how we all got here, I\u2019m so happy to see you both right back at you. Hope we opened that door. The last thing we expected to see was a friendly face, especially one as pretty as you . Steve, you look like you were ready for a fight. , I had one way or another, we\u2019re gonna take half the way down and if it\u2019s gonna be the hard way, so be after what she did to you.\tI don\u2019t blame you. That woman deserves what\u2019s coming her way. Well, The fact is it isn\u2019t just about what she did to us.\tWe should have known that you were gonna show up. I mean, how would we think we were gonna wake up from the dead without you? How indeed you may express your thanks at any time. Don\u2019t hold your breath. So now you\u2019re in league with Megan Hathaway. Hmm. Oh, surely that doesn\u2019t surprise. Well bit you would take directions from somebody who was evil and unhinged.\tNo, it does not surprise me. I serve as a pleasure as a Demer family. Aunt Megan is a dememer. She\u2019s a daughter of a man who caused pain and suffering to everybody he ever met. Untrue certain. Dara has a legend lost to us far too soon. It is now my duty, honor and privilege to carry on some issues of his progeny.\tI shall. Her wish, as they say, is my command. Look, we don\u2019t really have time to wait, okay? No. Oh, did you? Did you hear what I said? Kayla and Marlena, they\u2019re both here somewhere, so Yeah, I heard you, but we can\u2019t leave. If you are worried about Megan, there\u2019s no problem there. She\u2019s incapacitated. What do you mean?\tI mean that she had me tied up. She was trying to inject me with some kind of drug, so I punched her in the jaw and I knocked her out. But she could come too anytime. So we need to go Where, where did this happen? Right on the other side of this door, right before I ran into to you. So the love of God.\tLet\u2019s get out of here. Um, sorry, but we have to go that way. No. No, we don\u2019t. It\u2019s way too risky. Nope. Don\u2019t have a choice.\tI know it didn\u2019t turn out so well for us the last time. Ended up devolving into a bunch of texts about when we could possibly meet up and all the times that we couldn\u2019t. Right. But even when we lost touch, I, I couldn\u2019t stop thinking about last summer meeting you for the first time traveling around the world together, trying to find your dad.\tYeah. It\u2019s not often a, on our first date where we end up in a shared hotel room in Hong Kong. , I\u2019ve never been happier to return someone\u2019s gym clothes , when she could probably tell Yeah. When we kissed . Yeah. Yeah. I, I could,\tyou know, I thought about that kiss many times. You know, it felt like, uh, it felt like the start of something. Sometimes when I\u2019m sitting at my desk working late, I think about that moment and now I wish we could go back to him.\t", "Nothing If there\u2019s a affording address, she did not leave it lying around. Damn, damn well, partner. Looks like it might hit a dead end here. Dead end. What are you talking about? There\u2019s no dead end. There\u2019s gotta be a way to figure out where Megan went. Yep.\tYou are absolutely right. I missed you. Maybe there is.\tThank you for always knowing exactly what to say. No, I, I don\u2019t always. Don\u2019t even think I do most of the time . I just think that I do in this case because you know, I\u2019ve been there and if there\u2019s something that I can tell you, it\u2019s that you\u2019re never gonna stop missing them. But time, time definitely helps, you know, although there are days that I will feel the loss of my dad, so it\u2019s a cute thing.\tIt\u2019s like, it just happened yesterday. And then there are other days that I remember all the fun times I had with him now that we had, you know, and think about all the funny things that he\u2019d say and times that he\u2019d tell me that he loves me and that he\u2019s proud of me and that definitely it makes things less painful.\tYeah, right. You know, another thing that. Hmm. So when I remind myself just how blessed I am to be able to share my life with someone like you, someone so kind and so wonderful, who I just happen to love with all my heart, I love you with all my heart too, and I need you so much right now. You have me now.\tYou have me now, and you have me always.\tAnd do you know what else we need to remind ourselves of? Mm-hmm. , not only do we have each other, got an incredible daughter. Yeah. We\u2019ve got a great big family to lean on.\tAnd now\tI\u2019m officially off the clock. I said, what do you say? We go home and we lean on each. On the couch. That sounds really good.\tThat was perfect.\tAh, exactly the words I was looking for. So can we talk about what happens next? Well, I was thinking.\tNo. No. , no. Do we discuss where we go from here? Yeah. Yeah. We probably should, but not, right? No, I just wanna enjoy this perfect moment with you.\tIt\u2019s all right. Get it.\tDonovan? Yeah. Pat your through\thope. What can I do for you? I need a favor. I need to go to see Harris Michaels.\tWe know that you kept Stephan Damara on ice for four years, but a decade. That\u2019s quite a feat, don\u2019t you? Thank Marta. Yes, I do. It\u2019s quite remarkable. Mm-hmm. . So the person must have been very important. Yeah. I\u2019m just, I\u2019m just so curious. I can\u2019t stop thinking about who it might be. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it either.\tI mean, it could be, but No, that\u2019s silly. Now what are you thinking? Well, I\u2019m just thinking that maybe what if it\u2019s, uh, somebody famous? You mean like a world leader or a rockstar or a Hollywood legend? Maybe an athlete? You know, I did hear a while back that there was a baseball player who was Cryogenically frozen.\tWait a minute, wait a minute, maybe. Maybe we\u2019re on the wrong track. Maybe it\u2019s somebody who was, I don\u2019t know, closer to home, maybe somebody from Salem, somebody that we all. Yeah. What about that Ro? Somebody we all knew. Somebody close to Salem. I didn\u2019t say anything, but nice try. If I went in such a hurry to complete my experiment, I\u2019d stay and applaud your creativity.\tWe don\u2019t need your applause. We\u2019d just like to know who was in that tube. And we are pretty. Wasn\u2019t Stefano because you took his essence and put it in Steve. Another hugely successful experiment of mine ruined by stefano\u2019s well meaning, but misguided children for a tremendous loss. When Chad and Tony destroys that microchip, you can lament it later.\tJust tell us who it was for the last time. Tell us who was in the tub.\tHand it over. Do you really think that you\u2019re gonna be able to make it out of here without Bo shooting you dead? Or perhaps you think that another pathetic speech about how the two of you used to be family is gonna change his mind. Oh, please give it. You heard the man,\twhatever kinship the two of you used to have, it\u2019s long over. I\u2019ll stop wasting time and let\u2019s get on with it.\tTime.\tThat was stupid. Really not allowing you to make me your personal Guinea pig. I think it was one of my smarter moves. How typically arrogant and ignorant of you. Congratulating yourself when you\u2019ve just made one of the most idiotic decisions ever. How\u2019s that? The only reason that I was keeping you alive was to make sure that that serum worked.\tNow that it\u2019s gone, you\u2019re of no further use to me,\tno point in drawing this out any.

Well, it\u2019s just that Auntie Mag and I aren\u2019t really seeing eye to eye on its future, and since Bella\u2019s been my baby for the past six months now, I was hoping that maybe you would consider my input before making any major decisions. Do you want to talk about us?\tWell, I thought that was the last thing you\u2019d want to talk about, given the way you rushed out of it just a little while. And I was wrong, cowardly. Well, in all fairness to you, Oh, I kissed you impulsively. Um, I could see how very thrown you were and I, I honestly, I just, I got really caught up over the sales and numbers.\tYou don\u2019t have to explain Glenn, and you don\u2019t have to apologize, but I do need to explain my, my reaction at least, and apologize for it. Yes, I can. No, there isn\u2019t. Okay. Please just let me speak. When I found out that my divorce papers had been lost, I dunno. I thought maybe that was fate telling me that there was still hope for me and Sarah.\tYes, Sarah assigned the papers and she left town, right, and I know it\u2019s naive to keep holding out hope, but naive or not, it is what I am doing, which is why I, I can\u2019t even consider a romantic relationship with you until I know for sure that my divorce is. And if that\u2019s not okay with you, I do understand\tlike sands through the hourglass, so are the days of our lives.\tWhat are you doing here, father? Checking up on your wayward offspring? Well, without much luck lately, but I went to the Salem in to see Lee and he told me he is living here now. He is. Ian Gabby moved in yesterday, he and Gabby. So your brother is celebrating by that ridiculous contract with a woman who doesn\u2019t love him.\tYeah. You know, I suggest you take that up with him, but, uh, he\u2019s not home right now. Is someone actually sleeping on a sofa? I mean, don\u2019t you have enough bedrooms for the three of you? Uh, we do have enough rooms for me, Lee and Gabby, but, uh, there\u2019s four of us here.

We\u2019re just friends and roommates. There\u2019s nothing romantic going on between us. Oh, I. . Yeah, Wendy told me, um, and I trust her. So anyway, I\u2019m not even here about Wendy. I\u2019m actually here about my dad.\tBut I spoke to Johnny and Wendy earlier. I could have sworn they believed me. Oh, by the time I got to them, they were questioning if Stefan was using drugs. And they\u2019ve suggested that you might be the one jacking Stephan. But how did they figure it out? Well, I, I don\u2019t think they. I think it was just conjecture.\tAh, damn. So what did you do? Uh, how did you react? Light my ass off. Of course, I totally vouched for your innocence. I even told them that I was there when the investigator told you that S\u2019S fingerprints were on the vial. Good. Good. Did they buy it? They seem to, I hope they. Oh, if Johnny knew the truth, then he could ruin everything.\tUh, is your father all right? Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, he\u2019s, he\u2019s. He\u2019s fine. He did though, um, get some tests taken the other day for some demer business. I just wonder if I could get a copy of the results. Nah, I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t help you there. Uh, HIPAA rules. I\u2019d still need written authorization from your father,\tWell, yeah, but my dad sent me here to get the results form to save him time.

That\u2019s all he\u2019s worried about. My brother. Hmm. Little does he know what his beloved Uncle Stephan is willing to do to me. He actually drugged my water at the office earlier. Bastard. Yes. Luckily I was able to switch the bottles. , and you did that without my help.\tGood job. So how did it affect him? I\u2019m not too sure. He skipped out of there early, just like he did yesterday to see Gabby. This is the second wasted opportunity for him to make a fool of himself at Tamir.\tAh, good Miss.\tWhoa, whoa, whoa. Stephan, did you get a head start on your cocktail somewhere else? No. No. I just, I got a. Hi, Kevin. Okay. Why don\u2019t you sit down, Stephan. I\u2019ll get you some water.\tThanks. Mm-hmm. .

What is that all about? Well, if I had to play along, obviously otherwise he might suspect, oh no, my head is spinning. How long is this gonna go on? As long as it.

Well, if you don\u2019t have any plans tonight, whenever you can get here.\tWell, I\u2019m vanished. Didn\u2019t, uh, well my daughter\u2019s out that much of a cook,\tI\u2019ll be there immediately. Excellent\tway. Shin is on his way. And now all we have to do is wait for the.\tOh, uh, Mr. Shin. Hey. Hello. Hello, Johnny. Good to see you. Jim Wynn has been saying some very nice things about. . Really? Mm-hmm. . Oh, that\u2019s, uh, that\u2019s good to hear. What? I\u2019m going to give you two some privacy, so have a good night. Hey, I hope I didn\u2019t chase him off. Believe me. You didn\u2019t. What\u2019s up? I was wondering if, if you had a minute to take a look at something.\tYes, sure. I, uh, I was able to get into the lab and I got a copy of those test results my dad had ordered on that drug that I found, and I. Have no idea what I\u2019m looking for. How did you get this? I have my ways. Okay. Well, I am an expert in cyber, not Ken. Mm-hmm. . Let\u2019s cross source this puppy. Oh, well I already did a web search, so did you try the dark web?\tNo, no. I, I guess I should have.\tOkay. I got a hit. Oh, what? Uh, your dad said this was some kind of recreational street drug. Yeah, well, I think if your Uncle Stephan wanted to get high, he probably wouldn\u2019t use a rare medical grade tr that not only induces euphoria, but also has a host of nasty side effects. So what you\u2019re saying, my dad lied to me.\tI\u2019m sorry. I think so.\tThis is perfect. And when Stephan tries to drug me at dinner, you will turn the tables on him. Right. And he will make a fool of himself in front of none other then way shin. Mm-hmm. the best person to witness his foolishness. Exactly. And given Mr. Shin\u2019s notoriously thin patience, my brother could be on the unemployment line by tomorrow.\tYeah, I hope so. But ooh, do you really wanna do this under shin\u2019s nose? I mean, there\u2019s more people to, to witness you switching the drinks, and it\u2019s a risk unwilling to take besides if the truth ever does come out. I haven\u2019t drugged anyone. It\u2019s all on Steph and my, my hands are clean.\t", "Auntie Maggie, don\u2019t you, aunt Maggie? Me, according to Victor, you told him I didn\u2019t have enough experience to make an informed decision. Whoa. I I, I didn\u2019t say that. Not in so many words. Well, then what did you mean by calling him and giving him a heads up that your incompetent wife was about to make a big mistake?\tOh, I definitely didn\u2019t say that. No, but you went on and on to him about how I was cav literally shutting down this magazine. That he named after his beloved daughter. Nice use of pathos. I\u2019ll give you that. Did you seriously think that DIB would overrule me? That he would side with you over his own life?\tThat he wouldn\u2019t tell me that you went behind my back, auntie. I\u2019m sorry. And believe me, I know my place around here. It\u2019s just that I passionately believe in the magazine. I felt like it was worth fighting for. It\u2019s nothing personal. Nothing personal. I have, I have reminded you twice today that that chair no longer belongs to you.\tI am your boss, Alex. I am the C of this company. I know, and I respect that. Do you, because your behavior says otherwise. Now if you can\u2019t accept the fact that I now have the job that you think you\u2019re entitled to, well then you know you are free to resign. Now\tlet me fix my work here is done. I will leave you two love birds alone. Go bend Jimmy\u2019s ear some more. Maybe a few other choice Body parts Chowk.\tUm, I\u2019m sorry he put you on the spot like that. Please know that I, I did not put him up to my, I I know you, I know you didn\u2019t. Grandma we\u2019ll say he did have a few valid points though. I agree. And you did for everything on the line for me. You sacrificed your own happiness to try to make things work for Sarah and me, and you\u2019re so very grateful for that g.\tI can never thank you enough, but, um, I thought with time maybe things would become clearer and I know I promised you a decision when my divorce came through, and\tthe truth is\tI still love Sarah. I dunno if I\u2019m ever gonna get over her. And you deserve someone who\u2019s gonna love you with their whole heart.\tI\u2019m sorry, I just, I think the of us can be\tnot right.\tDamn it. And I, I was worried enough when I thought my dad or my uncle might have a drug problem. But if my dad is the one giving the drugs to my uncle just to get ahead in business, I mean, I know, I know they don\u2019t have the best relationship and back stabbing is kind of the dememer way. But after everything Stefan\u2019s been through, who knows what that could do to him.\tAnd if my dad were to get caught, I mean, okay, take a deep breath, Johnny. We still don\u2019t know what\u2019s really going on here. Nicole said that the investigator found Stephan\u2019s fingerprints on that file. Yeah, we don\u2019t know that for sure. Now. I mean, she\u2019s, she\u2019s sleeping with my dad. She\u2019d lie for him in a heartbeat.\tOh my God. What? Your dad called my dad and invited him over to dinner. Okay. Let\u2019s say all of this is true. Could he be planning to drug Stephan and then get him to make a total fool of himself in front of my.\tYeah, I bet that\u2019s exactly the plan. Look, I, I, I\u2019m not just gonna sit here and do nothing about it. Okay.\tJohnny, my man. Okay. Paa Uncle Stephan. Uh, I, uh, I really hate to tell you this, but I think somebody might be drugging you,\tMr. Shannon. Of course. You know the lovely Nicole Walker, how you do Indeed. She is doing a super job at Basic Black. Thank you so much. But I understand that your co c e o was arrested for kid. Yes, but we expect all the charges against Brady to be dropped. But in the meantime, we\u2019re fully cooperating with police.\tWe don\u2019t want to have any scandals on our watch\ton that subject. I, I have to confide. I\u2019m rather worried about my brother. I\u2019m not sure what Dr. Wolf put him through, but I\u2019m afraid it may have taken its toll on his physical and mental health. He doesn\u2019t seem to be himself lately Really. I haven\u2019t heard any word about Stephan\u2019s behavior at work, but I\u2019ve heard plenty about yours.\tI\u2019m sorry. I how you understand.\tYou know what, and uh, I don\u2019t.\tI mean, sure when there\u2019s blackmail to be done or your dead body to hide or claps are closing in, you have no problem calling on good old friend Gwen.\tHave a romp around in the hay to thank me,\tbut I am never the person you would take home to meet your mother. Am I my mother\u2019s dad? To me she is. The point is you see me as some sort of a fearless bad girl. Don\u2019t you have a couple of laughs with, and I help you out with your schemes, but you will never actually commit to me. I was gonna marry you until you drugged Sarah.\tYou killed Susan Banks. You killed Laura Horter. That was an accident. Was it? The point is, is that you are no better than me, Zander, and you never will be. And you put Sarah up on this pedestal because you think I will never measure up. Isn\u2019t that right?\t"], "answer": [0, 1, 3, 4, 2]}
{"content": ["Victoria: No, actually, i talked with tucker about it myself.\tDevon: Oh, you did? That\u2019s interesting. You seem awfully curious about my relationship with him and the ipo and chancellor-winters, all in the same conversation.\tVictoria: I\u2019m just asking you as a friend. It\u2019s not business.\tDevon: I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d call us friends, victoria, but I do know that you don\u2019t do anything casually. So why don\u2019t you just come clean about what you really want?\tTucker: I know you\u2019re wary of me, and not without good reason, considering my history in this town with some of the folks. But I just wish I could convince you that we share a similar vision.\tDaniel: Hmm. I actually do think that we share some common ground. Your pitch earlier struck a chord with me.\tTucker: Really?\tDaniel: Mm hmm. So much so that I spoke with my mother about it.\tTucker: Uh-oh.\tDaniel: [ Chuckles ]\tTucker: I cannot imagine phyllis was in favor of us going into business together.\tDaniel: [ Chuckles ] Oh, you are correct. Well, this is my venture. I\u2019m going to make the final decision as to who we partner with if things do fall apart at chancellor-winters. My mother, well, she\u2019s going to have to deal with whatever decision I make.\tTucker: I like the sound of that, although I know phyllis can be a little, uh\u2026\tDaniel: Bossy?\tTucker: [ Chuckles ]\tDaniel: Stubborn?\tTucker: [ Chuckles ]\tDaniel: Always thinks she\u2019s right?\tTucker: I was gonna say \u201cformidable,\u201d but\u2026\tDaniel: Mm-hmm. Well, she works for me, so I\u2019ll handle her. And that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m gonna turn my back on lily \u2014 you know, not without cause.\tTucker: Sure.\tDaniel: I just hope that\u2019s something that you can appreciate and, um, maybe back off until things have settled.\tTucker: But you should know, my company is absolutely the most viable place for your dream to come to life. And, uh, [Chuckles] When i set my heart to something, I \u2014 I don\u2019t ever give up, which [Sighs] Has been a problem for me, learning to let go. So I\u2019ve been combating that with the belief that things are going to work out the way they\u2019re meant to. You know, simply trust the universe and all that?\tDaniel: I\u2019m sorry, what did you say?\tAbby: Look, I have seen far too many times how business can damage family relationships. And at first, I was trying to nudge devon to accept the buyout.\tLily: Yeah, well, too bad it didn\u2019t work.\tAbby: I disagree. I mean, after listening to devon, I understand his perspective. Hamilton-winters means so much to him, and it would be awful for him to lose it to some ipo that he never supported in the first place.\tLily: Yeah, but do you realize how ugly a lawsuit could become? I mean, you think there\u2019s hurt feelings and resentment now. Imagine what going to court would do.\tAbby: Honestly, I don\u2019t know why you and jill don\u2019t just accept devon\u2019s decision. Chancellor industries was huge before it ever merged with hamilton-winters. So why don\u2019t you just go back to that? And why are you willing to fight your brother for something that\u2019s dollars and cents to you, but it means everything to devon? I think it says more about your priorities than anything else.\tLily: [ Chuckles ] How dare you question my priorities? To you, it may just be an elevator.\tLily: Who are you to tell me that I care more about my business than my family? My family has always been a priority to me, and I really resent you saying otherwise.\tAbby: I think you\u2019re misinterpreting what I said. I never said you didn\u2019t value your family.\tLily: Abby, I\u2019m only talking to you about this because I\u2019m trying to figure out a way to have devon and I work this out together. I\u2019m not trying to get you to convince him to not fight for his company. I\u2019m trying to convince him to stay at chancellor-winters.\tAbby: Devon has made it clear \u2014 drop the ipo.\tLily: Jill is not gonna go for that. She\u2019s not. The whole reason for this merger was to have our family work together. And I\u2019ve already lost nate, and now I feel like I\u2019m losing devon. And he\u2019s saying that he wants to protect our father\u2019s legacy. Like, he\u2019s my father, too. Of course I want to protect his legacy. And he doesn\u2019t realize that if we go to court over this, it could damage hamilton-winters. And I don\u2019t think he\u2019s considering that risk.\tAbby: Have you said this to your brother?\tLily: I\u2019ve tried. I have tried, and he just seems so set in doing this. Abby, listen, I would never ask you to go against your instinct, but you said you know what kind of turmoil this could cause to a family. So a legal battle would damage us all. So I\u2019m just asking you if you think that devon might regret walking away. Just tell him that. Please, just tell him that, as one last try.\tVictoria: I\u2019m not sure what you mean. I don\u2019t really have anything to come clean about.\tDevon: Oh, really? Okay, well, then I\u2019m gonna go ahead and take off because I need to get back home. Abby is dropping off dominic, so I\u2019ll see you later.\tVictoria: Devon, uh\u2026\tDevon: Yeah?\tVictoria: [ Sighs ] = You may not see it this way, but I still \u2014 I still see you as a friend. And we are connected by family through abby and dominic. I hope we can find a way to separate the business and the personal. I\u2019ve had to learn to do that as a newman. It\u2019s not easy.\tDevon: [ Chuckles ]\tVictoria: But if you count everyone that you have a different professional agenda with your enemy, then your circle gets very small.\t[ Footsteps departing ] Um\u2026 can I get a coffee to go? And, um\u2026 a croissant? Thank you.\tTucker: I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m trying to trust the universe?\tDaniel: [ Chuckles ] The same exact thing that heather always used to say to me. Sorry. It just caught me off guard, hearing those words.\t[ Sighs ] Anytime I would lose my patience, get frustrated, she would always tell me to stop fighting and trust the universe.\tTucker: Hmm. You miss her a lot?\tDaniel: I do. But I\u2019m following her advice and yours. I\u2019m living my life and I\u2019m having faith that one day we\u2019re gonna be reunited. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the reason why this project is so important to me and believe that it\u2019s the path that I\u2019m meant to be on, the one that\u2019s gonna bring me back to lucy and heather. So I\u2019m just trusting the universe.\t", "Tucker: Hmm. I guess you must have a certain amount of trust in phyllis, too.\tDaniel: Why would you say that?\tTucker: I assumed she was going to portugal to help smooth things over with your partner and daughter.

Um, I-I know you\u2019re busy, but I \u2014 I kind of felt like this conversation couldn\u2019t wait, and, well, I thought we could use some privacy.\tKyle: What you want to talk about?\tDiane: Well, I spoke to summer, and she clearly has reservations about jack and i being romantically involved again. I \u2014 I tried to address her concerns, but I-I-I don\u2019t know how effective I was.\tKyle: Well, I haven\u2019t had a chance to talk to summer about that yet.\tDiane: Well, I also spoke to jack, and he told me that the two of you talked earlier.\tKyle: Thought that was supposed to be a private father-son conversation. Is this how it\u2019s gonna be now \u2014 I say something to one of you and it\u2019s automatically shared with the other?\tDiane: No, no, absolutely not. But, kyle, that\u2019s why I wanted to talk to you. I-I don\u2019t want to hear how you\u2019re feeling from summer or from jack. I want to hear it from you. And [Sighs] I want you to be honest with me. Suffering from sinus congestion, especially at night?\tKyle: I am still processing the idea that you and dad are back together. Like I said before, when you broke the news. I\u2019m conflicted.\tDiane: And I want you to tell me why.\tKyle: I\u2019m worried things may not work out, which happen way more often than \u201chappily ever after.\u201d\tDiane: Kyle, I have no intention of messing things up with jack. I love your father\u2019s big heart, and I am not going to break it again.\tKyle: I want to believe that. But people make promises and things happen. Things have happened. I know you\u2019ve hurt him in the past, moving us around, cutting us off from him.\tDiane: Alright, well, things were complicated back then.\tKyle: Yeah, but dad\u2019s heart is not complicated. And if it is broken, so is the entire abbott family, because we rely on him, we lean on him.\tDiane: I know, and I accept that responsibility.\t[ Sighs ] But I-I can\u2019t let the fear of what might happen keep me from being happy now. And it\u2019s not just one-sided. I mean, I\u2019m taking a leap of faith with this romance, too. We both are. Because, I don\u2019t know, it just feels right in so many ways that it hasn\u2019t before. But you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right. There are no guarantees. But jack and i both have a lot at stake. And we\u2019ve gone into this consciously and cautiously.\t[ Sighs ] But I get the sense that there\u2019s more going on for you when it comes to this. You\u2019re not just protecting jack\u2019s heart, are you?\tSally: [ Sighs ]\tNick: [ Sighs ] Alright, now that we, uh, have some privacy, do you want to tell me what your doctor said?\tSally: Um, yeah, I\u2019m \u2014 I, um\u2013 I just went in for some routine prenatal testing, and \u2014 and everything\u2019s fine, but, um, they want me to come back in because my blood pressure is high.\tNick: Has that been an issue for you in the past?\tSally: No, not at all. And I mean, dr. Chandler assured me there was nothing to worry about at this point. I\u2019m in good physical shape. They said they\u2019d just keep an eye on it and treat it if need be.\tNick: Okay, well, it sounds like your doctor\u2019s just being cautious.\tSally: Yeah. Yeah, but it still threw me. It just got me thinking about this massive responsibility coming my way and all the ways that my life is gonna change, in the ways that I\u2019m gonna have to adjust \u2014 ways that I-I can\u2019t predict and ways I-I never even planned for. And just got me thinking, how \u2014 how am I gonna navigate all of it?\tTucker: Yeah, phyllis told me about her trip to portugal. You seem surprised. Did you not know?\tDaniel: [ Chuckles ]\tTucker: Oh, man, I\u2019m sorry I-I overstepped. Pretend I didn\u2019t say anything.\tDaniel: No. No, no, I-I appreciate the information. Not a big fan of surprises, especially ones concocted by my mother.\tTucker: Mm. Yeah, I\u2019m \u2014 again, I\u2019m sorry if I caused you any trouble. Listen, I got to get going, but I\u2019m really looking forward to continuing this conversation. So, alright, man? Give me a call anytime you want. Okay?\tDaniel: Thank you.\tTucker: Alright. See you.\t[ Footsteps approaching ]\tDaniel: [ Clears throat ] I don\u2019t know what you think you\u2019re doing, but you better stop. You better not have gotten on that plane.\tDevon: [ Sighing ] Oh, yeah. Oh.\tAbby: Hey, you.\tDevon: Hey.\tAbby: I just got here. Dominic had a busy day at the play gym, so I put him down for a nap.\tDevon: Oh, nice.\tAbby: Is everything okay? What\u2019s on your mind?\tDevon: Um, I just ran into victoria at the coffeehouse, and now I can\u2019t shake the feeling that she\u2019s up to something with tucker.\tAbby: Why would victoria be involved with tucker in any way?\tDevon: I have zero idea. But she seemed oddly curious about my relationship status with him, and I don\u2019t know if it had anything to do with chancellor-winters or not, but\u2026\tAbby: Weird. Um\u2026 [ Chuckles ]\tDevon: [ Chuckles ]\tAbby: Oh, I actually had an interesting run-in with your sister, and she said some things that surprised me.\tDevon: How so?\tAbby: I thought that lily was fighting you over hamilton-winters because she wanted to hang on to the winters half of chancellor-winters.\tDevon: If she\u2019s not, why is she fighting me at all and refusing to sell me my company back?\tAbby: She painted a very different picture today. I\u2019m managing my high blood pressure,\t\u201cThe young and the restless\u201d\twill continue.

They said it\u2019d be ready in a few minutes.\tAbby: Oh. Let me guess. You are picking up food to bring back to the office because you\u2019re working overtime.\tLily: [ Chuckles ] Yeah, well, there is a lot going on at chancellor-winters these days.\tAbby: How are you feeling about everything?\tLily: Well, you were there when devon said he\u2019s ready to go to court over this.\tAbby: [ Sighs ]\tLily: What do you think about it? I mean, I know that you\u2019re loyal to devon, and clearly he trusts you if he said it was fine for you to stay while we were chatting.\tIt\u2019s probably because I know you both so well, and he didn\u2019t think it would do any harm.\tLily: Yeah. Well, I just really felt like I found a win-win situation for us. I mean, he gets to keep the name and get paid handsomely, and we get to move forward with the ipo. Anybody clearly, devon doesn\u2019t feel the same way about it.\tLily: Yeah, but how do you feel about it? Because, I mean, you were very quiet during our conversation. Do you really think that devon is making the right decision?\t[ Footsteps approaching ]\tDevon: Look who it is.\tVictoria: Hello, there, devon.\tDevon: Hi, victoria.\tVictoria: So, how are things going with the ipo?\tDevon: Uh, well, why would I want to talk about that with you after you tried to take my company?\tVictoria: I may have had some interest initially, but I\u2019ve moved on.\tDevon: Oh, well, that\u2019s good to hear. You\u2019ve been making some interesting choices lately at newman media. I hope you don\u2019t regret hiring nate and audra, since they both betrayed chancellor-winters.\tVictoria: I\u2019m sorry there\u2019s a rift between you and nate.\tDevon: Are you?\tVictoria: Yes, of course I am. I know how important family is, and I know how tricky family business can be.\tDevon: Bet you do.\tVictoria: Speaking of family, how are things going with tucker?\tDaniel: Thank you. I\u2019m willing to sit down with you, but anything we discuss regarding omega sphere is purely hypothetical. You know that I have a deal with chancellor-winters.\tTucker: I do. I was gonna ask you about that.\t[ Clears throat ] What\u2019s the current status of your contract there, with their ipo on hold?\tDaniel: Should have a better idea in a week.\tTucker: I admire your patience [Chuckles] And your loyalty, [Inhales deeply] Especially to a company that seems so in flux.\tDaniel: Well, lily is a dear and trusted friend.\tTucker: Hmm. Yeah, but she can\u2019t know everything, right? And this is your vision, your future. It\u2019s a possible legacy move for you. Have you ever been involved in anything potentially this big?\tDaniel: Nothing of this scale when it comes to business. I was an artist, so I was painting, doing photography. These are all uncharted waters for me, which is why I need to make sure that I align myself with someone that I trust completely.\tTucker: You mean, someone unlike me.\t[ Laughs ]\t[ Glasses clink ]\tDiane: Hey, thank you for telling me about your conversation with kyle. I need to speak to him now. You know, I just don\u2019t want his fears about us to fester. And if he felt the need to discuss them with you, then I should do the same with him.\tJack: I\u2019ll call and tell him to join us.\tDiane: No, no, no, no. I should talk to him alone. I \u2014 I want him to be able to speak his mind freely without worrying what your reaction would be or wondering if you were going to defend me or not.\tJack: And we both know I would.\tDiane: [ Chuckles ] Yeah. This also is not a conversation for the office.\tJack: Okay, you decide what\u2019s best.\tDiane: Yeah. Kyle. Hi. I was wondering if we could talk. Um, can you meet me at the house?\tNick: As misguided as it is for dad to try and create trouble for you at jabot, it does seem like he wants to bring you back in the fold. Hey, is everything alright?\tSally: Yeah, it\u2019s fine.\tNick: Doesn\u2019t seem like that.\tSally: I am more interested in what the two of you were discussing. The parts of your body that collagen supports:\tAdditional sponsorship\tprovided by\u2026\tAdam: Uh, my brother was just alerting me to a potential land mine set by our father, and I was about to thank him, even though his motives were potentially self-serving.\tNick: Well, adam, I just hope you can use the information regardless of why I shared it. Sly well, I\u2019m just relieved the two of you aren\u2019t battling each other \u2014 at least, not now.\tAdam: Oh,no, we\u2019re not ready to throw a fist just yet. We are, um \u2014 what are we doing? How would you characterize this, nicholas?\tNick: Just trying to keep our father from causing trouble.\tSally: Hmm. Good. Uh, you know, I \u2014 I\u2019ve kind of lost my appetite. I-I should get going, but \u2014\tAdam: Hold on a second. Alright, you are not acting like yourself.

I mean, it must hurt, given that when he first came back, he said that he wanted to connect with you and dominic.\tDevon: Well, I didn\u2019t trust him from the day he turned up, so that doesn\u2019t hurt that much. But I imagine that you learned about his true motives from audra?\t", "Devon: Right. Well, yeah, I know that. That was the whole original motive for merging the companies together. But I don\u2019t think she wants it anymore, since she\u2019s siding with jill and wanted to hold on to my company.\tAbby: Or maybe that\u2019s her way of getting you to stay on.\tDevon: How does she figure that\u2019s gonna work? Getting me to stay on board? What, she wants to unify our family by not listening to my concerns and refusing to sell me back hamilton-winters?\tAbby: Look, I know that it sounds crazy, but I saw lily\u2019s pain. I could hear it in her voice. And, yes, maybe for jill, it\u2019s about the bottom line. But for lily, I think she just wants to hang on to her dream. The dream of you two working together. She doesn\u2019t want to hang on to hamilton-winters. She wants to hang on to you.\t[ Paper tearing ]\tEsther: Knock, knock.\t[ Chuckles ]\tLily: Hey.\tEsther: [ Chuckling ] Hi. I thought you could use a pick-me-up, and I made it just the way you like it.\tLily: Oh, my gosh. Thank you. I really appreciate that.\tEsther: So, I haven\u2019t seen, uh, devon here today. I-is he working from home, taking care of that adorable dom?\tLily: [ Chuckles ] Uh, well, I\u2019m not really sure where he is.\tEsther: I-is everything okay with him?\tLily: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. He\u2019s, um \u2014 he\u2019s fine.\tEsther: Okay, well, if you need anything, anything at all, I\u2019m here.\tLily: Thank you.

I just can\u2019t help it.\t[ Sighs ]\tNick: I know you were hoping you wouldn\u2019t have to deal with the reality of becoming a parent for a little while longer. But it sounds like your pregnancy has other plans in mind. I know it can be overwhelming.\tSally: Oh, you don\u2019t know. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry. I just \u2014 I-I-I am overwhelmed.\tNick: I know. I know. You\u2019re not alone in this. Okay? I\u2019m right here with you.\tSally: I just don\u2019t want this to put any pressure on us. I mean, we\u2019re supposed to be taking things slow. We\u2019re just figuring this out. You know what this is, who we are.\tNick: Stop. We don\u2019t have to think about things like that. We only have to look as far ahead as your next doctor\u2019s appointment, okay?\tSally: Okay.\t[ Sniffles ]\tNick: Okay.\tSally: Thank you.\tKyle: I feel like I\u2019m taking a big risk opening up my heart to you again. I thought you were gone forever. And then you just showed up, and I had to wrap my head around the fact that you purposefully abandoned me. You let me believe you were dead. And when I found out you were alive, all those memories came rushing back. You can\u2019t imagine what that was like.\tDiane: Uh, you\u2019re right. I \u2014 I can\u2019T.\tKyle: And I had to reconcile the existence of a woman who could do that to her son with the nurturing mother I remember from my childhood. And you swore you worked for years to turn your life around, and you came back to ask my forgiveness, to be in my life and harrison\u2019S. And I desperately wanted to believe you were genuine, that the hole you had left could be filled, and you have filled it to a large degree. But it is still hard to quiet the lingering doubts in the recesses of my mind.\tDiane: Tsk. I\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I will ever be able to heal the wound that I create. But, kyle, you have to believe me that you and harrison are the reason I came back, the reason I\u2019ve stayed.\tKyle: Yeah, but we continue to be surprised by secrets from your past. The danger jeremy stark brought to our family. The risky plot you enlisted my dad in.\tDiane: That wasn\u2019t my intent.\tKyle: I know it was mostly dad\u2019s idea, but he became a jewel thief for you. He stole from summer\u2019s grandmother for you. So, excuse me if I have some reservations about where this relationship with my father could lead.\tDiane: [ Sighs ] We pulled people off the street\tEsther: Oh! Oh, you\u2019re here! Oh. Oh, gosh. Uh-oh, I-it\u2019s too much. Sorry. I-I-I just got caught up.\tDevon: It\u2019s okay. You alright?\tEsther: I-I-I promise, I\u2019m being discreet and not engaging in office gossip. But I want you to know that I absolutely adore you. You\u2019re mrs. C\u2019s grandson, and dom is katherine\u2019s sweet great-grandchild. And I absolutely love working here for her family and for yours. And I-I-I\u2019m just praying that you and your sister can work things out.\tDevon: Oh, thank you very much for saying that. It means a lot to me. But I promise you, we\u2019re gonna be just fine. We are. Sometimes things have to change, and you know, it\u2019s the way things are. But I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re still the same esther that I\u2019ve always known and loved.\tEsther: Oh, back at you, sweetheart. Oh. Mwah.\tDevon: Appreciate you.\tEsther: I so love you.\tDevon: We\u2019ll be just fine. I\u2019ll see you.\tEsther: Okay, okay.\t[ Door closes ]\t[ Doorbell rings ]\tTucker: Oh, abby. Hi. I didn\u2019t expect to see you. Did I knock on the wrong door?\tAbby: Devon\u2019s not here. I\u2019m watching dominic. You know, devon and I are co-parents, so it shouldn\u2019t be that surprising to see me here.\tTucker: No, just cut me a little off guard. May I come in? I got a little gift for dominic.\tAbby: Dominic\u2019s sleeping. And don\u2019t think that this gift is gonna win any favor with devon or score any points with me.\tTucker: Your unapologetic disdain for me is very refreshing.\tAbby: Well, there\u2019s no need to fake civility, now that we know the real reason you\u2019re in town.\t", "Tucker: Oh, yeah. I understand why you might feel that way, given what you\u2019ve heard, but I don\u2019t believe you know the whole story. Will you give me a minute so I can tell you the rest of it?\tAbby: [ Sighs ]\t[ Footsteps approaching ]\t[ Knock on door ]\tAdam: Can I talk to you for a minute?\tJack: Absolutely. Come on in.\tAdam: Hmm.\tJack: How\u2019s it going?\tAdam: Pretty smoothly. Or so I thought [Clears throat] Up until today.\tJack: Oh?\tAdam: I just, uh, wanted to let you know that things might get a little more tumultuous around here.\tJack: Why is that?\tAdam: Well, I don\u2019t know all the details, but I found out that victor is working on a scheme to pull the rug out from under me here at jabot.\tJack: I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised. It\u2019s kind of a classic victor move. Is he punishing you for leaving newman?\tAdam: Well, according to nick, he wants to force me to come back to the company and the family. Guessing he thinks, if I failed here, it\u2019d be a motivator to bring me back home.\tJack: Never ceases to amaze me how that man\u2019s mind works.\tAdam: \u2018Cause it\u2019s so twisted.\tJack: You said that, not me.\tAdam: Well, at least, now that I know there is a plan in the works, I can avoid the trap.\tJack: We can handle victor and whatever plans he has.\tAdam: Mm-hmm. There is one other thing that I need to tell you that I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to be happy about. I suspect that kyle is involved.\tDiane: Now that jeremy stark is out of our lives, there\u2019s no more danger. And there are no more secrets from my past.\tKyle: Relieved to hear that.\tDiane: And I\u2019m not going to hurt jack or break his heart.\tKyle: There\u2019s a part of me that sincerely hopes this works out. And my dad has assured me that he is walking into this with his eyes wide-open. But relationships implode all the time for all kinds of reasons. What happens if that\u2019s the case? What will you do?\tDiane: You\u2019re still afraid that I\u2019m going to leave again. Kyle, listen to me.\t[ Sighs ] I can\u2019t guarantee what the future holds for me and jack. But I can promise you that whatever happens, I will never abandon you again.

I appreciate you letting me, uh, tell my side of things.\tAbby: [ Scoffs ] I cannot wait to hear how you twist reality to fit your agenda.\tTucker: I profoundly regret how I bungled my attempt to reconnect with devon. I came back to genoa city expressly to bond with him, both professionally and personally. But I handled it wrong and made a major miscalculation.\tAbby: It\u2019s interesting how you left my mother out of your mea culpa.\tTucker: No, I wronged her, too. But while she\u2019s on a different continent, there\u2019s not much I can do about that. But I don\u2019t plan on throwing in the towel when it comes to devon. I-I genuinely want to find a way to make things right with him. Uh, I\u2019m just not gonna give up on my own son or my grandson.\tAbby: Well, you should, immediately.\tTucker: Excuse me?\tAbby: Devon is going through a lot right now. And the last thing he needs is more trouble from you. All you do is bring pain and turmoil into people\u2019s lives. You\u2019re bad news. You always have been.\tTucker: You\u2019re protective of devon, and I admire that.\tAbby: You should go\u2026 now.\t[ Sighs ]\tTucker: I\u2019ll be back another time\u2026\tAbby: [ Sighs ]\tTucker: \u2026Because this is not the end of this.\tAbby: It is, if I have anything to say about it. Here\u2019s a little advice. Don\u2019t cross me. Don\u2019t cross us.\t[ Door slams ]\t[ Sighs ]\tLily: This is a surprise. What, uh \u2014 what\u2019s going on?\tDevon: Abby told me about the conversation you guys had.\tLily: Okay, what did \u2014 what did she say?\tDevon: She said that you told her that the real reason that you want to keep ahold of hamilton-winters isn\u2019t just to strengthen the ipo, but rather to keep me on board so we can keep working together as a family.\tLily: Yes. Yes, that\u2019s true. So I hope the fact that you\u2019re here means that you believe it.\tDevon: No, I\u2019m here because it doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense to me. And I don\u2019t know why you would use abby to influence me one way or the other.\tLily: Uh, [Chuckles] Okay. Uh, no, I did not seek her out. We ran into each other. And, yeah, I was talking to her because I thought maybe she could get you to hear what I haven\u2019t been able to do, which is that I\u2019m sad and I\u2019m scared because I\u2019m afraid of how ugly this lawsuit could get. And I don\u2019t want us to have what we created fall apart.\tDevon: Yeah, but realize it\u2019s only fallen apart because of what you or jill are doing to me. You\u2019re siding with her to move forward with this ipo, despite how I feel, and now you\u2019re not giving me my company back.\tLily: Devon, that\u2019s not true. I-I want you to stay here. I want us to keep working together.\tDevon: Right, as long as i go along with you and jill. A partnership doesn\u2019t work like that. And you claim to care about neil\u2019s legacy, but you won\u2019t let me protect hamilton-winters properly. So you\u2019re just proving to me that you care more about profits and jill\u2019s agenda than you do your family or me.\tLily: [ Sighs ]\tDevon: And the fact that you don\u2019t see it that way, it hurts.\tKyle: [ Sighing ] Man. I want to believe you. I do. Just like all the other times, I\u2019ve given you the benefit of the doubt. Of course, I want you and dad to be happy. Why wouldn\u2019t I? But you\u2019ve asked me to be honest about how I feel. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. And in my heart, I\u2019m scared another shoe is gonna drop.\tDiane: Kyle, I promise, there are no more secrets. There are no more surprises from my past.\tJack: I know kyle had real reservations about my hiring you to replace him, but I can\u2019t imagine he would purposely try to sabotage you. Least of all, with victor.\tAdam: Okay, trust me, jack, I didn\u2019t want to believe it either, but I saw victor and kyle together. And frankly, their cover story wasn\u2019t very convincing. And I know my father has a good poker face, but I read him pretty well, and I know how he operates.\tJack: As do I.\tAdam: Look, I\u2019m not trying to cause any trouble for you or for the company. I just \u2014 I\u2019m trying to avoid that. Just thought you\u2019d like to know that I think your son is conspiring with my father to take me down.\tJack: [ Sighs ]\t"], "answer": [2, 0, 1, 3, 4]}

Tony was just more interested in living his playboy lifestyle than pulling off any kind of grand schemes.\tMm, so no mastermind?\tRight.\tUnlike mikkos, who is a megalomaniac entirely fueled by greed and power.\tSo how is this different than victor?\tWell, their actions might be similar. Their motivations were very different, \u2019cause victor\u2019s always been an idealist. I mean, evil, certainly. And now where mikkos wanted to control the world, victor was always determined to fix it. Like he really believed that these weapons that they were developing would curtail the developing population that he believed was draining the resources of the world.\tSo is this what victor\u2019s trying to do now?\tProject demeter? Demeter, goddess of harvest who was so broken-hearted over her daughter, persephone. That\u2019s what gave us the seasons.\tIn greek mythology, one prayed and worshipped demeter because she was responsible for the weather.\tIs that the threat we\u2019re dealing with? Could victor be trying to reverse the climate crisis? And if so, why would he need hostages?\tI don\u2019t know.

And they tried to take it over the first time I crossed paths with victor. And his brother\u2026 I was trina\u2019s age. And now trina is on the \u201chaunted star.\u201d That\u2019s the ship that helena gave luke and me for a wedding gift. And then she cursed it and us.

Holly?\tThe end of civilization.\t[Ominous music]\tSaid to me and drew last fall?\tMichael\u2019s mother knew about the potential merger, which is why she bought the stock. That\u2019s called insider trading, and it\u2019s illegal. Martha stewart went to prison for much less.\t[Sighs] Luckily for both of you, nobody has really looked into it, but I think it\u2019s something that you both need to consider.\tYou threatened drew that you could tip off the sec. Now you have.\tMichael.\t[Chuckles] If you really think so little of me that you believe that I would send your mother to prison while your wife is dying, then you don\u2019t know me at all.\t[Dramatic music]\tWell, ned, I guess you\u2019re right. I really don\u2019T.\tDo you have any idea where drew cain is?\tHe was supposed to be at the wedding walking willow down the aisle, but I guess his plans changed.\tWell, do you think he got wind of the sec\u2019s interest and bolted?\tDoesn\u2019t strike me as the type.\tFine. Well, then at least carly is not antagonizing two federal agents on behalf of someone who ran off and left her holding the bag.\tThe sec knows about me and drew. Did you say anything to anyone?\tThe only people that I know that know about this are brick and olivia. They would not say anything.\t[Sighs]\tAre they still holding you?\tYes. They think I know where drew is.\tDo you?\tHe went after victor to find liesl so we can bring her home to save willow, and if the authorities find him and get in his way?\tExcuse me for a second.\t[Sighs]\tYou were with sonny when he was ambushed. What\u2019s your take on the shooter?\tHe was a pro. He only missed the first shot because I saw movement out of the corner of my eye. But once he had me and sonny pinned, he was methodical, working to get the range.\tSo ex-military?\tAlmost certainly.\tMm. But a ghost. Fingerprints, dna, nothing showed up on the database.\tSomeone invested a whole lot of money to make this guy invisible.\tWhy send him after sonny?\tThat\u2019s what sonny wants to know. Maybe pikeman can tell him.\t[Phone ringing]\tSpeaking of the devil. Sonny, what\u2019s up, man? What\u2019s going on?\tCarly and drew are in a jam. I need a favor.\tName it.\tAll right. I\u2019ll get my people on it asap. All right. No problem.\t[Sighs] I got to take care of something for sonny. You good here?\tAll good.\t[Dramatic music]\tListen, I know what it\u2019s like, you know, trying to distract yourself so that your mind doesn\u2019t go to bad places. Hell, I haven\u2019t slept in a quite a while. I also know what it\u2019s like not to be able to help your child. Not that this is the same thing.\tNo, I mean, you don\u2019t have to justify your fear. You love liesl. And we\u2019re both scared for our loved ones right now.\tYeah, it\u2019s the helplessness that I can\u2019t stand. Ever since, you know, trina and liesl were kidnapped, I have a sneaking suspicion that I\u2019ve been kept in the dark by, you know, robert and anna and felicia and laura. You know, I think they know exactly when victor has his martinis. And this whole holly coming back to town, I think it\u2019s all connected to luke spencer\u2019s death.\tWhy do you say that?\tBecause\u2026 luke ended them in \u201981 and they\u2019re sore losers, so victor got rid of luke and now, luke\u2019s family wants to get rid of victor. And you know who\u2019s the collateral damage? Me and you.\t", "[Wind howling]\t[Dramatic music]\tYou think they saw us?\tOr heard us?\tWell, the \u201chaunted star\u201d is docked. Let\u2019s hope her radar is off.\tWell, even if it\u2019s not, a radar is usually used to detect debris, other ships, icebergs, things like that. We came in so low beneath the hills, and landed on the opposite side of the island.\tWe took the scenic route. That explains the bumpy landing.\tWell, it\u2019s the safest way to approach victor\u2019s island undetected.\tAnd for bringing home trina, liesl, and your grandsons.\tHi.\tHi.\tOkay, so robert\u2019s busy and you\u2019ll be in the \u201cbureau\u201d about stepping up the rescue.\tAh. A lot of red tape. You know, the island is in international waters, so there\u2019s not really any government that can claim it.\tNo sovereignty to answer to. You\u2019d think that would make it easy.\tDid he say anything else?\tWell, I was hoping that on reflection, he\u2019d decide that we were crazy to think that victor\u2019s in the possession of a biological weapon, but no, he does think that is the likely scenario.\tAnd he\u2019s gonna have to convince them of that. They\u2019ll need air-tight evidence to get them to take any action.\tYeah, but how do we find air-tight proof?\tI called in a favor.\t[Knock at door]\tHi. Anna devane. What have you gotten yourself into this time?\t[Line trilling]\tYou have reached\tcurtis ashford.\tLeave your name and number\tand I\u2019ll call you back.\tHell of a time to have your phone off, curtis. Call me.\tWhere\u2019s my mom?\tShe\u2019s in the interrogation room with the sec. Diane\u2019s with her.\tDid they say what it\u2019s about?\tAll I can say is that your mother\u2019s in a little bit of trouble.\tMy client is absolute willing to cooperate, even though your interrupted her son\u2019s wedding to drag her down here.\tWe do apologize for the timing, but this is a very serious matter. We have cause to believe that you colluded to drew cain to raise the stock price of aurora media.\tAnd it could you both to prison.\tSo how you feeling, mrs. Corinthos?\t[Laughs] Happily married, mr. Corinthos. How \u2019bout you?\tSame. Just sorry all this business with my mom, you know, interrupted our night.\tInterrupted, but didn\u2019t derail. We got married. That\u2019s what matters. I am worried about your mom, though.\tI\u2019m sure this will all get sorted out quickly.\tWe just spoke to diane. Sec got a tip that carly colluded with drew during the aurora-elq merger last year.\tThat merger didn\u2019t even happen. What\u2019s the big deal?\tWhat I want to know is what does this mean for you, michael? You had a division at aurora. You\u2019re a major shareholder at elq. Will they bring charges against you too?\t[Electronic warbling]\tSweep\u2019s done. No bugs.\tGreat. Boss wants you to check the perimeter while I get everything set up.\tCopy that.\tGot you now, kid.\t[Dramatic music]\tTrina, honey, it\u2019s gonna be okay. We\u2019re gonna find you.\tMom, I\u2019m here. I\u2019m here.\tI love you.\tDr. Robinson?\tOr is it dr. Ashford?\tNo, no, no. It\u2019s still dr. Robinson. How can I help you, mr. Baldwin?\tWell, you know, you\u2019re here by yourself and I don\u2019t know, I thought maybe you could use a little company since we\u2019re kind of in the same boat.\tThank you. That would be lovely. And I\u2019ve told you before. Please. It\u2019s portia.\tOh. Hi, portia.\t[Chuckles] You must be so worried about liesl.\tI am, but she\u2019s a tough cookie. And, you know, if you cross her, she\u2019s very dangerous. So I kind of find that comforting right now.\tI had not thought of it in that way. [Chuckles]\tWell, not to make things worse.\tNot really sure that you can.\tOh, oh, oh, I can. You know, just ask anybody. They\u2019ll tell you that. So trina, she\u2019s not a mad scientist like liesl, so those cassadines, I mean, you must be scared as to what they have up their sleeves.\tYeah, I am.\tWell, you must be worried sick, which brings me to my million-dollar question. Why are you here at the hospital and not at home?\tSimply put, work is the only thing that\u2019s keeping me from completely losing my mind right now.\tHolly, I\u2019d like you to meet dr. Andrew maddox.\tOh, why do I know that name? Oh. Right, you were involved in the anamnesis project.\tAnd I\u2019ve been trying to right that wrong ever since.\tWell, you have my empathy. A while ago, I got mixed up in something deplorable and ever since, I\u2019ve been trying to help the bureau any way I can.\tBut andre\u2019s been doing the same. You know, thankfully, he\u2019s been backchanneling into the bureau\u2019s records without raising any alarms.\tUnfortunately, I don\u2019t have access to any files directly related to project demeter. But I\u2019m hoping I got you all the next best thing. Back when I was doing psych evals for the bureau, I had access to the complete dossier of the original operation against the cassadines.\tThe crazy weather machine? That was-\t40 years ago.\tI\u2019m amazed they didn\u2019t delete all those files, with victor in charge.\tWell, I\u2019m sure they did. Fortunately, the wsb is an institution of many fail safes and redundancies, so I just downloaded it off the server.\t", "Okay, then we stop it. If you say it\u2019s a curse, fine, it\u2019s a curse. Then we break it once and for all.\tI like the sound of that.\tWe can\u2019t share our theory with the bureau. Not now.\tI think we have more than just a theory, andre.\tThere\u2019s a biological agent that could wipe out most of the world\u2019s population. If not now, dr. Maddox, then when?\tLet me put it like this. If you were the wsb and you received this intel, what would you do? How would the bureau react and respond to this information?\tOkay, clue me in.\tI think what you\u2019re saying is that if the bureau finds out that there\u2019s a large-scale bioweapon on the island that they will do everything in their power to neutralize the threat.\tYeah, but isn\u2019t that what we want?\tNot if they send an aerial assault team to contain the virus.\tThey have to make a choice\u2026 between saving eight people\u2026\tincluding a baby.\tAnd saving eight billion. And they\u2019ll just bomb it. They\u2019ll just wipe that island off the map.. killing everyone.\t[Ominous music]\tWhat did you do?\tWhat do you mean?\tThe men from the sec found evidence that drew\u2019s heading west.\tOh, yeah. I hope that drew can stay ahead of them.\tDrew wasn\u2019t in san diego. And he definitely wasn\u2019t heading to maui.\tAs long as it keeps the sec busy, that\u2019s all that matters, carly.\tYou didn\u2019t have to do that.\tDo what? Look, I know things haven\u2019t been great between us, but we\u2019re still family. All of us. Keep me posted.\t[Soft dramatic music]\tSorry I lost my cool like that.\tYou\u2019re worried about your mom. That\u2019s good reason.\tYeah, well, she\u2019d be the first one to tell me not to\u2026 not to waste this precious time.\tAnd she would be right. I want to get back to the gatehouse and spend some time with wiley and amelia. Let\u2019s celebrate the start of our marriage with them.\t[Phone ringing]\tSorry. It\u2019s my mom.\tTake it.\tHey, mom.\tHow\u2019s willow?\tShe\u2019s fine. She\u2019s just anxious for you.\t[Sighs] Well, it was dicey for a while. They wanted me to tell them where drew is off to.\tAnd what\u2019d you say?\tWell, I didn\u2019t have to say anything. They\u2019re under the impression he\u2019s headed to hawaii.\tWhat? How?\tYour father.\tNo, they couldn\u2019t possibly.\tThe bureau\u2019s focus is the greater good. Protecting the many over the few. And as heartless as this might sound, they\u2019d consider trina, spencer, and the baby expendable.\tWe must remember, though, that victor did take obrecht to that island presumably to make the pathogen viable. Now if I know anything about liesl, she won\u2019t make it easy for him.\tWhich means we have some time.\tYeah.\tTime for what?\tTime for laura and the rest to bring the hostages home before we alert the bureau to the situation.\tRight.\tIt\u2019s a calculated risk. Victor could still release the pathogen.\tWell, what\u2019s the point in saving the world if we can\u2019t save the people we care about?\tI don\u2019t actually know that much, really. I just know that he left town because curtis left me note.\tAnd I don\u2019t think he would leave town by himself. So who went with him?\tThink maybe you should speak to anna.\tYeah, I will. Thank you, doc. See ya.\t[Suspenseful music]\tHey, good news. Finally got a sat signal. We\u2019re about half a mile from the \u201chaunted star.\u201d\tThis is good. Let\u2019s go.\tWhoa, whoa, whoa. The footprints. Would victor have his guards patrolling this far from the island?\tSo far no timetable for how long this thing\u2019s gonna last. Just assume we could be here for weeks.\tTalk about deserted.\tThat\u2019s why you\u2019re getting paid a hell of a lot more than your standard fee.\tso we all done here?\tNot quite. There\u2019s another matter you need to be made aware of.\tUh, what?\tPending the sec investigation, all of aurora\u2019s accounts and assets have been frozen.\tWhat? That\u2019s ridiculous, diane.\tMm-hmm, and so have yours.\tCan you believe him? For michael to accuse me like that? Insinuate that I would\u2013\tdouble-cross drew? Secure your own position as ceo, making sure he\u2019s not a threat? I don\u2019t know, dad. Sounds like your standard tactics for me.\tSonny send the sec down the wrong trail to buy drew time?\tYeah, yeah, he really stepped up for you.\tNot just for me. For you, too.\tYeah, I get the feeling that sonny had something to do with this hit on drew\u2019s location.\tNo comment.\tMm-hmm. Then why aren\u2019t you celebrating? Because it was sonny?\tAgain, no comment.\tI know you think sonny did wrong by your mother and michael, but maybe this is a sign that one day, there\u2019ll be a chance to make things right.\t[Tense music]\tWe\u2019ve got company.\tPikeman.\tGuards.

Where\u2019s your boss?\tWhere\u2019s yours?\tI\u2019m here.\tWe\u2019re gonna get this started or what?\tSo we\u2019re in agreement, then? We\u2019re going to wait for valentin and the crew to try to bring everyone back?\tHow much time?\tI don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll have to figure that out. But we can\u2019t stall forever, obviously.\tWell, I have some contacts in the canadian military. People I trust. I can get word that they might want to get in striking distance.\tOh, good. That\u2019s great. Thank you, andre.\tAnd I\u2019ll try to reach valentin. He needs to know about this.\tAll right.\t[Soft tense music]\tI\u2019ve already asked so much of you, including silence while we wait.\tSo you need something else? The worst I can say is no. So ask.\tThe bureau is probably gonna run this investigation through your department. And if they find out the location of the island or\u2026 what victor\u2019s really up to\u2026\tI\u2019ll run interference for as long as I can.\tThank you.\tGet what\u2019s at stake.

(Buzz) are you guys telling secrets?\tJack: I haven\u2019t seen that gorgeous smile in, oh, what seems like a lifetime.\tDiane: I\u2019m free.\tJack: So what do you wanna do first?\tDiane: Oh, I know exactly what I wanna do.\tJack: Name it.\tDiane: I have been dreaming about it for weeks.\tJack: Name it, it\u2019s yours.\tDiane: I wanna go out. I wanna go over the threshold and down the street.\tJack: And that\u2019s it?\tDiane: No, of course not. And then, I wanna put on a really nice dress, one that shows off my ankles that are monitor-free.\t[ Diane laughing ]\tJack: Then what?\tDiane: I wanna go out on the town.\tJack: Yeah? Any place in particular?\tDiane: Oh, I wanna go to every place in particular. And then, maybe we can talk about our wedding?\tJack: Oh, I like that.\tDaniel: You can\u2019t do this on your own.\tSummer: Watch me.\tDaniel: Is this like a loyalty test? Did mom put you up to this?\tSummer: It\u2019s my choice.\tDaniel: I can help.\tSummer: Not if I can\u2019t trust you.\tDaniel: Summer, this is a mistake. This is too big. It is too risky for you to do on your own. You need to let me in.\tSummer: I can\u2019t do that. Not with mom\u2019s freedom at stake.\tDaniel: So you\u2019re just gonna cut me out? Just like that? Even though I can help.\tSummer: You know what you can do to help? You can back off. I\u2019m the one that\u2019s helping her. And I swear to you, daniel, if you tell anyone else about this.\tDaniel: Hey, kyle.\tKyle: Yeah, what\u2019s this? It looked intense. What are you two talking about?\tChance: Detective chancellor. Yeah, yeah, I was the one who left that message. Did you get that information I was asking you about? That\u2019s right, the name is cameron kirsten. You don\u2019t say.\t[ Cameron clearing his throat ]\tFaith: If I had to sum up borgnine, I\u2019d say he\u2019s complex.\tNick: Well, I just can\u2019t shake the feeling that this cat is gonna be nothing but trouble.\tFaith: He is just a little kitty, how much trouble could he be?\tNick: Famous last words.\tFaith: You\u2019re gonna love him. I mean it.\tNick: Faith, your roommates stuck you with a cat for the summer. They clearly know who the sucker is.\tFaith: It just means I have a big heart.\tNick: Well, now you are back where you belong. You and borgnine.\t[ Girls laughing ]\tTessa: We missed you so much.\tFaith: It\u2019s so good to be home.\t", "Daniel: You seem to be the one with all the knowledge. So, what do you suggest we do?\tSummer: She stays hidden. Until we can prove that the situation she was in was kill or be killed. I don\u2019t know, maybe we\u2013 we try to find the emt. Stark must\u2019ve paid him off to do what he did.\tDaniel: That\u2019s a good point.\tSummer: So, we find him, we get him to corroborate mom\u2019s story\u2013\tDaniel: We can\u2019t put all our trust in one guy though. Especially when his whereabouts are unknown.\tSummer: Well, what else are we gonna do? We can\u2019t just do nothing.\tDaniel: What about kyle?\tSummer: What about kyle?\tDaniel: You know that this is upsetting him. You know he doesn\u2019t like seeing his mother suffer like this.\tSummer: Yeah, living in the lap of luxury, surrounded by her family. Poor diane.\tDaniel: Mom started this. She\u2019s the one who chose this path.\tSummer: People make mistakes, daniel. Chance. Hi.\tChance: Hey.\tDaniel: What\u2019s up, man?\tChance: A lot, actually. I have some news.\tSummer: How bad is it?\tChance: Depends on how you look at it.\tKyle: Uh, can I get you anything?\tDiane: Yeah, yeah. A night at the movies. A day at the park. Feeding the ducks at the pond with harrison.\tJack: We will have all of that if we just show patience and a little bit of faith.\tDiane: I\u2019m trying.\tJack: I know.\tKyle: I was worried you were gonna bolt. Set off the alarm bells.\tDiane: No. I\u2019m not running anywhere. I have too much to stay for. But phyllis, on the other hand, she\u2019s probably off on some island, sunning herself.\tJack: I know it\u2019s frustrating, but we\u2019re not giving up, are we?\tKyle: Someone will find her, the charges will be dropped, and we\u2019ll all go back to our normal lives.\tDiane: But time is running out.\tJack: Wait, why do you say that?\tDiane: Because the longer it takes to find her, the farther away she can get. She can change her name. She can meet all the right people who will help her do all the wrong things. Trust me, trust me. I know how easy it is for a motivated person to disappear.\tKyle: They are going to find her.\tDiane: I don\u2019t know. By then, I may be rotting away in some prison cell. I think\u2013 I think we all just need to come to terms with it. It is what it is.\t[ Doorbell ringing ]\tKyle: Hi. Um, come in.\tChristine: Sorry to barge in like this.\tMichael: But this is one of those times where you, um, don\u2019t wanna kill the messenger.\tJack: Has something happened?\tMichael: I wanna see the look on diane\u2019s face when she gets the news.\tChristine: We\u2019re dropping the charges.\tDiane: What?\tKyle: Yes! I knew it.\tJack: Some prayers are answered. Wow.\tDiane: Wait. It\u2013 it\u2019s true? This is real? It\u2019s over?\tChristine: It\u2019s really over.\tDiane: Oh, god. Kayaking is my thing.\tSharon: You\u2013 you brought a friend home?\tFaith: I hope it\u2019s not a big deal. I told him it wouldn\u2019t be.\tSharon: Well, it\u2019s not moses, is it?\tFaith: No, but moses loves him too. I\u2019ll be right back.\tSharon: You know, if you\u2019d told me that you were bringing someone, I would\u2019ve straightened up the guest room.\tFaith: He can fall asleep anywhere. You\u2019ll love him. Everybody does. Mom, borgnine. Borgnine, mom. He\u2019s a cat.\tSharon: Yeah. Well, welcome borgnine. As long as you\u2019re here, you\u2019re family.\tFaith: Speaking of family, when do I get to meet my new niece? I can\u2019t wait to cuddle something that doesn\u2019t shed on me.\tTessa: Did we hear someone asking about a niece?\tSharon: Hey! Come on in. Come in. Ah, I love having a full house. Everybody please, take a seat.\tMariah: What is going on here?\tSharon: Um, this is a cat.\tMariah: Oh.\tSharon: Who is staying in faith\u2019s room, right now. Just a sec.\tMariah: Wow.\tFaith: Is this our bundle of love?\tMariah: Oh, yes. Aria, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re awake because you are about to meet somebody very important.\tTessa: See, this beautiful young woman is your aunt faith.\tFaith: Hello, aria. I\u2019m so happy to finally meet you. I have waited for this moment for such a long time. Normally, I would tell you that I\u2019ll be the one to take you for your first tattoo or concert, but since your moms came pre-loaded with that stuff, I\u2019m pretty sure it won\u2019t be a problem.\tTessa: Well, that will be a long way off.\tMariah: Thank you.\t[ Mariah and faith laughing ]\t[ Faith sighing ]\tFaith: She\u2019s so beautiful. I love her already. Welcome to the family, aria.\tNikki: Well, it\u2019s a shame that elena had to be hurt in this. She\u2019s a lovely young woman. But victoria seems very happy.\tNick: Oh yeah, she was real happy about ashton too. And we know how that turned out.\tNikki: Yes. But, there was no way she could have known that he was the monster he turned out to be and anyway, we all welcomed him into the family.\tNick: No, not all of us.\tNikki: All right. The thing is, victoria does not need a chaperone.\tNick: We\u2019ll agree to disagree on that.\tNikki: What do you have against nate? I mean, we\u2019ve known him forever.\tNick: He was different then. Now, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like he can\u2019t operate, so now he\u2019s just stabbing everybody in the back. This isn\u2019t gonna end well. Not for any of us.\tNate: Latte delivery.\tAudra: You\u2019re a mind reader. Thanks. Come in. Tell me everything I need to know.\tNate: What? About the streaming deal?\tAudra: You said that you had some updated numbers that we can plug in.\tNate: Ah, yes. I meant to bring that printout, but I got distracted by something else.\tAudra: Something\u2026 important?\tNate: Breakfast with victor.\tAudra: What did he want? And how bad did it get?\tNate: Oh, it was going great. And then, we started talking about his daughter. And my future.\tDiane: No murder charge? No\u2013 no trial? It\u2019s all just wiped away?\tChristine: The lead detective found evidence that phyllis was alive at the time of her memorial.\t", "Audra: Nothing like a little fatherly interference.\tNate: That\u2019s when I knew that the only way out was being totally honest.\tAudra: And that\u2019s when you lost your job.\tNate: Will you please let me finish the story? He mentioned a time I did him a favor, that almost led to me losing my job. I was his personal physician for a while, and it almost cost me my medical license. Boy, was I furious, for a while. But, I understand him and his family better now.\tAudra: I mean, it sounds like he trusts you. That\u2019s worth a lot to men like him. You impressed an actual legend. That\u2019s pretty huge. And now you\u2019re seeing his daughter, and it sounds like you have his blessing.\tNate: But there\u2019s this one problem.\tAudra: Name it.\tNate: Nick.\t[ Girls laughing ]\tMariah: Hey.\tNick: There she is.\tFaith: Hello.\tNick: Look at that. We sent away a little girl, they sent back a scholar.\tFaith: Oh, it\u2019s so good to be home.\tNick: Hey, don\u2019t stay away so long next time. I mean, noah got tired of waiting and he just took off.\tFaith: Untrue.\tNick: Okay, that\u2019s probably right.\tFaith: It is so not my fault. He opened up a glam club in the uk.\tSharon: He\u2019s back in his old stomping grounds.\tMariah: And it\u2019s safe to travel there now because his ex lives here.\tFaith: And allie\u2019s learning the ropes at the jabot lab in paris?\tSharon: Oh, did he tell you? It is the sweetest thing. Each weekend, one of them takes the train to visit the other. Or, they both spend a few days in some other country in europe.\tFaith: Poor kids. Their lives are so empty.\tNick: Yeah, their passports are probably junked up with a bunch of stamps from exotic locations.\tTessa: Yeah. Like, why couldn\u2019t they just do something romantic instead?\tMariah: Like come babysit.\tTessa: Yeah.\tFaith: As gorgeous and time consuming as aria is, it\u2019s no excuse to put your music on hold, tessa. Next on my road to building my business portfolio? I think I should start guiding your music career.\tTessa: Can we bring the baby on tour?\tMariah: I mean, I can work remotely for jabot.\t[ Doorbell ringing ]\tNick: Are you expecting anyone else?\tDiane: Right now, I am thinking about the one person who can give me what I want.\tMichael: Don\u2019t look at me, I\u2019ve done all the tricks I know.\tChristine: Oh, I think I know who she\u2019s looking for. Oh.\tMichael: Ah.\tChristine: Right on cue.\tChance: Morning.\tDiane: Good morning.\tChristine: And on that note, my work is done here.\tJack: Christine. Thank you.\tDiane: Yes, thank you so much.\tChristine: All right, she\u2019s all yours.\tChance: All right.\tDiane: And I cannot wait another second.\tChance: It\u2019ll be quick. I promise.\tKyle: Chance, we owe you our thanks, and probably a few apologies.\tJack: Absolutely. I wasn\u2019t always my best self in all of this and I know that.\tChance: Well, work usually starts with the worst day of someone\u2019s life, so I get it. No apologies needed. All right. You are free to go. Or stay here because you live here.\tDiane: I am free to come and go.\tKyle: You can live your life again. How do you feel?\tDiane: I feel fantastic. Thank you. Thank all of you for everything. You\u2019ve\u2013 you\u2019ve given me my life back.\tDaniel: I just hope that wherever mom is, she is staying safe.\tSummer: You\u2019re the one that put her in danger. Now, you\u2019re worried about her? That\u2019s really rich.\tDaniel: I know, it\u2019s all my fault. You did nothing wrong. She did nothing wrong.\tSummer: Daniel, I told you that she was alive in confidence. And look at what you\u2019ve done?\tDaniel: God, I am so sorry that I have a conscience.\tSummer: There\u2019s a full-blown manhunt for our mom.\tDaniel: I know.\tSummer: All she wanted was to get her ducks in a row. Was that really too much to ask?\tDaniel: Diane might disagree.\tSummer: Yeah, well diane has her own family that is worried about her. Mom is supposed to be our family. I mean, you heard chance. Christine is out for blood.\tDaniel: Do you wanna keep going off on me? Or do you wanna actually try and maybe work together and figure out a way that we can help mom.\t[ Summer exhaling ] Okay, look, have you left anymore messages for her on that number that she called you from?\tSummer: No.\tDaniel: Maybe we need to change tactics. Maybe, I should call her, I leave her a message, tell her that the police are looking for her, beg her to come home.\tSummer: Absolutely not. You do that and she\u2019s gonna run and she\u2019s never gonna look back. Not for her own sake, but for us. All she cares about right now is protecting us.\tDaniel: Why does it sound like you have inside information? Like you know what\u2019s going on inside mom\u2019s head?\tSummer: Because we think alike.\tDaniel: Have you been in touch? Have you seen her again? Summer, do you know where she is? We\u2019re done.\tAudra: How is nick a problem for you?\tNate: He\u2019s had it out for me at least since victoria gave me sally spectra\u2019s job. And now, he sees I have the chops for this job he didn\u2019t think I deserved. I\u2019ve watched him over the years.\tAudra: What\u2019s your read?\tNate: Tenacious. And that\u2019s when he doesn\u2019t even give a damn. But this is about me and his sister. He didn\u2019t trust ashland and he was right to do so, but now he thinks he\u2019s victoria\u2019s noble protector. And he\u2019s not giving up.\tAudra: What will you do?\tNate: Handle the problem.\tAudra: Well, he\u2019s a newman. Handling him is going to be a delicate operation.\tNate: And that\u2019s where you come in.\tNick: Did that wake up the baby?\tTessa: No, I don\u2019t think so.\tNick: I thought I heard her fussing a little.\tFaith: I didn\u2019t hear anything.\tNick: Well, that\u2019s because you don\u2019t have supersonic parent hearing like we do, faith. I mean, even while she\u2019s asleep, she\u2019s adorable.\tTessa: I just could not agree more.\tMariah: I mean, sometimes we\u2019ll just look at her at home for hours and hours. It\u2019s very, very hypnotizing.\tNick: What about you, faith? Are you hypnotized by your niece?\tFaith: She\u2019s great. But when will she start doing\u2026 stuff?\t", "Michael: No body, no murder, no crime.\tDiane: This is unbelievable.\tKyle: But how?\tChristine: Well, chance followed up on the strand of hair that you found at the motel, which led him to finding a program from phyllis\u2019 memorial.\tMichael: Yeah. The lab examined the evidence, they found phyllis\u2019 fingerprints as well as her dna, which proved that she was very much alive after she was declared dead.\tJack: There it is. What did I tell you? The proof we\u2019ve been hoping for.\tKyle: You made it, mom. You\u2019re free.\tChristine: So, on behalf of the prosecutor\u2019s office, and myself, I just, want to apologize. These were extraordinary circumstances.\tDiane: So, what happens now? Now that you know that phyllis is alive? What happens to phyllis?\tChance: So, the lab ran some tests on evidence I found and they just called me back with the results.\tDaniel: Is it a match to our mom?\tChance: You were right to believe your brother. Phyllis is alive. And you did see her, like you said.\tSummer: So everything daniel said is true.\tDaniel: I would imagine that this means D.A. Will drop the charges against diane.\tChance: Yeah. They\u2019re telling her right now.\tSummer: Oh, she must be thrilled. I\u2019m sure you are too, right? Is this what you hoped? Diane is free. But what about my mom? What\u2019s gonna happen to her?\tChance: Look, it\u2019s out of my hands at this point. All I know is that when we find phyllis, she will be facing charges.\tSummer: If you find her.\tChance: Oh, we\u2019ll find her. Christine is not gonna let her get away with this. I guarantee, she\u2019ll call a press conference and have a perp walk when we find her.\tSummer: Christine has always had a grudge against my mom.\tChance: Well, after the money, the man hours, and the embarrassment, phyllis is now the poster girl for what happens to the rich and powerful when they bend the law. Christine wants her to pay.\t[ Summer exhaling ] I won\u2019t let me moderate to severe plaque psoriasis\tFaith: Is it possible that aria\u2019s even cuter when she\u2019s asleep?\tTessa: No, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying.\tFaith: You can wake her up and do a comparison.\tTessa: Don\u2019t you dare.\tMariah: I will kill you.\tFaith: I\u2019m kidding. I would never.\tMariah: We have house rules.\tTessa: You wake her up, you put her back.\t[ Faith laughing ]\tFaith: I want to know everything. Every time that mom calls, she\u2019s always too busy to asking me about myself to tell me what I\u2019m missing.\tSharon: Well, some things you need to hear about in person.\tMariah: I mean, you know about the gala. And phyllis.\tFaith: It\u2019s awful. Poor summer. I\u2019ve called and texted but she never answers.\tSharon: Don\u2019t take that personally. She needs time.\tFaith: How\u2019s dad?\tSharon: You will see for yourself soon.\tFaith: And how about new motherhood to the world\u2019s cutest baby?\tTessa: It\u2019s the hardest job we\u2019ll ever love.\tFaith: I love that. Anything else I\u2019m missing?\tSharon: Um, I\u2019m just happy to have all my ladies here with me. Other than that, um, nothing unusual.\tCameron: Money doesn\u2019t have much of a conscience.\tSharon: Yeah. Well, what about you, mr. Kirsten?\tCameron: Well, my conscience is, um, is kind of like my lawyer, my accountant. I can consult it, but, uh I don\u2019t always follow its advice.\tSharon: If you ever, ever, mention to my husband having met me before, I will make sure that the whole world knows what a sicko you are.\tCameron: Don\u2019t threaten me. Because you know what? I got nothing to hide. Now you, on the other hand, you seem to feel you have quite a bit to lose.\tSharon: My children are young, okay? They need me. Now, what possible pleasure could you get out of harming them? Well, that was a stupid question, wasn\u2019t it?\tCameron: Not at all. I like that you came looking for me. So, we can discuss this privately.\tSharon: Please tell nicholas that you can\u2019t make this dinner.\tCameron: Let me ask you something. Do I get a, uh, a little something in return?\t[ Cameron sighing ]\tChristine: At the very least, phyllis is guilty of fraud and obstruction of justice. On the other end of the spectrum, we have the murder of jeremy stark.\tMichael: Which was reportedly self-defense.\tDiane: Yeah.\tChristine: Once they can track down how the ambulance crash was staged and how the bodies were switched out, that list is gonna get longer and longer.\tJack: It finally happened. Kyle, what do you think?\tKyle: It\u2019s great. I mean, we can pick back up where we left off, wherever that was.\t[ Laughing ] I need to find summer. She has to hear this from me.\tDaniel: I\u2019m just glad that diane can be back with her family, for good. We both are.\tSummer: Right. Yeah. Of course.\tDaniel: I just wish we could do the same for mom.\tChance: Well, look. Everything\u2019s up in the air until we get a statement. I gotta run, but I\u2019ll be in touch with any updates.\tSummer: Wait, chance. That can\u2019t be it. You must\u2019ve found something else in the motel. Evidence to prove that it was self-defense?\tChance: The room wasn\u2019t even preserved a crime scene. I was lucky to find what I did. Any sign of struggle, it was long gone somewhere.\tSummer: Well, how am I supposed to help my mom?\tChance: You know I can\u2019t advise you on that.\tSummer: But she is innocent until proven guilty, right? All I\u2019m asking for is that she\u2019s able to come home without an extended prison stay. Look, any guidance that you can give me.\tChance: I\u2019ll do what I can. Within the bounds of the law, okay?\tSummer: Of course. I wouldn\u2019t expect anything else.\tChance: First of all, phyllis needs to come home and she needs to make a statement. We all need to hear this from her lips. (Wheezing)\tAnnouncer: The young and the restless will continue.\tAudra: You went toe-to-toe with victor newman himself and lived to talk about it.\tNate: It wasn\u2019t toe-to-toe. It was a friendly conversation.\tAudra: Does victor do friendly? He was trying to get a read on you, which basically determines your entire future. So, tell me all the details.\tNate: Well first, we started talking about my past as a physician. All the while, I\u2019m trying to figure out what this meeting was about.

I promise, nobody recognized me. Nobody. \u2013 No, wait, wait. You went to the metro court. \u2013 Uh, yeah. Just the lobby. No\u2013no further. I got there, solved that problem.

I walked a half a mile down, and then coming back, I had them drop me at the far corner, like way down the street. Way down the street. Everything\u2019s fine. \u2013 We have to leave now.\t\u2013 So your act is on soon. \u2013 [Chuckles] \u2013 Are you ready for the spotlight? \u2013 Please, me and the spotlight are old friends. \u2013 What are you kids talking about? \u2013 Old friends. \u2013 Trina!

But this year, we have turned things up a notch in order to celebrate the 60th anniversary of general hospital. \u2013 As you all know, anything can happen at the nurses\u2019 ball. \u2013 And it usually does so expect some surprises. \u2013 And let\u2019s get on with the show.\t[Bill withers, \u201clovely day\u201d]\t\u2013 When I wake up in the morning, love\tand the sunlight hurts my eye\tand something without warning, love\tbears heavy on my mind. \u2013 Then I look at you both: And the world\u2019s all right with me \u2013 oh just one look at you \u2013 and I know it\u2019s gonna be all: A lovely day\tlovely day, lovely day, lovely day, lovely day\tlovely, lovely day\ta lovely day, lovely day, lovely day\tlovely day, lovely day\tlovely day, lovely day, lovely day\twhen the day that lies ahead of me\tseems impossible to face \u2013 when someone else instead of me\talways seems to know the way \u2013 then I look at you\tand the world\u2019s all right with me\tyeah both: Just one look at you\tand I know it\u2019s gonna be\ta lovely day.

The dress, this bracelet\u2013 you have really made my first nurses\u2019 ball special. \u2013 I am grateful to everyone who helped me while I was struggling. No one has helped me more than you, gladys. \u2013 Look at you. You\u2019re not struggling anymore? \u2013 I still have my days. But I\u2019m finally ready to get back into the world, jump start my life again. \u2013 I guess that means the court will revoke gladys\u2019s guardianship. You\u2019ll be on your own two feet in no time. \u2013 This is gorgeous. \u2013 Yeah. It is. Gh really goes all out. Who pays for all this? \u2013 Oh, the vendors donate all the products and services. And all the money that\u2019s raised goes to a charity that\u2019s devoted to hiv and aids. You know, I\u2019m really impressed that you agreed to perform, though. \u2013 Yeah. Yeah, well, you know, every once in a while, I do the right thing. \u2013 Hi, elizabeth. You look absolutely stunning. \u2013 Thank you. Cleaned up pretty well yourself. Can\u2019t wait for the big duet.

Are you ok? \u2013 I\u2019m just so proud of everybody. I\u2019m so proud. And it\u2019s breaking my heart that I can\u2019t be there. \u2013 I\u2019m devastated for you. If only our lives didn\u2019t depend on our staying away from the nurses\u2019 ball. \u2013 I know. I know that. I know that. You\u2019ve made it very clear.

You think victor\u2019s looking for us? \u2013 100%. \u2013 You don\u2019t think he\u2019s just left town? \u2013 Victor wants to get his hands on the ice princess necklace. And he\u2019s not going to give up until he finds us. \u2013 We checked all the houses in a three block radius. No sign of them. \u2013 Yeah, well, of course, lucy coe is savvy enough not to be dropped right outside the house she, anna, and valentine are hiding out in along with my necklace. Widen the search, again discreetly. \u2013 Of course. \u2013 And when you find the house, no one is to approach without my direct order. \u2013 Ok. I\u2019m going to go find tj. \u2013 So I couldn\u2019t help but notice your little traffic jam with you, and portia and jordan. \u2013 You saw that, huh? \u2013 Yeah.

How do we do that? \u2013 It\u2019s very easy. We act like we\u2019re having fun. \u2013 Ha. Like that? \u2013 Perfect. \u2013 Ok. \u2013 Can I get a club soda please?

I\u2019m still kicking myself for letting sydney val jean tell you how beautiful you look before I could. \u2013 Well, you got there eventually. \u2013 For the record, the only reason I hesitated was because I was speechless. I should have offered to escort you here tonight so that I could arrive with you on my arm. \u2013 As an accessory? \u2013 No. No. You\u2019re no one\u2019s accessory.

Maxie following your micromanaging? \u2013 Yeah, yeah. Uh, so far, so good. I mean, of course, you should have seen the chaos this afternoon. I mean, it was madness. An army is only so good as their general. \u2013 What chaos, lucy? \u2013 How would you know what\u2019s happening at the metro court? \u2013 Maybe, just maybe, I did a little bit more than text maxie. \u2013 I\u2019m not an everyone for themselves kind of person. I don\u2019t want to be alone, but sometimes life just works out that way, obviously. \u2013 I\u2019m sorry. \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, too. I\u2019m sorry I ever signed that nda with linc to get my songs back. I knew it was the wrong move, but I was selfish. So I did it anyway. I let you down. Actually, the worst part is I let down all the women who will have to deal with linc, but I let you down, too. That\u2019s what hurts me the most. \u2013 What hurts me the most is that you let yourself down. \u2013 Thanks for waiting.

{"content": ["Don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s fine.\tLook, are you pleased? Just gonna, at least let me explain this. Fine, explain just what were you doing at the police station. You didn\u2019t betray anyone and God forbid you had left hand with Colin. I told you that he never hurt me physically. Talia, emotionally abusive relationships turn physical almost all the time.\tI, I see it almost every day.\tLook, I, I, I think you should see a therapist just to work through your feelings and, and everything that that happened and why Dr. Marlena is the best apparently. What\u2019s it matter to work out my feelings if I\u2019m going to prison anyway? Huh? You me? Why are you giving up so easily? Where is that strong woman that I know?\tYou know the one, the one that you said play football with the guys that was president of her high school class? I wasn\u2019t strong back then either Jada. Okay. It was just an ax, so, so you\u2019re saying it was what a, a facade? Yeah, I guess you can say that. So I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d measure up. Okay. So I put a lot of pressure on myself.\tThat is the only reason that I succeeded at anything. No, Talia, you succeeded because you are bright. You are so very bright and you are gifted. Okay? You succeeded because you work hard as hell and you are not someone who gives up. Okay.\tOh God, I am, I, I\u2019m, I\u2019m sorry. I am so sorry that I didn\u2019t know that you were hurting and, and, and suffering even back then. I, I, what, what would it hurt? What would it hurt to talk to Dr. Marlene. If you don\u2019t wanna do it for you, would you please do it for me?\tYeah, I will. Thank you.\tWhat, oh, oh. Oh no, they must have cut the cable off. Cause I didn\u2019t pay the bill. My bills are just piling up. I\u2019m not able to manage this household by myself on a nurse\u2019s salary. What, what? What about me? Don\u2019t I have a job? You\u2019re retired. What about a pension? Oh, you don\u2019t have one, I\u2019m afraid. Uh, you owned a business, uh, an ice cream shop, Marshall\u2019s ice cream shop.\tWell, that has a Vegas memory. Yeah. Well, it doesn\u2019t matter. You know what I wanna do? I\u2019m gonna pick up a few shifts. Things are gonna be fine. Wait, wait, wait. But my, my, my medical bills. Oh, don\u2019t you worry about that. Well, speaking of work, I\u2019ve got to go. Uh, I\u2019d have my Chanel. Come by and take care of you.\tBut she\u2019s got a very demanding business and works long hours. Oh, what kind of business? Uh, bakery. Oh, ice cream pastries. Oh, I have a good, don\u2019t I? You do. You sure do. No, I don\u2019t want you to think that you, you\u2019re gonna sit here all day long staring at the walls and talking to cats. Even though the cable is out, you can still watch tv.\tI recorded 15 years of my favorite story, body and Soul, and I have them right here for you. You\u2019re gonna enjoy it so much.\tHolly, come on. You were hospitalized for hypertension. Oh, but I\u2019m fine now. I\u2019ve been taking my meds. Who we stone. That\u2019s not something to play around with. And why\u2019d you walk outta the hospital? Chanel left me last night to go get me some dinner. Then she texted me, something came up, and I never heard from her again.\tThen this morning I saw on the news she was involved with the arrest of Colin Bedford, and no one even had the decency to tell me, okay. Chanel was never in danger, and besides that, we still have not established a definite connection between Abe\u2019s disappearance and common, but he just admitted it. We don\u2019t know if he\u2019s telling the truth yet.\tWell, my client was mistaken. No, he doesn\u2019t know anything about Merick Harbor\u2019s location. I\u2019m sorry. All right, so in other words, he was lying. Well, maybe he\u2019s lying now. Maybe this is some sort of tactic she just came up with to get him a better deal. No. Look, I was very clear with him that he needed to come clean with me so I could use any information he had to his advantage.\tAnd I\u2019m certain he just, he doesn\u2019t know what your husband is and that\u2019s the God\u2019s honest truth.\tLook, I am really sorry, Wendy. The last thing I\u2019m meant to do was let you down\tthat that\u2019s it. You\u2019re just, you\u2019re not gonna say anything. I understand. Bet you witnessed a crime bet you had to make a statement. I just don\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t let me know. A, a, a and I should have, of course, I should have. But look, they were questioning me for quite a while. Right. And by the time that I had a chance to call or text you, my phone had died.\tSo you didn\u2019t think to ask someone else if you could use their phone? I wish to hell that I would have, but honestly, I, I admit that I was a little distracted. By, by, by all the drama, you know. Okay. I don\u2019t know what else to say. I feel terrible. All right. And I know that no amount of apologizing is gonna make up for the way that I stood you up like that, but is there any other way I can make it up to you?\t", "\u200aMorning. Good morning. Coffee\u2019s ready. Oh, thank you. Oh man. So did you hear from Johnny last night? No, not this morning either. Hmm. That\u2019s strange. I mean, he\u2019s on his way over here with takeout and then he calls you, says he is with Chanel and then nothing. Hmm. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s still with her. Do you?\tUh, six cups of coffee and I still feel like the walking dead. I am so sorry. I can\u2019t believe the police kept us there all night to give them our statements. You didn\u2019t even see what happened with Colin. You were downstairs the whole time. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I, I, I saw them, uh, hauling him out of the pub and, well, you know what I saw because you heard me repeat it about.\t600 times. Yeah. They should\u2019ve let you go home, get some sleep, and let you go through all that by yourself. It wasn\u2019t that big of a deal besides saying, I. I\u2019m, I\u2019m willing to do anything that I can to make sure that that psycho gets put away for a very long time. You and me both.\tYou betrayed me to now you\u2019re gonna pay.\tWhere in the hell is my husband? You little coward, Paulina. What you doing here? I thought you were still at the hospital. Well, I\u2019m out obviously. Okay. Yeah. And how the hell did you get in here? Why are you interrogating me when you should be questioning him? I wanna know where the hell my husband is, and you\u2019re gonna tell me right now.\tMs. King, this is Police Commissioner Ray Hernandez. I need to speak with you right away about the abduction of Mayor Abe Carver. I understand that you were on duty when it happened, so please call me back at this number as soon as possible. Thank you.\tYou are finally awake. Oh, thank. God. Oh, we also worried about you, but everything\u2019s going to be fine. Mm-hmm. Because we have each other, my love, and we always will. Paulina\u2019s here. Good morning, sunshine.\tLike sand through the hourglass. So are the days of our lives.\tSo no. I haven\u2019t heard from Johnny, but before you say anything, there could be a million reasons why he didn\u2019t call. So he spent the entire night with his ex-wife and there are a million reasons he couldn\u2019t eat next to him. Okay, look, I\u2019m not happy about this and he better have a good explanation. I jump to conclusions about the whole crazy.\tBiscuit episode and I was wrong. So this time I am giving him the benefit of the doubt. Fine. Yeah, I understand. I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s really not a good look for him to keep ghosting you. You know what? Trashing Johnny just to score points isn\u2019t such a good look for you either.\tAre you okay? Yeah. Why? Because your, uh, your hands are shaking. Uh, um, it\u2019s, it was probably the coffee from the PD last night. I two had about six cups. Right? Right. It was the, uh, the coffee look. Chanel, you had a really close call last night and. You haven\u2019t had time to process it until just now.\tI\u2019m really sorry. It\u2019s not your fault. Oh no. Chanel. I should have never let you go up to Talia\u2019s room by yourself. You could have been hurt. We\u2019re worse. Yeah. Well, you, you didn\u2019t know Colin was up there and, okay. Can you, can you believe that Tolia had the nerve to defend him to me? Yeah, she did. Right before she gave you the badge and basically turned him in.\tOh Chanel, she was probably terrified to say anything bad about him cuz she knew he was right there. Terrified. She loved that guy and she did everything he told her to do. Yeah. Yeah, she did like give up her job as a doctor to move to a town that she\u2019s never even been to. To terrorize a bunch of people she\u2019s never even met.\tI mean, he must have some hold over her. Are you defending her? She did just go off a building and almost die to save your mother. But she obviously, she feels terrible about what she did. Right? Yeah, I suppose. But that doesn\u2019t change the fact that she betrayed me in the worst possible way. So I don\u2019t care if she apologizes a million times.\tI will never. Forgive her.\tOh, you\u2019re awake. I was hoping you sleep in. Yeah, no, I was having a nightmare that Colin was gonna come back for me.\tI\u2019m so sorry, Talia. But he\u2019s locked up now. He can\u2019t hurt you. Or anyone else. I know you also know that I\u2019m not gonna let him lay another finger on you again. I do. Okay, good. So get some rest. Okay. You\u2019ve been up all night. Yes. How are you? No, seriously, Jada. I don\u2019t wanna close my eyes again.\tSo is he still refusing to talk? It would seem so. Look, J do you really think he took Abe? I mean, he didn\u2019t even say anything to me. Listen, Colin escaped from the hospital at the exact same time that Abe disappeared. If he\u2019s not responsible, then I don\u2019t know who else it could be. Oh, you were tossing and turning all night last night, darling.\tIs everything all right? I I had a dream. It was so strange.\tIt was about you, Paulina. Well, it didn\u2019t look like you\tstop staring at me and say something. Damn it. Mr. Bedford has been exercising his Fifth Amendment rights ever since he has got here. So now if you will, please go outside. Look, I know he has to get due process from you, but not from me. How to strangle the truth out of it. Paulina, what\u2019s not? What the hell is going on here?\t", "Deep breath. She can\u2019t have gone far. Right. I\u2019m gonna help you find her, but Wendy, she\u2019s waiting for you. No, no, no. This is more important. Well, I, I, I don\u2019t even know where to start looking. Actually, I have an idea.\tIt\u2019s been long enough. I\u2019m going back to No, Paul Paulina. No. Now listen to me. Abe will be the first one to tell you that we have to follow the law and besides, we don\u2019t even know if Colin is telling us the truth. You said he\u2019s your number one suspect. Who else would take Abe? I mean, yeah, sure I have lots of enemies, but Abe doesn\u2019t.\tEveryone loves him. Yeah. Excuse me. Hello? Hi, commissioner. This is Chanel. Johnny gave me your number. Look, I, I know this can\u2019t exactly be called a missing person case, but Mama went missing from the hospital this morning, AMA, and I\u2019m, I\u2019m really worried about her. Mm-hmm. She\u2019s right here. Chanel, oh, what is she in trouble?\tUm, no, she\u2019s not. She came here to confront Colin Bedford, but she didn\u2019t tell me that she left the hospital against medical advice. There\u2019s not any chance you can come down here, pick her up, take her back to the hospital. Yes. Yes. I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll be right there.\tSheels on her way. I\u2019m not going anywhere until I find out what that psychopath knows about where a is.\tYou know, darling, that knock to the noggin may have messed up your sense of taste. It\u2019s been known to happen. Well, if you don\u2019t want sausage, what would you like? Uh, maybe a toast tea. Hmm. And perhaps a pain pill for that headache you\u2019re trying to hide from them. It is. It\u2019s throbbing a bit. Yeah. Am mind turning on the tv?\tWell, we talked about the news. Remember, it\u2019s. It\u2019s just too upsetting and, and screen time should be limited after concussion. Are you my mother or are you my wife? Oh, post-concussion mood swings. Gonna have to keep an eye on that. Yeah.\tHey, how\u2019s your arm? Do you need any meds? Can you stop worrying about me, Jada, please. Okay. I\u2019ve caused you enough trouble already. I honestly, I don\u2019t even know how you let me stay here. How many times do I have to tell you, you are my sister. I love you. What is this guy call and do to you to make you feel so bad about yourself?\tWhat he did? Nothing. Talia. He messed with your mind? Yeah, because I let him, but as soon as you realize what he was going to do, you turned him in. You should be proud of yourself. E even the newspaper is calling you a hero. You, you know, I, I really think that\u2019s gonna help your case. No, Dana. I am not a hero.\tI was scared of him. He was furious with me. Aim over for that one second when he asked me to go away with him. Right. My heart, it, it was bounding and I thought maybe he might forgive me for turning on him. I was relieved. I, I was so relieved that I got like this adrenaline rush, you know. In that moment, I was scared.\tJust in that incident, I almost went with him. What is wrong with me? Honey? Honey, there is nothing. There is nothing wrong with you. I miss him. And I know I did the right thing we giving Chanel that badge, but I constantly hear this voice in my head, Jay and his voice, and telling me that betrayed him and his right because I didn\u2019t, I did betray him.\tI dunno where a is. I knew it, but the cops don\u2019t need to know that, do they? If I can get them to agree to let them lead me to him, then I\u2019m, I\u2019m sure that I can escape and make everything much worse for yourself. How can it be much worse than colon is? If you try to escape again, you can wind up dead and I don\u2019t think that I can bear that.\tDo you? Don\u2019t understand. You\u2019re so selfish. God, you the only family I have left. If you plead guilty. I can at least try for a plea deal. Yeah, there\u2019s gonna be prison time, but if you just admit to everything that you did, I know you mean that\u2019s hard as done. No. That you have done. Colin, you may have not trashed Paulina\u2019s office or.\tSpike those biscuits all by yourself, but there\u2019s just no way I can get you clear to what happened on that roof. It\u2019s bad enough that you assaulted a cop. I thank God you actually didn\u2019t kidnap the mayor, but you have to admit to everything that you\u2019ve done.\tI want to go to prison. Yeah, well, there\u2019s no choice. So what\u2019ll it be?\tHey, uh, hi. I have brought breakfast. I already ate. Oh, he\u2019s back. Yeah. And he has a name, but he\u2019s back Trip blue in last night. He just made me breakfast. Oh. And tacos. For dinner last night when you never showed up because you were too busy with Chanel? I can explain. Okay. Really? You can explain why you didn\u2019t even call.\tI wish that I could have, I was stuck at the police station all night. No cell signal at the police station. I somehow doubt that and don\u2019t they have land? Hey, can I, can I just, uh, can I talk to you alone for a second please? Yeah, I\u2019ll go take a shower. No, he lives here. You can\u2019t just tell him what to do and where to go.\t", "Le let me take you out to dinner tonight. Anywhere you wanna go? What do you say?\tThe bed is lumpy. . Right. And I know you\u2019re just sweating the smallest stuff right now, so you don\u2019t have to think about the big stuff, baby. I\u2019m scared. I\u2019m scared. You know, it\u2019s bad enough thinking that queasy Colin had a somewhere, but now I don\u2019t even know where he is or how he is. And in a way that\u2019s even worse.\tNo. Oh, I know. But you just need to try to close your eyes and rest. It\u2019s gonna be okay. It has to be.\tSo let me. This straight. Colin said that he knew where Abe was and then he recanted. Yeah. That\u2019s a long short of it. Which story do you believe? Well, I feel like at this point, if he knew where Abe was, he\u2019d give him up. Might help him. Hmm. Now what? Yeah. Well that nurse is the only potential witness that we have at this point, and we don\u2019t even know if she saw anything, but she still hasn\u2019t responded to my calls, so I was hoping that you could follow up with her.\tI know we were supposed to go together, but now I have to deal with charging Bedford. Well, if you don\u2019t mind, I have a personal interest in scene as calling case through. Could we switch? Yeah, yeah, sure. I wish you the nurse then. Thank you. Yeah, and hopefully she has something to tell us.\tBody and soul. Yeah. I never miss it. I used to tape it every day before they started streaming. My tapes go back 15 years. It\u2019s all queued up. There you go. And you know you\u2019re gonna start from the beginning and you\u2019ve lost your memory, so it\u2019s all new to you anyway. Right, right. All right. I\u2019m gonna go now and I\u2019m gonna lock the door behind me.\tI want you to listen to me very carefully. I don\u2019t wanna frighten you, but that. Man that attacked you is still out there and he\u2019s, he\u2019s been impersonating a cup, so it\u2019s very important not to open the door, especially if the cops show up. Okay. You expect him to, no, of course not, but I\u2019m a warrior. Alright, well watch your show and enjoy and get some rest and I\u2019ll see you soon.\tSure. Okay. How about eight o\u2019clock at the bistro? Great. It\u2019s a date. Uh, that\u2019s how you, that\u2019s how you walk around the apartment, huh? Uh yeah. Yeah. You know, as we established, I live here. Uh, and look, for some reason you can\u2019t make it tonight. You know, say you have another emergency involving Chanel. I\u2019m making stir fry tonight.\tI, I know it\u2019s your favorite.\tChanel,\thave they found your stepfather yet? No, because first your boyfriend said he knew where he was, then he said he didn\u2019t. He\u2019s not my boyfriend. Not anymore. Whatever. Just stay away from me and my mom. Look, I\u2019m trying. Okay, then what the hell are you doing here? I came to make an appointment with Dr. Evans, my sister thought it\u2019d be a good idea to talk about why I did the things I did for Colin.\tLook, Chanel, I\u2019m sorry about everything.\tI don\u2019t know what else to say anymore.\tDA\u2019s on her way. So you couldn\u2019t convince your brother to plead guilty, huh? I tried, but uh, he\u2019s not having it too bad. As I\u2019m sure you know, Trask is going to throw the book at him, especially after all his transgressions after the initial crime. Not only did he escape police custody, he tried to kidnap my sister.\tOh, and he lied. While being interrogated, you know, I am well aware of the charges being brought against my brother, and I\u2019m appalled by what he\u2019s done, but he\u2019s my brother and I love him. I imagine you feel the same way about your sister Colin manipulated her. They were in a consensual relationship. Talia was a willing participant.\tTalia takes responsibility for what she did, as does Colin. You know, he\u2019s not been quite the same since our parents died. If you dare try the insanity defense, don\u2019t you tell me how to defend my client. And maybe he should stop worrying so much about my brother and start finding the mayor who seems to have been misplaced on your watch.\tIn St. Louis? Yes, Julie. I\u2019m back in my hospital bed now. No, no, no. Honey, you don\u2019t need to come. No, I\u2019m fine. Oh, I\u2019m I will be once they find out who really took Abe and where he is. Oh.\tYou\u2019re not dressed yet, sweetheart. One of the upsides of being a gentleman of leisure is not having a set schedule, but you do have an appointment to keep\tlunch with Ms. Riz. Check. Ah, yes, that. I am not going.\tYes, this is Gwen Recheck. I\u2019m phoning to confirm a reservation for lunch, right? Yes. It\u2019s for two people at one o\u2019clock. Um, and just so you know, my um, guest is Mr. Vaughn Noner, Dmitri Vaughn, Mona. So I would please like a very quiet, nice table in the corner, private one. Thank you. Well, everything\u2019s set with my interview with the mysterious Mr.\tV Mok. I\u2019m telling you, Mattie, this is going to be the spectator scoop of the century. How nice. So while everything\u2019s coming up, roses for you. My life is over.\tYeah. Well, okay. Thanks Jada. Keep me posted. Okay. Sounds like there\u2019s no news. Yeah, she says they have no new link. I mean, I don\u2019t care.\t", "Nobody should be speaking to my client without his lawyer. Present your client. You mean your, your. Psychopathic, murderous, kidnapping brother. He has nothing to do with the mayor\u2019s disappearance. Actually, if I may say something, I do know where mayor cover is. If you let me out of here, I\u2019ll take you to him.\tOkay, look, I\u2019m sorry for what I said about Johnny. You\u2019re right. I was being a jerk and I just, I just don\u2019t like seeing you hurt. But if you\u2019re not upset with him, then I sure don\u2019t have any right to be No, I didn\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t upset. Just said. I hope he has a good explanation. Oh, he is a fool. If he doesn\u2019t, you\u2019ve had three guys fighting over you.\tPoor Johnny. I, I wouldn\u2019t take your patience for granted. Yeah, and not exactly the overly patient type\tI should get to work. Did you have breakfast? I saw your banana still on the counter. Um, No, I\u2019m not hungry. Oh, come on. The best day starts with a good breakfast. I mean, all the studies say it\u2019s true. Come on, sit down. You know you don\u2019t have to keep cooking for me because you feel sorry for me. Okay.\tWaffles and a toaster does not count as cooking. And for the record, I don\u2019t feel sorry for you. No, actually, if there\u2019s anyone I feel sorry for, it\u2019s Johnny. You know, because if he doesn\u2019t step up his game, he, uh, nevermind. I\u2019m not gonna keep you in a joke about it. If you\u2019re gonna give him the benefit of the doubt, and so will I.\tWell, um, if you\u2019re sure that you\u2019re all right, I should probably go find Wendy and explain to her why I disappeared last night. You didn\u2019t text her? No, my phone died. Oh my God, Johnny. Yeah, she\u2019s probably worried you should go now. I\u2019m on my way. Um, so take care. I\u2019ll see you around\tJulie. Oh my God. Chanel, my mother went missing from the hospital. Oh, so you know where Mayor Carver is, but you can\u2019t tell us. You have to take us to him. Oh, you wouldn\u2019t find him without me. Colin, not another word. Commissioner. Ms. Price. I need a moment, uh, with my client alone. Let him finish. Oh my God\u2019s sake.\tMy husband\u2019s life is at stake. Paulina, please, please, we have to follow the law. We will find Abe, but you want him to walk? Do you want the case to get thrown out? Okay, go please. Paulina,\twhat the hell are you doing? You told me last night you didn\u2019t know anything about the Marist disappearance. You told me not to tell you if I did. Well, I didn\u2019t mean for you to lie. And even if you did kidnap him, why the hell would you just go and confess it to the cops like that? I didn\u2019t confess. I just said I knew where he was.\tOkay. I\u2019m gonna ask you one more time the truth. Colin, do you know where Mayor Carver is?\tWhat do you mean? I didn\u2019t look like myself?\tIn my dream, I, I woke up in the hospital and you were, you were sitting right beside my, my bed. Mm-hmm. And, uh, everything was blurry and when my vision cleared up, it was you. But it wasn\u2019t. What do you think that means? Uh, you, you were just different and, and you, you weren\u2019t dressed like a nurse. You think I only wear scrubs?\tLook, I dreamed one time that I was elected president of the United States, but that obviously didn\u2019t happen. You know how dreams go and you better stop thinking about other women. Mr. Also, I\u2019m gonna start getting jealous. Sorry. Well, I wanna go make you some breakfast sausage and eggs. Here we go. Sausage.\tI, I, I thought I was the only one who was having a memory lapse. I hate sausage. No, no, you don\u2019t. You, you do not. You just must have lost your memory. You forget that you love them so much, you know. No, no. I haven\u2019t forgotten that. I hate sausage. It\u2019s slimy. It\u2019s me, pig parts.\tMaybe my stomach turns just talking about it. I, I, I, I hate sausage.\tI guess I was hungry, apparently, you know, apropo of what you said before about having three guys fighting over me. Yeah. Well, just so you know, I\u2019m totally not used to that. I\u2019m not even even used to guys looking at me. No, come on. I mean, a, my father always told me that I was never gonna get married if I didn\u2019t wear makeup or stop dressing like a slob, a k a, wearing comfortable clothes and drove him crazy that I didn\u2019t care.\tWell, First of all, you don\u2019t need makeup or fancy clothes. You are beautiful just the way you are and you\u2019re not caring. It is one of the things I love about you. That\u2019s sweet. It\u2019s true trip. You\u2019re such a good guy. I feel kind of guilty that I\u2019m the one who\u2019s ambivalent. Indecisive.\tI hope you know that. I\u2019m totally cool with you seeing other people too. I don\u2019t wanna see other people. Come on. You are a red blooded American guy. I mean, you\u2019re handsome. What? Smart as hell. Really nice. Doctor, you\u2019re a total catch. You could have anyone you want.

Julie said that she left the hospital this morning against medical advice, and she thought that she went back to the apartment, but she wasn\u2019t there. Okay. Where the hell could she be here?

You end up having to rely on each other in a lot of different ways, and I know you ran into some difficulties in co-parenting with chelsea.\tAdam: Yeah. Especially recently. I mean, before her incident.\tSharon: But you overcame those difficulties because of your mutual love for connor, and I think that that will extend to your respect and care for each other.\tAdam: It, uh \u2014 it did. It does for chelsea, but that doesn\u2019t mean the same thing\u2019s gonna happen with me and sally.\tSally: Well, once your baby\u2019s born, I think your connection will get stronger because you have your child\u2019s best interests at heart.

It\u2019s not obvious to you?!\tSummer: I\u2019m just trying to understand what led up to that. Like, why have you been acting so weird tonight? One minute you\u2019re giving me this speech about how proud you are of me\u2026\tPhyllis: What? That\u2019s weird to you, that I\u2019m proud of my daughter?\tSummer: Well, the next thing I know, you\u2019re in some secret hotel room fighting with diane. I \u2014 I\u2019m just trying to figure out why the two of you were in there to begin with.\tPhyllis: I have worked so hard.\t[ Laughs ] I\u2019ve worked so hard. Oh, god. I\u2019m working so hard to convince everybody who diane really is and no one\u2019s believed me and I\u2019ve lost everything. I\u2019ve lost everything. I\u2019ve lost my children. I\u2019ve lost my job. I\u2019ve lost everything. I-I \u2014 I\u2019m tired. I\u2019m so tired.\tSummer: Okay.\tPhyllis: Oh, my god.\tSummer: That doesn\u2019t explain why you were in there with her.\tPhyllis: I wanted to work things out with her. Oh, summer, I wanted to work things out with her. I saw her walking upstairs. I wanted to pull her in to a suite so we could talk. And look at you, looking at me with suspicion. That breaks my heart. But I have wanted to work things out with diane because I saw how crazy it\u2019s gotten. I wanted to clean the slate with her, that\u2019s all.\tSummer: So, what went wrong?\tPhyllis: I don\u2019t know. It was her. She has this power, this false power now, you know, that she\u2019s living at the abbott mansion and she\u2019s close to my daughter and she\u2019s the one who can\u2019t stand that I know who she really is.\tShe\u2019s the one who has hatred with me!\tSummer: Mom, stop! (Terrie) if you\u2019re a smoker.\tAdditional sponsorship\tprovided by\u2026\tSummer: I can\u2019t listen to this again. It is the same story over and over. It\u2019s like you think if you tell it enough times that it\u2019ll become true, but \u2014 I want to believe you. I wish that I could.\tPhyllis: You never will. You\u2019ll never believe me.\tSummer: Mom, wait.\tPhyllis: No. You stay away from me. Okay?\tJack: Are you alright? At least physically?\tDiane: I-I-I think so.\tJack: What the hell did we just walk in on?\tDiane: Phyllis tricked me into coming up here. She said that kyle was \u2014 was really sick a-and that he was asking for me and then when i got in here, she just kind of attacked me in some sort of fit of rage.\tKyle: What would make phyllis go off like that?\tDiane: I mean, who knows? She\u2019s psychotic. My mere presence sets her off.\tJack: Okay, whatever happened, it was clearly traumatic, and we have to deal with this situation. First of all, I don\u2019t think we should announce our engagement tonight.\tDiane: No. No, phyllis is not going to take this from me. She is not going to ruin tonight. Jack \u2014 jack, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m better than fine. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m fantastic.

Well, I\u2019ll go with you.\tDevon: Yeah?\tAbby: Yeah.\tDevon: I know you like parties like this.\tAbby: Yeah, but I would rather be with you.\tDevon: Yeah?\tAbby: And besides, I want to hear what brought on this truce between you and lily \u2014 if you want to talk about it.\tKyle: That was\u2026\tJack: I know. I know.\tKyle: Look, phyllis is always the one stirring up trouble, but mom was out for blood.\tJack: Yeah, that\u2019s why i wanted to call it a night. What we just saw is a version of diane I thought was long gone. It\u2019s unsettling.\tKyle: Look, are you having second thoughts about the engagement?\tJack: I don\u2019t know what i think. Look, I love your mother. I want to spend the rest of my life with her, but I worry this is all going too quickly and the stress is too much for her.\tKyle: Yeah, she was definitely enraged. Look, on the other hand, if phyllis used my son as some kind of ploy to get me alone, I would flip, too, especially if i thought harrison was sick or in trouble. Look, mom was rushing to that suite because she was worried about me. Her adrenaline was pumping, and phyllis ambushed her. That\u2019s enough to send anyone over the edge.\tJack: Right. Migraine hits hard, so u hit back with ubrelvy\tDevon: Just seeing this jazz club being dedicated to neil is what changed everything for me. And you did that. You have no idea how much it meant to me and lily. It\u2019s what\u2019s reunited us more than anything else. So, thank you.\tAbby: Well, it was a very tough secret to keep, but knowing that it brought you and lily together\u2026\tDevon: It means everything.\tYou mean everything.\tNick: So, how are you feeling?\tSally: Uh, fine. Yep. Great.\tNick: Yeah?\tSally: Mm-hmm.\tNick: Because you are clutching that mask like it\u2019s some kind of shield.\tSally: [ Sighs ] Any chance the shield will fend off these questions?\tNick: Nah.

For putting myself in a position where people that I care about can\u2019t stand me. Except you. For some reason, you still put up with me. Why?\tDiane: Okay, I\u2019ve pulled myself together and I\u2019m ready to enjoy the rest of the evening with my favorite fellas.

And then the fact that you didn\u2019t answer made me think that what phyllis had said was actually true.\tKyle: What? You texted me?\tDiane: Yes.\tKyle: I didn\u2019t get a text.\t[ Sighs ]\tJack: What?\tKyle: I lost my phone. Again.\t[ Indistinct conversations ]\tAudra: Uh, sorry for the interruption. Hi. Um\u2026 yeah, so, uh, you know, I \u2014 you know, I \u2014 I was wondering if you know who this phone belongs to because it keeps ringing and the bartender is too swamped to try and find its owner.\tAshley: Audra charles, right? Ashley abbott. But then I\u2019m sure you already know that. This is kind of fun. Isn\u2019t it, tucker? I finally get to meet your co-conspirator.\tAudra: [ Chuckles ] I do indeed know quite a bit about you.\tAshley: I\u2019m sure you do. And still, that\u2019s not even half of it.\tTucker: Uh, I don\u2019t know whose phone that is. Do you, ashley?\tAudra: Fair enough. I will continue my rounds as a good samaritan.\tAshley: Actually, that is my nephew kyle\u2019s phone.\tAudra: Oh, great. Yeah. Thanks. Um, I will get it to him. I\u2019ve actually been looking for a reason to make kyle abbott\u2019s acquaintance.\tAshley: Huh. Bye.

Oh, I\u2019m so glad you came for this.

I know it\u2019s coming from the right place, but when it comes to my personal life, I got to make my own decisions.\tDanny: Fair enough. I\u2019ve said my piece. I will butt out now. Hey, what do I know anyway? I\u2019m just, you know, your old man, right?\tDaniel: Well, thank you. Thank you for butting out. It\u2019d be a shame if I had to avoid both my parents.\tDanny: I know that phyllis can be overbearing at times.\tGina: Now, that\u2019s an understatement.\tDaniel: Oh, my god. Hi! Hi.\tGina: You see, he\u2019s realized that the best way to handle phyllis is with total avoidance. He is so wise, daniel.\tDanny: Okay, one last piece of advice from the wisest of the romalottis \u2014 that would be me.\tGina: Oh, yeah.\tDaniel: Okay.\tDanny: Life is too short for grudges, especially against people we love and people who love us back. You understand?\tDaniel: I spoke with her earlier. She did seem different.\tDanny: I\u2019m sure she\u2019s feeling pretty lost right now, being on the outs with both you and summer. I just really hope you can find a way to get past this because at some point you\u2019re gonna have to accept her for the way she is, the same way that you want to be accepted.\tDaniel: Okay, I will talk to her. I will sit down, and we will figure this all out, just not tonight. But soon, okay?\tDanny: That\u2019s all I ask.\tGina: Okay, now that we\u2019re done with this conversation, how about me?

Looks like diane is trying to play the part of the first lady.\tVictor: [ Chuckles ]\tJack: Thank you all for giving me a couple of minutes of your time. First, I want you to join me in thanking my sister, traci abbott, nikki newman, lauren fenmore-baldwin, and michael baldwin for putting together this spectacular event.\t[ Cheers and applause ] Who says the people of this town can\u2019t work together, especially when it\u2019s to create such a wonderful moment, a celebration of the place we all call home? Genoa city is where my parents chose to live their lives, where I have lived my entire life, where I raised my son kyle. And I could not be happier that kyle and his beautiful wife, summer, have chosen to raise their son, harrison, here as well. It is my dearest hope that my grandson will learn to cherish family and community, as generations of abbotts have before him.\t[ Applause ] Now, let me be clear. Just as with all families, with all communities, it hasn\u2019t always been simple. It hasn\u2019t always been easy. We have definitely had our ups and downs, both as collaborators and competitors, as friend and foe. But make no mistake. The people of genoa city have more in common than they don\u2019T. We all share the same blood. We all manage wisconsin winters.\t[ Laughter ] We all have the same distinctly midwest value for hard work and kindness. We share a humanity, same loves and losses, the same heartache and hope. And we choose to live in this town together. And I am forever grateful for that.\t[ Applause ] The people of genoa city know that in this town, you can grow, you can change, you can transform despite your mistakes, your flaws, your foibles. We all know we have the opportunity to live our very best lives. Every day I see the very best in the woman standing next to me. I know some of you don\u2019t see what I do, but perhaps everyone is not meant to. But I know from the life I have lived, happiness can be elusive. When you find it, grab it and don\u2019t let go. That is what I have done. That is what we have done. We have chosen happiness. We have chosen love. And we have chosen this evening to share our great news with you because we know, perhaps better than most, there\u2019s nothing this town loves more than gossip.\t[ Laughter ] So we are happy to provide it. Consider it a party favor. I am in love with diane jenkins. I have asked her to marry me.\t[ Crowd gasping ] And she said yes.\t[ Applause ] Ubrelvy helps u fight migraine attacks.\tChelsea: Well, I think i turned into a pumpkin an hour ago. I\u2019m gonna head upstairs. Here you go.\tBilly: Thank you. Well\u2026sweet dreams.\tChelsea: Good night.\tBilly: Chels, one more thing, just in case. Did I forget to tell you that you look beautiful?\tChelsea: I think you did.\tBilly: [ Chuckles ] You look beautiful.\tChelsea: [ Breathes deeply ] Wow. It was even better the second time.\t[ Indistinct conversations ]\tNick: You okay?\tSally: Yeah. It\u2019s just, seeing someone so certain. That\u2019s real love.\tVictor: Just amazing, you know? To watch jack abbott commit one mistake after the other. It won\u2019t be long because he and diane jenkins will blow up in some spectacular fashion. I promise you.\tNikki: Well, apparently i spent months putting this event together as an opportunity for them to steal the show.\tVictor: Ohh. Well, and kind of funny, i think it is.\tNikki: Yeah. Ha ha.\t[ Indistinct conversations ]\tAshley: I think I\u2019m gonna be sick to my stomach.\tTucker: Well, let\u2019s get the hell out of here then.\tAshley: Oh, my god. You\u2019re so right. Let\u2019s go.\tTucker: Yeah.\tPhyllis: Whoo! Yes! Yes!\t[ Chuckles ] Let\u2019s hear it for love! Whoo! Come on! Come on! Come on! Love! It\u2019s me! Hi! Hey!\t[ Sighs ] Well, let\u2019s hear it for the future mr. And mrs. Jack abbott. Come on!\t[ Applause ]\t"], "answer": [2, 3, 1, 0, 4]}
{"content": ["\u00a0[Soft dramatic music]\t[Knocks]\tYeah, come in.\tYou asked to see me. I\u2019m assuming it has something to do with a plea deal for the Randall case?\tI recused myself from that. You\u2019re going to have to deal with ADA Lansing-Davis on that one. No, no, no, I want to talk to you about something else, something a little more sensitive.\tGoing somewhere?\tUh, the office. Got a lot of damage control to do.\tHmm, sure you\u2019re not going to meet with the SEC, you know, to follow up with them after you gave up Carly and Drew for insider trading?\tI wish we could stay like this forever\tmaybe not forever, but for an afternoon.\t[Chuckles]\tExcept I cannot turn my mind off. I keep wanting to hear from Trina again, or something about Drew and Liesl or something about Willow\u2019s bone marrow transplant.\tIt might help to have something else to focus on.\tAny suggestions?\tI know Dr. Randolph has gone over all this with you, but I have to remind you that Willow now needs to undergo a strong round of chemo to destroy her diseased bone marrow so that it can be replaced by Dr. Obrecht\u2019s healthy marrow.\tI also know that during this process, my immune system will be completely compromised.\tYou\u2019ll have to be in isolation.\tSo I was just talking to Nina.\tReally? How\u2019d that go?\tWell, you know, Nina and I, we have, like, a not so great history.\tSince when, she came to Port Charles?\tYeah, she was kind of obsessed with her first husband, but he was a big support for me when Danny was sick. Anyway, that\u2019s ancient history. I just\u2013I feel like I have to step carefully around Nina.\tHmm.\tBut Sonny loves her. So for his sake, I\u2019m willing to make the effort.\tThat\u2019s great.\tMm-hmm. I wish Michael and Carly would do the same.\tYou know, that\u2019s kind of ironic, because I just told Nina that she should make an effort with Carly.\tCarly, please, can I have a minute?\tI was wrong\u2026\tand I\u2019m sorry.\tSorry for what?\tFor all the blame that I heaped on you, for trying to make it your fault that I\u2019m estranged from Willow.\tI didn\u2019t get along with her when she was Charlotte\u2019s teacher. I didn\u2019t get along with her when she became Wiley\u2019s stepmother. And at my best, I was critical. And at my worst, I was combative. And I regret my actions more than I can say.\tBut I\u2019m standing here, desperately wanting a connection with my daughter.\tPlease, Carly, will you help me?\t[Laughs]\t[Dramatic music]\tWe\u2019re going to move you to an isolation room. Everything will be wiped clean daily, you\u2019ll be given a low bacteria diet, and anyone who comes in contact with you will need to be gloved, gowned, and masked.\tIs, um\u2013 is Willow allowed visitors?\tThere\u2019ll be a protective barrier between Willow and the door. You can\u2019t go past it. It\u2019s very important that friends and family keep their distance. No physical contact to avoid the transmission of bacteria.\tI remember all this from nursing school. I never thought it would apply to me.\tHey, um, could\u2013could Willow and I have a minute alone?\tOf course. You\u2019re going to do great, Willow.\tWe, uh\u2013 we knew this was coming. Isolation is pivotal to the transplant\u2019s success.\tI know\u2026 but it scares me thinking this could be the last time I hold your hand.\t[Dramatic music]\tYou want to cook for me?\tNo, I want us to cook together.\tOh, well, that sounds good. But there\u2019s a problem. I don\u2019t cook.\tNot at all?\tI can scramble eggs or make a sandwich, sometimes bake some cookies. Other than that, that is the limit of my repertoire.\tWell, that\u2019s more than I could do when I started. I was limited to grilled cheese sandwiches and anything I could pop in the microwave.\t[Laughs]\tThat\u2019s why I wanted to learn how to cook, so I could actually enjoy what I was eating. So when I started following online tutorials and following recipes, I started to actually enjoy it, both the process and the result\u2026 and a few disasters.\t[Laughs]\tI\u2019m learning as I go.\tWell, it sounds like you\u2019re enjoying yourself.\tCooking takes me out of myself. Instead of worrying about what\u2019s going to happen next and creating contingency plans to deal with that, just in the moment, hopefully enjoying what I\u2019m making.\tIt sounds like just what I need right now.\tAll right. Well, let\u2019s figure out what we want to make together.\tOk.\tI, uh\u2013I want to apologize for using you during that, uh, Holly business. But I know you\u2013 you know that.\tThank you.\tFor me personally, it snowballed into something else quite different. But then again, you were unaware of that.\tInteresting.\tI want to thank you, though, for stepping in the other night and helping me during that, uh, that bureau business.\tMy pleasure.\tYeah, I know. I\u2013you get that twinkle in your eye whenever you use the law to mess with people.\t[Laughing] Present company very much included.\tAnyway, that, uh\u2013 that brings me to this little get together now. I\u2019m the DA, and you\u2019re the highly respected defense attorney. We\u2019re dancing very close on ethical lines here between sparring and flirting, unless of course, we agree to do it by mutual consent.\tI will tell you as many times as you need to hear it. I was not the one who turned in Carly and Drew to the SEC.\tWell, you threatened to.\tMore than once.\tI\u2019m a Quartermaine! And chairman of the board. I make threats all the time, but I don\u2019t always carry them out. And I especially wouldn\u2019t turn in Drew and Carly while Willow was fighting for her life. I\u2019m not that heartless.\t", "No, not heartless, but you are a world class rationalizer. I could see you telling yourself that with a little pressure on Drew from the SEC, he wouldn\u2019t be around much at ELQ, and that would ultimately be a good decision for the company. It was just a tip, Dad, right? It wouldn\u2019t generate more than a phone call or two. I\u2019m sure you never intended for it to go as far as, you know, Carly getting picked up at Michael and Willow\u2019s wedding.\tIt was after the wedding, and I was just as shocked and upset as everyone else.\tEspecially the groom.\tMichael\u2013Michael was completely out of line, assuming that I was responsible.\tMichael was out of his mind with worry over Willow. By the way, he has no reason to trust you. And it kills me to say this, Ned, but you sold out Drew and Michael to Valentin Cassadine. What would stop you from selling out Carly and Drew to the SEC?\tCan\u2019t a man get any peace and quiet in his own house without being hounded by his family?\t[Sighs]\tWhere is the coffee? And the croissant? Have the standards in this house fallen that far?\tTracy, your breakfast niceties are going to have to wait. We\u2019re in the middle of something right here.\tAnother crisis nobody told me about.\tOlivia and Brook Lynn still think I\u2019m responsible for turning in Drew and Carly.\tWell, of course you did. And good for you.\tAre you ok? Let me look at you. Oh, my god.\tThank god and my rescuers, especially Drew.\tWhat happened?\tWhen Victor\u2019s demented plan started to unravel, he tried to escape with me as his hostage. It was Drew, with an assist from Holly Sutton, who stopped that from happening. I use this word sparingly, but Drew is der held, a hero.\tThat\u2019s no surprise there.\t[Chuckles] Scout can\u2019t wait to see her hero dad.\tOh, I can\u2019t wait to see my daughter. I cannot wait.\tWelcome home.\tHey, thanks, man. Thanks. And I appreciate all the kudos, everybody, but obviously I was part of an amazing team, so let\u2019s just\u2013you know.\tYou can be modest later. Without you, I would not be here, and Willow would not have a chance at life.\tElisa, let\u2019s\u2013 let\u2019s talk over here.\tHey, are you ok?\tYeah, yeah, yeah, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m fine. Hi.\tHi. Um, you know, there\u2019s been a lot going on.\tAre you ok?\tYeah, I\u2019m ok.\tWhat\u2019s going on?\tDrew Cain?\tWe\u2019re with the security exchange commission. We were told we\u2019d find you here.\tWhat\u2019s this regarding?\tWe have some questions for you regarding allegations of insider trading.\tThis is outrageous. Don\u2019t you have eyes? The man just returned from a dangerous rescue mission. Why don\u2019t you take your bureaucratic drivel and be gone?\tYou have the option to refuse to speak with us, but we can get a subpoena, and if necessary, a warrant. So if you want to clear this up, you\u2019ll come with us voluntarily.\tYou know, if you want to fight this, I\u2019ll back you all the way.\tOh, thank you, Sam, but there\u2019s nothing to fight.\tWe have a credible allegation that says otherwise.\tHow do you know the allegation is credible? By its very definition, an allegation is something which has not yet been proven. You are wasting our time with this lacherlich doublespeak.\tDon\u2019t let these government drones bully you.\tLiesl, it\u2019s ok. I can handle this, all right? You need to focus on Willow. It\u2019s fine. Guys, let\u2019s go. Come on.\tIt wasn\u2019t me. However, Carly and Drew did commit insider trading. The date of Carly\u2019s huge stock purchase pretty much speaks for itself. All anyone had to do was realize the two of them were in a personal relationship. Not hard to pick up on. Anyone could have turned them in.\tOh, really? Name one. Yeah, exactly. Look, Carly made an investment months ago. Why would the SEC only start caring now?\tThey\u2019re bureaucrats. It took \u2019em a while to get around to it.\tIt took you pointing them in Carly and Drew\u2019s direction.\tIf Drew gets investigated, it could spill over onto ELQ, where he is a major shareholder. Now, you can accuse me of any nefarious thing, but do not accuse me of being a bad strategist!\tThat is your defense?\t[Chuckles] Despicably turning over your cousin Drew and your other cousin Michael\u2019s mother to the SEC is bad strategy?\tTechnically, Michael\u2019s my second cousin.\tThat\u2019s not the point!\tSweetheart, I applaud your technique, deny, deny, deny. And when that doesn\u2019t work, obfuscate. Daddy would be proud.\tThat is exactly what I\u2019m afraid of! He\u2019s turning into Edward right in front of my eyes.\tRobert, do you regret kissing me the other night when your car broke down?\tHell no. Just the opposite. In fact, I\u2019d kind of like to see where this can go. But not if you feel that I\u2019m using my position to pressure you.\tWell, I appreciate your sensitivity. But no, I don\u2019t feel pressured in the slightest. In fact, I\u2019m intrigued by the prospect of spending more time with you. We are two sophisticated adults who understand boundaries, and I\u2019m sure we can keep our private and professional lives separate.\tI was hoping you\u2019d say that.\tWell\u2026 on that note\u2026 why don\u2019t we celebrate our newly formed social status?\t[Laughs] Well, while I appreciate you waiting until we came to terms to bring out the champagne, I\u2019m going to point out that it\u2019s noon.\t", "Your point?\tCarly Spencer, formerly Carly Corinthos, had never owned stock in Aurora prior to the failed merger. Is that correct?\tWell, hello, agents. How unfortunate we have to do this all again.\tMy client has nothing further to say.\t[Sighs] Waste of good Champagne.\t[Soft dramatic music]\tHolly?\tWell, looks like I\u2019m just in time to celebrate.\tHas Monica instituted an open door policy, anyone can just walk right in?\tI apologize for my mother-in-law\u2019s rudeness. Sweetheart, you are always welcome here.\tSince when?\tSince she\u2019s Michael\u2019s sister and a part of our extended family.\tI don\u2019t like your tone.\tMother, Josslyn was at the wedding.\tHer hair was different. And who is he?\tIt\u2019s Dex. He works for Sonny.\tOh! Well, that\u2019s better. Now we can all be relieved that he\u2019s gainfully employed, carrying brass knuckles and a gun for Sonny.\tWho happens to be the father of my first born son.\tAnd you were a teenager! Otherwise, you hopefully would have had better judgment and maybe even better taste.\tI think Olivia showed great taste. Uncle Sonny\u2019s the best.\tThe best at what, racketeering, extortion? And when did we start welcoming his employees in this house?\tDon\u2019t worry, we\u2019re not staying.\tBecause you\u2019re not invited.\tAll right. We\u2019re here to pick up Wiley and Amelia. Michael wants to see them at the hospital.\t[Soft dramatic music]\tWillow\u2019s been moved to isolation on the third floor, but she\u2019s starting\u2013 she\u2019s starting chemo to kill her diseased bone marrow and ready for the transplant.\tOh, I knew that had to happen. I\u2019m so sorry that I panicked.\tHey, it\u2019s ok.\tWillow\u2019s doing her part. It\u2019s time I did mine. I will confer with Dr. Randolph and get prepped for my donation procedure.\tI\u2019ll walk with you, ok?\tLiesl\u2026 what you\u2019re doing, giving Willow a chance at life, it means everything to me and my children.\tIt is my privilege. Willow is family.\tI just can\u2019t believe that something that started with the best of intentions turned out so badly. All I wanted to do was support Michael and Drew. And suddenly, Ned turned it into insider trading. It\u2019s crazy!\tI know. I think it\u2019s incredibly harsh considering everything that\u2019s going on with Willow. But I guess when it comes to Ned, nothing else matters but ELQ.\tSEC\u2019s still in there, huh?\tThey are. Shouldn\u2019t be in there long. The guy they\u2019re questioning is represented by Diane Miller.\tYeah, Diane will have him out of there in 10, 15 minutes. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to get anything out of him.\tShould you choose to move forward with this matter, you will have to calendar an interview and submit all of your questions to me in writing.\tWe already have enough to issue a subpoena.\t[Chuckles] By which I gather you do not presently have a subpoena for my client in this matter.\tNo.\tNo. Then this interview is over.\t[Dramatic music]\tNot that I ever had a problem with it before, but when did you go back to drinking in the middle of the day?\tGo back?\tThe \u201980s, we were married. Do you recall?\tI remember that, yeah.\tWell, we drank a lot of Champagne at all hours.\tIt was your favorite.\tStill is. So you won\u2019t mind if I help myself?\tHave a glass. Have the bottle. Just tell me what happened in Greenland.\tIt was quite an adventure.\t[Police radio chatter]\tHey.\tHey. So Diane\u2019s representing Drew. Agents left a little while ago. From the looks on their faces, they got nothing.\tShort term, that could be great. But long term\u2026 Drew could be in a lot of trouble.\tWell, your timing was impeccable. Thank you.\tYou can thank your ex-wife. It was Sam who called and alerted me.\tI will do that. You seem to have a really good handle on this case, so I\u2019m grateful that you\u2019re representing me.\tThis was a one-off, my friend. We will have to discuss further representation down the line.\tFirst, I got to figure out what the hell is going on.\tWhat\u2019s going on is you and Carly are alleged to have a personal relationship, and Carly took advantage of said relationship to make a stock purchase in anticipation of the Aurora ELQ merger.\tWho brought these allegations to the SEC\u2019s attention?\tWe don\u2019t know. It was an anonymous tip.\tI was on the first flight back with Drew and Obrecht. And the WSB are organizing additional flights to get the rest home.\tBut\u2013I\u2013 I don\u2019t care about the travel arrangements. I want to hear about Victor and how you stopped him.\tHe was running away with Obrecht as his hostage, but I was waiting there.\tAnd you shot him.\tNo, I couldn\u2019t because he was using Obrecht as a shield. However, I distracted him with the unwelcome news that he could no longer father children. You may ask how I know that, but last time I was here, I arranged for him to drink a special cocktail as punishment for kidnapping me and Ethan and forcing me to frame Anna.\tPayback really is a bitch.\tIt was obviously a sensitive subject because Victor lost it. He tried to take a shot at me. And that gave Drew an opportunity to jump him and take him down. But during the struggle, Obrecht fell. But whilst Drew and I were focused on her, Victor ran away.\tShe all right?\tShe bumped her head. But when she came around, she was able to tell me how to save Valentin and Anna.\t", "Yeah, well, that\u2019s the great thing about Champagne, you can drink it any time.\t[Laughs]\t[Tender music]\tRight.\tTo us.\t[Phone ringing]\tExcuse me.\t[Phone ringing]\tIt\u2019s a client. Yes, what can I do for you?\tI promise you, this is not the last time that we\u2019re going to hold hands. Ok, you\u2019re just going to be in isolation until your body accepts the new transplant and you start producing healthy cells, ok?\tListen to you, overnight medical expert.\tNah, you\u2019re the nurse. You\u2019re the expert here. I\u2019m just parroting back what the doctor said.\t[Heart monitor beeping]\tMichael\u2026 you know how weak I am. There\u2019s a chance I won\u2019t live through\u2013\tOh, hey, whoa.\t[Soft dramatic music]\tYou\u2019ve beaten the odds already. You\u2019re going to beat them again, ok?\tYour love is what\u2019s gotten me this far. I don\u2019t need to hold your hand to feel it. I can feel it in my heart.\tI want you feel it too.\tI do feel it. So do our children.\tYour love is the most precious thing that we have.\tNow would be a really good time to kiss me so I can take that with me.\tIt\u2019s time.\tButter lettuce.\tLettuce.\tMake sure it\u2019s butter lettuce. It\u2019s what the recipe calls for.\tOk. And raspberries and avocados.\tAnd don\u2019t forget the radishes.\tGod, there\u2019s a lot of fresh ingredients on here.\tNormally, I get my produce at the farmer\u2019s market.\tThere\u2019s a farmers market here?\tYeah, right next to Rice Plaza.\tOh.\tWe can go together.\tYou\u2019re right, we can go together. Now that Sonny knows about us, there\u2019s no reason to hide anymore.\tOk, tell the truth. How freaked out were you when Sonny busted us after the Nurses\u2019 Ball?\tOh, I think paralyzed by fear would be accurate. I didn\u2019t know what to say. Thank god you did.\tWell, it was no use denying it. He had us dead to rights.\tIt\u2019s a poor choice of words.\tThat\u2019s the part about Sonny that\u2019s so tough. Ok, we lied to him for months about being together, and he knew all along, but he didn\u2019t retaliate. He just\u2013he gave me credit for covering him during the warehouse ambush.\tSonny gave you credit for saving his life?\tYeah. And then he just let it go. He said it was up to your mom and he didn\u2019t want to be the romance police.\tSonny said that?\tHe did.\tWell, then we can take him at his word. We don\u2019t have to hide anymore.\tUnless you don\u2019t want people to know that we\u2019re seeing each other, which I would totally understand.\t[Phone ringing]\tIt\u2019s Michael. Michael, what can I do for you?\tThis is outrageous. How can government flunkies show up at the hospital and drag Drew off? For what, insider trading? Why were they not investigating Victor using those resources instead of letting him to come within a hair\u2019s breadth of taking out half the world? This world has gone crazy. Question a man who saved lives, who risked his own life so that Willow could live. But no, the SEC only cares about going after a good man who made this world a better place.\tOh, Liesl, enough!\tI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry.\tYou know, it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s what Drew said. Let\u2019s just focus on Willow. I mean, she\u2019s a priority.\tOf course.\tWhy don\u2019t we go and see her and tell her you\u2019re back.\tYes. Absolutely.\tCome on.\tYes, yes, yes.\tDrew\u2019s coming into this blind. He had no idea the SEC was investigating him.\tDrew is going to keep a cool head. He\u2019s not going to give the SEC a reason to use anything against him.\tDante, would you mind going to the PCPD and see what\u2019s going on with him?\tYeah, I was planning to do that anyway.\tThank you.\tOk, see you.\tYou know, it\u2019s ironic. Drew asked me over and over again not to buy any Aurora stock. I didn\u2019t listen.\t[Both laughing]\tOh god, what happened to Willow?\tMy father was a wonderful man.\tHe was also a liar, a cheat, and a serial philanderer.\tI loved Grandpa Edward to pieces, but he kind of was. That\u2019s why we\u2019re all related to Austin. Jimmy Lee Holt, remember?\tOh, don\u2019t mention that name. The too-tight pants, the unfortunate hairstyle still makes me shudder.\tOk, we are getting off topic! The subject is Ned and the unconscionable, underhanded way that he behaved toward Drew and Carly.\tReally not cool, Dad. After all of those lectures about family loyalty?\tI swear, it wasn\u2019t me! Call the SEC. They\u2019ll tell you.\tWell, what, it was an anonymous tip? Anonymous just means that they won\u2019t reveal your name. And you know that. You\u2019re counting on it! Look, the more you try to get us to believe that you\u2019re innocent, the guiltier you look!\tWhen are you going to learn it\u2019s not the crime, it\u2019s the cover up.\tIt\u2019s not a crime to tell the SEC about insider trading.\tAh-ha!\tWhich I did not do! But if I had, it wouldn\u2019t be a crime.\t[Dramatic music]\tOh good lord, what are they doing here?\tOur inquiry concerns the failed Aurora ELQ merger and the inflation of the ELQ stock immediately prior to the merger falling apart. Now, you\u2019re a majority shareholder in Aurora. You own a large block of voting stock in ELQ, but you\u2019re not the majority shareholder.\t", "Save Anna?\tMichael confirmed that Dr. Obrecht is back. Willow is being prepped for her bone marrow transplant.\tSo why do you look like you just lost your best friend?\tWell, the chemo that Willow is on is really strong. Next few days are going to be tough.\tBut once the treatment\u2019s over, she will be in remission, yeah?\tFingers crossed. But I\u2019m thinking what Brook Lynn is thinking. Willow is very weak. She might not recover.\tI am banning all dark thoughts from this house. The right attitude can make all the difference. Willow has so much to live for. She is going to beat this.\tShe has held on longer than anyone would have predicted. She can make it through.\tThank god Drew was able to find Liesl Obrecht and rescue her from Victor Cassadine and bring her back home.\tYeah, would have been a real bummer had the SEC picked up Drew before he left for Greenland.\tHey. Well?\tWillow has been moved to isolation and Liesl has been admitted. She\u2019s getting prepped to donate her bone marrow.\tOh, my god, this is what we\u2019ve been praying for. A miracle is happening.\tI know. It\u2019s going to work. She\u2019s going to live. Just\u2013just the hardest part of the treatment, you know, the heavy chemo, the isolation. I just wish I could hold her and comfort her.\tHey, Willow knew it was going to be hard, but she also knew it was going to be worth it.\tYeah, and I think I found a way to show her.\tDaddy!\t[Laughs]\tHey, buddy.\tHey!\tI see you have a new friend.\tHe\u2019s Aunt Josslyn\u2019s friend. His name\u2019s Dex, and he was a soldier. Isn\u2019t that cool?\tYeah. Yeah, that\u2019s very cool. I didn\u2019t realize aunt Josslyn was going to bring Dex along.\tWell, I just wanted a little extra help with Wiley and Amelia.\tWhere is Mommy? Can I see her?\tWell, that\u2019s why I had Josslyn and Dex bring you and Amelia along so you can see Mommy, and so Mommy can see you.\tValentin was infected with the pathogen. Anna took a huge risk going to him and staying with him. Obviously, she could have been infected too.\t[Sighs] Damn that woman.\tLuckily, Obrecht was able to hide the antidote nearby, and I managed to find it and get it to Anna and Valentin.\tWell, thank god for you, but what was she thinking?\tWell, obviously, she loves Valentin very much, enough to put her life on the line.\tTell me something I don\u2019t know.\tAre you upset?\tOnly that she\u2019s so reckless with her life.\tIt doesn\u2019t bother you? You\u2019re not jealous?\tI wish her well. And Valentin, he\u2019s her mistake to make.\tThat\u2019s a relief.\tWhy?\t[Soft dramatic music]\tThere were a few moments\u2026 in Greenland where I was pretty sure I was going to die.\tAnd there was only one thing I wanted to do.\tThis.\tSo that was your family.\tExtended family. One branch of it anyway.\tOh, jeez. How are you all connected?\tWell, remember I told you about Tracy, Michael\u2019s great aunt? Michael\u2019s biological father, AJ, and Ned were first cousins. So I guess that makes Michael and Ned second cousins.\tWill there be an exam on this later?\tI know, it\u2019s a lot.\tThat\u2019s only one branch. What are the others?\tThe Spencers, the Corinthos. I might not like Sonny that much right now, but there\u2019s this big blended sibling group and then various assorted nieces, nephews, and cousins.\tAnd you\u2019re ok with all those people knowing we\u2019re together?\tI want them to know.\tIs that why you brought me along today to get the word out?\tNo, Wiley\u2019s a lot on his own, and then we had Amelia. We had to get Amelia into the car seat, and then the car seat into the car, and then getting her back out again.\tIf you can stitch up a bullet wound in the middle of your brother\u2019s living room, I\u2019m pretty sure you can handle two kids in a car seat.\tDid I put you on the spot? Did you not want to come?\tNo, I loved it. Getting to meet Wiley. Getting to hold Amelia while you wrestled that car seat.\tI told you, it\u2019s complicated.\tI just wonder if you brought me along for help or if you were trying to make a statement.\tCarly is convinced that Ned is the one that turned her and Drew in.\t[Sighs] Ned reports Drew to the SEC with Carly as collateral damage? That sounds extreme.\tBu t who even knew that Carly and Drew were together? And of all the people who knew\u2026 who stands to gain the most from exposing them?\tHeroism is one thing. Business is quite another. And since Drew was foolish enough to confide the merger plans in Carly, and Carly was greedy enough to try to cash in, they brought the SEC on themselves.\tNo, they did not. Ned brought the SEC on them when he turned them in.\tFor the thousandth time, I did not turn them in!\tIt was a smart business tactic.\tIt was a gross betrayal.\tI didn\u2019t do it!\tYou double crossed Michael and Drew with Valentin when you tanked the merger with Aurora by becoming chairman of the board of ELQ. Why do you expect us to believe you now?\tOk, I admit, I threw in my lot with Valentin, but that is standard Quartermaine family politics. It\u2019s a far cry from turning Drew and Carly into the SEC. Drew is family. The A\u2019s stay loyal to each other.\tYou talking about me behind my back?\tDrew, I heard you brought back Dr. Obrecht from\u2013\t[Groans]\t[Gasps]\t[Gasps]\t[Dramatic music]\tOk, you got me. I wanted Michael to see us together out in the open. It was bonus that my mom was there. She\u2019s known for months about us, but I think she was hoping I\u2019d change my mind.\tWhy?\tWhen she was my age, she had someone like you. And she said that he was the best thing to ever happen to her. Losing him almost killed her. She doesn\u2019t want that for me.\tWhat do you think?\t[Sighs] I think that history doesn\u2019t necessarily always repeat itself and what happened to him doesn\u2019t have to happen to you. I mean, I\u2019d rather be happy now than give this up because I\u2019m scared of what might happen in the future.\tSo you\u2019re happy now?\tI could be happier.\tHow?\t[Tender music]\tI\u2019ll show you.\t[Heart monitor beeping]\tSay hi.

Haa, you admitted to me that you came to town with the express purpose of going after me and my loved ones. Well, did anybody hear me say that to you? I heard it. You hear what you wanna hear. You know, the truth is that I came to Salem with the sole purpose of opening a law practice.\tIt was only a coincidence that you and your home wrecking slut of a daughter happened to be here too.

You lied through your teeth to cover up Chanel\u2019s involvement with my mother. Oh, oh, oh. That was no lie, huh? And you are no better than your mother. She trapped Chanel on that roof so she could kill her. Chanel is the one that did the killing. Seems to me like it runs in the family.\tI hear that your other daughter.

You will keep my daughter\u2019s name outta your filthy mouth. That sounds to me like another threat. I\u2019ll just like to add that to my complaint.\tWhat is the matter with you?

Yes. But I had to cover for where I was going to be tonight. So I sent her a text to come here and she was cool with it. So what happened tonight, Melinda and I had to make out in front of Nicole. You made out with that bitch? Just, just for two minutes.\tOkay. But now EJ and Nicole think I\u2019m upstairs with her so I could be down here with you. So be careful with that woman. She\u2019s on our side. She hates EJ for letting Kristen escape. I don\u2019t care. Doesn\u2019t do anything without wanting something in return.

Right\tnow is not the time to get superstitious. I get that and, and I know that you made quite the effort, but could have picked a better place for this rendezvous. I mean, right over here is where I helped Abigail tie Gwen to a. Do you know what else happened right here? What? Right here is where you and I got real with each other about our feelings.\tRemember that finally admitted our true feelings for one another. So maybe being trapped down here wasn\u2019t the worst thing. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m not here to be rescued.\tTell me you\u2019ve forgotten. Of course, I haven\u2019t forgotten. I remember every second I\u2019ve spent with you. And every second. Every second. And I know that we\u2019ve had bad times, but it\u2019s, it\u2019s led me to this journey, led me to where I\u2019ve always wanted to be. Right here in your arms.\tCut out of this one either.\tHey, hey, where is she? Where\u2019s Sloan? She\u2019s not here. She\u2019s out to run some errands at this time of night. You better hope that she\u2019s not delivering another threatening note to my wife.\tOh my God. Are you stalking me now? I should be asking you that question. Nothing to see here. How? Nothing to see here. Really, the mayor\u2019s wife is harass. A private citizen. Oh girl, you are losing your mind. You should know I just filed a restraining order against you. You did what? You heard me. By this time tomorrow, you won\u2019t be able to come within 1500 feet of me not getting thrown in jail like the criminal you are.\tPeace offering. Thank you.\tI\u2019m sorry if I\u2019ve been neglecting you, but in my defense I thought you were enjoying our little game with my brother and Gabby as much as I was, I was.

No, listen, listen, listen.\tBeing a co-conspirator isn\u2019t enough for me, even if I\u2019m a co-conspirator with benefits. Is it enough for you?\tOh, but now you\u2019re cutting me off because I made the complaints.\tI do see you as more than my co-conspirator. You\u2019re the woman that I want to be with, and it\u2019s high time. I started acting like it. Well then where are you going? This occasion calls for more than near cocktails. I\u2019m going to go down to the wine cellar and grab a bottle of Father\u2019s vintage champagne, and then I\u2019ll be right back to romance, the beautiful woman by my side.\t", "Did you hear what I said? I did. You still have feelings for me?\tAren\u2019t you gonna say something? Well, When we had our little adventure in Hong Kong, I, I thought you liked me and then I moved here and you came back and I dunno, I just felt like you were over for me. I thought I was too. At least that\u2019s what I told myself. Then today I was talking to a patient and it just kind of hit me like how much I still feel for you.\tWait, you were talking to a patient about. Do I know this person? Uh, yeah. It\u2019s Chanel\u2019s mom pulling a price. You discussed me with her. How could you do that? You were in the hospital. Why didn\u2019t you say anything? Are are you all right? Yes. I I\u2019m fine now. I you don\u2019t have to worry. Video people. Were fine.\tDon\u2019t take themselves to the hospital now. What\u2019s going on? You have to promise not to overreact, please. Almost. Okay. I went to the hospital because I thought, I thought something might be wrong with my heart. Your heart, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine. Oh, what I had was, was a panic attack courtesy of that bitch Sloan Peterson.\tYou invited me over here to watch you work. No way. This isn\u2019t gonna take long.

Showing up here, accusing me of sending her a, a threatening note with letters cut out of a magazine. Yeah,\tthat\u2019s, uh, pretty wild accusation. Won\u2019t happen again. I can guarantee that as soon as the judge grants this request, Paulina Price won\u2019t be able to come with them 1500 feet of me.

Oh, you\u2019re checking up on her. Right? That\u2019s none of your business. What are you so worried about that Gabby lied to you? That she\u2019s really hooking up with my Uncle Stephan right now.\tI\u2019ve spent enough time in this room to know that you are quite the decorator. Come on. Really? No. Really?

Perfect for me, Gabby. I have never loved anyone the way I love you.\tI can\u2019t believe it took me so long to remember that. Time\u2019s over now. Okay.

Good point. Thank you. Wow. So how did you, uh, how did you get the kitchen to make all of this without the Lord and Lady of the Manor finding out, oh, please, EJ and Nicole, they know about dinner.\tThey know. Yeah. They just think that I\u2019m upstairs eating in my bedroom with me. Belinda Trask.\tHow stupid does he think we are? I don\u2019t know. He never should have talked me into coming downstairs. I should have bought straight into that room. There is no way in hell that Stefan would cheat on Gabby, especially with an I sculpture like Melinda Trust. Well, after what I saw when we got home and what we heard, Maybe good old Melinda can heat up whenever she wants to.\tI don\u2019t care what we saw or what we heard. Me too. What I wanna know is what Melinda tries is getting out of all of this more than I\u2019m getting from you. Excuse me. How are you doing? Changing the subject to what? Well, maybe instead of obsessing over Stephanie\u2019s love life, we could turn our attention to ours.\tWhy don\u2019t you do whatever you came here to do and stay outta my business? Hey, I didn\u2019t mean to overstep. I just, and when I came over to your guys\u2019 apartment the other morning, I couldn\u2019t help but notice a chill in the air between the two of you. I don\u2019t care what you noticed. You don\u2019t know anything about Gabby and me.\tI\u2019ll tell you what, I\u2019ll make you a deal. I won\u2019t comment on you and Gabby anymore if you promise to stop trying to convince me that there\u2019s something going on between Wendy and Tripp. I can\u2019t believe you talked about me to a patient.

No worth to you, but you don\u2019t have to leave. I, I\u2019m on duty. Okay. I, I decided that I had to talk to you and so I took a break, but I, I\u2019m sorry. I shouldn\u2019t have butted between you and I I didn\u2019t think you were butting in.\tI didn\u2019t realize you two were so serious. You act like Johnny\u2019s my boyfriend or something.

Look, I am beyond flattered, flattered. Okay.\tThat came out wrong. No, no. I think you made yourself perfectly clear. Uh, how I feel for you is just the way you feel about me. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m saying. Oh, Kevin, what are you saying? I\u2019m not sure.\tI dunno what to say now. Maybe we should just stop talking.\tHow, how long have you been having these panic attacks? Um, it was just the one, I swear, Abe, I, I don\u2019t want you worrying about. I have been worrying about you and Chanel ever since Sloan Peterson started this. The police should be putting a stop to it. I agree. But they keep saying all they have is my word against hers.\tAnd Abe, she always is one step ahead of the cops. I didn\u2019t even bother to tell \u2019em about the latest thing. What latest thing? After the police left my office, someone left a note for me. It said This is an over. Which in her handwriting, no. She knew better than to do that. Oh, she cut letters out from a magazine.\tI wanna see that. No, I gave it to Chanel. You should have taken it to the police. They might have been able to lift fingerprints off it. Mm. If she was smart enough to cut letters from a magazine. She was smart enough to wear gloves besides who wanted to tell her a thing or two before I talked to them.\tYou confronted. What happened? She denied everything like she always does. That doesn\u2019t, wherever you going, I\u2019m going, no, no, you\u2019re going home. You\u2019re gonna lie down and get some rest. Oh, no, that\u2019s, that\u2019s it. It is time that I handled Sloane Peterson, myself.\tThis won\u2019t take long. Where are you going? The courthouse. This slate? Yes. I wanna get this requested by tonight. Yeah, but the courthouse is closed. Well, they don\u2019t lock the front entrance. I\u2019m just gonna slide this under Judge Bauer\u2019s door and I\u2019ll come back. No, no, no. You can email it. No, judge Bauer\u2019s Old School.\tI want her to see this first thing tomorrow morning. Like it\u2019s not gonna take long. I\u2019ve. And I\u2019ll make it up to you when I get back.\tWhat has she done now?\tI suppose it was petty of me insinuating there was something going on between Trip and Wendy. So why\u2019d you do it? Because you went to such lengths to expose my involvement in what Rolf did to him, your involvement. You hired the guy, you told him to rearrange My Uncle Stephan\u2019s brain. You are outraged on behalf of an uncle you never even knew.\tNo, I didn\u2019t do it for him. I did it for my, no-no. What? Yeah, it\u2019s Italian for grandfather Stephano, the mall boss. No, not to me. To me, he was the guy who pulled quarters out of thin air. Let me keep him, let me eat the cherries out of his Manhattans. I adored him. Stephan was his son. I mean, my own father didn\u2019t give a damn about his brother.\tSo somebody had to, huh? You tried to ruin my life. And not only that, you also involved my younger sister in your place. Oh, okay. Wendy. Just as excited to get to the truth as I was. And Lee, we didn\u2019t ruin your life. Okay. You did that on your own and you don\u2019t think you\u2019re splitting hairs here. What\u2019s your problem?\tYou and Gabby are still together, so she and my uncle are farther apart than ever. Right? Right.\tI suppose it is time to two of us bury the hatchet for my sister\u2019s sake for reasons. That I don\u2019t understand.

But we can still tinker around with it?\tDaniel: Absolutely.\tChelsea: Great. \u2018Cause the deeper I dive into all this stuff, the more research I do, the more possibilities I see. Did you know some of these games can qualify to be fda-approved as therapy?\tDaniel: I do know that. Isn\u2019t that something?\tChelsea: Yeah, it really is. I\u2013 I just want this to be the best game, best tool. Resource. So, I\u2019ve been meeting with experts to try to fine-tune everything we\u2019ve been working on.\tDaniel: Hmm. Well, you keep fine-tuning, because that prototype\u2019s gonna be out before you know it.\tChelsea: Well, I can\u2019t wait. And listen, thank you for taking the time to noodle around with all this.\tDaniel: You have no idea how much I needed this.\tChelsea: I know you\u2019ve been through something agonizing, and it\u2019s really hard to find your way back from that. But from where I\u2019m standing, you\u2019ve got a lot to be proud of.\tDaniel: Thank you. Not sure everyone else would see it the same way, though.\tSummer: Daniel, I need to know what you\u2019re thinking. What we\u2019re gonna do next. Has mom called you again? Oh, I hope that she has. Even if she doesn\u2019t say anything, I think it means that she\u2019s thinking about coming home. We have to help her, daniel. We have to find her, no matter what it takes. \u2018Cause I\u2019m not gonna let her disappear on us. I have some ideas about how to bring her home safely.

Oh, you mean my lawyer is trying to protect his best friend somehow?\tKyle: No, he\u2019s trying to protect you. He was\u2013 this is what he was afraid of. That you would get so upset, you\u2019d try to break house arrest.\tDiane: And that\u2019s what I should do. I should hunt that bitch down and bring her back here.\tKyle: Mom, I know you\u2019re angry. I understand. But you need to calm down.\tDiane: Calm down? What? And\u2013 and\u2013 and\u2013 and do nothing? Oh, my god. Where\u2013 where are the police in all this? Why haven\u2019t they found her? And if phyllis is so remorseful and misses her kids so much, then why is she still in hiding?\tKyle: She\u2019s probably facing legal consequences.\tDiane: You mean like life in prison for murder, which was my future, thanks to her.\t[ Huffs ] But not any longer. So, what\u2019s the plan? What\u2019s the plan? How soon are the charges against me dropped? When will I be free again?\tKyle: There is a process.\tDiane: What process? Phyllis is alive.\tKyle: Yeah. Well, we don\u2019t have proof. Just daniel\u2019s word. But I swear to you, dad and i will do everything we can to get the evidence we need. He\u2019s with christine right now trying to convince her to put the gcpd on it.\tDiane: I can\u2019t believe your father wanted to keep this from me.

Does summer know?\tKyle: I wanted to tell her as much as I wanted to tell you, but daniel begged me not to.\tDiane: Why? Can\u2019t he see how much she\u2019s suffering?\tKyle: He was afraid it would crush her knowing that phyllis put her through all of this. And that phyllis reached out to daniel, not summer, when she was ready to reveal herself.\tDiane: You know, how heartless can phyllis be? I mean, she put getting revenge above the well-being of her children.\t[ Sighs ] Not\u2013 not that I have anything that I can judge after what I put you through.\tKyle: We\u2019re long past that, mom.\tDiane: Tell summer.

But the toll a secret this big can take\u2026 I don\u2019t know if a marriage can survive that.\tChristine: If phyllis is so remorseful and determined to be with her children, why is she god knows where and not home?\tJack: She is afraid of prosecution, fraud, falsifying evidence, obstruction of justice. Whatever you can throw at somebody who\u2019s trying to fake their own death. And she\u2019s got a da who\u2019s not a fan of hers, who will make the charges stick.\tChristine: I don\u2019t suppose daniel has any evidence, a photograph, a recording?\tJack: No, but he\u2019s willing to sign an affidavit.\tChristine: Oh, which means nothing, jack. Come on, there\u2019s more questions than answers. There\u2019s no evidence. We\u2019re taking the word of a grieving son.\tJack: Okay.

What\u2019s going on?\tDaniel: Oh, you know, just waiting for some bombs to explode.\tJack: Victor, always a joy.\tVictor: Indeed. Indeed. Yeah.\tJack: I\u2019m sure you have an important business meeting. Don\u2019t let me keep you.\tVictor: Well, now, I have a feeling you\u2019re waiting for someone as well. It\u2019s making you kind of nervous, isn\u2019t it?\tJack: It\u2019s nothing for you to worry about.\tVictor: Certainly it couldn\u2019t be about adam. He is back in the newman fold, running mccall.

Please, kyle, just\u2026 just tell me, how bad is it?\tKyle: It\u2019s potentially good, mom. Very good. Diabetes can serve up a lot of questions,\tAdditional sponsorship provided by\u2026.\tBilly: It\u2019s understandable that you would feel that way. I didn\u2019t exactly handle the breakup with your mom very well, after all.\tSummer: Yeah, no kidding.\tBilly: Look, summer, whatever issues that we have between us, I think it\u2019s important that you know that I really respected phyllis. She was one of a kind, pure energy. That power wasn\u2019t always used for good, but with that heart of hers, she loved the hell outta you and your brother.\tSummer: I know that my mom loves me\u2013 loved me. But that love could be\u2026 overwhelming. I mean, she\u2013 she gave so much, but she demanded a lot in return.\tBilly: Yeah. She was all or nothing. She lived life out loud and she expected everyone else to do the same, which didn\u2019t exactly make it easy for the ones that cared for her. Look, summer, I hope I\u2019m not overstepping by saying this. I know how much you loved her. But you two had your fair share of ups and downs.\tSummer: She was so impulsive and reckless. She would act without thinking, you know? She would get something in her head and there was no talking her out of it. And she\u2019d end up hurting people she loved and hurting herself even more in the process. All because she had decided that it was her against the world, even when it wasn\u2019T.\tBilly: That pretty much sums her up.\tSummer: [ Scoffs ] That\u2019s the thing. It didn\u2019t have to be like that. She was never alone, not really. I was always on her side. Always. I just\u2013 I don\u2019t know why she couldn\u2019t see that.\tDiane: I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m all for good news, but you don\u2019t look like it\u2019s good.\tKyle: Um, mom, there\u2013 there is a real possibility that the murder charges against you can go away.\tDiane: What? How? Have\u2013 have the police found evidence or proof that I\u2019m innocent?\tKyle: No. No. Not\u2013 not exactly.\tDiane: Well, then how has anything changed? Kyle? Kyle, you\u2019re not going to do anything illegal to protect me, are you? Because I will not have you putting yourself at risk for me.\tKyle: Look, the only person who has done anything illegal is phyllis.\tJack: Victor, I\u2013 I know we\u2019re on better terms these days, but trust only goes so far.\tVictor: Uh-huh. Now, jack, you and I have known each other for a long time. Okay? Something is going on. What\u2019s bothering you?\tJack: Let it go, please?\tVictor: Maybe you\u2019re waiting for your fianc\u00e9e to join you. However, she is wearing a beautiful ankle bracelet, courtesy of the authority.\tJack: Not for long.\tVictor: Oh, yeah? What are they doing now? Issuing get-out-of-jail-free cards to murderers?\tJack: Diane did not kill phyllis.\tVictor: If she didn\u2019t, she belongs behind bars. She\u2019s a bad woman and you know it.\tJack: If anyone belongs behind bars it\u2013\tVictor: What are you gonna say? Who belongs behind bars? Who?\tJack: Christine.\tChristine: Gentlemen.

Thank you.\tJack: Thank you so much for coming.\tChristine: Jack, I really shouldn\u2019t be here. I mean, meeting you before diane\u2019s trial is completely inappropriate. I\u2019m only doing it as a courtesy to a friend.\tJack: If\u2013 if you will just keep an open mind and listen to me for a few minutes, there will be no need for a trial.\tChristine: Is that why you called me here? To lobby me to drop the case? Wait, this is\u2013\tJack: No, no, no. Christine, don\u2019t go. You need to hear this. This is something you wanna know.\tChristine: What could possibly be so earthshattering that it would change the course of the case against diane?\tJack: Phyllis is alive.\t[ Scoffs disbelievingly ]\tDiane: Phyllis did something illegal?

Taking this one step at a time to make sure that we do it right, it\u2019s important. You bring me happiness. You give me hope and excitement for the future. We accept each other.

When? How?\tKyle: She called him a few days ago and they\u2013 they met at the lookout at the park. He said he couldn\u2019t believe it when he saw phyllis standing in front of him.\tSummer: Yeah. Can\u2019t imagine. What I don\u2019t understand is why\u2013 why\u2013 why would he tell you and not me?\tKyle: He didn\u2019t want you to be upset that she chose to reveal herself to him and not you. He didn\u2019t want you to be hurt.\tSummer: Isn\u2019t lying to me hurting me?\tKyle: Look, daniel only wanted to wait until we had real proof or that we could track phyllis down.

I\u2013 he saw phyllis, he spoke to her. He knew that stark was killed with a pair of scissors. How else would he know that if he hadn\u2019t talked to phyllis?\tSummer: Who else knows about this?\tKyle: My dad and michael.\tSummer: [ Gasps ] They\u2019re gonna go to the police! My mom\u2019s gonna be arrested.\tKyle: No, daniel was adamant that we had to protect phyllis. That she was a victim in all of this. But my dad did take the information to christine.\tSummer: What? Kyle, she hates my mom, she\u2019s\u2013\tKyle: No, no, we will do everything we can to protect phyllis. But there is one more thing. I told my mom. I thought she had a right to know. No. Hey, hey, hey, don\u2019t shut down on me, summer. Don\u2019t shut me out. Please. Tell me how you\u2019re feeling.\tDiane: There you are.\tJack: Has something happened?\tDiane: Yes, it has. Kyle told me.\t[ Jack sighs ] It should\u2019ve been you, jack. Partial response:\tChelsea: I try to maintain this constant vigilance every day. I check in on myself. I do. I ask myself how I\u2019m feeling. Am I okay? Am i not okay? And lately, I\u2019ve\u2013 i\u2019ve\u2013 I\u2019ve been okay. But then it feels like every time i\u2019m enjoying myself or if I\u2019m actually happy, like when you look at me the way you\u2019re looking at me right now, I ask myself if I deserve it.\t[ Voice breaking ] I ask myself if it\u2019s real. Um, or if I\u2019m gonna screw it up.\t[ Chuckles dryly ] And then I\u2019m hit with this other thought. I almost wasn\u2019t here for this. I almost wasn\u2019t here for anything. For my son. And then I just get this rush of\u2013 of fear, billy, and I\u2019m back on that roof and\u2013 and\u2013 and I\u2019m alone and I\u2019m scared. And I can feel the wind.

I guess I\u2019m scared to hope that my mom is really out there.\tKyle: Hey, you don\u2019t have to be afraid, summer. Your mom is alive. Why would daniel tell me something that isn\u2019t true?\tSummer: Yeah. Why would he tell you? \u2018Cause I\u2019m not gonna let her disappear on us. I have some ideas about how to bring her home safely, so please just\u2013 just call me as soon as you get this.\t[ Indistinct whispering ]\tChance: That\u2019s one hell of a story.\tChristine: Yeah. With zero actual evidence that phyllis is out there.\tChance: What do you make of it?\tChristine: Wishful thinking. Deflection, a part of michael\u2019s defense strategy. I don\u2019t know.\tChance: [ Exhales ] Well, there is one real fact in all this: Stark was killed with scissors.\tChristine: Obviously, there\u2019s a leak in the department and michael took advantage of it.\tChance: Yeah.\tChristine: Okay. Well, I\u2019m just letting you know in case jack approaches you, which I have no doubt he will.\tChance: Well, I appreciate the heads-up. Desperate people do desperate things, huh?\tJack: I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you. I didn\u2019t wanna give you hope without having the evidence we want to show the world that you are innocent.\tDiane: I know you did it to protect me. Your intentions were in the right place.\tJack: Then I\u2019m forgiven?\tDiane: How can I be angry at a man I love so much?\tJack: I promise you, we are so close to ending this nightmare. Soon, soon you will be free and we will get married as we planned.\tDiane: That\u2019s all I want.\tJack: I am not going to give up until that happens. Phyllis put you in this mess. Come hell or high water, by god, she\u2019s gonna get you out of it.\t", "Kyle: No one killed phyllis, mom. It was all stageD. She\u2019s alive.

You just wanna help \u2019em, but you\u2019re not sure what the right course is.\tDaniel: What\u2019s going on with you?\tChelsea: Connor. He\u2019s been handed a curve ball lately and getting through to him has been difficult. You know, I just try to get him to open up, but he just shuts me down.\tDaniel: Well, I\u2019ve been there.\tChelsea: Any advice?\tDaniel: You know, I don\u2019t think that I\u2019m the right person to ask.\tChelsea: I swear, the only thing harder than being a parent is being a kid. All the stuff the world throws at them. Um, which is why, actually recently, I came up with an idea.\tDaniel: Really?\tChelsea: This is something I\u2019ve been working on. An omega sphere world for kids. I mean, they\u2019re the ultimate gamers anyway, right? Why not create a space that they already feel comfortable in? Help them feel safe feeling their feelings, whether they\u2019re sad or happy or confused. You know, a parent-free zone. No judgments. No timeouts.\tDaniel: Well\u2026 I think I could\u2019ve used something like this when I was a kid. You know, since we\u2019re here, since we\u2019re caffeinated, clearly, um, why don\u2019t we dive into where we\u2019re at with the current game, and I\u2019ll give you some updates?\tChelsea: Are you sure? I\u2013 I mean, I\u2013 are you in the right mindset? You\u2019ve been going through a lot lately. If you wanna do it a different day, we can.\tDaniel: No. This is exactly what I need right now. Distractions are the only things that are keeping me sane these days.\tBilly: Look, I\u2019m no expert on grief, but I know that when you lose someone that you love, \u201cwhy,\u201d that can send you into the weeds. \u201cWhy,\u201d I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best question. I think maybe \u201cwhat.\u201d As in, what would your mom want you to do? I know you and daniel, you were everything to her. Her heart and soul. She lived for you. She would die for you. And she would want you to find happiness again.\tSummer: I don\u2019t really think that that\u2019s possible.\tBilly: Oh, see, right there? No, that\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s not a phyllis attitude. She was a fighter. She didn\u2019t back down. When the going got rough, she doubled down.\tSummer: Yeah. It could be exhausting.\tBilly: [ Laughs ] Yeah. Unless she was in your corner. Then you knew you had someone to believe in you. Because she would go to the wall to protect you. I see a lot of phyllis in you. The good parts. Summer, you are smart and you are strong. You know what you want and you go after it and you don\u2019t give a crap about what anyone else thinks. And for the people that are lucky enough to be loved by you, well, they know that you\u2019re gonna do everything in your power to protect them. Over time, this will get a little bit easier. And look, you\u2019re gonna miss her. But that part of her, that\u2013 that good part, it\u2019ll stay alive for you, I promise. And here I am yammering on, and all you wanted was a little peace and quiet.\t[ Summer laughs softly ] You take care. Okay?\tSummer: Billy?\tBilly: Yeah.\tSummer: I\u2019m sorry.\tBilly: Sorry for what?\tSummer: For being rude earlier about you and my mom.\tBilly: [ Sighs ] Can I ask you one more question?\tSummer: Could I stop you?\tBilly: I think I know the answer to this. But why are you sitting here alone when you got a whole house full of people that love you and all they wanna do is help you? Now, look, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re gonna say because you believe that you can handle this on your own. I hate to say this, but you can\u2019T.\tSummer: You don\u2019t\u2013\tBilly: No, you can push me away. That\u2019s fine. Okay? But don\u2019t push all those people that love you and care about you. Don\u2019t\u2013 don\u2019t push them away. Like your friends and your family. Especially not kyle. He is crazy in love with you.\tSummer: I don\u2019t think that kyle or anyone knows what\u2019s going through my head right now.\tKyle: Phyllis and stark staged her poisoning.\tDiane: [ Scoffs ] But the ambulance crash, the\u2013 the explosion?\tJack: All orchestrated by phyllis and stark to fake her death.\tChristine: But why?\tKyle: Phyllis wanted revenge on you so badly she was willing to go to any extreme to get what she wanted.\t[ Gasps ]\tJack: But phyllis has come to regret her decision. She has secretly reached out to daniel.\tKyle: She\u2019s scared and on the run.\tDiane: But she\u2019s alive.\tKyle: I know it\u2019s hard to believe.\tJack: But it\u2019s all true.\tChristine: [ Sighs ] Well, that\u2019s quite a story, jack, but that\u2019s all it is. Fiction.\tJack: It is the truth, christine.\tChristine: It\u2019s desperation.\tJack: Tell me something. Why would daniel, of all people, invent something to help diane\u2019s case?\tDiane: Phyllis faked her death to frame me.\t[ Scoffs ] I always knew that she was psychotic and vindictive, but this\u2026 this is pure evil.

We\u2019ll run a test version, then we\u2019ll take a look at functionality, user experience, gameplay, um, the art style.

Is that enough to get you to get the gcpd involved in this?\tChristine: You know what? You\u2019ve given me a crazy story that\u2019s very light on facts. Okay? So, we\u2019re done here.\tJack: I\u2019ll give you one more fact. Phyllis killed jeremy stark with a pair of scissors.

Cinnamon buns in particular?\tBilly: Is that a bad thing?\tChelsea: Nope.\tBilly: You know, when I walked in here, I saw you and daniel wrapped up in the world of omega sphere. If you wanna keep working, I can take this cinnamon bun somewhere else.\tChelsea: No way. You and this bun stay here.\tBilly: All right.\tChelsea: Especially because we\u2019re celebrating.\tBilly: Is that right? What are we celebrating?\tChelsea: The prototype is almost ready.\tBilly: That\u2019s amazing.\tChelsea: Yeah. So, this game, it\u2019s not just a hope or a\u2013 or a dream or a wish. It\u2019s really happening.\tBilly: That\u2019s fantastic. Congratulations.\tChelsea: Thank you. And I\u2019m actually bringing a new aspect to it that involves kids. So, it\u2019s gonna be new lessons, new challenges that help them deal with real life.\tBilly: Are we still talking about omega sphere or does this have more to do with connor now?\tChelsea: [ Sighs ] Billy, I am so worried about him. He\u2019s become so withdrawn.\tBilly: Yeah. He\u2019s got a lot going on and he\u2019s just trying to figure out all those feelings.\tChelsea: Yeah. Maybe it\u2019s my fault.\tBilly: Why would you say that?\tChelsea: My life. My\u2026 episode. Maybe he feels like he can\u2019t lean on me, or else I\u2019m gonna fall apart. Or maybe, I don\u2019t know, maybe he\u2019s stuffed down all of these feelings over the past few months that are finally coming to the surface. Or\u2026 maybe he\u2019s angry at me for almost leaving him.\tBilly: I think you\u2019re being too hard on yourself. You\u2019re being a concerned, attentive parent. You\u2019re doing all the right things.\tChelsea: Am I? [ Laughs ] Adam and I are not shining examples of healthy behavior, let\u2019s be honest. And it worries me what that could mean for our son.\tBilly: I mean, I understand that. I look at johnny and katie sometimes and think their dad has got a very addictive personality. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s locked in their genes or if that\u2019s something that can be stopped.\tChelsea: [ Exhales ] Well, certainly not something we can solve tonight. But you know what we can do?\tBilly: What\u2019s that?\tChelsea: Pat ourselves on the back for making it through another day without screwing up royally.\tBilly: I like the sound of that.\tChelsea: Do you?\tBilly: Mm-hmm.\tChelsea: I\u2019ll get it embroidered on a pillow. I\u2019ll get one for you. I\u2019ll get one for me.\tBilly: [ Laughs ] Oh.\tJack: Now that I have your attention, perhaps you and I can discuss the best way to flush phyllis out of hiding and get her back to genoa city.\tChristine: Jack, I won\u2019t be goaded into action. Okay? There\u2019s no evidence that phyllis is alive or that she killed stark. This whole story is just way too convenient. You\u2019re too involved.\tJack: Everything\u2013 everything I have told you can be proven, if we find phyllis. One phone call from you and the police can make that happen.\tChristine: Oh, so, you want an overburdened police department to spend resources trying to track down a woman who\u2019s legally been declared dead?\tJack: Except she isn\u2019T. And now diane is shackled with a bogus murder charge because the woman who framed her is alive and well. Christine, if you have any sense of justice in you, you\u2013 you have no choice but to get the police involved.\tChristine: Do not question my sense of justice.\tJack: I don\u2019t understand your hesitation in acting on this. You know phyllis.\tChristine: Yeah.\tJack: You have your own history with her. Does it make you think that anything I\u2019m saying is improbable?\tChristine: Yes. Yes, it does. Because you know what? As hateful as she has been to me and as capable as she is of doing real harm, the one thing she would never do is abandon her kids. Not like this.\tJack: Well, she did.\tChristine: Okay. You know this conversation\u2019s over, right? You want me to believe you? You bring me some proof. Concrete proof.\t[ Sighs ]\t[ Door opens, closes ]\tKyle: Hey, glad you\u2019re home. It was getting late.\tSummer: I didn\u2019t realize I had a curfew. Uh, did the nanny call you?

What\u2019s wrong?\tKyle: Nothing. It\u2019s good news.\tSummer: Really? We haven\u2019t had a lot of that lately. I don\u2019t suppose that tucker\u2019s moving out?\tKyle: Uh, no. No, not exactly.\tSummer: Okay. Well, whatever it is, go ahead and tell me, I\u2019m really tired. I wanna go to bed.\tKyle: I\u2013 I\u2013 I don\u2019t know how to say this, or where to begin, so I\u2019m just gonna say it. It\u2019s your mom.\tSummer: My mom?

Well, so if you didn\u2019t come back here to pick up where you left off with my daughter, why do you need to see her so urgently?\tI\u2019m heading back to Chicago, and then you came to say, No, I want Sarah to come with me.\tSo you and Sarah aren\u2019t getting back together, but you want her to move away with you? Well, I mean, not. With me, but yes to the same city . Look, I want Sarah to work at my hospital.

Yeah, he\u2019s moving to New Zealand with Will and Allie and Henry. Wow. So I guess things are gonna be different around here for sure.\tAnd for starters, you\u2019re gonna be stuck with me.\tLike sand through the hourglass, so are the days of our lives.\tThat was fast. Sunny hasn\u2019t even left town yet. And your uncle already named you c e o? Well, it hasn\u2019t been announced officially yet, but I\u2019m the obvious choice. Why is that? Well, for starters, the whole reason why I came back to town was to help out Titan specifically to help out Sunny boy. How so? Look, I love my brother, but he isn\u2019t exactly a killer.\tThat\u2019s where I come in. There were times where I just had to give him a little extra support. So he benefited from your expertise? Exactly. And then when I covered for him after he was attacked by Clyde West, and that\u2019s when I really got to show my stuff. You know the Kiki Drive, the Thes business acumen, though.\tThe Kriyas ego. Careful. Ms. Johnson, you are talking to your new boss. I am my own boss, Alex will. You\u2019d be smart to remember that\tTitan cuts you some pretty large checks. You\u2019d be smart to remember that. Checks Sunny\u2019s been signing. Sunny\u2019s gone. You just said Victor hasn\u2019t decided who\u2019s taking over for him yet. I said it hasn\u2019t been announced officially. Okay, so if you\u2019re name\u2019s CEO e o, then yes, you\u2019ll be in charge of one of my clients signing some of my, when I\u2019m named C e o, I\u2019ll be in charge of your biggest client.\tCutting you your biggest checks. Alex, I\u2019m not denying that Titan is great business for SJ p r. Well, good. Now, will that still be the same when Uncle Vic announces that I\u2019ll be taking over for Sonny? What do you mean? I mean, are you gonna be. Working as closely with me as he did with my brother.\tWell, what do you think? Oh God. It just keeps getting worse. I know, right. Wait, what are you doing? I wanted to save that for posterity. I can\u2019t print this. What? Why? Because it\u2019s not true. The truth is, so 2015, I\u2019m sorry, Mattie Guinevere, the spectator is a snooze. It needs life energy buzz. I was giving that to you.\tItem by juicy item. Guess in each one of those items is a liable suit waiting to happen. Oh, Jackson is not going to sue. Right? Cuz the Kes don\u2019t have their own army of lawyers or. I am not loving this new professional you. She\u2019s less three sheets to the wind, more wet blanket. Look darling, I know that son hurt you, but you cannot use your poem through exact revenge.\tBut I worked so hard on that. Do you know how long it took me to come up with scabies? I applaud your creativity. I do. But this is a n. And we have standards to uphold standards that were set by my father and my late sister. I am very determined to prove I am every bit as good of an editor as same one.\tGeez, I had no idea you were so serious about. Maintaining these lofty journalistic principles. See anything about principles you did Gwyneth Pulitzer. Ah, now don\u2019t you misunderstand me. I am fine with you going after every pious Salem that you want, but you have to write the truth, not something that\u2019s made up.\tGreat. So what do I do now? You go out there and you get me some dirt. I can actually run. Go on chop. We\u2019ve got a deadline. Thank you. Bar.\t", "Oh, I love you. I love you too. Hey, hey, look, we\u2019re on Easter. If you and Bonnie want to come up and uh, no, kick it with the Kiwis, we will definitely see you down under. Take care, Chad. Stephanie. Take care. Yeah, see,\tso I finally moved back to Kelo and now you\u2019re leaving. Yeah. Seriously, we need to, uh, Work on our timing and you need to promise you\u2019ll be back. Just try and stop it. I\u2019m sure that, uh, whatever it is, is gonna pass in a minute. I don\u2019t know. There are a ton of bugs going around. Let me go. I I\u2019m a doctor. I know the difference between a bug and nothing and this, this is nothing.\tMaybe we should let the LA run a few tests just to be safe. Yeah, I guess it, it probably couldn\u2019t hurt.\tYou are, aren\u2019t you? You are, um, still luck with Sarah. It\u2019s complicated and confusing\tand it\u2019s just that the other night when.\tWe were together, you seemed to indicate that you\u2019d prefer to be with somebody like me. You actually said we\u2019d belong together,\tbut then the next morning you woke up having dreamt to Sarah, and I realized that whether your marriage may be over, it may not still be over. I said I wasn\u2019t, I told you that I dunno if or when ever will be I, right? And then we were gonna go talk and have breakfast and figure this out, which I just assume meant figure us out.\tBut then we bumped into Sarah in the squares, you remember? And we didn\u2019t get to have that conversation. So, I guess I\u2019m just a bit unclear as to where we stand. I mean, everything that I said, I, I really do care about you a great deal. I just can\u2019t believe everything that you sacrificed for me, and I\u2019m so grateful for it.\tI just, I am still coming to terms with the very recent end of my marriage and just don\u2019t have any answers for you.\tOf course. Yeah, I completely understand. I mean, maybe once the divorce is finalized, I can start thinking about what I want for the future, but right now I\u2019m just not ready.\tYeah, I know. That makes absolute total sense. Yeah, I understand.\tSo look, until then, I think that, um, I think we ought to keep things strictly professional between us and after all, we are running a newspaper together, aren\u2019t we? Sounds like a plan.\tRight? Well, I, I best be off. I\u2019ve got a million things that have to do before I put the spectator to bed, so. All right. Thank you. Um, so, um, do you have any, um, last minute thoughts or, I dunno, concerns about the layout on headline? Oh yeah. I mean, not that I can think of. No. Something comes up just let me know.\tBut otherwise I\u2019m, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow. Partner? Yes, tomorrow.\tI owe you a huge thank you son for taking a chance on SJ p r for giving me such a huge opportunity in Titan. Are you, are you kidding me? I owe Pauline a price for bringing you to doubt. And when you come back, which we\u2019ve established that you will, I will be saving you a seat at the bar.\tI hate to interrupt, but uh, you have a plane to catch. You missed that flight then. Then my husband will kill all of us. Yeah.\tOkay, we,\tHey. Ah,\tI love you guys. We love you too. See you\taround\u2019s. So great, isn\u2019t he? He\u2019s the best.\tSucks. He\u2019s leaving. Yeah, that\u2019s um, It\u2019s a big change for you, Titan. I mean, you\u2019re, you\u2019re gonna have a new boss. Hey. Okay. As soon as I got your text, is everything okay? Oh, everything is fine. Uh, I asked you over to discuss some business, Titan business. Of course. Oh, okay. Where\u2019s Uncle Vic? I assume this is always taking over for Sunny, right?\tUh, it is. Uh, your uncle is out of town. He asked me to handle. Handle letting me know. He chose me to take over. I\u2019m assuming he didn\u2019t. He didn\u2019t. What?\tHe\u2019s giving the job to a different ke hawk,\tJustin and it\u2019s late knows. Fine. Come.\tWell, uh, it\u2019s a nice surprise favorite cousin popping by for a visit. Yes, this isn\u2019t a social visit.\tPerfect timing. I just finished my rewrite.\tThese sauces on. This is solid. Got it. Straight from the studs mouth. I tell you what, that man whore, Alex Kiki, is going to be the gift that keeps on giving to Lady Whistleblower. Wonderful. Pointier. I thought you would be overjoyed. We have a hit gossip column on our hands. I know. And I am Mattie. I\u2019m really impressed.\tReally? Oh, here comes the big butt and don\u2019t you lie. No, it\u2019s um, not about the.\tYou just had a chat about where we stand romantically and he doesn\u2019t want to think about the future until his divorce is finalized, which should be soon, right? Let\u2019s not soon enough. As far as I\u2019m concerned,\tI\u2019m here on behalf of my. So, sir, I want you to hand deliver the decree that formally ends our marriage. Go on, hand it over. I can\u2019t. Why not? Because there\u2019s a problem with the divorce.\tCome in.\tHey there. Thanks. How\u2019d you know I was in here? Amigo told me. Hey, there\u2019s, um, something important that I need to talk to you about. Yeah, me too. Okay. You first.\tI am pregnant.\t", "Just dumping this on everyone out of the ball. I got some. And as much as I will miss seeing you every day, I\u2019m thrilled that you and Will are going to be reunited. Yeah, me too. It\u2019s, um, it\u2019s been pretty rough being a part. Mm-hmm. for a minute there. I. Thought that Snake Leo Stark would get his fangs into you again, but we don\u2019t have to worry about him anymore.\tLeo is someone else\u2019s problem.\tIt\u2019s a simple question. Did you or did you not bust up Shalley? Yeah, I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re getting your information, but you\u2019re way off base. sucking lemons and other things with one Alice Caroline Horton at a local bar before stumbling back to her place for night of raunchy sex. You and Allie, it\u2019s not how he\u2019s making it sound.\tAre you telling me that Allie\u2019s former live-in lover Chanel Dpri didn\u2019t show up unexpectedly at the SAF sanctuary? They one shared to find the two of you in the throws of passion. Chanel caught you. She showed up the next. Sounds like confirmation to me. That\u2019s not confirmation. Leo. I didn\u2019t confirm anything.\tNo comment. Too late. So tell me how awkward was it for Chanel when she found the two of you together? Maybe not at all, considering that you\u2019d already had a threesome with her and Ellie. A threesome. That\u2019s it.\tYou want to comment? Leo, here\u2019s one. Take your whistle and shove it up. Your blower.\tUgh. Look what you did. You\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t do it to your face. You\u2019re lucky I have a memory, like a steel trap among many other fine attributes. Leo, get the hell outta here before I actually lose it, okay? Okay. But be sure to pick up a copy of Tomorrow\u2019s Spectator. I hear it\u2019s going to be a must read.\tAbout what he just said. Um, you do not have to explain. Your personal life is none of my business. Yeah, but the way he just made that whole thing sound, Steph, he made it sound a lot more salacious than what it actually was. Alex, really say no more. You, Allie and Chanel are all consenting adults. What you do with them has nothing to do with me.\tNow, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have more work to do before calling in.\tHow\u2019s it going, partner? It\u2019s uh, it\u2019s going. Um, I just thought I\u2019d stop by, see if you have any last minute concerns about the paper. I mean, can you believe it? We\u2019re actually gonna put our first issue of the spectator out. We did it, Sandra. We\u2019re, we\u2019re actually running a newspaper.\tWe don\u2019t seem very excited. Is, um, is everything all right? Sarah just left. Oh, did she have to scold you about this time then blackmailing the paper away from Jack and Jennifer? How did you find out? No, no. She just, she just didn\u2019t believe that her cousins would willingly give us the paper. So she asked Jennifer why they really did it.\tJennifer told her, no, no, no. Thank God she kept a trap shut. She was smart enough to do that, but Sarah came here to get it out of me. You didn\u2019t, she\u2019s relentless when I said No, no, no. I, I didn\u2019t tell her. I just told her that we blackmailed them. I didn\u2019t say with what?\tWell, I will bet that Little Miss Perfect won\u2019t be some bloody sanctimonious if she found out that her cousin was the one who move me over when she was high on painkillers.\tSorry, I shouldn\u2019t speak Sarah. Love Sarah. Especially when it\u2019s obvious for the look on your face that you were still in love with her.\tDr. Horton, are you okay? You look a little green around the gills. Yeah, I\u2019m fine. Um, it\u2019s just a touch of food poisoning I think. Are you sure that\u2019s all it?\tI guess we\u2019ll have to figure out the time difference with New Zealand so we know when to call you. I\u2019ve already committed it to memory. Okay, so New Zealand is 17 hours ahead, which means if it is 9:00 AM here, It is 4:00 AM there. So then don\u2019t call at 9:00 AM No, do never call . Hey big bro over here.\tThere he is\tnot. This is family only. Come on. Okay. Chad is family. So can we just play nice please? Yeah, sure. No problem, Alex. Tough day. No, papa. It\u2019s all good. So New Zealand, huh? It\u2019s a pretty radical move. Yeah. You should come visit. That is, I mean, if you have any time off being the CEO of Titan, it\u2019s a stressful job and big bro.\tI think you\u2019re gonna kill him. You think so? Yeah. You were born to be a ceo E o. It\u2019s true of all my sons. You are the most like Victor . He wishes, okay, Chad, what did I say? Play nice. I mean, the old man couldn\u2019t have made a better choice. Thanks that.\tI\u2019m gonna miss you. You big dummy . I\u2019m gonna miss you too. You big dummy. I\u2019m be a stranger, okay? Okay. I love you. I love you too.\tAll right dad. See you later, Chad. See you guys.\tHey Steph. If you\u2019re looking for Chad, he\u2019s right over there. Hey, he made it. Yeah. I wasn\u2019t gonna miss saying goodbye to my favorite cousin. Okay.

You can just, I ain\u2019t come here to talk to you about that. Then why are you, Sarah made it very clear that we have nothing to discuss ever. There wasn\u2019t. That\u2019s how I heard about your latest stunt. So I heard on this time to deserve your righteous indignation.\tYou stole the spectator from Jack and Jennifer. You son of a bitch,\tMaggie. Hi, uh, Henderson. Let me in. Sarah here. Um, I\u2019m afraid not. Oh, well I need to, um, I need to speak with her. It\u2019s kind of important. What a coincidence, because there is something very important that I\u2019d like to discuss with you. Yeah, yeah, sure. What is it? Well, for starters, how about the fact that you\u2019re sleeping with my daughter?\tYou\u2019re moving to New Zealand? Yeah. You know that Will\u2019s new project is out there and he\u2019s, he\u2019s really excited about it and I just, I want to be there to support him. What about Ari? Just come with us. I mean, Gabby wasn\u2019t thrilled about the idea, but. She realized Ari wanted to come with us, so she\u2019s gonna visit us there and, and we\u2019ll come visit here and, and Allie\u2019s gonna come with us too.\tHer and Chanel just broke up, you know, she has a lot of changes going on and Henry\u2019s so young. I know this is a lot. I\u2019m just dropping on your lap at once. Jenna, I\u2019m, I\u2019m, I\u2019m really sorry. Don\u2019t. Don\u2019t be. I think this is gonna be really good for everyone, especially for you. And Will, I\u2019m happy for you, for all of you.\tThank you. When you leave, I am, uh, I\u2019m going straight to the airport from here. What? That soon? Yeah. No, I, I mean, I, I would\u2019ve left with everyone else, but I had some, uh, loose ends. Tie up the titan. How did Victor take exactly how you would, uh, you\u2019d think he would like trash will and then screamed a bunch of curse words.\tPretty much. Yeah, pretty much. But you know what? He\u2019ll get over it. And it\u2019s not like I\u2019m leaving in the lurch. You know, Alex has been dying to be c e o of Titan ever since Uganda into.\tOkay with Alex step for you. I guess that means, uh, Stephanie\u2019s gonna be reporting directly to him.\tWe\u2019re both adults. Alex, I don\u2019t foresee any problem with us working together, especially since we\u2019re no longer romantically involved, but if you do. No, of course not. I mean, we both want the same thing, right? For Titan to thrive. Absolutely. So as long as we keep that in mind, stay focused, mutually respectful, mindful of each other\u2019s.\tBoundaries and we should get along just fine.\tWish I got it? Sure, why not?\tI take it. Sarah told you about what happened between us. No, Henderson did. He saw you leaving Sarah\u2019s bedroom the other day? , yeah. Ah, okay. Henderson. Yeah. Should have known that he would spread the word Rex. Sarah\u2019s going through a divorce. She\u2019s very vulnerable. Good. And, and I, I would never take advantage of that, Maggie.\tI promise you. I have no intention of ever hurting Sarah again. Well then what exactly are your intentions for my daughter?\tDidn\u2019t realize you had such strong opinions about the fourth estate. I have very strong opinions about you stealing from my family. I\u2019m not sure what you mean. I\u2019ve read Jack\u2019s farewell editorial. It says that he and Jennifer are giving you and Gwen the paper with her as editor-in-chief. Is that a problem?\tYeah, there\u2019s a huge problem because there is no. that they would ever do that by choice. Why not? They was planned on giving the paper to one of their. Navil. God rest her soul\u2019s no longer with us. JJ J\u2019s not interested. So Gwen is the obvious choice. She hears Jack\u2019s daughter too. You know Gwen is nothing but an evil bitch who has only ever brought misery to me and my family.\tRight? Think about all of the lies. She\u2019s turned upside down. Now all you Hortons were perfect saints until Gwen Rusche came long. Huh? I just save it. I called Jennifer. I told her that I didn\u2019t believe any of this time for change nonsense, and I wanted to know the real reason that she gave up the. And what did you or do your cousin have to say?\tShe said she couldn\u2019t get into it, but I had the very distinct impression that it was a decision made under duress. So is this how your twisted little partnership with Gwen works? She covers for you when you commit felonies and you help her find new ways to hurt Jack? Jack made a choice. Oh my God, do you really expect me to believe that this is what he.\tThat he chose of his own free will to hand over the reins to one of the most revived women in Salem who has exactly zero journalism experience. Explain this, your explanation is bull. What did you do, Xander? How did you force my cousins to hand over the paper that they put their blood, sweat, and tears into for 30 years?\tSarah? No. Answer me now. Fine. I\u2019ll tell you, I blackmailed Jack and Jennifer into signing over the Spectator, and it\u2019s all your bloody fault,\tChad. I\u2019m telling you, there\u2019s nothing to worry about. Okay. Alex and Stephanie are over. Yeah, I know. I know. Well then why do you seem so disappointed that the two of them are gonna be working so closely together? I wouldn\u2019t say disappointed. I wouldn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t use disappointment.

It means that you did not deprive her the chance to say goodbye to her mother.\tNo. Well, apparently not, but trust me when I tell you this has nothing to do with that. Come on. Alex. Do you honestly mean to tell me that there isn\u2019t even a small part of you that feels that the two of you can\u2019t just reignite that spark again?\tAbsolutely not. That ship has sailed. Stephanie\u2019s with Chad now, and I highly doubt that she will ever. Look in my direction again.\tOne, this has nothing to do with any other woman.

Price is crazy low for what we\u2019re getting, what we are getting. I haven\u2019t agreed to anything yet. Come on, Chloe. Can\u2019t wait around forever. Place like this is gonna go fast.

No, nope. That\u2019s not what I meant. Look, I, I decided to lean into this whole no strings sex thing after I screwed things up with Stephanie. And then after speaking with Dr. Evans, she made me realize that it\u2019s not the right way or the best way to handle things.\tI\u2019m actually just avoiding facing my feelings now. I\u2019m using you to do that, and that\u2019s not cool, you know? No, I don\u2019t know. No. Do I mind being used? Oh, well maybe you should. Guas isn\u2019t healthy. Hey, hey, this isn\u2019t healthy for either of us. I want better for you. I think you should want better for yourself too.\tLook at that is just so freaking unfair.

I heard about what happened at the bakery. Such a shame. It\u2019s just a temporary situation.\tI assure you. You do not have to worry about your sister\u2019s employment. Oh, I\u2019m not. Actually, if you could spare a few minutes, Ms. Price, I was actually just about to call you. I\u2019ve been reviewing your statement regarding when your office was broken into, and I was hoping you could just answer a few more questions.\tWhy do you have a new lead? I\u2019m not sure yet.\tCommissioner Chanel. Come on in. I, uh, I haven\u2019t really had a chance to talk to you since, uh, the incident at the bakery. And, um, well, actually I did when Talia and I came back over here to go over our stories. My, I, I wanted to tell you that I, I\u2019m really sorry that my bake goods put you in the hospital. I appreciate it.\tBut you have nothing to apologize for. I mean, if you do, it\u2019s simply that those biscuits are so damn good. I mean, I hate so many of them. That\u2019s why I had such a severe reaction to the drug, Sam. Right. Uh, and that\u2019s, that\u2019s really kind of you to say. It\u2019s just, I, I just wish I knew how it happened. Well, we are working hard on trying to find that out.\tHey, and when we arrest someone, you\u2019ll be the first to know, thanks.\tOh my God,\tthey shut the freaking bakery down. This just gets better and better. Babe, I cannot tell you how much I appreciate everything you\u2019ve done for me, and as I\u2019ve said before, I wouldn\u2019t impose this on you. If there was any way that I could do this myself, it\u2019s just the cops would be onto me in a heartbeat. I know.\tI know we\u2019ve been a horn a thousand times, but Colin isn\u2019t destroying Chanel\u2019s business revenge enough. How can it be enough? Talia, you\u2019ve been there with me when I\u2019ve woken up from horrible nightmares. You\u2019ve seen me cry and scream and get crazy depressed, or cuz of what that little slut took from me and my sister, which is why I\u2019m not gonna rest until I make her feel the same kind of misery that she put me and my sister fruit.\tYou. You\u2019re not talking about killing someone. No. No. I\u2019m not a murderer. Unlike Chanel. I know, but this whole eye for an eye thing, it kind of seems like, you know, listen to me. All right. And listen. Good. Before that bitch killed my mother. She broke her heart when she went for my father. So now it\u2019s time to see how she likes having her heart broken.\tShe\u2019s already had her heart broken, her ex cheated on her, and then moved to a different continent, which is why it\u2019s the perfect time for you to swoop in and sweep her off her feet, and then break her little heart all over again.\tPlease have a seat.\tAnd now Ms. Price, I\u2019ve been reviewing the timeline of events. And it seems that the day your office had broken into was the same day that Sloan Peterson found out that her civil case had business missed. That\u2019s right. She threatened to come after me extra judicially, and about an hour later, my office was vandalized.\tCoincidence, I think not well. I agree. The timing is suspicious, but what I\u2019m struggling with is that there was no signs of forced entry. Whoever broke into your office that day had a key and I was the only one who had one. Is there a chance that there might have been a duplicate, an employee, perhaps?\tMm-hmm. Nope. I\u2019m a one woman show after my former employee, Leo Stark turned out to be a dumpster fire, and that\u2019s a kind way of putting it. I\u2019m, I\u2019ve been using contractors and outsourcing work well in that case. Um, have your keys ever been left unattended? Um, perhaps someone else have gained access to your key.\tYou mean Sloan Peterson? Anyone? Well, I suppose it could have been Sloan Peterson. Uh, the day she confronted me, my bag was laying on the table at the cafe. Oh. It was when, uh, Chanel introduced me to your lovely sister. Wait, Talia was there.\tYou want me to,\twhat\u2019s the problem? She\u2019s into women. You\u2019re a woman. Yeah, but I\u2019m not gay. I\u2019m not eating. Bye. Hey, all I really want is just you. At least that\u2019s what I thought you wanted too, but it seems like you\u2019re trying to pit me out. No, no, not at all. I only want you to at least won\u2019t be real. At least not for us.\t", "Hey, I\u2019m really sorry about this. About what? Oh, you haven\u2019t seen it? No. Is it about the price case? Well, indirectly, yes. Kissing cops out. Killer Sloan.

I already took a bite out of my brioche French toast. I ordered you some too. Here. Have a mimosa. It\u2019ll calm you down. I don\u2019t want a mimosa look. I\u2019m, I\u2019m sorry to sound like such a miser Leo, but.\tBloody hell what we\u2019ve spent on this place in the last month. We might as well be living in a penthouse on Fifth Avenue. Well, I hate to break it to you, but you\u2019re being ripped off. No kidding. And I know from having lived here with Zander, that management goes completely Tony Soprano on any guest that doesn\u2019t pay promptly.\tIn fact, I\u2019m expecting Phyllis to come up here and hunt me down and rip my fingernails off. Phyllis, she\u2019s like four, 10 and 90 years old. And Mina, then a junkyard dog. No, we can\u2019t keep living like this. Leo, I, I co-own a small paper. I\u2019m not a, okay. Okay. I will. Downgrade to a single mimosa tomorrow. No, forget downgrading.\tNo more mimosas, no massages, no more spa, and no more room service. We need to find a new place to live asap, preferably somewhere where Phyllis will never, ever find me. I didn\u2019t order anything else. I swear. Good Lord, that might be her. We need to hide it. Okay, let\u2019s, let\u2019s just relax. If it\u2019s Phyllis, I, I won\u2019t answer the door.\tDoesn\u2019t she have a key? No. I changed the locks on the sly. Who is it? Hey, it\u2019s Alex.\tHi. Can we talk?\tWow. Well, this place does get a lot of light, doesn\u2019t it? Yeah. And it doesn\u2019t look over a parking lot like my room at the motel. That\u2019s certainly a plus. It is though. I do just have to say what? Well, the last thing I expected was to be looking at apartments with you. Right. Sometimes the unexpected can be fun.\tRight? And don\u2019t you want that, you know, Phyllis off your back. Mm, definitely. That woman is a terrorist. Yeah. Well, in my opinion, this place is a seals, two bedrooms, light, airy, and the best part you get out of there. I can add that dump.\tOh, there she is, my beautiful daughter. Hey mama. Well, darling, you\u2019ll be delighted to hear that I\u2019ve made the decision to show the city hall appreciation by ordering Drum roll please. 200 Bear Claw. I\u2019m sorry, mom. I. I can\u2019t fill that order. Oh, well honey, honey, honey. There\u2019s no rush on it. No. You know, maybe it\u2019s too much work.\tWell, um, how about those, uh, cinnamon twisted donuts? That, that Abe is so crazy about. What, what is it? Why you looking so sad? I, I can\u2019t fill any order.\tThe department shut us down. Sweet bits is out of business.\tLike sand through the hourglass. So are the days of our lives.\tOh, baby mama. How can they do this without even warning you? Oh, they did, but we, we\u2019ve been opening later, since it\u2019s been slower and, well, they left a message, but I didn\u2019t get it until just now. Oh, well this is so wrong and unfair and I\u2019m, I\u2019m going to give whoever made this terrible decision a piece of my mind.\tNo, mama, I don\u2019t want you to do that. Well, we can\u2019t do nothing. The bakery, I mean, this is your dream. You made it happen. And I\u2019m not, I be, damn. I\u2019m just gonna let somebody just trample on it. Oh yes. It was my dream and, and it was amazing while it lasted, but, Wait a minute, it\u2019s over. The bakery is my shirt down for good, right?\tThis is just temporary until the investigation is resolved. Right? Until they prove Sloane Peterson drug, those biscuits. Then everybody will come flocking back to the best bakery in all of sale. The flake is crusted inside of Chicago. I, I appreciate your optimism, but I hope, uh, Uhuh. No buts. No buts. Now, now, I will not allow you to give up on sleep bits in your dream.\tNow you hear me? I will not stand for it.\tJada, I understand why you\u2019re angry with Leo Starkman. I am too. He\u2019s a mean-spirited little creep, but this is Sloan.

Yeah, right.\t", "You are not to blame for this. Okay. Yeah. And how can you say that I\u2019m the one who infused those biscuits?

Okay, that\u2019s too late now. You just sit there. You don\u2019t go anywhere,\tbabe. What do you mean turn up the heat? It\u2019s probably Chanel. Wondering where the hell I am. Hi, I am so sorry that I\u2019m late. Oh no. Uh, don\u2019t worry about it. We\u2019ve been shut down by the health department, so the baker\u2019s closed. Oh no. Yeah. I was calling to tell you not to come in. Um, are you sure There\u2019s nothing I can do.\tThanks. But now until we get to the bottom of this, there is nothing anyone can do.\tYou know, it\u2019s, it\u2019s still eating at me that Talia had the means and the opportunity to tamper with those SCUs. Mm-hmm. But still no motive whatsoever. Yeah, but her story just kept coming out in pieces. Oh, hey sis. Sorry. I forgot that I stopped by the drugstore. Oh, I forgot that I took a long walk around the lake.\tYou know, if I didn\u2019t know her, you know, between her lack of an alibi, the fact that she forgot to turn on the security cameras. Mm-hmm. And not to mention she\u2019s one of the very few people with a key to the bakery. Yeah. But she didn\u2019t have keys to Paulina\u2019s office. And that vandalism was most certainly committed by the same perp unless they had an accomplice.\tOh mm honey. Like you wouldn\u2019t believe and it\u2019s just like moving down like to my shoulder. Oh my God, lemme help out. You know what, second thought. Better not. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe not.\tAbe is in a meeting with the DA at the police station. I\u2019m gonna have to go over there and track him down myself. Oh mama, I, hold on. Look. You know you\u2019re gonna just have to stop with the mamas right here cause there\u2019s no way you\u2019re gonna stop with your mama from doing what is right for my baby girl. Do you think that I haven\u2019t had any obstacles becoming a successful businesswoman or getting on the ballot for governor or Abe on the way to becoming mayor?\tNow, this is just a roadblock. You\u2019re gonna have to push yourself through Chanel darling, and you will, if I have to push you myself. Oh, mom, if you would\u2019ve just let me finish what I was saying. You wouldn\u2019t have had to give that speech because I\u2019m coming with you. Oh, that\u2019s my girl. Oh. Oh. Now you can come over and watch me take that health inspector head off at city Hall.\tOkay. As entertaining as uh, sounds. There\u2019s something else I wanna do\tsince we have to keep our distance. I thought this was the next best thing. Thanks. Yeah. Just overheard in the bullpen where Riley went to get his morning coffee at Sweet Bits. Mm-hmm. Health Department shut him down. I don\u2019t know. Yeah, that\u2019s sad for Chanel, but maybe this will force Talia to get that crazy idea out of her head to become the next cake boss.\tMean maybe she can use her medical training to actually, you know, save lives. But once she gets an idea in her head, she cannot be deterred. Unlike her sister. Huh? How long you been staring at that file? Uh, I\u2019m just looking at the timeline. I\u2019ll see if there\u2019s something in here that what we might have missed.\tAlright. Okay. Well if you find anything, I\u2019ll be in my office. Mm-hmm.\tYou think you\u2019re not good enough for me? Hey. The rich, handsome Alex, Kiki. I did not say that at all. I just, I need to do some soul searching. I think you do too. Yeah. I\u2019m not really a fan of soul searching, so No. But, um, thank you. Anyway. Come on. Come on. I\u2019ve gotta know you pretty damn well.

I wouldn\u2019t worry about stacking up too many hours. I, I think this case is gonna be over pretty quickly.\tThat, that\u2019s great to hear. It makes you so sure. Wow. A bulk of the charges resulted from you pretending to be my paralegal and as the victim, I can just make those charges go away by not cooperating with the da, which then leaves.

I mean, how is this even possible?\tUm, well, well maybe it was because something I said,\tyou are right. It\u2019s time to bring this fight out in the open. I\u2019m just gonna get pretty ugly, especially since both of you live under the same roof. Now, let\u2019s step Dewey\u2019s Worst. I\u2019m not afraid of him.

You really think you should be lecturing me on Brotherly Love? What\u2019s that supposed to mean?\tDidn\u2019t I just read in the gossip section that you almost slept with your twin sister\u2019s girlfriend and that led to the demise of their relationship? All right? It\u2019s a little more complicated than that, and also that\u2019s not what happened. Allie and Chanel didn\u2019t break up because of me. They broke up because Allie decided to have a one night stand with Alex, Kiki.\tAh, well you still having regrets? Ah, I knew that. We can\u2019t have a go at around three. So ? No. No. I can\u2019t.

I spoke to Xander. The man is a total.\tYou okay there? Yeah, I\u2019m fine. I just need to catch my breath. What are you doing here anyway? I\u2019m not really sure. It\u2019s my place to wait. I know my wish came true. What are you talking about? Yesterday I was at the park and there it was. A bright and shiny penny on the ground. I had to raise some little brats.\tPick it up. Knocked her out of the way. Here you are. Yeah. I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t follow. Hello? Find a penny. Pick it up. Then tonight you get to hold on. What\u2019s, hold on. You\u2019re a little late though. It\u2019s morning. But I won\u2019t hold it against you, Leo. Or will I look how, how stupid am I spending the night at the office when I could have been here with you.\t", "But what are we waiting for? Here I am. There you are. Oh. Time out, ti time. Time out. Who are you gonna put me in a timeout? Daddy. Not your lucky penny. I\u2019m not here because of you. Well, then why are you here parading around? Stark naked patent pending. Leo, who else is staying in this room? Well Gwenny, but she, oh my gwenny.\tYou know, I just don\u2019t get it. I thought Sloane dumped Eric because she was super pissed at him for getting raw out of jail. Apparently she, for forgive, Ugh. I just thought we were done with this wretched, bottom feeder. You know, I just don\u2019t understand how Eric and her got together in the first place. I mean, what does he seeing her?\tWhat? She\u2019s kind of hot bell, you know? Oh God, dude, you\u2019re such a man. Yeah, I am. I am. I\u2019ve been called worse, by the way. Yeah. Well, can\u2019t actually think that that woman is good for our brother. Actually, I don\u2019t at all, but, but from his point of view, I think maybe she has been there for him when things went south.\tMm-hmm. . And that\u2019s why he is been such a jerk because she\u2019s been there for him. Look, given my history with Kristen Damara, I\u2019m in no position to judge. Oh, please. Anyone with a brain is in a position to judge that Sloan Peterson is a nightmare. I just hope and pray that. At least keeps it professional this time.\tI don\u2019t get it. I mean, how could this be your fault? Trash through the book at me. I know, but maybe, maybe because I told her to you. What? Look, it was before I agreed to take the case, I was still angry with you. You know, I kind of, I went off in front of Trask. I mean, God, who knew I had so much influence over that woman.\tThis is all because that stupid column. No, this is because of your stupid action. Nathan. You talk her out of it. I don\u2019t know, Eric. I mean, she\u2019s already gone to the press with this. Knowing her. She\u2019s not gonna back out, so then I\u2019m screwed.\tNot necessarily.\tOkay, look. All right. I\u2019ll be the first to admit, my sister and I have definitely had some real knockdown drag outs, but at the end of the. We love each other, and I, I can\u2019t believe that I\u2019m about to say this out loud that I even have to, but you don\u2019t drug your sibling to sabotage their career. Okay, Johnny?\tI know you mean well, but this is between me and your father. Except it\u2019s affecting the whole family, you know? Not to mention the company seen the stock lately. It\u2019s in the dump way. Shin\u2019s unhappy. This whole thing\u2019s a mess. I\u2019ll get it under control. Not a fair war with my dad, but why don\u2019t I just go get him right now.\tYou guys can hash this thing out here. And now.\tHello, Mr. Damira. Hi, this is Sloan Peterson, counsel for Eric Brady. I was hoping you and I could have a little chat.\tI\u2019m all done in there if you\u2019d like to hop in. Thank you. And there is something seriously wrong with your friend.\tDid the two of you. My girl get it. Also, I had been worried sick about you. Why? I ran into Xander at the office where I slept last night. Thank you very much. He told me what happened between you two. So I raced over. I thought you\u2019d be hole up in here crying your wi eyes out, licking your wounds. Turns out you\u2019re licking something else entirely.\tFilthy. Ah, I\u2019m filthy. I\u2019m filthy. Okay. I\u2019m filthy, but so are you Gwendolyn bagging two of the hottest guys in Salem first Ander. Now Alex, you are a queen. I both hate and respect you at the same time. Huh? You have a But that\u2019s out of the way. I did get a sneak peek at the main attraction, and I have one word.\tEpic indeed. Girl. Give me all the deeds and I mean everything.\tSo, uh, I was thinking maybe I should go with you when you confront Stephan. He\u2019s less likely to kill you with me there, Nicole. This is not your fight. No, it kind of is since not only I was Stephan\u2019s unintended victim, you and I are seeing each other again, which makes us a team. Right? I suppose it does.\tMm-hmm. I know it says. Now let\u2019s go kick your brother\u2019s ass.\tYou know what better safe than sorry, God, this family. Good morning, son. Good morning. Uh, good morning Nicole. Morning. How you feeling, dad? Better. Thank you. Um, thank you for helping me out last night for getting me outta here before I can make an even bigger fool of myself in front of shin. Yeah, well it\u2019s uh, probably no surprise to you that Uncle Stefan is pushing for him to fire you.\tNo, it\u2019s not. So where is my backs stabbing brother, you just missed. Oh, well, look, dad, I hope you\u2019re not mad about the warning I gave him. I, but you know, I, I, I know it backfired on you, but like he said, he. Just give your taste of your own medicine. John Roman, you don\u2019t understand this whole drugging business.\tI wasn\u2019t the one who started it. It was your Uncle Stephan\tattempted. Attempted murder. That\u2019s insane. Well, I think Trask was playing hardball. I wasn\u2019t trying to murder him Bell. I was just trying to help him. For God\u2019s sake, I take it. You got the message from Trask. Yeah. It\u2019s pretty ridiculous. Yeah. You missed a button there, counselor. So much for keeping it professional.\t", "Wait a minute, if you can. Gwenny Warren, having sexy time last night. Why was the do not disturb sign on the door?\tOh, oh God. Oh, I, I remember. I remember now. I, oh, it\u2019s all coming back to me. Yeah. Apparently I preceded my legend.\tWe, um, we, what did we, we ran into the, um, we ran into each other at small bar and we got completely bollocked, didn\u2019t we? Because that Oh, bloody oneand. Can\u2019t get over Sarah Horton. And, um, and, um, you, uh, I lost my job. Right. Yeah. Maggie, the tyrant, she stole your job. Hmm. And then we, we came back here and had a nightcap and we had.\tWild. Hot, passionate, no holds barred. Oh, no, no, no, no. Too many adjectives. My head\u2019s pounding sex. We had sex and you know what? I think this was a first for me. Uh, at first, yes. A first with a British woman. Are you a beautiful, sexy, stunning British woman? Yeah. Well then technically I am an American. And what\u2019s with the heart accent?\tUh, well, what does it matter? It doesn\u2019t matter at all. All it matters is that you really, really, I\u2019m really turned me on. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That\u2019s fine. No, this cannot happen again. This has been a terrible, terrible mistake.\tWell, why was there a do not disturb sign on the door if there was nothing to disturb? I suppose because Gwen wanted to be left alone. Poor. Thanks. She was probably crying her eyes out all night time to think of it. I did hear mother damn you Zander cook. I was trying to be honest with you. Yeah. So you keep saying what do you think you deserve a medal for being honest.\tWhen the entire time you\u2019ve known Gwen, you\u2019ve treated her like she\u2019s a second fiddle to that skinny snooty Sarah Horton. And now even though skinny snooty woman has given you the Hepo left town to get away from you, you still treat Gwen like she\u2019s a damn afterthought. Like, like she can never measure up to your standards, which is completely absurd given that you are a total swine with the soul the size of a pee.\tYou know what? I\u2019m not gonna call her. I\u2019m going to go see my bestie in person and stop her from doing something she might regret.\tLast a mistake. Now wait a second. When, look, we, we are practically. Aren\u2019t we? And we just knew each other a few hours and we just jumped right into bed with each other. Okay. So you never had a one night stand before? Yeah. Yes. I\u2019ve had my wild days, of course, but God, now I\u2019m in love with another man. Right.\tXander, who is still in love with Sarah Horton. So you used me to get back at him? Oh, I did not.\tYes I did. Hm. I\u2019m sorry. Don\u2019t be. I\u2019m not at all besides, I\u2019m still trying to get over Stephanie Johnson. She\u2019s with Chad, so I have no reason to feel guilty either. Neither do you. We are both single and, oh God. Don\u2019t say ready to mingle. I hate that. I would never say that. What I was gonna say is that we are both consenting adults and what we did is perfectly normal.\tUnacceptable.\tYeah, yeah, yeah, you\u2019re right. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t owe zand or anything. Exactly. So we are free to have all the earth shattering sex we want with no regrets.\tPretty great, wasn\u2019t it? Definitely. In fact, I think it deserves an encore.\tHang on a second. Last night you tipped me off that somebody was drugging me and now you\u2019re accusing me of drugging my brother, which is it, honey, I\u2019m guessing. I\u2019m confused. No, you\u2019re not. Don\u2019t try to manipulate me. I\u2019m a der too. Remember you got me there After I tipped you off last night, you decided you wanted to get back at my dad\u2019s, so you pulled the old switcheroo.\tCausing him to ingest the drug that was meant for you. Go ahead. Tell me I\u2019m wrong. Mm. Well that all depends on what, if it was in fact your father who was drugging me. Is that what you\u2019re telling me, John? John? That my own brother\u2019s been plotting against me.\tSo I not only called shin old, but then I proceeded to talk about how my son was possessed by the devil. Mm-hmm. . And then you topped it off by shoving Stephan. Ah, damnit. It was pretty hard to watch. Yes, I\u2019m sure. And now I have to do major damage control. How are you gonna do that? Well, with way I can just express great contrition and turn on the charm.\tIt\u2019s Stephen. Stephan is a whole other story.\tI, I think there\u2019s only one move to make where Stefan\u2019s concerned, and that is well after Johnny tried to do the right thing, your brother now knows you\u2019re onto him. So all this subterfuge is, is pointless. He. It is time for you to confront Stephan once and for all.\tOkay, so I\u2019ve decided not to worry about Nicole or that stupid gossip column anymore, really? Mm. What changed your mind? Well, while we were just enjoying each other just now, I realize it\u2019s incredibly demeaning for me to compete with the Navy. I mean, I know I\u2019m the best sex you\u2019ve ever had. I don\u2019t need to hear it from you.\tI admire yourself, confidence, and I admire you for your impressive staying power.\t", "I assume Brady mentioned that I hired Sloan. Yeah. One bad decision after another. Sloane\u2019s an excellent attorney and you gave me no other choices. Okay, listen, I don\u2019t wanna fight and I actually do think it would be better for all of us to work together on this. I know you and I don\u2019t really get along, but I think we have a common goal in keeping these two idiots out of prison.\tSo I think we should do an end run around trash and call Stephan Dira. Gee, what a great idea. I wish I had thought of that. Oh wait, I. Oh, and here he is now.\tOkay, well we were there and then we ordered another round and another round, and then we, um, started talking about his work situation. Honey, how is any of this relevant to what I want to hear? I said everything. But what it meant was everything. Like everything. What don\u2019t you wanna know about how we got into bed, honey?\tNo. No. Boring. Boring. Listen to me carefully. Nobody cares about the setup. Press fast forward. Choose your words wisely and paint me a vivid picture of that God among men and men. Okay, go.\tOkay. Um, me see, uh, Well first he uhhuh, . He did this. Oh, I have to get that. Sorry. Hang on. Oh damn. Musts be an emergency with the advertiser. I, I have to go to work. Sorry. I am gonna throttle you. Uh, can you maybe just tell Alex I to run? You better. Give me all the details later. Missy, this is gonna be great for stuff at lady whistleblower column.\tDon\u2019t you dare. Or I will make it so that lady is not just a nom.\tSo, wait, let me get this straight. Stephan spiked your drink and then you switched it with his, and then he switched it back. Oh. This cat and mouse game has been going on for a while. Technically, I never actually drugged Stephan. He drugged himself. He just didn\u2019t know about it. So why? Why is he doing all this in the first place?\tI suspect he secretly holds a grudge against me for not telling him about the brain. . Well, that\u2019s great. Now you guys can just be done with it. Call it even. I was planning on confronting him, but I guess I\u2019ve missed my chance. Yeah, well, in that case I should probably get going to work. Oh, I was, uh, I was headed out too.\tYou need to lift? Yeah, that\u2019d be great. Okay. I\u2019ll see you tonight. Looking forward to it.\tWell, if it isn\u2019t the brother\u2019s grim, please uh, have a seat.\tI didn\u2019t realize the whole gang was gonna be here. Mr. D. Thank you so much for meeting us. Yes. As I was just telling Ms. Peterson, we have a common goal to get your brothers off the hook for what they did to me. I realized that, um, their methods were reckless. You think they kidnapped me, knocked me out, tied me to a bed so a mad man could experiment on me.\tYes. But in the end, the experiment was a success and you\u2019re back to the man you once were because I was. That was a hell of a risk one that they took without my consent. You wanted to talk about consent? Excuse me, pal. Listen, Brady, let us handle this. Mr. Damara. I admit that our clients were extreme, but everything worked out for the best.\tAnd since the DA doesn\u2019t have a case without your cooperation, we\u2019re asking you if you could please not press charges.\tWhat they did was unconscionable, but as much as I hate to admit it, in the end, they did me a favor. So you\u2019ll talk aask. Consider the charges dropped.\tUh,\tStephan, thank you. Yeah. Thank you.\tOh, no, I still can\u2019t stand her. Oh.\tOh, I didn\u2019t think you were coming in today. Um, yes. Well, I heard that there was a problem with one of the advertisers. Oh, I was just like to take care of that actually. Yeah. Well, I\u2019m here now so I can take care of it. No, I\u2019m happy to cover it if you wanna take the day off. Why about to do that going? You, you don\u2019t have to put on a front with.\tWas just here. I feel terrible that you spent the night in your room all alone. Crying. Crying.\tActually, I wasn\u2019t alone. I was busy hitting the sheets with your cousin, Alex.\tWhere\u2019s Gwen? You should do go to work. Looks like it\u2019s just you and me. Handsome. Good One of the moment alone with you. Me too. I have a bone to pick with the guy who ruined my career\ton. Put that away. Considering you\u2019ve saved my life, sis, practice is on me. Well, thankfully Stephan was willing to listen to the reason Dave and Sloan, you make a pretty good team. Maybe you should, uh, you know, get firm together or something. Then who would represent me when I throw her out the window?\tthought about that. No, there will be no teaming up between me and that awful woman whom I still loa with every fiber of my being. Just wish the hell Eric would stay away from her.\tJohnny, I\u2019m really sorry about lying to you and Wendy about what was going on. Hey, you\u2019re not the first person who\u2019s ever kept a secret from my dad.\tSo you and he are, uh, getting pretty close, huh? Ah, yeah, I guess we are. Does that mean you\u2019re over my uncle?\tI\u2019m getting there.\tI\u2019m certain you don\u2019t approve of all this end fighting father, so whether you like it or not, there is going to be a reckoning between my brother and me.\t"], "answer": [0, 3, 1, 2, 4]}

Because that\u2019s how we\u2019ve done everything since you let me back into your life.\tJack: I love that. I would like nothing better.\tDiane: Good. And\u2026 mm. I do have one more idea.\t[ Sighs ] If she\u2019ll accept, I would like summer to be my matron of honor.\tJack: Summer? You\u2019re certain?\tDiane: Yeah, our family means everything to me, jack, and I want our wedding to reflect that. And since phyllis pulled this horrible stunt, summer\u2019s been\u2013 well, she\u2019s been lost to us. I want her to know that she\u2019s important, that she\u2019s loved, and I want our wedding day to prove that phyllis has no power over our family.\tKyle: If you\u2019re so damn remorseful, and want to make amends, and do the right thing, turn yourself in!\tSummer: Kyle, that isn\u2019t the answer.\tPhyllis: No, it\u2019s okay, summer.

I realize that. I will accept punishment, but please, kyle, no police. No police, not until I clear my name.\tKyle: And there it is. You just made it about saving your own ass.\tSummer: Kyle, please.\tPhyllis: That\u2019s okay. I know I was wrong, and I am so sorry. In a million ways, I am sorry. But that\u2019s why I\u2019m back. To do the right thing, kyle. Just like your mom did. I\u2019m here to take responsibility, and have accountability. And I\u2019m gonna start by admitting that I resented your mother.\tKyle: Oh, that\u2019s an understatement.\tPhyllis: I did. Because she had everything I wanted. She had a family, she had a son who loved her. And my kids wanted nothing to do with me. And I was alone. I was completely alone. And then, jeremy stark started whispering in my ear, and I tried to push him away, but he kept coming back. And I am ashamed to say that I wanted your mother hurt. And so I gave in to jeremy\u2019s plan.\tKyle: So, you\u2019re a victim?\tPhyllis: Yeah. Just like your mom. Because jeremy took advantage of your mom when she was weak and vulnerable, just like he did me. But then, I realized\u2026\t[ Sighs ] \u2026I was in too deep, and the only way to save myself\u2026 was by\u2013 was by hurting jeremy.\tKyle: By killing him.\tPhyllis: Yes. But it wasn\u2019t murder, kyle. It was self-defense.\tKyle: Your word against a dead man\u2019s?\tPhyllis: But it\u2019s true. It was self-defense, and that\u2019s why I need more time. I need to find a way to clear my name. Kyle, please. [ Gasping ] For my family, my life. I mean, it\u2019s in your hands right now. Hey, dad. I got an a on my book report.\tKyle: How do you plan to clear your name? And how do you expect to stay hidden? Because the gcac isn\u2019t exactly in the middle of nowhere.\tPhyllis: Hey, listen, it wasn\u2019t the smartest thing to do, but I couldn\u2019t stay away.

I know that you understand how that feels.\tPhyllis: Hey, um\u2026 let\u2019s look at this, um, rationally.\tKyle: Rational? You?\tPhyllis: You remember when your mother came back, right? Back from the dead? And you were so angry at her. Like you are at me right now. And it took some time, kyle, but you forgave her, and the two of you have built this amazing relationship, and, oh, my gosh, it\u2019s so beautiful to watch. It truly is. And all I\u2019m asking for is just time.\tKyle: No, it\u2019s totally different.\tPhyllis: How\u2019s it different? Uh, well, I mean, your mom was gone for years and years, so, in that sense, yeah, \u2019cause, for me, it\u2019s just been A\u2026 but these are the similarities. Your mother was unhappy and the idea of a brand new life seemed very, very appealing and I completely understand that. But we couldn\u2019t be away from our babies, so we had to come back. And you see, that is the same. You see that, right?\t[ Chuckles ] Kyle, I need time.\tKyle: No.\tPhyllis: I will make this right, I just\u2013\tKyle: No, no, no. Stop. Stop. I watched summer cry herself to sleep. I watched her retreat into her grief to a point I didn\u2019t know if she could ever return. You did that. And then you magically reappear with all your tears and your victimhood and your apologies, and you expect summer to risk it all to help you avoid a punishment you deserve.\tPhyllis: I would never put my daughter in harm\u2019s way.\tKyle: It has already happened. I feel guilty even being in this room. It makes us all complicit. And you don\u2019t even give a damn because all you think about is yourself.\tPhyllis: That\u2019s not true.\tKyle: Hmm?

And I\u2019m going to go and check on faith, but I am not going to alarm her.\tNick: Yeah. It\u2019s probably best. What about the tea, is that too much?\tSharon: I think that\u2019s an excellent idea. Listen, we are not going to freak out about cameron. We can\u2019T. We are going to remain calm and rational.

I know I put a lot of people through pain, and one of those people is your mother, and I am so sorry. Kyle, please believe me. That\u2019s why I\u2019m back. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here. I want to make amends. I want to make things right.\tDiane: [ Sighs ] Love won, jack. We won, because of you. You made this possible. Your love, your compassion, your patience. You let me back into your life when everyone was telling you to run the other way. And I saw you struggle, I saw\u2013 I saw how hard it was for you to trust me, and I\u2013 I just wanted to be worthy of that trust.\tJack: I have never loved you more.\t[ Diane chuckles ] And I couldn\u2019t be more excited about our future.\tDiane: When we were dancing, I was thinking about how I could have never had this kind of day as the person I was before.

Let\u2019s talk about you some more.\tJack: No, I got a better topic. You said earlier you can\u2019t wait to get married.\tDiane: That\u2019s right.\tJack: So, when? When can we be pronounced husband and wife?\tAshley: Diane is unfinished business for me.\tTucker: Mm-hmm.\tAshley: I can\u2019t focus on anything else until I handle that, which is why I need your help.\tTucker: A very wise woman once forced me to become a better man in spite of myself.

He\u2019s definitely here.\tNikki: Oh, no!\tSharon: For a few weeks now I\u2019ve been receiving these mysterious gifts. Um, a champagne bottle that apparently has blood on it, uh, a postcard from denver, colorado, and then a cigar box with a matchbook inside from the southside hotel, and that was delivered here despite security.\tVictor: But have you seen him?\tSharon: Yes. Tonight at the coffeehouse, nick was helping me close up. Mostly he just taunted us and then he left, but the scary thing is, he approached faith when she was in chancellor park and pretended to be an old friend.\tVictor: Have you called the cops?\tNick: Yeah. We brought chance in on this. He, uh\u2013 he told us what cameron\u2019s been up to. Apparently, he got out of prison, moved out to la. He got a new girlfriend, one that looks eerily similar to sharon. He then beat her up, ended up back in prison, did more time, but now he\u2019s out again. Back to playing his old sick mind games.\tSharon: Chance has the police looking for cameron, but so far, nothing.\tNikki: Maybe we should put additional guards at the gate and a patrol around the perimeter?\tVictor: That\u2019ll be done before we get back to the house.

My mom has made huge mistakes. I know. And she\u2019s willing to accept the consequences, but she deserves a fighting chance. Kyle, if we don\u2019t help her find a way to clear her of killing stark, then she\u2019s gonna be at the mercy of christine, and that\u2019s not justice!\tKyle: Maybe she should have thought about the consequences before she framed my mother for murder, killed stark, dragged you into this mess. I will never forgive you for this.\tPhyllis: Kyle, I\u2019m gonna make this right. I swear to you. I swear to you, I\u2019m gonna make this right.

Just like I have been trying with her.\tJack: I know, I know.\tDiane: [ Chuckles ] Okay, so when you asked me to marry you at the cabin, I kind of\u2013 kind of had a little day dream about what our wedding day would look like.\tJack: Uh-huh.\tDiane: And that included having summer accept me as part of her family. And I\u2019m not ready to give up on that. I have my life back, jack, and I want to do what my heart says is right. And that includes being there for summer.\tJack: And I say, by all means, follow your heart.\tDiane: You know what else my heart is saying?\tJack: No, what?\tDiane: That it\u2019s time to go home and make love to my husband-to-be.\tJack: I like that idea. In fact, I wish that had been my idea.\t[ Diane chuckles ]\tAshley: I gotta tell you, it\u2019s kind of strange that you\u2019re so laser-focused on getting married.\tTucker: Hmm.

I am out of circulation.\u201d\tAshley: Oh, that ring really stopped you from circulating before, didn\u2019t it?\tTucker: Yeah, I know. I know what it\u2019s like to lose you now so I\u2019m not gonna let that happen. And when you set the date, I\u2019ll know you\u2019re finally ready to let me into your life, and when you say the vows, they\u2019ll come from your heart, and they will be forever.\tAshley: Hmm. Well, then. You think you know me so well.\tTucker: I do know you so well. You wanna know the kicker? Not only will marrying you be a dream come true for me, but it will give me the legal maneuverability to take over jabot. Totally throw jack and diane off their game. If you had a bladder accident today,\tPhyllis: How you doing? Really?\tDaniel: [ Laughs ] You know, kyle just tore out of here, he might be ready to set a match to your future, and you\u2019re worried about me?\t", "Ashley: Are you not hearing anything I\u2019m saying to you? I\u2019m doing this for the right reason. I want to save my family, and the abbott legacy, which, by the way, used to be jack\u2019s reason for existing until diane hijacked his brain.\tTucker: Do you really believe that diane is after jabot?\tAshley: Yes. She\u2019s not marrying jack because she loves him, she wants access to respectability, to money, to power.\tTucker: And jabot is her ticket?\tAshley: Yes, she will convince jack to give her her position that she\u2019s not qualified for, and she\u2019ll use it to claw her way to the top, which is why I\u2013 you know, as I told you, I spoke to the board.\tTucker: So, your idea is to weaponize the board against jack in order to save jack?\t[ Ashley sighs ] I don\u2019t like that word, \u201cweaponize,\u201d but\u2026\tTucker: Whatever.\tAshley: Yeah, it\u2019s the only way.\tNick: How\u2019s our girl?\tSharon: She\u2019s awake, and, um, on high alert. She\u2019s snuggling with borgnine, I think he makes her feel a little safer. But now that we\u2019re back home, she\u2019s gonna try to get some sleep.\tNick: This is crazy. It makes me want to hunt down this creep and run him out of town myself.\tSharon: Nick.\tNick: I know, I know. Calm and reasonable.\t[ Sighs ] Calm and reasonable, but it is getting harder and harder to be rational about this. This madman is on the loose. We don\u2019t know why he\u2019s here or what he\u2019s planning on doing.\tSharon: Maybe, it\u2019s time we let victor and nikki know what\u2019s happening. Why give your family just any eggs\tNick: I\u2019ve already alerted ranch security. If we bring my dad in on this, it\u2019s gonna turn into a whole different situation, and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for that.\tSharon: Well\u2026 your dad does have resources that we don\u2019t have access to.\tNick: I know, but if we ask for his help, he\u2019s gonna want something in return.\tSharon: Well, his family is in danger. He would do whatever it takes to protect them.\tNick: He absolutely will, but I\u2019m telling you, he will use it as leverage to get something he wants from me, like\u2026 make me work with adam at mccall, which he\u2019s already tried to do and it\u2019s never gonna happen.\tSharon: Oh, I think you\u2019re overreacting.\tNick: [ Sighs ] Am I? He hates my relationship with sally. We already have the police on this, sharon.\tSharon: Well, you said yourself, they\u2019ve come up with nothing on cameron so far.\tNick: I do hate the waiting.\tSharon: Yeah, I know. You\u2019re horrible at it. Nick. If you take matters into your own hands, I don\u2019t know if we will be so lucky as we were last time. It\u2019s a miracle that we\u2019re actually still here after what went down in that plane.\tNick: I know.\tSharon: We should have worked with victor from the start last time, instead of waiting until I was framed for frank\u2019s murder. This time, we know who cameron is, we know what he\u2019s capable of, and we need to be reaching out for all the support we can get. We need your father.\tTucker: If I\u2019m gonna ride shotgun on this thing, we need to analyze every angle.\tAshley: Mm-hmm.\tTucker: Like, when things don\u2019t go according to plan. \u2018Cause jack, if nothing else, is beloved by all. Yes, he is.\tAshley: Mm.\tTucker: And it\u2019s gonna take real artistry to convince the board that he\u2019s unfit. And billy\u2019s on his side. And traci, well, she just wants to get along with everyone. What about kyle? I don\u2019t see us getting his vote. And do you want to bring abby through the ringer?\tAshley: Okay, okay, you\u2019re right. I know, there\u2019s parts of this plan that require some serious finessing, but nobody finesses better than you. Right?\tTucker: Mm-hmm. But if you\u2013 if you come at the king and you miss\u2026 jack would be lionized, he\u2019d be untouchable, and diane would be right there with him. And you would\u2019ve lost your family in the process.\tAshley: I\u2019m not going to fail. Period. It won\u2019t happen.\tTucker: Mm-hmm.\tAshley: And then, diane will lose, you know, her access to respectability, power, and money, and she will lose interest in jack. And she\u2019ll move on to the next jeremy stark, and jack will be sadder, but he\u2019ll be wiser.\tTucker: Thanks to you.\tAshley: Yes. Thanks to me.

Before we set an actual date, there\u2019s just a few details I wanna run by you.\tJack: Okay, but I pre-agree to almost everything.\tDiane: [ Chuckles ] Good idea. Okay, I\u2019d like it to be small, yet elegant. After our big announcement at the gala, I\u2019m a little gun shy about grand gestures.\tJack: Understandably.

But you were. You were there. You were there at your memorial and you saw me in pain, you saw me grieving, and you just\u2013 you just let me feel that.\tPhyllis: [ Sighs ] Um\u2026 I did. And I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m lucky you\u2019re talking to me. I know that. And I know I put you through pain\u2013 it kills me. But I\u2019ll let you talk about it as long as you want, even if it takes years.\tDaniel: You know I love you, mom. And I\u2019m so glad that you\u2019re back, but forgiving you?

You were rational. Might sound crazy, but it\u2019s almost as if you were more surprised to see me than phyllis.\tSummer: That does sound crazy.\tKyle: Yeah?

She wouldn\u2019t budge. When I asked her to sleep up at the main house tonight, she said nobody is going to scare her out of her own home.\tNick: That\u2019s my girl. As stubborn as her grandpa.\tNikki: Well, I guess if a guard is here, I can live with that.\tVictor: Yes. It\u2019s all taken care of, okay?\tSharon: Thank you so much, victor. I really do feel a lot better just knowing that we are actively doing something to protect faith and to find cameron.\tVictor: Sharon, I want you and faith to get some sleep now.

I just can\u2019t do it in a prison cell. I can\u2019t go to prison. Daniel, I can\u2019t go. I can\u2019t go. But I am done running.

But I have a feeling everything will work out for phyllis. She\u2019ll come back, she\u2019ll get the support she needs for whatever\u2019s ahead, and she should. For you and daniel.

Hold on. So when dr. Obrecht didn\u2019t reappear in the magic act, that-\tthat was real? She disappeared?\tIt looks like someone kidnapped her. Sonny sent dex to go check, and he found this charm that looks like it belonged to a bracelet, and they know it belonged to britt, and they found it in the crawlspace beneath the stage.\tGod. Actually, I need to talk to you about dex.\tSonny told me that he knows about you two.\tYeah, he\u2013he caught us, and he told us that he\u2019s known about it for months and that he was just disappointed in dex for lying to him. I mean, thank god dex saved his life.\tWhat are you talking about? What do you mean, dex saved his life? When?\tThey\u2013they were both in a warehouse, and someone was taking shots at sonny, and dex stepped in, and he saved him. He\u2013he got grazed on the arm, but-\tI knew he was injured, but you didn\u2019t tell me he was shot. Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\tI didn\u2019t even know he was shot until the day after.

And believe me, I\u2019m gonna be more than thrilled when this whole thing is over, but right now, spencer, his little brother, and dr. Obrecht are all missing. And if dr.

Sorry, baby.\tWillow, we know that you and michael are being strong for each other.\tEveryone needs to vent sometimes, even you. So whatever you\u2019re feeling, just say it.\t[Sighs] I know that michael believes that everything is going to be ok, because that\u2019s what he has to believe.

She coded in the ambulance.\tFortunately, the team was able to get her heart back to sinus rhythm and complete the surgery.\tHow long do you think it\u2019ll take before she wakes up?\tThere\u2019s no way to predict. She was under a long time.\tSo she should be awake right now? She isn\u2019T.\tHow are you doing?\tMm. To be honest, I feel really uneasy. Just unsettled, you know? It\u2019s like everything that\u2019s happening right now is strangely familiar.\tLike a d\u00e9j vu?\tIt\u2019s more than that.

Only back then, it was called the \u201ctitan.\u201d Is history repeating itself with my grandsons?\tWell, I had an extremely strained conversation-\tno, no, no, I wouldn\u2019t even call it a conversation-\ta moment with trina at the nurses\u2019 ball.\tOk. And after that?\tI stopped by her dorm room to talk and check on her, but she wasn\u2019t there, and she never showed up.\tSo she didn\u2019t call or leave a text saying why she wasn\u2019t gonna be there?\tNo, no, but she had no idea that I was going to be there. And it\u2019s not like she\u2019s calling or texting me that much nowadays anyway. Curtis, why? Why all the questions? What\u2019s going on?\tI know it\u2019s probably nothing-\tyeah, you keep saying that, but it\u2019s clearly something.\tYou can\u2019t ask me all these questions about trina and not expect me to ask why.\tI don\u2019t want to worry you.\tIt\u2019s too late for that.\tI texted trina last night that her mom was here, so maybe that\u2019s why she never came back. Let me check something.\tLook, I don\u2019t mean to worry either of you. There\u2019s really no reason to believe that trina is in any danger, ok?\tWell, you showing up here looking for trina isn\u2019t really giving off that vibe.\tDante, look at these texts.\tIt says they weren\u2019t delivered.\tYeah, I know.\tCan I call her?\tYeah, you can.

I know-\tthat\u2019s why\u2013now, michael, as we all know, is quite the multitasker. So he can believe with all his heart that dr. Obrecht will get back in time, so that you can have this transplant that you need for a long, long life, and at the same time, understand that you need to-\tthat you need to tell him and wiley and amelia how much you love them, how much you will always love them.\tEven if I\u2019m gone?\tOk.

But come in.\tOk.\tWhat\u2019s going on, dante?\tWell, we\u2019re looking for spencer, actually.\tSpencer? I thought that victor cassadine had spencer and his little brother.\tWell, we don\u2019t know that he\u2019s got spencer. But trina and spencer were together at the ball. They probably hung out after the ball. So I\u2019m wondering, maybe she could help us, give us a timeline of his whereabouts.\tI haven\u2019t seen trina since the ball.\tBut she was staying here at the dorms, right?\tWell, yeah. She was supposed to come back here. We were gonna go to a party together, but I\u2013I remember she was worried about spencer, so she went to check on him and see if she could help him out with anything.\tAh.\tYou haven\u2019t seen her since?\tNo, but her mom came by here yesterday looking for her, but like I said, she wasn\u2019t here.\tSo no one\u2019s seen trina since the ball?\tNot that I know of.\tSo you\u2019ve been enjoying the sea air?\tI wouldn\u2019t know. I\u2019ve been locked up in this stateroom.\tYes. Unfortunate but necessary precaution, till you realize that everything I\u2019ve done has been for your own good.\t[Laughs] That\u2019s why you\u2019ve kidnapped me and my brother? For our own good?\tOh, spencer. I didn\u2019t kidnap you. I invited you here, and you accepted.\tNo, you asked me to join you on your ship, and then when I did, you stole the boat out of the harbor without asking me if I wanted to come.\tI am the head of this family. I don\u2019t need to ask anyone anything. And besides, even if I\u2019d given you the choice, the outcome would have been the same. You want to be where your brother is. I need your brother to be with me. So here we all are.\tIf the point of bringing me along was to make sure that I could spend some time with my brother, how about you let me see him?\tOk, in good time.\tListen to me. I do not work for you, and I sure as hell don\u2019t take orders from you.\tI suggest you change that attitude. My son knows what I\u2019m capable of when crossed. I\u2019d hope for you not to have to learn the same lesson the hard way.\t[Devices beeping]\tGladys set you up?\tYes.\t[Sighs] God, she is a piece of work.\tSo you believe me?\tI mean, I just-\tI\u2013I wouldn\u2019t put it past her. But why?\tUh, ok. I\u2013I told gladys that I was going to tell sasha that she-\tgladys-\twas not to be trusted.\tOk, what did gladys do that you needed to warn sasha?\tI can\u2019t tell you that.\tWhy not?\tBecause I like my kneecaps exactly where they are, you know? They help me to walk, kneel, stay on a horse.\tOh, ok. I get it. You\u2019re being threatened.\tNo, I\u2019m not the one being threatened. Let\u2019s just say that sasha needs to be really careful about whose hands she puts her life in.\tOf course, you don\u2019t want to wait to marry michael. This is your family. You want them to know forever and ever how much you love them.\tAnd the best part is, you don\u2019t have to do a thing. We will make sure this wedding happens.\tThank you both so much. But I haven\u2019t even discussed re-rescheduling the wedding with michael.\t[Sighs] I know he would have married me at the hospital months ago. I was the one who insisted on coming home. We were going to be married at the main house. Then we found out dr. Obrecht was a match. I told him I wanted to wait until after the transplant, to dance at my wedding, to really celebrate, and, of course, he agreed. He always wants to give me whatever I want. And now I\u2019ve changed my mind yet again. I want to get married immediately. Isn\u2019t that the same as telling him I\u2019ve given up hope?\t[Soft dramatic music]\tMay I speak to her surgeon?\tThe procedure was very long, so she\u2019s not available for several hours.\tWell, is there anybody else I can talk to?\tThe doctor did instruct me to inform you that she was able to remove the bullet. It missed the major organs and arteries. However, ms. Devane lost a considerable amount of blood. About an hour into surgery, she went into cardiac arrest.\t", "Come on, dante. Where else could she be? She\u2019s not just gonna disappear.\tJoss, I-\tI don\u2019t know what to tell you, other than you\u2019ll know something when I know something, ok? In the meantime, keep your phone on. And if you do hear from her, please let me know.\tI mean, what if she was with spencer when victor grabbed him?\tJordan. Hey, uh, no sign of trina.\tDo you have anything else? Any physical evidence to connect her to spencer or victor\u2019s disappearance?\tNo. Nothing yet. I\u2019m going to go talk to portia. I\u2019m gonna head to the hospital now.\tI\u2019ll meet you there.\tAs it turns out, spencer went missing last night, along with his little brother. And since trina was with him at the ball, she may have been the last person to see him.\tOk. I need to call trina.\tIt\u2019s going straight to voicemail. Maybe she has her phone off. Trina? Honey, it\u2019s mom. I\u2013I just want to check and see if you\u2019re ok, all right? So give me a call. She\u2019s not gonna listen to that. I\u2019m gonna text her, too.\tI\u2019ll call the university, have them do a safety check.\tCurtis, the texts, they\u2019re not-\tthey\u2019re not going through. They\u2019re going as not delivered.\t[Tense music] What do I do now? I can\u2019t-\tI can\u2019t reach my daughter?\tI have this feeling that the answer to all of this lies in the past, you know? Like, some part of my history that I haven\u2019t been able to connect with yet.\tWell, let\u2019s break it down. Victor finally has everything he\u2019s after. He\u2019s got the ice princess necklace, the decryption key. He\u2019s got spencer and ace. Where would he go?\tI don\u2019t know. Some place that\u2019s isolated where he could protect himself, I guess, if someone were to come after him.\tSo if someone did come after him-\tI guess it would have to be a place where he has some kind of pull with the authorities.\tExactly. So thoughts?\tUh, I don\u2019t know. A lot of the old cassadine haunts come to mind. They\u2019re all pretty similar, you know? They\u2019re fortresses and compounds and islands. They\u2019re places where victor could go and just do whatever he wanted.\tThink, where would the \u201chaunted star\u201d sail?\tI know that the cassadines had some hideouts in, I think, uh, panama, ecuador.\tThere was one on the coast of venezuela, and that one was completely isolated because it was cut off from everything by miles and miles of tropical rainforest. In fact, you couldn\u2019t even get to it, except by boat.\tThat could be it. We might have a lead.\tAll right, spencer. Tell me, what might you do?\tAnything, if it meant being free. Wouldn\u2019t you feel the same in my position?\tYou make a good point. But spencer, freedom is not a right. Freedom must be earned.\tAll I\u2019m asking is to have breakfast in the dining room and to see my little brother and to not have a deadbolt on the outside of my door.\tWell, I don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s any harm in you getting a little air and nourishment. But that\u2019s only because we\u2019re in the middle of the ocean.\tBelieve me, the sweet release of drowning is not the freedom that I long for.\tHmm. Very well. We will breakfast in the dining room. It\u2019ll take a few moments to make arrangements. Can you bear your confinement a little longer?\tOh, I\u2019ll survive. I always do.\tI\u2019ll send for you shortly.\tIf I find this deadbolt unlatched again, you\u2019re gonna find yourself in some very deep, cold water, attached to a very heavy weight.\tYou ok? All right?\tYeah. You were right. We are so trapped here.\t[Laughs] No, we\u2019re not. No, we\u2019re not. My uncle victor thinks that he has me all figured out, but he just made a terrible mistake.\tI can\u2019t reach my daughter, curtis.\tPortia, trina is one of the most practical, level-headed young people we know.\tYeah, except when it comes to spencer cassadine though. That\u2019s the problem.\tHey, maybe-\tmaybe her phone is dead.\tThat would explain the voicemail, but not the texts going through.\tOk. Maybe it\u2019s just out of range.\t[Tense music]\tNo. No. No, no, no. Not trina. No.\t[Breathes sharply]\t[Soft dramatic music]\tI always knew cody bell couldn\u2019t be trusted. I bet he\u2019s done time behind bars before.\tHmm. Yeah, maybe he has. But not today. He\u2019ll make bail.\tWait, what? Are you going to-\tyou bought his act? Are you nuts?\t[Door clicks]\t[Tense music]\tLook at it this way, what you really want is a celebration.\tThat really is all you\u2019re asking for.\tYeah, so my best advice is just rip off the band-aid, ok? Because you really can tell michael anything.\tBrook lynn is right. Michael will understand.\tUnderstand what?\t[Soft dramatic music]\tWhat we have is a theory with no real evidence to back it up. We can\u2019t show that to the authorities.\tSo we have to find something.\tYes, but how? I mean, come on. We\u2019re not gonna be able to infiltrate that compound. Venezuela is a very different country now. It\u2019s tough to get into-\tand more importantly, tough to get out of.\tNot to worry. I know exactly who can help us.\tTrina is important to spencer.\tYep, and victor would use trina as leverage against spencer.\tIn a heartbeat. But why would he have to do that? Spencer will do anything that victor tells him to do.\tOk, well, maybe he doesn\u2019t have her then.\tThen where is she?\tI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. But I do know that dante has the entire port charles police department searching for her. So at the very least, wherever she is, maybe she\u2019s not alone.\tOk. You ready?\tYeah. Let\u2019s just go over it one more time anyway.\tOk. I\u2019m gonna cause a diversion with my uncle, and that\u2019s gonna draw attention away from the deck.\tWhich will enable me to go to the communication office and radio for help.\tThat\u2019s right.\tAnd spencer-\toh my god, this-\tthis better-\tit\u2019s gonna be epic. The diversion is gonna be epic, ok? You don\u2019t have to worry. Baby, I got plenty of practice causing a scene.\t[Both chuckle] In case I don\u2019t get another chance to tell you this, I, um-\tI want you to know that you are the best thing that has ever happened-\t[Dramatic music]\tThis is not the end for us. We got this.\tI\u2019ve been negotiating\u2026\t[Devices beeping] Maybe with god, fate, the universe. I don\u2019t know, maybe with myself. But, uh, I\u2019ve been making a lot of promises in my head, and one promise I can make you\u2026 my father will pay for this. I promise you that no matter what it takes, I\u2019ll bring my father down.\t[Tense music] But right now, I need you to wake up, darling.\t[Somber music]\tI just want you to wake up.\t[Sobbing quietly]\t", "[Somber music]\tDid you call a lawyer?\tI can\u2019t afford to hire one. Public defender is just gonna try and get me to plead out, which I\u2019m not gonna do because I\u2019m innocent.\tWell, the evidence says otherwise.\tDante, come on. You know me. Even if I did try and steal that bracelet, you really think I\u2019d try and hide it in my jacket pocket?\tLook man, I don\u2019t know. But the thing is, I got three missing people. I just-\tI don\u2019t have time to help you.\tYeah, I hear you. I really do. But, look, I\u2019m gonna sort this mess out myself, ok?\tHow? From inside a jail cell? Why don\u2019t-\twhy don\u2019t you call mac?\t[Laughs] He\u2019s the one who arrested me.\tWell, maybe you should have told him to look for his son.\tAnd then\u2013and then what? He\u2019d have the pleasure of putting his son in the slammer?\tNo-\tdude, it doesn\u2019t really matter, ok? I\u2013I already made my one phone call. Help\u2019s on the way.\t[Tense music]\tGood morning.\tHow are we going to escape? We\u2019re at sea, and we have no way of communicating with anybody.\tMaybe we do, ok? I\u2013I was in the utility closet, and there was all these maps of the ship. So I got to studying\u2026\tof course you did.\tAnd it showed the communications room on the map, located at the front of the ship.\tThe bow?\tYeah, whatever. So I snuck out, and I did some snooping, and I managed to find the room. There has to be a radio there, right?\tYou didn\u2019t check and see?\tNo. There was somebody coming, so I had to get out of there as soon as I could, but if there is a radio, I can-\tI can call for help.\tWell, you\u2019d have to find a way to sneak back into that room without someone noticing you. And trina, if my uncle finds you, do you have any idea what he will do to you? He doesn\u2019t need you as a hostage. He\u2019ll throw you overboard.\tIt\u2019s our only option.\t[Sighs] So this is the plan.\t[Suspenseful music]\tSo I stayed in the closet until around 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning. I figured victor would only have a skeleton crew on lookout, and I was right. He only had two on the left-\tport side.\tUh-huh. And then three on the other side. There\u2019s basically zero visibility of the communications room if they all go on their smoke break at the same time.\tOk. That\u2019s how you found it. How are you gonna get back?\tI\u2019ll stay out of sight until-\tuntil tonight. And then I\u2019ll make a break for the office and then radio for help.\tI\u2019m sure my nephew\twill come around soon.\tWe just have to make sure.\tHide.\tWhere?\tWe finally, finally get a donor, and\u2013and she\u2019s gone?\tI know, and it\u2019s crazy. I can\u2019t believe victor took them all, all three. He took spencer, the baby, and obrecht. And I know the police are gonna follow every lead, and they\u2019re gonna talk to every witness, but, god, I pray they find her.\tHow long is that gonna take? Because willow gets weaker every time I see her. It\u2019s like with oscar, you know? You\u2013you try to stay positive, and you-\tyou pray for a miracle. But what if that miracle never comes?\t[Somber music]\tI know.\tExcuse me, commissioner.\tIf you will have a seat over there.\tOk, I-\tI am sure whatever everybody\u2019s buzzing about around here is important, but I\u2019m here about a very expensive bracelet.\tSomeone will take your statement. But we\u2019re very busy, so it might be a while. Perhaps you should come back later.\tAren\u2019t cops supposed to take statements from the victims while the details are fresh? Who knows what I might forget about cody\u2019s crime.\tWhat are you doing here?\tCody called me.\tHmm.\tHe said that he had no one to turn to.\tI didn\u2019t sound that desperate.\tNo, those were your exact words, actually.\tYeah, but I don\u2019t think you accurately captured my tone.\tWell, I\u2019m here. So how can I help?\tMaybe you could convince him to hire a cheap lawyer.\tI believe she was asking me what I needed.\tI believe you have the right to remain silent. Maybe you can help him out with that?\tHey, why don\u2019t you do me a favor? I\u2019ve got this. Please go out and find victor and those hostages.\tYes, ma\u2019am. Bye-bye.\tThank you for coming, sam.\tYeah. So how can I help?\tI need you to bail me out.\tI can\u2019t just post bail. You have to see a judge first.\tNo, no, I know. I\u2019ve been arraigned before. But I promise I\u2019m good for the bail money. I won\u2019t go anywhere.\tSays the guy with the hot bracelet?\tOk. That was a frame, sam. I don\u2019t care what you\u2019ve heard. I\u2019m being set up.\tSaid every thief ever. Hell, I\u2019ve even said it, I don\u2019t know how many times, and I was guilty every single one of them.\tOk, well, allow me to be the exception that proves the rule. Someone planted that bracelet on me.\tAnd that is when sasha noticed the bracelet was missing.\tAnything?\tNothing. It\u2019s as though victor, the ship, and the hostages all vanished into thin air.\tYou know what? I think I know someone who might be able to help us.\t[Soft dramatic music]\tThis is a private conversation. This doesn\u2019t concern you.\tIt does when it concerns my wife. Now show some respect.\tLet me, um-\tlet me see what I can find out.\tThank you.\tI want you to keep a close eye on spence-\t[Tense music]\tAmbrose, search the ship.\tOh. Hello, uncle. Is something wrong?\tShe found it.\tI am holding on to hope. But at the same time-\tin my experience, blind hope can get in the way of saying goodbye.\tExactly.

She was trying to get away from him and she can\u2019t come back to us because then she would be arrested for his murder.\tDaniel: If it was self-defense, why wouldn\u2019t she come back and explain everything?\tSummer: Because who would believe her? Who would believe her? She would be the one in jail right now for murder instead of diane. Daniel, we have to do something. I don\u2019t know\u2013 I don\u2019t know what, but we have to do something. We can\u2019t just let our mom slip away from us forever.\tMichael: That\u2019s not at all the way it happened. I didn\u2019t just deliberately take diane\u2019s case to go against your wishes.\tLauren: Then why did you?\tMichael: It was victor and nikki\u2019s rush to judgment. They had diane tried and convicted without any awareness of the facts. They didn\u2019t just suspect diane was to blame for phyllis\u2019s murder, they knew it.\tLauren: So, who cares what victor and nikki think, right?\tMichael: That\u2019s when I realized that\u2019s just the kind of jury that diane\u2019s gonna go up against in court. A bunch of biased people who have already made up their mind. Everybody deserves legal representation. Guilty or innocent and they deserve an attorney who works to make sure that the system is\u2013 that the system works fairly for everybody.\tLauren: Well, I can\u2019t argue with that.\tMichael: Exactly.\tLauren: But there are other top attorneys that could have defended her. Lawyers with no emotional ties.\tMichael: I think I\u2019m a good attorney because of my emotional ties and you are partially to blame for that. It is why I\u2019m passionate about what I do.\tLauren: Not this time.

You don\u2019t honestly think that I am defending a woman who cost phyllis her life?\tLauren: I do. Christine is sure that she is to blame and chance is damn good at his job. Do you remember when diane was cuffed and hauled out of here and she begged you to represent her and you refused, as you should? That was your gut telling you, you should not give that woman the benefit of the doubt.\tMichael: You\u2019re right. You\u2019re right. How could I not? I was reeling. We all were. We had just found out that phyllis had been poisoned.\tLauren: And after jack pleaded with you personally, you still refused. What superseded your reluctance? Your enormous ego?\tMichael: How could you even say that?\tLauren: Because I remember you telling me that victor and nikki were giving you a hard time for even thinking about defending diane. So what was this, the ultimate pushback to prove that you can make your own decisions?\tMichael: You hold on now. That is a gross oversimplification. I would not just blithely sacrifice my job with victor because my fragile and enormous ego was bruised.\tLauren: Then tell me. Tell me what it was? Because it certainly seems that your desire to prove a point was more important than everything, including my feelings.

Brooding, perhaps.\tTucker: Why would you go there?\tAshley: Because the tucker mccall I know doesn\u2019t handle being at loose ends well.

I wouldn\u2019t be able to live with myself if I knew I had let phyllis\u2019s murderer walk. But I truly believe diane\u2019s telling the truth. Look, I\u2019ve known a lot of bald faced liars in my life, yeah. And I have developed excellent radar for the art of lying and diane is telling the truth. She believes she\u2019s innocent. That\u2019s why, to her, the only logical conclusion is that she was set up. Unfortunately, the man to blame for that will never pay for his crime.\tLauren: And if jeremy stark is at fault, then why the hell would he be allowed to get away with that?\tMichael: Because his body just washed up on a shore of a nearby lake.\tLauren: What?\tMichael: I\u2019m afraid so. And now I\u2019m left with more questions than before. You can\u2019t get answers from a dead man. The fact that I can\u2019t call jeremy stark to the stand makes it a hell of a lot harder to keep diane out of prison. But I\u2019m not gonna let that happen because that means stark would win, even from the grave.\tBilly: You okay?\tJack: Yeah, I\u2013 I\u2013 I will be, eventually. It may take some time for me to grasp that I will never see phyllis again. Still longer to accept that\u2013 that long beautiful story ended in so much anger and resentment.\tBilly: I know it\u2019s difficult jack, but I think it\u2019s important that you acknowledge what she meant to you in your life.\tJack: You were right. When did you get so wise? You were spot on. I needed to look back before I could begin to look forward.\tBilly: I\u2019m glad I could be of service.\tJack: You were wrong on one front.\tBilly: Oh?\tJack: I am more determined, more eager than ever to marry diane and not as a diversion from mourning over phyllis. As an acknowledgment that life is short. Life is fragile. Life is too precious to waste another minute. I can\u2019t let her shut me out. I can\u2019t lose her, not now.\t[ Summer sighing ]\tSummer: I know that you feel like you\u2019ve got to do the big brother thing and protect me, but I\u2013 it\u2019s not what I need.\tDaniel: I don\u2019t\u2013 I don\u2019t see it like that. I am not trying to be your big brother. I just think that we need to look out for each other right now.\tSummer: But you\u2019re looking at me like I\u2019m crazy. I haven\u2019t had a psychotic break with reality. I promise you that.\tDaniel: But what you\u2019re telling me\u2013\tSummer: I know! I know that it sounds impossible. I mean, what do I have to do to prove it to you? I mean, do you need\u2013 do you need to see mom with your own two eyes? Could I have her call you or something?\t", "Daniel: Call me? Are you making plans to see mom again, summer?\tSummer: No. No, I don\u2019t have plans to see mom again, but I know that I\u2019m going to, and you will too. I don\u2019t know when, I don\u2019t know where but she\u2019s gonna come back.\tDaniel: I wanna believe you, summer. I wanna believe you more than anything, but it\u2019s not gonna happen. She\u2019s gone. Mom is gone, she\u2019s gone! New vibrant from air wick.\tDaniel: Summer, I am sorry. I am not trying to be dismissive and the last thing I want to do right now is hurt you.\tSummer: This isn\u2019t about my feelings. This is about the truth. I talked to her. She told me what happened.\tDaniel: Okay. Okay, let\u2019s play this out. We take this story to christine and to chance, okay? We tell them that diane\u2019s innocent, stark, he\u2019s guilty and he\u2019s murdered by the hand of mom, who somehow miraculously is still alive. What then, huh? What do you think\u2019s gonna happen? They\u2019re either gonna react the same way I did or they\u2019re gonna pursue it. Now if they pursue it, we\u2019ve got two possible outcomes. They hit a brick wall, we wind up right back where we started\u2013\tSummer: Or they find her. And they bring her home to us.\tDaniel: But if they find her, highly unlikely. But say that they find her, what do you think is gonna happen? They\u2019re gonna arrest her, they\u2019re gonna charge her with murder. They\u2019re gonna put her on trial and then diane\u2019s gonna be set free, mom\u2019s gonna be locked up in jail.\tSummer: So you\u2019re saying there\u2019s nothing we can do?\tLauren: I don\u2019t doubt that stark played a part in what happened to phyllis. I mean, that sudden ludicrous marriage? That raised all sorts of suspicions in me. But he\u2019s just a low-life criminal and I will not shed a tear for him.\tMichael: But?\tLauren: But even if he\u2019s guilty, that does not make diane blameless. You and I both know diane\u2019s hatred of phyllis was real. So, no, I will not share in your belief in her.\tMichael: You don\u2019t have to believe in diane. You just have to believe in me. I would never betray you and phyllis that way. You are two of the strongest, most resilient, most determined women I have ever met. That\u2019s why I\u2019m doing this. Seeking justice for diane and phyllis. They both deserve to have the true story told. I believe what I\u2019m doing is right and decent. Why can\u2019t you have faith in me?\tAshley: Cheers.\tTucker: Cheers.\tAshley: When you sold mccall, it was a very big deal.\tTucker: Yeah.\tAshley: Right. I mean, the company is a part of you, body and soul. I\u2019m sure you could look at it, no matter what was going on in your life. You could say, \u201cI built that, that\u2019s my legacy.\u201d It gave you a sense of purpose, success.\tTucker: Yeah, it did. Nobody can take that away from me.\tAshley: That\u2019s true. And your whole identity was kind of tied up in mccall so that when you sold it to victor, I mean, you kind of have to figure out who you are now. Look, I\u2019m just a little concerned that if you don\u2019t have a plan, you\u2019re gonna end up regretting your decision.\tTucker: No, no, no, no, I\u2019m letting go of the past, fully. The future feels wide open, I\u2019m kind of excited about it. And it\u2019s not as if I\u2019m out here wandering aimlessly.\tAshley: Okay. So what\u2019s your plan?\tTucker: Okay, here\u2019s the plan. Are you ready?\tAshley mm-hmm.\tTucker: I\u2019ve got some unfinished business here in genoa city. I\u2019ve got some refocused priorities.\tAshley: Like?\tTucker: Like devon for one. Rebuilding his trust, getting to know my grandson a little better.\tAshley: Yes.\tTucker: And then there\u2019s ashley.\tAshley: Of course.\tTucker: Yeah. Making myself irresistible to her. That\u2019s gonna be a full-time job.\tAshley: Yes.\tTucker: Hm. I\u2019m gonna have to wine and dine her all over the world.\tAshley: Yes.\tTucker: Ply her with my unique brand of charm, which no woman in the world can resist.\tAshley: Hm. Well, that sounds very exciting.\tTucker: Yes, you should meet her.\tAshley: But I think that you might have to have something else in mind besides that.\tTucker: No, no, no. I\u2019m planning on seducing her 24/7. I\u2019m just gonna have to take some breaks for sustenance, but\u2026 beyond\u2013\t[ Door opening ]\t[ Door shutting ] Just between us, you know what\u2019s better than mopping?\tTucker: Jack, hello.\tAshley: Tucker\u2019s my guest, jack, and you should probably get used to seeing him more often around here.\tJack: And why would that be?\tAshley: Because I asked him to move in.\tJack: Tucker?\tAshley: Yes. Tucker. You keep telling me that your personal life is none of my concern, so I figured it must work both ways.\tTucker: That went well.\tLauren: I do have faith in you. That will never change. But even if diane doesn\u2019t have blood on her hands, I will never see her as innocent because she made phyllis\u2019s last months a living nightmare. And I know\u2013 I know phyllis brought a lot of that on herself, but she paid too dearly. Because of diane, phyllis left us way too soon. You know what? You\u2019re right. We shouldn\u2019t be here. This is just too painful.\tDaniel: I feel just as lost as you do. And honestly, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a single thing that either one of us can do to fix it. I promise you, we will get through this together. You and me because that\u2019s what mom would want.\tSummer: She would, wouldn\u2019t she?\tDaniel: Yeah, she would.\t[ Summer exhaling ] Come on, I\u2019ll walk you home.\tSummer: I just need one more minute.\tPhyllis: Whatever you decide, I love you. I\u2019ll never stop loving you. Okay? Uh, I have to go.\tSummer: I\u2019m gonna miss her so much.\tDaniel: Me too.\t[ Summer exhaling ]\tDaniel: Ready?\tJack: Next week on the young and the restless\u2026 morning.\tTucker: Coffee?\t", "Billy: So you asked diane to marry you, right then and there? And she didn\u2019t give you an answer?\tJack: Nope. I\u2019m not sure why. I thought that offering to marry her now would make her see that my faith in her is unshakeable. That I could make her see that I deeply believe she was coming home. That any day now, we could start to rebuild this new chapter in our lives that\u2013 that we dreamed about.\tBilly: Yeah. Well, you know, jack, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m sure she\u2019s scared, you know, and overwhelmed. I\u2019m not surprised that she put the brakes on. She\u2019s trying to get through her life right now, hour by hour.\tJack: I know\u2013 I know all that. That\u2019s why I\u2019m doing everything I can to give her some sense of comfort.\tBilly: Yeah, I know. I\u2019m sure she appreciates that, but I can\u2019t imagine she was prepared for you to show up and say, \u201clet\u2019s get hitched right now\u201d, you know. As much as she loves you, and she does love you, that is pretty impulsive.\tJack: Yeah, I will admit to that.\tBilly: Look, maybe she\u2019s thinking that there\u2019s more to this than you asking her to marry you.\tJack: Meaning what?\tBilly: I think it\u2019s pretty clear that you think things are spinning out of control right now and maybe this is your attempt to desperately find something that you can control.\tJack: Billy, the last thing I need right now is you analyzing me. My suggestion did not come out of the blue. We are engaged. I fully intend to spend the rest of my life with her. I was simply moving up the timetable.\tBilly: Why don\u2019t you just slow down a little bit, okay? This isn\u2019t something you can outrun, jack.\tJack: What are you talking about? What am I trying to outrun?\tBilly: Not that long ago, you were ready to spend the rest of your life with someone else. Someone that you loved deeply. You called her red, and now she\u2019s gone and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve even begun to mourn that loss yet.\tDaniel: You are overwhelmed and emotional and I think I know what\u2019s going on. I haven\u2019t told anyone this, but I see mom too. I see her all the time. Someone walking by me on the street and\u2013 and my heart, it skips a beep.\tSummer: This wasn\u2019t like that, daniel. This was real.\tDaniel: I know that it seems that way. I mean, those fleeting moments, they\u2013 they feel real to me too. But our mind, it plays tricks on us, especially in a stressful situation like this. And I think that\u2019s why mom, she comes to me in my dreams and you know, when I\u2019m alone, sometimes I find myself talking to her. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just my way of trying to hold on to her, I guess. Trying to still feel close and connected with her. I just keep thinking about the way she died and going over and over all the unanswered questions.\tSummer: What if I had answers to those questions? Moderate to severe eczema\tJack: Once again, you have misconstrued things. My desire to marry diane is quite separate from my need to mourn phyllis.\tBilly: With all due respect, I\u2013 I disagree, jack. It seems like to me, you\u2019re avoiding your pain and your grief by simply focusing on your future with diane.\tJack: Believe me, I have grieved. I poured my heart out at that memorial service. I am not in denial.\tBilly: I\u2019m not saying you are, but what I am saying is that you\u2019re not really allowing yourself to understand what\u2019s going on inside of you. I mean, everything has been moving at warp speed since that gala. I\u2019m sure you haven\u2019t had a second to even take a breath.\tJack: God, that is the truth. That party was so chaotic and the chaos hasn\u2019t stopped since.\tBilly: No, it\u2019s been a nonstop nightmare.\tJack: No sooner were we passed the trauma of phyllis\u2019s memorial service, and diane was arrested.\tBilly: And you\u2019re gonna do what you do, you\u2019re gonna make sure everyone else is okay. From diane and kyle to daniel and summer, without taking a second for yourself.\tJack: Yeah, I suppose part of that might be true.\tBilly: You know what? You and phyllis, you weren\u2019t in the best place when she died and I would imagine that would make her loss even harder. Jack, I think you gotta allow yourself to acknowledge who phyllis was to you. How much she meant to you. You two had a rich, deep history and you got to allow yourself the time to grieve that.\tSummer: What I know now is that\u2026 everything that we believe to be true is a lie. Mom\u2019s not dead.\t[ Daniel sighing ]\tDaniel: Summer, I know that you really want to believe that mom\u2019s not dead. I do too.\tSummer: Daniel, just listen to me, please. I know that it sounds crazy, but is it really that hard to believe that not everything is as it seems?\tDaniel: We saw mom collapse in front of us. Nate and elena, they weren\u2019t pretending to try and help her. They did everything that they could to save her and now we know that she was poisoned and the ambulance crashed and burned. I mean, there\u2019s not a person in this world that could survive all of that.\tSummer: What if she survived? And it was all a part of this scheme that was orchestrated by jeremy stark. I mean, you thought that he was involved from the beginning, didn\u2019t you?\tDaniel: Yes. But I\u2013 I\u2013\tSummer: Don\u2019t you see, can\u2019t you see it? He played on all of mom\u2019s emotions. He forced her to be part of his plan for revenge against diane. And frame diane for murder. Mom didn\u2019t have a choice. And even though she regretted things that she\u2019s done, she was\u2013 she was trapped.\t"], "answer": [1, 4, 0, 2, 3]}

So how are you employed again? I took a job at Demara. What? My cousin Brady offered me a position at Basic Blank and I accepted. So you\u2019re working for the competition? Mm-hmm. Wow. And, um, how does Maggie feel about that?\tLet me get this straight. Sorry. You, you want me to work at Titan again? Well, I floated this idea before. Surely it can\u2019t come as a complete surprise. What about Victor? He\u2019d never approved and he\u2019s barely spoken to me since I quit. It\u2019s not up to Victor.

You know, children always understand more than we give them credit for.\t", "In fact, I would go as far as to say he may as well have been absent from my life altogether. Sounds like an awfully lonely childhood. Yes. Yes. I suppose it was. Of course I grew up with great wealth and privilege, and I am fully aware of how lucky I was,\tbut looking back, I, uh,\tI would\u2019ve traded all in for just a, a modicum of unconditional love,\tif that even exists. I think it does.\tWell then you\u2019re less of a cynic than I am anyway. When you\u2019re deprived of love, it starts to eat away at you and to cope with this deprivation, I think I developed a sort of a me against the world mentality. And to be honest with you, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been able to shake it. And I suppose that it might be that mentality that\u2019s driven many of my, shall we say, less prudent life choices?\tAh, you mean, um, your choice to use a weapon of a mass destruction to bend world governments to your will? Uh, yes. Like that. Mm. Among others\tin prison, you spend a lot of time by yourself alone with just your thoughts to keep you company and you start to wonder. How did I get here? How did I hit rock bottom,\tand do you know what I realized? No, I\u2019m very eager to hear. I realized that my need for power and money was all born from a lifelong desire just. Just to be loved.\tPlease feel free to scoff. I just, uh, I realize how wildly cliche that sounds, and I\u2019m sure that now you think that I\u2019m just some self-pitying narcissist. So if, uh, I don\u2019t know. No, I don\u2019t. Um, I don\u2019t, um, actually, I, I completely get it.\tI should be going. I\u2019ve given you a lot of advice. I hope, I hope you take it to heart. I will. I appreciate everything you said. You are always. You\u2019re so wise and caring. You really helped me, Julie. Good. Anytime you wanna talk. I\u2019m, I\u2019m always around. I,\tI love you. She, I love you too, Julie.\tI want you to know, Abby,\twell, I saw you here that day and that what I said.\tI will love you forever.\tOh, hello. Hi. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d seen you today. I\u2019m in. I just wanted to come by and, uh, apologize for missing the meeting today. Oh, it\u2019s okay. The truth is, is I went to go see Abigail. That\u2019s what I thought. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t tell you Chad. You don\u2019t owe me an apology.\tHow was the meeting? It was really good. Actually, we just finished up right before you got here. And the client wants to see the numbers you crunched. Hmm? I have them right here.\tGot them right here.\tGreat.\tLet\u2019s get to work.\tSo are you still looking for that perfect love?\tI suppose I am.\tAnd um, is there anyone special? No. Perhaps, um, anyone you fancy?\tSadly, no.\tHas there ever been?\tYes, yes. There was someone that I thought was perfect for me, but I kept getting hurt. So finally, as painful as it was, I had to walk away. I think you might know what that feels like. Sorry. Excuse me. Forgive me. I, uh, last night at the house, I overheard you speaking to my aunt and you said something about wanting to put someone named Xander behind you and starting fresh with someone new.\tOh yes, I suppose I did say that. I\u2019m so sorry. I really shouldn\u2019t have been dropping, but secretly I\u2019m glad that I did because it made me realize that perhaps you and I have a connection. Of sorts.\tUm, yes, um, it\u2019s true. I mean, honestly, since hearing your story, I am. I think it\u2019s quite uncanny how much we have in common. Really. It\u2019s Imagine that Gwen\u2019s on a date. I thought she was interviewing Dimitri Von Leischner. Oh, well she is, but you never know. One thing could lead to another. Well, I hope you\u2019re right.\tIf she\u2019s happy and moved on, then she\u2019ll be less of a problem for Xander and me. You know, even if Gwen is out of the picture. What about Sarah Horton? What about Sarah? She and Xandr have been over for a while now. I mean, she doesn\u2019t even live here anymore and yet her Specter always loomed large over Gwen\u2019s relationship with Xandr.\tPoor Gwen always playing second fiddle to Xander\u2019s. Beloved Sarah, who\u2019s to say that won\u2019t happen to you too? That\u2019s ridiculous. They\u2019re, they\u2019re done for good. Trust me. You say so.\tOh Lord. Do you think Maggie bought my story? Let\u2019s hope. And you may wanna let Mimi know that she needs to get pregnant. A sap. That\u2019s the only thing I can think of. This is all your fault anyway. My fault. Yes, your fault. I was a much better liar before I fell in love with you. Now I\u2019m outta practice. Oh, well I guess I should take that as a compliment.\tYes, it\u2019s a compliment and a curse cuz now I feel guilty for lying and I never used to feel guilty before. Oh my God. Did you see Maggie? She can\u2019t wait to be a grandmother again. Well, she will be, won\u2019t Sarah eventually have to tell Maggie? I mean, it\u2019s not like she can keep this secret forever, especially from her own mother.\tOh, no, you\u2019re right. It just, I think Sarah needs time to figure it out, you know? Well, she better do that soon, because I\u2019m not sure how much longer you can last before you put it in Skywriting. I really not. You\u2019re the only one I\u2019m gonna tell. Okay. I try to do that.\tAll right. I have a client to meet. Okay. Then you\u2019ll be here when I get back. Oh, God, yes. All right. And keep your mouth. Mm, yeah. Ow\tyou can do this bunny girl. You can keep Sarah\u2019s pregnancy a secret. Easy peasy. You just gotta stay away from Xander.\t", "Well, wait a minute. I thought you were already taking a step away because it was so awkward working with, you know, with Gwen. Am I wrong? No, you\u2019re not wrong. It\u2019s, I\u2019ve been awkward as hell, but, huh. I dunno. Certain things about the job have improved recently.\tOh. Well, okay, you just take some time and think about it. Not too much time though. I do need to replace Alex sooner than later. And I really do hope it\u2019s you. Of course. Oh, I\u2019ll get back to you as soon as possible. Wonderful. Chloe, it was so nice seeing you. Oh my goodness gracious. I see you too. Oh, listen.\tWould you tell Parker that? I absolutely loved his birthday gift. He got me. Of course. I\u2019ll tell him. Okay. So nice to see you. Oh, it\u2019s so nice to see you. Think about it.\tHow is unexpected? Yeah. Well, Maggie obviously thinks very highly of you. I feel the same about her, but No, I mean, I\u2019d be crazy to go back to work at time, wouldn\u2019t I? Then why didn\u2019t you just say No, I didn\u2019t wanna be rude. Or maybe deep down, you actually want the job.\tSo what\u2019s it going to be? Are you going to call a truce or am I going to call the police?\tNo, no need to call the police. I apologize, Mr. Stark. I shouldn\u2019t have manhandled you. Oh, that\u2019s okay. Normally I enjoy a good man handling. You\u2019re right. It was too easy. Anywho, I have got to get to work. Guinevere, you are a lifesaver. Love you minutes.\tYour best friend is, uh, yes, I know I, I know he\u2019s a lot, but he has a good heart and he makes me laugh so,\tAre you still willing to do the interview or, oh, um, of course. Brilliant. Okay. Well, I\u2019ve, I\u2019ve made a lunch reservation at the Bistro, so we could just head over. Actually, I was thinking, well, why not just do it here? Could be a lot more intimate.\tChad was being really vague about his plans, but I, I figured they had to be important if he was blowing off a client meeting and then it hit me. Today is the one year anniversary that\u2019s Abigail\u2019s death. Wow. So I\u2019m sure he just needed some time to process that. Well, why wouldn\u2019t he just say that? I guess because.\tIt\u2019s just something he has to deal with on his own right. I mean, obviously I\u2019m sure it\u2019s still very painful for him. Mm. How could it not be? Right.\tYou know, one thing I did notice though, um, what, nevermind. Oh, Alex, what were you gonna say? Um,\the still wears his wedding ring. Yeah, he does. I think I haven\u2019t noticed that too.\tWe, um, we haven\u2019t talked about it, but I totally understand. I mean, when you love someone so much, It must be hard to let go.\tWow. You\u2019re just so chill about all this. Just living in Abigail\u2019s shadow. Nope, nope. Sorry. That\u2019s not what I meant at all. That that came up very, very wrong. Um, I didn\u2019t mean that you don\u2019t like measure up at all because you do. Um, it\u2019s just that you have to. Somehow, I don\u2019t know. You have to share Chad with Abigail\u2019s memory.\tYou\u2019re a strong person, Stephanie. I know you can handle it. Chad\u2019s really lucky to have you. You\u2019re understanding, caring. You\u2019re always there for him. You don\u2019t pressure him about anything. Thank you. That was much more tactful, not only tact. That was kind and insightful. Must be the therapy. I don\u2019t know that Dr.\tEvans, Hey, she\u2019s a genius. Yeah. Anyway. I, um, I really do hope that Chad\u2019s okay. Yeah, me too. I know it seems impossible that you actually saw Abby, but who knows? What did Shakespeare ride in Hamlet? There are more things in heaven and earth than dreamt of in your philosophy. Maybe you did see her. I will never know that.\tBut I know one thing, whether you just imagined her or not, whether you just told yourself the things you wanted to hear or not. I know that she would want you to get on with your life and you know that too, don\u2019t you?\tSometimes. Only sometimes other times I just, I\u2019ve, I, um,\tI just have this overwhelming feeling of guilt,\tlike I\u2019m betraying her, you know what I mean? Well, maybe I just made up this vision of Abigail so I could give myself permission to be with Stephanie. Sleep long enough. It\u2019s only been. A year since Chad stop, I have something to say and, and I want you to really hear me okay. There is no timetable for grief.\tThere is no right or wrong way to mourn, but one thing I know from living a long, long life is that guilt is corrosive. It will steal all of your happiness if you let it. So don\u2019t you let it. You deserve to be loved. You deserve to have happiness, and not just for yourself, but for your children too. They need to see their father living a full life.\tYeah, you\u2019re right. I see you\u2019re still wearing your wedding ring. This is really none of my business. You can ignore anything I might say, but.\tDo you think that wearing the ring is holding you back from moving on?\tYeah, maybe.\tMaybe it, I just hadn\u2019t been able to bring myself to take it off. I\u2019m afraid that if I do, it\u2019ll allow me\tmake it final and really let her go. My darling, she will never be gone. Abigail is always going to be with you in your heart and wearing a piece of jewelry, a little golden ring. It\u2019s not gonna prove that to you. You don\u2019t need it and you don\u2019t have to prove it to anyone else in the world.\t", "Another thing, the guilt that you feel, I think it\u2019s because you are here. She\u2019s not, it\u2019s called survivor\u2019s guilt,\tbut life is a gift. And we should treasure every single bit of it we get cuz it\u2019s brief, it\u2019s limited. It\u2019s limited for all of us. So forgive yourself for finding love again, for wanting to move into the future. Forgive yourself. And be thankful for all the blessings you have and all the glorious joyous moments that are ahead of you.\tWill you do that,\tMr. Vaughn Lona? I think that it\u2019s best that we keep things strictly professional. Oh, I wasn\u2019t suggesting otherwise. Well then why? It\u2019s just that restaurants can be so crowded and noisy. I thought it might just be easier to do the interview here that we were not disturbed. Oh, right. Well, alright. I suppose you have a point.\tWonderful. Well then I will order us room service, my treat, of course. Oh, no, I can, no, I insist please. I think we might have gotten off on the wrong foot earlier, and I\u2019d like to make it up to you fresh start. Of course, Mr. Von Lena, uh, as I said last night, please call me Dimitri. All right. Well, thank you in advance for lunch, Dimitri, and for the interview.\tHmm. Normally I, uh, I detest interviews. For some reason, I\u2019m looking forward to this one. Something tells me that you and I are gonna get along\twell, to be honest, I mean, God, part of me would just love to go back to Titan, I mean, Bro, not face to dream about being part of the family business and finally feeling like I belonged. I have to say, I mean, it would be so satisfying to go back and just rub it in Victor\u2019s face showing that he made a mistake by not believing in me.\tI could see why that would be satisfying. So I guess you\u2019re taking the job\tactually. I think I\u2019m gonna turn it down. You are? Why? Well, as much as I enjoy spending time with Maggie, I enjoy spending time with you much more. Listen, we already live together and this job. Yeah, the job, right? I mean, I can\u2019t abandon you to battle Gwen or by yourself. That wouldn\u2019t be fair, would it? So what, you\u2019re staying here for me?\tYeah, I guess I am.\tHow on earth could Sarah be pregnant with Xander\u2019s baby? She left town months ago. Well, she was pregnant before she left. She just didn\u2019t tell anybody. Why not? Isn\u2019t it obvious? She thinks Sander is a dangerous criminal. She\u2019s trying to protect her unborn child. Yeah, I guess I can see where she\u2019s coming from.\tI mean, he did hold you and Susan hostage. Mm-hmm. Which led to Susan\u2019s death. She rest in peace. Well, if Sarah didn\u2019t want anyone to know, why did she tell you? Well, I ran into her, bless her heart. It\u2019s kinda hard to hide your pregnancy at this stage. So she tried to convince me that the father was Rex, which of course I didn\u2019t believe, and then she finally confessed, but she begged me not to tell anyone her secret, but holy moral doesn.\tIt\u2019s a huge of a secret for me to hold it. I just had to tell someone. Yeah. I understand Justin, this has to stay between us. No one, not even Maggie can know that she\u2019s pregnant, who\u2019s pregnant.\tHi Maggie. I didn\u2019t know you were home. I just got back. So who\u2019s pregnant? And why am I not allowed to know? Well, well, it\u2019s not just you. No one can know. She wants to keep it a secret. She who? Mm-hmm. Mimi. Yes, Mimi is. She\u2019s pregnant and she doesn\u2019t want too many people know until she\u2019s through her first trimester.\tYou know how that goes. Oh, yes. Of course. Of course. I won\u2019t say a word. Thank you. Thank you. Well, that\u2019s, that\u2019s, that\u2019s wonderful news though. No, you have to be thrilled. Oh, thrilled. If yes, the word yes. Now I have to admit a little jealous. Mm. I\u2019d love to be a grandmother again. Oh yeah,\thim. Sorry to interrupt. I just wanted to grab my paycheck.\tThanks, Xander. Are you busy or do you have time to talk about my next column? Busy. You\u2019ll have to wait. Someone needs an answer from me. Air sap.\tSo that\u2019s your definition of platonic. Interesting. Listen, Leo, can you please not mention this to Gwen? She hates me enough as it is. Girl, please. Gwen is so over that Scottish longhead has been for ages. As a matter of fact, she\u2019s having lunch with a hot new hunky hun. Even as we speak, you know, most of our readers view you as this sort of James Bond type villain.\tWho threatens to obliterate entire cities to get what he wanted. And I know that that\u2019s, um, part of your story, but um, I would actually like to move beyond that. And, um, well, I\u2019d like to learn more about the real Dimitri Vaughn Leischner. What would you like to know? Well, how about we start at the beginning.\tWhat was your childhood like? My childhood. Well, I was an only child raised mainly by my mother, whom you\u2019ve met, whom I love dearly, although I, she can be quite needy. You see, she went through a lot before I was born. And come to think of it, sometimes it felt like I was the adult in the relationship. Yes, I know what that\u2019s like.\tAnd, um, what about your, your father? Ah, yes, the venerable Oscar Ner. My father. My father, my father and I didn\u2019t really have very much of a relationship because he was always off on business traveling. And when he was home, he, well, he was cold. And distant, not exactly what you would call a, a fatherly figure.\t"], "answer": [1, 0, 3, 4, 2]}

Unfortunately, molly\u2019s case is different.\tBecause my condition is severe?\tThere\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty around how the condition affects some women compared to others. Your diagnosis is severe based on where the endometrial tissue occurs in the body and how far it\u2019s spread and how much tissue\u2019s in those areas, which certainly contribute to infertility. But the condition can also affect fertility on a microscopic level. Endometriosis can change the hormonal environment around the eggs, as well as alter the quality of the eggs.

And they\u2019re willing to spend it to see ethan dead. That\u2019s why he\u2019s gone back to australia to try and hustle enough money to pay them back.\tYeah, well, that\u2019s a whole bunch of problems in itself, isn\u2019t it?\tHence why I need a large influx of cash.\tWhy didn\u2019t you come to me? I care about ethan. And I sure as hell care about you.\tIf this was as simple as asking a friend for a loan, I wouldn\u2019t have spoken to selina wu. I even inquired about working for the wsb. But that wouldn\u2019t have paid off fast enough. The only way to get these people off ethan\u2019s back is to compensate them. And I have to do that before they find him.\t[Scoffs] Why didn\u2019t you bring this to me earlier? I\u2013I still could have helped you.\tIsn\u2019t it obvious?\tNot to me. I mean, you and I, we help each other. That\u2019s what we do.\tBut I\u2019ve got you in so much trouble already. And I don\u2019t want that for the man I love.\tI am gonna check in with my uncle\u2019s attorneys and try to get more information about the will reading.\tYou know he did that so we could be alone.\tIs that ok with you?\tI\u2019m happy you\u2019re here, mom. I know this is hard on you too.\tThe hardest part is that I had to put you in this position in the first place. But I\u2019m really proud of your courage, you know. I wish I was as brave as you are in the very beginning. When I found out I was pregnant, I should have told curtis and marcus that I was not sure who the father was. And you never would have had to make this decision.\t[Chuckles]\t[Sighs] I\u2019m sorry.\tI know we haven\u2019t unpacked everything.\t[Dramatic music] And I\u2019m still angry that you chose to not be honest with me.

But I can\u2019t help it. I\u2019m terrified.\tAnd down this hallway is where the senior offices are. Hi. This is a surprise.\tOh, so is this. What\u2019s going on?\tRobert, lovely surprise.\tNice try, holly. But it\u2019s not gonna work. You\u2019re up to something.\tWhat exactly do you think I\u2019m up to?\tConspiring with selina wu.\tSring ridge. You asked me about maggie fitzgerald. You said she was my former nanny. But you said that you were a private detective. Did\u2013did you lie to me? Do you really work at \u201cthe invader\u201d? Were you just trying to use me to get the scoop that ryan chamberlain was my father?\tNo, no, no, no, I\u2013 I am a private investigator. And that\u2019s my mother.\tY-your mother. But\u2013\tyeah.\tIsn\u2019t your last name mccall?\tIt is.\tBut you\u2019re a cassadine too.\tLong story. Maybe some other time.\tOh, no, no, no. I get it. You tried to manipulate me just like every other cassadine. And you\u2019re really supposed to make me believe that you don\u2019t have some ulterior motive for giving me this job?\tWhat are you getting involved in here? You know what selina wu does for a business. What\u2019s next, drop in on sonny corinthos?\tOh, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\tYeah, I know you. And you love to play fast and loose with the law.\tFor goodness\u2019 sake, robert.\tExcuse me. Who let you in? We\u2019re closed.\tN\u2019neka, is it? Robert scorpio, district attorney. I\u2019m here on official business.\tWhich is now over.\tI\u2013you don\u2019t get off that easy.\tYou\u2019re right. Maybe you do need to be filled in. Can we discuss this somewhere more private?\tAs we suspected, your biopsy reveals that you have endometriosis. And unfortunately, it\u2019s severe. You hadn\u2019t complained of pain previously.\t[Cries] I mean, there\u2019s\u2013there\u2019s been some cramping, more severe lately. But warm baths helped. And an occasional missed period, like right now. But I\u2019m not pregnant?\tI\u2019m sorry. Ir regularity in your cycleis common with endometriosis. Any additional symptoms? That\u2019s good. Per your request, we conducted a fertility test.\tI know you told me to wait six months before I try and have a baby.\tAnd you insisted you didn\u2019t want to wait.\tNo, I mean, I\u2013 I need all of the information before I make any decisions about treatment. And I don\u2019t want to delay trying to get pregnant. What\u2019d the fertility test say?\tI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s not good news.\t[Cries]\tWill trina ever be free from this horrible family?\tWell, victor\u2019s dead now, so there\u2019s nothing he can do to harm trina.\tYeah, well, in the meantime, spencer and trina are closer than ever.\tI know that you\u2019re wary of spencer. But I witnessed firsthand how he stepped up for trina in greenland.\tYour uncle victor tried to control you. And when he realized he couldn\u2019t, he turned against you. Nothing in this will is going to be good for you.\tProbably not, which is exactly why i should deal with it now instead of putting it off till later. If uncle victor had succeeded, there would be no need for this will.\tRight. He planned on ushering in the new age.\tYeah, this\u2013this is worst-case scenario. This is a\u2013this is a contingency plan in case of disaster. In order for this will to mean anything, uncle victor would have had to assume that he was, a, dead, and, b, that his plan had failed.\tSo why let him have the last word?\tBecause if this will is uncle victor\u2019s last shot at revenge, if it sets something in motion, I\u2019m gonna need to be the one to stop it.\tSpencer didn\u2019t even care about himself. He was only concerned about trina. He put himself in the line of fire to protect her.\tAnd so did you. And I am grateful to you for bringing trina back home. Thank you.\tI care about trina too.\tI know you do. And she cares about you. I could see the look in her eye when she looked at you. I mean, I think you have a permanent place in her heart.\tDad.\tOh, how is my baby girl?\t", "Ok, I\u2019m assuming he probably swore you to secrecy.\tHe asked me not to tell anyone.\tOk, so I\u2019m not gonna pry. It\u2019s just that this must be pretty hard on you.\tWhat\u2019s really hard is I don\u2019t know if this radio silence means that he\u2019s in some kind of trouble, because apparently, I\u2019m the only one that knows about this. So if that\u2019s true and he doesn\u2019t tell me, how can I help him?\tWell, did you reach out to him?\tI am not comfortable doing that.\tWhy not?\tBecause he asked\u2013 he insisted\u2013 that I respect his privacy.\tOk, well, you can respect his privacy without ignoring him.\tIf I recall, you were the one who told me to trust him. And if he needs me, he\u2019ll reach out.\tAnd he did. I mean, didn\u2019t that change everything?\tIf esme can afford it, she\u2019ll disappear with my brother.\tOr the job can be a reason why she stays. The longer esme stays in port charles, the more time you have to convince her that your brother needs you. You and your grandmother will show her how important it is for ace to have a support system.\tBut what about you? The more involved esme is with my family, the more you\u2019re exposed.\t[Sighs] Don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ve gotten used to having esme around. And she\u2019ll always be part of your family, job or no job. It\u2019s part of the deal when you have a family.\tHave I told you lately how amazing you are?\t[Laughs] About 1,000 times.\tGod.\tBut you can tell me again.\tWhat\u2019s wrong?\tOh, just history repeating itself. But this time\u2013this time, I\u2019m ready for it.\tHow are you responsible for what happens to trina\u2019s family? Did you push for the dna test?\tNo, that was trina\u2019s choice. She wanted that.\tThen why are you blaming yourself?\t[Sighs] Because I am the complicating factor. Everything was perfect between trina and the parents that raised her. They had the perfect stable dynamic for over 20 years, and then here I come, complicating things.\tWell\u2026[Sighs] Their so-called stable dynamic was already complicated\u2013 and not because of you. Portia made her choice. And\u2026[Sighs] Right or wrong, it was what she needed to do at the time. But with the revelation that she doesn\u2019t know who trina\u2019s biological father is, that dynamic was bound to change.\tBut it doesn\u2019t have to. Taggert is always going to love trina as his daughter, and she\u2019s always gonna love him as her dad. So wouldn\u2019t the best likely outcome be to\u2013for those results to show that he is in fact her biological father? Because if that\u2019s the case, then trina can go back on living her happy life.\tSpoken like a true father.\tHonestly, I just want what\u2019s best for trina. But selfishly, I want those results to show that I am her father. Jordan, I want that so bad it hurts. And the only thing that would hurt worse is finding out that\u2013 is finding out that I\u2019m not her father.\tI\u2019m sorry.\tHey, for what?\tI feel silly.\tBaby, you just had a bomb dropped on you, ok? Of course you\u2019re upset.\tYeah, but I mean, I\u2019m a logical person. My brain completely understands that we can still have a child. And we will\u2013we will love that child whether I carry it or not.\tWe will.\t[Cries]\tBut your brain is not your heart. And your heart is broken.\t[Cries] I feel like I just got hit by a baseball bat.\t[Cries] I mean, I came in here expecting the worst. But then when dr. Navarro actually said the words, that it\u2019s unlikely I\u2019ll get pregnant\u2026\tunlikely is not impossible, baby.\tI told myself that it didn\u2019t matter either way. You know, I\u2019m not a very traditional person. And if we have a baby by nontraditional means, no one would be surprised.\t[Chuckles]\tBut\u2026 I think it took finding out how unlikely it would be for me to realize just how badly i wanted to be pregnant, just how badly i wanted to carry your baby.\t[Cries] I\u2019m sorry.\tI don\u2019t know how difficult this is. I cannot imagine what you are going through.\t[Cries]\tBut we are here together. I am with you. We are in this together.\t[Cries]\tExplain to me how I can insert myself into his life and then let him reach out to me at the same time.\tI\u2019m not telling you to press him to talk. I\u2019m just saying that you can reach out to him without being intrusive. You can just call him, mom. Send a text or a voice mail letting him know that you\u2019re his friend and you\u2019re there for him if he needs your help.\tYou mean act like a normal grown-up? How did you get to be so normal and so wise?\t[Chuckles] Come on. What is normal anyway?\tMm.\tIt\u2019s in my dna.\tOh. Yeah.\t[Chuckles]\tDr. Navarro downloaded a bunch of information on endometriosis for us to look at whenever you\u2019re ready.\tIs it ok if I\u2019m not ready yet?\tMore than ok.\t[Sighs]\tAs dr. Navarro said, baby, you need to process.\tHey, we both do. You don\u2019t have to just make this about me.\tI know. I\u2019m thinking positive here. And we can and we still will grow our family.\t[Dramatic music]\tJust not in the way that we thought we would.\tI should go.\tRight now?\tWhy prolong this? I wish we could stay together and shut out the rest of the world, but we can\u2019T. Letting go of you is gonna be the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done.\tBut\u2013\tit\u2019s what we both need. I truly want you to be happy. And I think that the best is yet to come for you.\t[Sighs] Goodbye, robert.\tTake care of yourself.\tI always do.\tGoodbye, holly.\tReady for the dna test?\t[Sighs] The lab tech hasn\u2019t returned.\tWell, she\u2019s probably waiting for you. May I walk you to the lab?\tYou may.\t[Sighs] I am just as upset as you are about this. But no good is gonna come from you continually warning her about spencer.\tThis is beyond talking, marcus. It\u2019s time for action.\tWhat are you saying?\tI\u2019m saying I\u2019m not gonna stand by and watch him take our daughter down. I\u2019m gonna make sure that spencer is out of trina\u2019s life for good.\tI am so sorry you\u2019re hurting. But if there\u2019s one thing I know, it\u2019s that curtis ashford is strong enough to weather whatever comes his way.\t[Sighs]\tAnd he won\u2019t have to go through it alone.

Yes, I was angry at being overlooked and constantly demoralized, but in the end\u2026 I couldn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t go through with it.\tNick: Well, look at that. Obviously, there\u2019s a conscience in there somewhere.\tNate: I\u2019ve tried to make up for it ever since. I\u2019ve done everything I possibly could to prove my regret for the hurt I caused. Nick, I wish there was something I could say or do to allay your suspicions of me. Anything that could help us get back to some semblance of a friendship we used to have.\tNick: I know exactly what you can do. Are you ready for this? Stay in your lane at newman media. You don\u2019t need to go anywhere near newman enterprises. Now, nate, if you do that, you\u2019ll prove to everyone, especially me, that this isn\u2019t part of some master plan that you\u2019ve cooked up with my sister. How\u2019s that sound? Does it sound like a good solution?\tNate: I hear you, nick. And I respect where you\u2019re coming from. But if victoria needs my input, I\u2019m not going to say no.\tNick: Well, there it is.\t[ Nate sighing ] My husband and I have never been more active.\tNate: I\u2019ve just about had it with all your insults and insinuations.\tNick: Why is that? I haven\u2019t said anything that isn\u2019t true, have I?\tNate: Aren\u2019t you supposed to be using this personal time to take care of all the things and turmoil in your life right now?\tNick: Yeah, vic said I should be using this time to take care of the people I love, so that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m trying to keep them safe.\tNate: Hm. From me.\tNick: I\u2019m glad you finally admit it.\tNate: Nick, I am genuinely sorry to hear what you\u2019ve had to endure these past few days. Genuinely. But don\u2019t blame me because you couldn\u2019t stop your daughter from being kidnapped. Or for the fact that you weren\u2019t there for sally when she lost her baby.\tTucker: Hey, victoria. Better break that up before it gets physical.\tVictoria: You didn\u2019t waste anytime, did you? You just had to come here and blame nate for my decision for your time off? And wrongly so, I might add.\tNate: Everything\u2019s fine, victoria. I don\u2019t fault nick for jumping to conclusions. Your brother\u2019s had this idea in his head for quite some time now, but no worries. I can handle it.\t[ Phone chiming ]\tNick: You know what? You two, uh, just do exactly whatever it is you think you got to do. Just remember, plans like this usually end up crashing and burning.\tAudra: You know, when I arrived in genoa city, I first considered uh, looking for a little pied-a-terre to settle into. But I\u2019m glad I decided to stay here, you know, at the club. It\u2019s just so convenient having the lounge downstairs. You know, it turns out, this is a hot spot where all the movers and shakers seem to stop through.\tTucker: Hi there.\tAdam: Are you\u2013 are you looking to cause more trouble, tucker? Or you just trying to stick your nose in where it doesn\u2019t belong?\t[ Tucker chuckling ]\tTucker: Actually, I had heard that sally spectra lost her child and so I was going to offer my condolences.\tAdam: Wait a minute, how\u2013 how do you even know about that?\tTucker: There are no secrets, adam. Isn\u2019t that right, audra?\tAdam: I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not interested in discussing my personal situation with you, tucker. And I\u2019m certainly, not going to be discussing my business plan with my soon-to-be rival in charge.\tTucker: Rival in charge? Have you pulled it off? Are you already being fitted for the crown?\tNikki: I refuse to believe that victoria would allow herself to be manipulated by a man after everything that happened with ashland. She learned that lesson the hard way.\tVictor: Yeah. I don\u2019t think she would ever allow it.\tNikki: So, do you think she\u2019s the one driving this?\tVictor: Mm-hmm, I do. But\u2026 nate hastings is more than eager to follow her. And that, I don\u2019t like.\tNick: Hey. How are you feeling?\tSally: I am ready to go, that\u2019s for sure. Just being here makes my heart ache. And having to deal with adam doesn\u2019t help. It messes me up even more every time I have to see him.\tNick: I understand. I\u2019m not going to keep pushing you to forgive him. That\u2019s gonna have to be something you work out on your own. But in the meantime, let\u2019s get you out of here.\tSally: Okay.\tNick: There is\u2026 one important thing I need to know.\tSally: What is that?\tNick: Where exactly am I taking you? Have you given any thought to my offer of\u2026 moving in with me? And what kind of milk?\t", "Sally: I love the way you\u2019re always looking out for me. You\u2019re the sweetest man that I know, and I really am touched by your offer, but\u2026 moving in with you and christian is a really big, important step, so I hope you don\u2019t mind if I just\u2026 need some time to think about it.\tNick: Yeah, of course. Take as much time as you need.\tSally: You know what I really want right now?\tNick: Name it.\tSally: I want to go back to my room at the athletic club and take a long, hot shower. And rest in something that is not a hospital bed.\tNick: Let\u2019s do it.\t[ Sally chuckling ] Take it easy.\tSally: I just found out that it was yours.\tAdam: Okay, and\u2013 I rea\u2013 I really don\u2019t mean to be insensitive, but how do you know like, for sure? I assume you, nick, you know.\tSally: Yeah, um, I had a paternity test that tested nick\u2019s dna and it ruled him out. You were the only other possibility.\t[ Adam chuckling ]\tAdam: Wow. Um\u2026\t[ Laughing ] I\u2019m not sure what to say right now.\tSally: Well, just to be clear\u2026 this\u2026 this changes nothing. Emotionally.\tAdam: Actually, I disagree with that. This\u2013 yeah, I mean, this changes everything.\t[ Sally grunting ] What\u2019s wrong? You okay?\tSally: Yeah, I just haven\u2019t been sure of what I\u2019ve been feeling has\u2026 been the baby moving, but I\u2013 I think this is it.\tAdam: What?\t[ Both laughing ] That is definitely a moving baby. Wow. He or she, wow, that is quite a kick.\t[ Sally laughing ]\t[ Sally chuckles ] I have no idea about little girls.\tSally: Yeah, but you have nieces.\t[ Adam laughing ]\tAdam: It\u2019s not the same. Uncles get all the fun stuff, dad\u2026 I mean, how am I going to be able to say no to our perfect little daughter when she\u2019s looking up at me with those big blue eyes?\tSally: They could be brown.\tAdam: Well, no matter what color they are, I am not going to be able to say no.\tSally: You chose me over her?\tAdam: No. Look, when you say it like that, that\u2019s not\u2013\tSally: Why? Why would you?\tAdam: How could I not?\tSally: She was my everything.\tAdam: I couldn\u2019t lose you.\tSally: But you already did, adam. You made that choice a long time ago. I\u2019m not yours anymore. I was hers and she was mine. She was all I had. And you let her die. You didn\u2019t even\u2013 you didn\u2019t even try, and fight for her.\tAdam: Look, this\u2013 sally, this was the hardest decision of my entire life.\tSally: Could you just not envision a life where someone actually needed you, where you had to step up, possibly, on your own, and be the man that nobody thinks you could be?\tAdam: I thought that I was making the right choice.\tSally: You destroyed her life.\t[ Sally sobbing ] And mine.\tAudra: Well, I haven\u2019t been exactly crowned the queen yet, you know, but things are progressing very nicely for me at newman media. All the pieces appear to be falling into place, even though nothing\u2019s official yet.\tTucker: So, it\u2019s just a matter of time. Oh, by the way, I just ran into your boy, nate.\t[ Tucker laughing ] He spoke very highly of you. He said you were a very valuable asset to the company.\tAudra: And why wouldn\u2019t he?\tTucker: Why wouldn\u2019t he?\t[ Audra chuckling ] Oh, audra.\t[ Clicking tongue ] Heavy is the head that wears the crown, you know. Just a little warning, be careful what you wish for. That may come with many sleepless nights.\tAudra: No warning needed. I know exactly what I\u2019m in for.\tTucker: Yeah, but you don\u2019t have a clue about adam. That guy is someone you have to look out for. I mean, he is trouble. You thought I was trouble? He\u2019s worse.\tAudra: Hmm. Adam doesn\u2019t scare me. Look, I can handle him and anything that gets thrown at me.\tTucker: Of course. Who am I to doubt the great audra charles?\tAudra: How are you, by the way? Still flying high?\tTucker: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. It\u2019s progressing nicely with ashley. Engagement is still on. Although\u2026 she is hell-bent on taking jabot away from her brother.\tAudra: That must make you happy now. Since it was your initial goal when you returned to genoa city. Taking over jabot.\tTucker: Yeah, you would think, wouldn\u2019t you? But no. A war over a legacy company is not a fight I wanna fight. It\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s destined to fail.\tVictoria: Oh, well, I certainly hope that nicholas didn\u2019t give you too much grief.\tNate: I had it handled. I held my ground and tried to get through to him as best as I could. But you, on the other hand\u2026 you look like you\u2019ve been through the ringer.\t[ Victoria laughing ]\tVictoria: Yes, I\u2013 I have. The mom and dad spin dry. Both my parents were all over me about insisting that nick takes time off.\tNate: Does that mean you\u2019re having second thoughts now?\tVictoria: Actually, no. It\u2019s just given me more resolve. I, um, made it perfectly clear that this was my decision. But I can\u2019t back down because I know it\u2019s what\u2019s best for the company and for nicholas.\tNate: So, you held your ground. Good for you.\tVictoria: I\u2019m sure my brother must have told you that this leave of absence is effective immediately.\tNate: Immediately? That was fast.\tVictoria: Yes. Which is why I would like to officially name you interim coo of newman enterprises in nick\u2019s absence. Are you okay with that?\tAnnouncer: Next week on the young and the restless\u2026\tJack: You lied to kyle. Again.\tSummer: Kyle wants to separate. He asked me to move out.\tAudra: My achievements are not confined to the boardroom. I got a few moves. [ Chuckling ]\tKyle: I bet you do. How about you show me some?\t", "Nikki: Victoria, what have you done?\tVictoria: Done? Uh, I\u2019ve done plenty. It\u2019s been a very productive morning. Is there something in particular that you\u2019re referring to?\tNikki: I saw nicholas tearing out of here looking none too pleased. Wasn\u2019t hard to guess what that was about.\tVictoria: And you would be right.\tNikki: You asked him to take a leave from work, didn\u2019t you?\tVictoria: It was more than just an ask.\tNikki: Oh, my god. Why would you do that? I told you it was a bad idea.\tVictoria: It was the right thing to do.\t[ Nikki groaning ]\tTucker: Hey, dr. Hastings, how are you? Oh. Sorry, it\u2019s, uh, just mr. Hastings now, isn\u2019t it?\tNate: Hello, tucker.\tTucker: How\u2019s the business world treating?\tNate: Great. Uh, I\u2019m proud of quite a few new accomplishments I\u2019ve managed to pull off at newman media. And I like to think I can take some credit for the increase in the profit margin as a result.\tTucker: I\u2019m sure audra charles could take some of that credit too, right?\t[ Nate scoffing ] Yeah, she\u2019s a spitfire, that one, huh. And brilliant.\tNate: Very. And now, she\u2019s finally being given the opportunity to shine. I know exactly how that feels.\tTucker: Oh, you mean after what happened to you at chancellor-winters?\tNate: I wasn\u2019t treated right there. My ideas and opinions weren\u2019t valued, and that was a\u2013 that was a frustrating experience. I get the feeling you clearly didn\u2019t appreciate audra at your former company or she\u2019d still be there.\tTucker: Oh, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d go that far.\tNate: Yeah, right. Now, if you excuse me, I\u2019ve got work to do.\tTucker: Some work to do.\t[ Laughing ]\tNick: Gotta hand it to you, nate.\tNate: Why is that?\tNick: Pretty smooth, man. And you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\tTucker: Uh, can I get another one please? This could be interesting.\tAdam: Excuse me, nurse. Has miss spectra been released?\tNurse: No, she\u2019s been taken for some final tests to be sure she\u2019s ready for discharge.\tAdam: All right, so she could get out possibly today?\t[ Sally sighing ]\tSally: What are you doing here, adam? Why do you keep coming back when I asked you to stay away?\tAdam: Please, sally, will you hear me out? Don\u2019t push me away. Not now. Not after everything that has happened. (Smelling)\tAnnouncer: Additional sponsorship provided by\u2026 with a smooth clean shave,\tSally: How many times do I have to tell you I don\u2019t want you here right now and I do not want to see you?\tAdam: I know that seeing me is a painful reminder of everything that we just lost. Okay? I\u2013 I feel the same pain that you were feeling, but please just let me help you get through this. I mean, at least tell me how you\u2019re feeling.\tSally: I\u2019m fine, apparently. At least physically. Doctor encouraged me to walk around as much as I can.\tAdam: Well, that\u2019s good. I\u2019m glad that you survived it all, but emotionally, I know that you\u2019re as wrecked as I am. And look, I don\u2019t wanna push, but I feel like what I have to say will help you.\tSally: [ Sighing ] Adam, how many times do I have to tell you?\tAdam: Let\u2013 let me just\u2013 let me tell you why everything went down the way that it did. Now that the sad reality has a chance to sink in, let me explain more fully why I made the decision that I did.\tSally: I already know why you did it. I heard everything that you said when you thought that I was asleep earlier. I\u2013 I didn\u2019t miss a word. How much you still love me. And how hard that decision was for you to make. But\u2026 if you were faced with the same situation again, you would make the same decision and honestly, that is the last thing that I want to hear right now.\tNate: What\u2019s going on, nick? Where\u2019s all this hostility coming from?\tNick: Don\u2019t insult my intelligence.\tNate: I\u2019m not insulting your intelligence. Why would I do that, nick? What is the problem?\tNick: You. You\u2019re the problem. I knew day one hiring you was a big mistake.\tNate: Mistake? I brought nothing but success to newman media.\tNick: Oh, I don\u2019t deny that. You seem to be a very quick study.\tNate: So what if I am? The numbers don\u2019t lie and I have a great mentor.\tNick: Oh, is that what she is? A mentor? Or is she a target? Like what you tried to pull with your families company?\t[ Nate laughing ]\tNate: Really, nick? I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re still throwing that back in my face.\tNick: And I can\u2019t believe you think a betrayal like that could be so easily forgotten. I mean, I gotta wonder how far you would have taken this if elena hadn\u2019t made you come clean. I mean, would you and my sister be running your family\u2019s company? The one you tried to steal from your cousins right now? What I find really interesting about this, nate, is my sister seems to be pretty central to all of your big power moves.\tVictoria: Believe me, nicholas will get past his initial upset and he\u2019ll realize that he truly needs this little break.\tNikki: I doubt that very much. Why are you forcing this on him? Especially with everything else that\u2019s going on in his life right now? I asked you not to push him, or at the very least, let him make the decision.\tVictoria: You know how stubborn he can be. Besides, his ordeal with cameron and sally losing her baby, it\u2019s too much for anyone to handle all at once.\t", "Nikki: Victoria, you should have let him make the call.\tVictoria: I made the right decision for nicholas and for the company. He\u2013 he may not see that for himself right now.\tNikki: Well, I\u2019m not sure I can see it either. So, what happens next? What\u2019s your next move?\tVictoria: Next move? There is no next move. How many times do I have to say it? This isn\u2019t part of some scheme to oust my brother from the company and quite frankly, I am sick and tired of people second guessing my decisions for this company.\tVictor: What\u2019s going on? That\u2019s me before dawn powerwash.\tNikki: Victoria has forced nicholas to take a leave of absence.\tVictor: Why would you do that?\tNikki: Well, because she decided that with all the trauma, with sally losing her baby and cameron kirsten terrorizing sharon and faith, that he must take a break from the company, whether he wants to or not.\tVictoria: Nicholas thinks that he can handle this all. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s wise. And I told him as much. And I\u2013 I brought up the idea of him taking a little time off.\tNikki: Which, if you recall, is exactly what I asked you after the whole ashland locke debacle, but you refused to take time off. You said you needed to focus on work.\tVictoria: But\u2013 look, those are completely different situations. You can\u2019t compare the two. Three of the women in nick\u2019s life that he loves the most have been through horrific situations and they need him right now.\tNikki: Nicholas knows what he needs to do to take care of his family.\tVictor: Your brother is perfectly capable of focusing on his job while handling his personal affairs.\tVictoria: But this is not about his capability. I\u2019m not worried about that. What I\u2019m worried about is him carrying around this heavy burden on top of his workload. And look, newman is in a strong enough position. We can afford for nick to take a little time to himself. He\u2019ll thank me for it later,\tNikki: But who are you to make that decision for him?\tVictoria: It\u2019s my decision to make. I am looking out for everyone concerned, including this company.\tNikki: Did you ever stop to think that nicholas needs a distraction like work with everything else that\u2019s going on with him right now?\tVictoria: Why is everyone making such a big deal out of this?\tNikki: While I suspect that there\u2019s more at play here than you\u2019re saying. And I believe it has something to do with your relationship with nate hastings.\tNate: You\u2019re way off the mark here, nick. There is no clandestine plan going on with victoria and me.\tNick: Why should i believe you?\tNate: Look, I know you\u2019re going through a lot of personal issues right now, and I get it. It\u2019s a lot for anyone to handle, so I\u2019m going to give you a break and cut you some slack this time.\tNick: Don\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t use that against me. You and victoria are using my personal issues to shove me aside.\tNate: Nobody is trying to shove you aside.\tNick: Nate, just stop, all right? And don\u2019t act like you didn\u2019t know vic was going to force me into this leave of absence. I mean, how long is it going to be before she makes you interim coo? Or has she done that already?\tAdam: I don\u2019t regret that you heard me pour my heart out. Maybe if I\u2019d known you were listening, I wouldn\u2019t have opened up so completely, but I did. You heard it all. You heard the hard, painful truth.\tSally: Please, adam.\tAdam: What? What, sally?\t[ Sally sighing ] Talk to me. Did I say something that brought up questions you want answered? Or is there something you want to say back to me?\tSally: There\u2019s nothing that can change or fix this decision that you\u2019ve made. How can I ever forgive you? Why didn\u2019t you give the word to save our baby\u2019s life?\tAdam: Don\u2019t you see? I couldn\u2019T. I had to give the word to save yours. She found it.\tAdam: Don\u2019t\u2013 don\u2019t push me away. Just\u2013 just hear me out. How could you think that I could give a blanket permission that could take your life?\tSally: So, instead, you sacrificed our baby.\tAdam: I had to make a lifesaving decision. Time was of the essence. Okay, when you\u2013 when you heard me before, you couldn\u2019t look into my eyes, but now you can. Sally, we have never been able to lie to each other with much success, but if you would just look at me, you will know that I mean every word. You will see how much I am grieving our little baby girl and how I will never get over something like that, but at least I\u2019m not grieving you. Even if I had opted to save the baby, there was no guarantee that she was going to live. I couldn\u2019t risk losing both of you. And I\u2019ll never regret saving you because you deserve to live.\tSally: Yes, but ava deserved to live too.\tAdam: But you will be a mother again someday. You\u2019ll be the mother that you always wanted to be. And even though I won\u2019t be the father, your next baby will be the luckiest little being in the world. Because she\u2019ll have you as her mother. If I could only save one life for sure, it had to be yours.\tSally: Just go. Please just go.\tVictoria: Why would you assume that nick\u2019s leave of absence has anything to do with nate?\tNikki: Well, it\u2019s pretty obvious since he\u2019s already delegating newman media work to audra.\tVictoria: And? Is there a problem with that? I mean, she is his coo.\tNikki: It\u2019s very presumptuous, victoria.\t"], "answer": [3, 4, 0, 1, 2]}

So let\u2019s keep this short. Okay, short. It is, uh, as we\u2019ve discussed, my client has agreed to testify against Colin Bedford in exchange for some certain considerations. Actually, I\u2019ve changed my mind about that. Excuse me. Yeah.\tI think it sets a terrible precedent for a truly dangerous criminal to be given a walk in exchange for pointing the finger at our co-conspirator. Okay, well, it\u2019s not your job to decide whether she\u2019s dangerous or a criminal. It\u2019s the court\u2019s job. And in court I will present an open and closed case that will put Ms.\tHunter away for a long, long time.\tI hope that if we went over everything again, maybe. So maybe we\u2019d find something that we\u2019d missed and all we missed was a night\u2019s sleep. Yeah, thanks. Now they said the academy, that missing person cases go dry after three days. It\u2019s been missing now almost three weeks. Rafe, we\u2019ll find him. Yeah,\tthat that\u2019s great. I will. Thank you so much. That was the Salem Health Department. They\u2019re letting me reopen sweet bits. That\u2019s wonderful, baby. Oh mama. I\u2019m sorry. It wasn\u2019t news about Abe. I keep saying to myself any day now, his memory will come back. The doctor said it could, and my, my phone will ring and it will be him.\tI\u2019ll go wherever he is and bring him home.\tTime for breakfast time. Breakfast from my baby. Here we go. Here we go. Bon Appit boat meal again. Well, it\u2019s, it\u2019s heart healthy, and I want you to live a long life. Well, facing this every morning is going to seem like a long life. You know, when we renewed our vows yesterday, I promised to love you through sickness and health, and I\u2019m gonna do my best to make sure that it\u2019s mainly in health.\tWasn\u2019t it nice to say those words again? Yesterday? Would\u2019ve been nicer if we\u2019d had our family there. Oh wow. That means you\u2019re gonna really like the surprise that I have for you. Bacon. Oh, it\u2019s better than bacon. Your son is back in Salem,\tTheo. Oh my God. It is so good to see you again. Hi Kate. Oh, honey, I wish it was under circumstances. Me too. Listen, I uh, I heard your speech at Juneteenth. No, no, my, that was my dad\u2019s speech. No, honey, you made that speech your own. He would be so proud of you. Do you think he\u2019s gonna be okay? Of course I do.\tYou know how strong he is? Right now I know that he is working on getting back to you. I wish that I could be so short.\tTheo thought you told me he lived overseas. He did, but he came back home because of your situation. So I\u2019m going to see him. That\u2019s right. You know, I\u2019m thinking if I can see my son, my own flesh and blood, then I can remember him and then I can remember everything.\tLike Sam through the hour. So are the days of lives.\tYou know, your dad and I had known each other for a long time, but I think I really got to know him. When thanks to me, you were in the hospital fighting for your life. No, I think that was, thanks to me being shot. Yeah. But that was my fault, you know? No, he never left your bedside ever, except of course when the doctors would, would make him leave your room.\tI watched him go through parent hell, and he never wavered. I think, I think it was his love for you that we\u2019ll do to come back and I, I really believe that that same love is gonna wheel him back to you. I hope you\u2019re right.\tI\u2019m sorry, I, I have to go. Someone needs me right now. Okay. Phil, what is it?\tNow, Abe, listen to me. I I don\u2019t want you to get your hopes up. You know, you may not remember him right away, and that\u2019s okay. I keep telling you these kinds of cases. Sometimes they just take time. Wait a minute, why isn\u2019t he here? I mean, if he came here to see me, why? Why didn\u2019t he come straight here? Well, because seeing him right away is gonna be stressful for both of you.\tHe wanted me to break it to you first, and so I did. And I just texted him and he\u2019s on his way.\tEli. Whoa. What\u2019s happening man? Wow. It\u2019s good to see you. Hey, you doing hi? Looking good, man. Thanks. You too. Uh, hey, um, this is, uh, Jada. I don\u2019t think you two, I\u2019m sorry. Detective Hunter, this is, uh, Eli Grant. F b I used to work at Salem pd. Nice to meet you. Same here. Yeah. He\u2019s also Abe\u2019s, uh, son-in-law. Oh.\t", "Okay? There is no need to pile on Melinda. Oh, am I supposed to be polite to her? I am a fit and healthy woman. And your drugs that you put in those biscuits sent me to the emergency room. Heaving my guts out all night long. It could have killed a child, a senior, anyone with a compromised immune system. Did you even think about that?\tDid you? Okay. Did you think about the fact that she actually saved Chanel and Paulina\u2019s life and nearly died in the process? You would\u2019ve never been on that roof in the first place if it wasn\u2019t for your client. Look, I don\u2019t take my job lightly, and I\u2019ve gone over and over the evidence. And there is nothing there that indicates any kind of leniency.\tOkay, here\u2019s something new.\tI got Jack. There you go. Okay. I\u2019m a little nervous. I, I just hope I, I, I hope I recognize him. If I don\u2019t, I, I don\u2019t know how that make him feel. Oh God. I told him about your condition. He\u2019ll understand. You seem a little nervous. Maybe just a little. Are you and Theo getting along? Well, to be honest, we don\u2019t really know each other that well.\tI\u2019ll get it.\tWell, here he is, your son, Philo. Hello Pops.\tI also think that Toya is working some angle trying to convince everyone that all the things she did were Colin\u2019s fault. Is that what she said? No. No. She apologized and tried to take responsibility for what she did. So tell me this, are you thinking of forgiving her?\tOh, I\u2019ll get it. Hmm.\tHey y\u2019all. Oh, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here, honey. Hey, I came as soon as I got your text. What\u2019s up? Oh, mama Price is uh, leaving for Florida this morning and she wouldn\u2019t leave us saying goodbye to you. What she actually said was, I have to see that handsome face of his. One more time.\tIs this my son? Yes it is. It\u2019s uh, good to see you again, pops. Thank you for coming. No problem, sir. Uh, you really don\u2019t remember me? I am, I\u2019m sorry. I, I don\u2019t, well just give it time. You two just need to get to know each other again. Theo, sit down.\tUh, yes. Would you, uh, like some coffee? Uh, no, I\u2019m good. Oh.\tUh, uh, so, uh, how was your flight? Uh, it was good. Long. Yeah? Yeah. So, uh, where, where are you living now? Uh, south America, South Africa. I, uh, sorry, uh, a major jet lag. I had a layover in Brazil. I got mixed up. You, you had a stop over in Brazil on a flight from South Africa. That\u2019s, uh, Boy, that\u2019s way out of the way.\tI, uh, got a deal. Cheap flights. Huh? Must have had it whole day. You know, you know what aid You are always so good at geography. You know me. I get lost on my way to the hospital sometimes. Oh, pops. Would you mind if I had a talk with Paulina out in the corridor? Why I, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessary. Paulina, right, please.\tYes. Excuse us. Let\u2019s talk.\tYou didn\u2019t tell me that The guy you were talking about was the mayor. What has she been with? Amnesia. He\u2019s no fool. I mean, he\u2019s not only good at geography, but he knows damn well there\u2019s something going on. Because like an idiot. You said that you were from South America. I gave you Theo\u2019s background. I didn\u2019t have time to read all that stuff you sent and, and I, I didn\u2019t expect to get grilled or, or that or that.\tWhat? That he\u2019s a good guy who needs help, needs his real family. I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t do this. You mean nothing can come of it? She\u2019s single, right? She is. Okay. Well so are you. What\u2019s the problem? Good jobs. Okay. Look, I know from experience that two cops getting together isn\u2019t easy, but Lonnie and I proved that it\u2019s possible.\tYou and Lonnie were partners. I\u2019m Jade\u2019s boss. Okay. And there are now new regulations in place. Fraternization with a subordinate is now grounds for dismissal. Yeah. Forgot about those new regulations. Mm-hmm. That sucks, man. Yeah. Uhhuh. And I know you\u2019re looking at me right now and you\u2019re thinking, oh man, this guy.\tHe\u2019s got some real bad luck when it comes to women. Oh no. Yeah, I was not thinking that bad. You were. Cause I saw you. All right. You were and you\u2019d be right. Yeah. Well, I am happy for race, happy for you. Well, there\u2019s nothing to be happy about. I mean, the only reason he kissed me was because he was high on those tainted biscuits.\t", "Okay, but what if I do? If he starts asking me about his life or fine, oh my God, you\u2019re an actor. Just improvise. Improvise. Yeah. Right, right, right. Just make some stuff up, like talk to him. Your, your guys. Do guy talk sports or something? I don\u2019t know.\tHello? This king? Yes, this is she. This is Agent Eli Gran the fbi. I\u2019m investigating the disappearance of Abe Carver. I need you to come down to the police station right away. Oh, I, I can\u2019t, my cat is sick and I can\u2019t leave him. Okay, then I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll come to you. No, no, no, no. That\u2019s not necessary. I\u2019ll just have a neighbor come over.\tMm-hmm. I\u2019ll see you soon.\tLook, um, I, I need you to go in there and, and, and just be with him. I, I got some place I gotta go. Hey, look, you\u2019ve spent an hour and I, I won\u2019t take that long. Um, I\u2019ll give you an extra hundred. Look, I, I, I, I need you to stay with him and I gotta go, alright? Okay. Okay. See and cash. Remember, I,\tI\u2019m back pops. What were you talking about out there? Where\u2019s, where\u2019s, where\u2019s Paulina? What\u2019s going on here?\tHey. Hey. Hello. Hey. Oh, how\u2019s Shawn? Uh, he\u2019s not doing great. He\u2019s still reeling after everything that happened in Greece. Oh, well that\u2019s understandable. Yeah. On top of that, he\u2019s feeling pretty guilty about not being able to help find Abe. Oh, you know what? Tell him not to worry. Eli\u2019s here. We got it covered, but, uh, is there anything I can do for you?\tUh, actually I\u2019m here to see Jada. I have news about Talia\u2019s case. I will file my recommendation with the court community service, and, uh, probation and continuing to see Dr. Evans.\tThank you so much. I never expected this to happen. If there\u2019s anything I can do, You can keep going to therapy and work on your self-worth. Get to a place where you can feel that you deserve to be treated with kindness and respect so that what happened with you and Colin Bedford will not happen again.\tSo we were talking about Talia before Theo showed up. Are you thinking of forgiving her hearing Talia talk about Colin. It wasn\u2019t just the things he said or did, it was more about the way he manipulated her. He played on her insecurities, took advantage of the way she felt about him to get her to do things that she didn\u2019t really wanna do.\tEmotional abuse, like what Ray did to me, Colin\u2019s father did to me. Yeah, all too similar. So you think Charlie was a victim in all this? She loved Colin and she was afraid that she\u2019d lose him if she didn\u2019t do what he. Told her to do. And as, as much as I hate what she put you through, put us all through, she\u2019s in pain, real pain, and it\u2019s going to take her a long time to get over it.\tWhat, you didn\u2019t answer me, what did you have to talk to her about? Uh, okay. Okay. Uh, Paulina got a call. She, uh, had to run an errand. You still didn\u2019t answer my question. What did you and Paulina have to talk about alone? Um, uh, you want the truth? Um, I asked her if my showing up here. Upset. You see? I mean, I mean, yeah.\tIt, it, it\u2019s, it\u2019s weird. I don\u2019t know how to talk to you when you don\u2019t, when when? I don\u2019t remember you. Yeah. I\u2019m sorry. It, it is weird. I\u2019m sorry. Hey, it\u2019s, it\u2019s not your fault, so I guess we just gotta try to get to know each other again. It\u2019s okay if I sit. Yeah, of course. Of course. Please do.\tSo, uh, how about those white socks?\t", "Figured. I\u2019d come by and see if there\u2019s any, anything I can do to help. Great. Well hopefully a fresh pair of eyes will help us find something that we missed. Yeah. This is everything we got. All right. You guys been pretty thorough? Oh yeah. Yeah. We spent the night going over everything, but, uh, nothing\u2019s jumping out at us.\tSo, uh, let me walk you through So far. No, no, no. Jada, you go home. You\u2019ve already been here all night. Well, so have you go home, get something to eat and get some rest. That\u2019s an order. Has he always been this wishy That\u2019s one of his best qualities. So, go on. I\u2019ll let you know if something happens here.\tPlease do. Okay, Eli, it was great meeting you. Hopefully you can bring us some luck. Yeah, have a good one. See ya.\tShe\u2019s great. She\u2019s great. She\u2019s been through a lobby. She never gives up. She\u2019s not real. Ask that to the team.\tWhat, what with the look? No, no. It\u2019s. I\u2019m, I\u2019m happy for you. Oh, you\u2019re, you\u2019re okay. You\u2019re happy for me? Yeah. She seems like you know. Good girl. Clearly there\u2019s something going on between you two.\tI know you\u2019re not gonna deny it.\tAll I said was that Jada has an incredible work ethic and that she\u2019s been a real asset to the team. And yeah, you know, it\u2019s been intense between us because we have been working so closely together, especially on this case, and I have worked a lot of big cases and as intense as they\u2019ve been. I don\u2019t recall us ever holding Nance when I walked in.\tY\u2019all were holding Nance.\tOkay, fine. Mm, fine. All right. Jada and I are, we\u2019re attracted to each other, but we also both know that nothing can come of it.\tJada. Hi. Oh my God, Kate. Oh my goodness. I am so glad to see you alive and back. Well, how do you think I feel, you know, this probably shouldn\u2019t be the first thing I say to you, but you look like you\u2019re feeling a little rough. Well, don\u2019t sugarcoat it. Well, I\u2019m just saying you dragged yourself in here. Did you have a night on the town?\tYeah, a night on the town at the station house going over Abe\u2019s case. Oh yeah, I know. I\u2019m so sorry. Of course. Of course. I\u2019ll tell you. It\u2019s just a nightmare, isn\u2019t it? I\u2019m just praying that he is somewhere alive and well. Yeah, we are all praying that. Ralph and I spent the night going over yet again.\tEverything that we have, right. You know, um, I hope you\u2019re a personal relationship isn\u2019t going to be a distraction, you know, working on the case now, why would it be? Well, I mean, I have to admit that I do read Lady Whistle. Lowers column every once in a while. And, uh, recently she reported that you and Ray were seen being affectionate in the office.\tSo kissing you mean? Yeah. Well I wasn\u2019t being so blunt. I mean, but it\u2019s not like I had put stock in idle gossip anyway. Well, it\u2019s, it\u2019s not idle gossip. It\u2019s, it\u2019s the truth.\tBig mama\u2019s packing to go home. And of course she wouldn\u2019t even hear of me trying to help. She\u2019s pretty upset about going home before we found aid. What\u2019d you say? Nothing important. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah. I, uh, was just about to post the job opening at Sweet Bits, and then I got caught in a bag. Kind of dejavu reminded you of Talia?\tNo, I didn\u2019t need to be reminded. I ran into her yesterday. She\u2019s out on bail. Did she threaten you? No, nothing like that. She was putting up posters asking if anyone had seen Abe, why would she be doing that? She was probably trying to help her case so that the DA will go easy on her. Wait, but you said that Talia, let me handle this.\tMy client and Colin Bedford are not co-conspirators. Yes, Talia committed some crimes at his instigation, which means that he is responsible for everything Talia did at his behest. But let\u2019s not forget that on his own, he held a gun to Chanel Dupre\u2019s, head to coerce Paulina Price to jump off a five story building.\tDo you really think a guy like that should walk? Because without my client\u2019s testimony, without your client\u2019s testimony, I still have a rock solid case against Bedford. Ms. Hunter\u2019s own sister, a Salem police officer is an eyewitness to what happened on that roof, and Paulina Price will testify to his attack against Mayor Carver, which will give me enough to lock your boyfriend up for a very long time.\tHe\u2019s not my boyfriend. Not anymore. Well, that\u2019s probably for the best I\u2019ve heard. It\u2019s hard to keep a relationship when each of you are serving long sentences in different correctional facilities. Oh, watch it more. I\u2019ve got your confession to your own sister about you drugging those biscuits. And trashing Paulina Price\u2019s office, which means I can use your own words to prove to the judge and jury that you are guilty as hell.\t"], "answer": [1, 4, 2, 0, 3]}

Based on what, how could you ask that this guy had you committing crimes for him and you told me that he had a temper? Uh, I\u2019m not naive. Okay. Like, yes, I know that Colin has done some terrible things, but I mean, he didn\u2019t just do them for no reason. Say that he had a hard life. You know, I believe we had a conversation about this sometime before Natalia, and I believe that I pointed out that a lot of people have had a hard life and they don\u2019t resort to trying to murder people.\tIn fact, I know a lot of people who have had a hard life, and you know what? It\u2019s made them stronger because they had to fight. They had to be resilient. I mean, Talia, how can you just sit here and be okay and give this man a pass because he had a hard life. So you\u2019re telling me that anything Colin Bedford does is justified?\tNo, of course not. He could have killed Mayor Carver. He could have killed Paulina and Chanel. Hell, he could have killed me. Look, I know that. Okay. Why do you think that I pushed him off the roof. That is why I was trying to save you. I was trying to save Chanel. I was trying to save Paulina, and I know that I\u2019ve made a lot of excuses for Colin before.\tWhen I saw him point that gun at Chanel Jay, I know she knew I had to do something.

You were attacked by a horrible and despicable man, and I don\u2019t see how anyone could hurt anyone As Sweden and kind as you are. Gentle.

How did you get involved in this?\tI found out Nicole was pregnant because she dropped her prenatal vitamins in front of me, and then I just happened to run into her again after Kayla had given her a paternity test kit. Yeah, she didn\u2019t know how she was gonna get the DNA n a samples from you or EJ without one of you knowing. So I told her I could get one from you, which I did.\tBJ proposed. When did this happen? Why didn\u2019t you tell me? Well, because I turned him down. I, I didn\u2019t feel like it was a sincere proposal. Not sincere. Let\u2019s just say EJ started caving to peer pressure. We found out that Stephan. Proposed to Gabby. So EJ started to get worried and soon they would be a couple and it would look like that Stefan had the advantage and you know, more people in the rinks, so to speak.\tSo EJ thought if he proposed to me, there would be another dememer on his side. At least that\u2019s how I saw it. And you told him that\u2019s how you saw it? Oh yes. I was very blunt. Yeah. Well, I can\u2019t imagine that he reacted well to that.\tActually, that\u2019s when he told me he loved me. Oh, I almost forgot that part. That very important part. So how did you react to that? Do you love ej? Nicole? Look, I told you why I did it. Colin convinced me of how awful Paulina and Chante were and that justified C committed crimes against them because that sick bastard decided that they needed to be punished.\tLook, it\u2019s not like I said yes right away. I was against it at first.\tBut then I saw how much it meant to him, and he said If I truly loved him, then I would do whatever he wanted. Dear God, look, I was afraid of losing him, so you did whatever this guy said because you were afraid that he would leave you. I was in love, Gina. Okay, and when you\u2019re in love, I don\u2019t know. You, you do things that make that person happy, not illegal.\tCriminal cruel things. Talia, you\u2019re smarter than that. You are a better person than that. Yeah. Well, apparently not. Jayna. I tried, I I tried to talk him out of it. I swear I did, I promise. But every single time I tried to convince him that what we were doing were wrong and that Paulina and Chanel were actually cut decent people.\tI don\u2019t know. He, he would just get mad and I would, I would just drop him. What do you mean? He would get mad. He had a temper and he would accuse me of not caring enough of being a coward.

She\u2019s a grown woman and she can make her own decisions. I. Never ever forced her to do a damn thing that she didn\u2019t want to do. Uhhuh. Right.

Okay.\t", "And he\u2019s, he\u2019s never recovered from that. So yes, he gets upset when things don\u2019t go his way, and when he did get mad at me, it\u2019s like he was sorry. Almost immediately. He would literally go out of his way to make it up to me, to show me how much he loved me. Like he\u2019d, he\u2019d go get me little presents. He would tell me how beautiful I was to him and how special I was to him.\tMy God. Snap outta it. Talia, can you please not be mad at me too? Oh God, I\u2019m sorry. Okay. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not mad at you. I am mad at this situation. I\u2019m mad that I was oblivious to any of this going on. I\u2019m, I\u2019m sad heartbroken. Really?

Someone here can probably help you find her. Well, even if I do find her, you, uh, I\u2019m almost too scared to even ask about Abe\u2019s condition, you know, almost lost 10 months before, and now with them taking so long to come back to me.

I can take it from here.\tOh, come on Nicole. Do you love ej? Or am I just being too nosy as usual? No, no. Anna, you are not being nosy. I know you\u2019re only asking because, you know, you\u2019re concerned for me and, and for ej, but it, it\u2019s just, it\u2019s, it\u2019s complicated. Mm-hmm. EJ and I haven\u2019t been back together that long and, and, and like I said, I.\tI do care for him and we do have a long history and it obviously, I loved him enough at one time to, to marry him not long ago.

I\u2019m not trying to put you on the spot, and I hope you know that no matter what I am on your side. I do, I do know that, Anna, but please, can you, can you stop?

Were you able to get a, a DNA sample from each a. Unfortunately, no. No, but that sleeping pill should have knocked him out like a light. I, I\u2019m sure it would\u2019ve if he had taken it, but he got called away on business before he could. Oh no. Darn it. Well, when do you expect him back?\tI don\u2019t know, but, uh, it doesn\u2019t matter. What are you talking about? How will you get a sample now? I don\u2019t have to. Sloane did she got one from Eric last night.\tOh, that was fast. Helps when you know the owner, I got us an egg sandwich with cheese and a black coffee for you. Ah, that\u2019s so sweet of you. Yeah. Do you mind if I just take it to go though? I kind of wanna get to the hospital and check on Colin. Yeah. Well, you need to take a test first, right? Test. Yeah. The virus outbreak that you and Nicole went on and on about, on the 10th floor.\tRemember you even said you had to prove it to the hospital that you weren\u2019t carrying the virus before they let you visit. Oh, right. Actually, I just called the hospital. They said apparently, I don\u2019t know, they contained the virus. So I don\u2019t have to take the test today. Great. Truth is you never had to take a test, did you?\tSo you think I\u2019m pulling a price? Huh? What? Do all black women look alike to you? No. No, no. I just, I only seen you from the back and a little on edge, as you can imagine. Yeah. On edge and nasty and rude here. This is some medicine to ease your pain. Although you don\u2019t really deserve it, do you for all the pain that you caused our beloved mayor, no full story.\tAll right. Uh, maybe I should just ask to assign another nurse. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Mr. Bedford, I am your nurse whether you like it or not, and I will do my professional best to heal your body, but you are gonna have to heal your own soul. You hear me? Young man, it\u2019s gonna take prayer and, and humility and repenting for your sins and.\tIf you believe this with your whole heart, maybe the good Lord will see fit to allow you entry into the kingdom of heaven.\tYou\u2019re seriously worried about that monster at a time like this. Have you forgotten where you are and what you did to aid? And I bet that son of a bitch, the only person that you need to worry about right now is Talia. Look, okay. I know this is bad, okay? But I mean, this is my first defense. They can\u2019t go that hard on me.\tRight? Wrong. I just had a visit with Da Trask and she intends to throw the fuck at you. Wait, what? You can\u2019t be surprised. She was one of your victims. She ended up in the hospital thanks to your poisoned biscuits. She could have died, although as as tragic as I would\u2019ve been. I mean, that would\u2019ve been better for you because now you have a pissed off.\tA very pissed off district attorney who is gunning for you. Love you. Why Talia?

And for that I am so, so sorry.\tOh my God.\tOh, oh, I got you. You\u2019re awake. I I wait until I\u2019m gonna get back. Actually, I\u2019m gonna, I\u2019m gonna text her. I\u2019m gonna text her right now. Where,\twhere am I? Oh, um, you\u2019re, you\u2019re in the hospital. Do you remember what happened?\tWell, um, you were attacked, you were hit over the head and then you had to get brain surgery, but now you\u2019re awake and you\u2019re gonna be okay. Thank God. Thank God.\tWho are you?\tColin Bedford. I\u2019m Commissioner Hernandez. As you know, you\u2019re under arrest. I just wanted you to know that you\u2019re gonna be facing a long list of charges. Attempted murder, kidnapping, false imprisonment. Is that it? Well, I\u2019ve probably forgotten about a few, but, uh, well, there\u2019s plenty of time for that. In fact, your doctors tell me that you\u2019re all enough to be discharged.\tSo I got a detail on its way down here to take you to the station. Well, you\u2019ll be booked, officially charged, and then, uh, taken to a holding cell. What about Talia? What about Talia? Anyone should be charged with attempted murder.\tHelp me understand this. Okay. You graduated at the top of your med school class. You had your pick of residencies all across the country. You were on track to star what was sure to be an amazing career. But instead you, you threw that all away. To what? To come to Salem. To what? To terrorize two people that you didn\u2019t even know.\tI didn\u2019t terrorize them then, what would you call it, Talia, you trash polling in\u2019s office. You, you tried to ruin Chanel\u2019s business by poisoning half the town. People were seriously hurt because of you. Okay. I get it. Okay. I feel bad enough as it is. I get it.\tOh, I don\u2019t think that you do, and I wasn\u2019t kidding earlier. You are incredibly lucky that no one suffered permanent damage or worse. Why Talia? Why in God\u2019s name would you wanna hurt so many people that you don\u2019t even know? I mean, especially Paul and Chanel. I did it for Colin, but that\u2019s what I don\u2019t understand.\tWhat kinda spell did the sick bastard have you under? Why would you do it? What would make you do this?\tSloan got a DNA sample from Eric. You mean that woman that Eric has been seeing? Yes, she found out that I was pregnant through an unhappy accident, although maybe not so unhappy because she agreed to help me get the samples for the paternity test, and she got a swab from Eric last night. Okay. Well that\u2019s good, but don\u2019t you need to get a swab from EJ as well?\tWell, only if this was a legal case and hopefully it will never go there. But Kayla said she only needs one sample for comparison. And if she does have a swab from Eric and the d n A doesn\u2019t match, then, then the baby must be ejs.\tListen, I, I have to go, I\u2019m, I\u2019m meeting Sloan at the park and she\u2019s gonna give me the swab. Okay. Okay. But Nicole, there is one thing I\u2019ve been meaning to ask you. Okay. What is it, Anna? Well, I know I did ask you before if, if you wanted this baby to be Eric\u2019s and you didn\u2019t answer me, so, um, maybe if I ask you a different question, if you find out that this baby is Eric\u2019s, what does that mean for you and ej?\tHonestly, I, I\u2019ve been so stressed out about who this baby belongs to. I, I haven\u2019t even thought about it. Well, I can only assume he will be fairly upset. Yeah. Especially since he just told me he loves me. He did right after he proposed,\tEric, what are you talking about? Why wouldn\u2019t I have to take a test? I talked to my mother. I was checking on Abe to see how he was doing or if I could visit him today. Or if the hospital still had restrictions on visitors because of the virus. She had no idea what I was talking about. Okay. Well, maybe she just wasn\u2019t aware.\tI mean, Eric, your mother\u2019s been slow. Stop. I know you were lying. You lied to me yesterday. You and Nicole didn\u2019t have to take some test for some non-existent virus. What was that test for?\tYou\u2019re clearly keeping something from me.

Well, okay, so \u2014 so as a doctor, you know, given your condition, I\u2019m gonna make a strong medical recommendation that you not go anywhere dangerous outside of the U.S. Because if something were to happen, you\u2019d need reliable medical care and you don\u2019t speak the language. Am I right? So you\u2019ll need a translator, you\u2019ll need a knowledgeable guide, and you will need considerable, you know, military kind of level protection. And let me ask you \u2014 if something went wrong, do you have a foolproof way to get back out of the country and get back home? Is this your medical advice? I mean, yes, but \u2014 yeah, y-you\u2019re not wrong. I mean, I\u2019m a doctor, but I\u2019m also a citizen. And, you know, as one of your constituents, I have some concerns.

Let me get this straight. Victor blamed you. The man who\u2019s broken every damn law and commandment that ever existed is blaming you for trying to save your mother\u2019s life. Who in the hell is he to pass judgment? Uncle Roman. Eddie. You know mom or here? She\u2019s Jeremy new one, but she\u2019s not. I am. So I guess the privilege is all mine.\tNo, no, no. Go Roman. No, don\u2019t. Please. It\u2019s bad enough in there. My mom and Sierra, they can barely keep it together as it is. What pompous as he can\u2019t just get away with it. He\u2019s, he\u2019s not getting away with anything. He\u2019s telling the truth. I\u2019m the one that fired the shot. You thought your dead was gonna kill your mom.\tYeah, but I was wrong. Okay. He wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s not like I just shot him in the, the leg and I like, I just disarm him or something and he.\tHe\u2019s just lying in there. He\u2019s lying in that bed and he may never, he may never come out of it. He\u2019s gone, come on, come here.\tThat\u2019s my father in there, and I missed him so much. He\u2019s a good man and he kidnapped Kayla and we thought he killed Kate. Yep, but he didn\u2019t. That right there, that just proves it, proves that I made the wrong call.\tThis your handy work. It\u2019s been a busy night.\tI am sure you both have spaces reserved in the der crypt, but you\u2019re just gonna have to settle for burial. Let\u2019s see,\tthe calvary has finally arrived. Make yourselves at home. Too bad I still have a gun point in the head of the woman\tyou wanted to dance with me dear. Good dance move.\tThank God you\u2019re okay. Oh, thanks to you. Okay. I already radioed this, uh, coast Guard. Come pick up this clown. And you are? Uh, this is Commander Michaels. Wow. Nice to meet you, commander. You have a perfect sense of timing. Hello Steve. How are things? Getting a whole lot better. Kate, how about with you? Same.\tThanks. Well, I\u2019ll stay here and babysit this guy while you two get Kate back to the mainland. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re looking forward to getting off this boat as soon as possible. Well, I am not going to argue with that and as soon as we are on dry land, drinks are on me.\tI don\u2019t think I like becoming a better person. Ready, ready to backslide already. Maybe.\tI just feel bad about everything bad that Uncle Vic and Auntie Mag don\u2019t trust me bad. That now I\u2019m letting her down as she\u2019s taking care of Uncle Vic. Bad that she has to worry about tightening and Uncle Victor and I, worst of all, worst of all, I feel bad that now you\u2019re in trouble with Maggie too. I just feel bad for messing up everything.\tFor everybody. I hate feeling bad. Not many people like it. You know, things were so much more simple when I was just shallow and self-absorbed. Really, and you were so good at it. Yeah. Until I met you. You really screwed me up Johnson. Right outta nowhere. You blew me right off course I did. You did.\tYou know, one of the things I\u2019m working on right now with Dr. Evans is, uh,\tIt\u2019s giving up meaningless sex. Okay? The thing is, before I met you, I didn\u2019t know I was having meaningless sex. Uh, I thought it was great, not meaningless. Then I saw the way that you looked at me. I started looking at myself the same way. I\u2019m sorry. I guess don\u2019t be really, it\u2019s not your faulty ride on my league.\t", "It\u2019s one of the main reasons why I\u2019m trying to change. It just kills me to let her down. I don\u2019t think you did. Look, I was in that meeting. You were doing everything you could to save the deal. Steph, you said it yourself. I\u2019m not authorized to change the terms of the agreement. I beg this woman to put me in charge.\tI swore I would tell the lion and then as soon as she does, I disobey her direct orders. Okay. Because, because. You are blindsided by Yuri\u2019s misgivings and, and you were just trying to be open-minded.\tLook, I got Seth Burns to unfi my mom. I\u2019m gonna call Maggie right now and work the same magic with her.\tYou would think after all these years, I would be used to not hearing from Steve. Right. Well, could you call Michaels, Roman said he was helping with the search. I think he would be about as impossible to get ahold of. How is Roman doing?\tThe way Roman always is, his facade does not crack. I mean, he has been through so much. He was scattering Kate\u2019s ashes in Ireland, and then soon after that he finds out that she\u2019s alive. Alive but in danger. And then he finds out that bow\u2019s alive, but he is not the bow. We remember he is a bow who kidnaps people and now he\u2019s in a coma.\tAnd now he\u2019s in a coma. Kayla, I am really worried about Sean. He did what he had to do. He thought Bo was gonna shoot his mother. Oh God, come on. He\u2019s Irish. Guilt trump\u2019s reality. If Bo doesn\u2019t make it, Sean is gonna spend the rest of his life blaming himself. For killing his own dad.\tYou okay? Stupid question, but for real. What\u2019s going on? Look, I just, I done seeing my dad. Any change? No. He\u2019s still in a coma and nothing that indicates that he\u2019s ever gonna come out of it. Well, you know what I mean? Come on. We just gotta keep faith. Hook a positive outlook at it at a decade of rosary.\tHe\u2019s not gonna change anything. Listen, I shot my father and now my mother is. Your mother needs you. Your mother needs you, Sean. Alright, so you know what? Let\u2019s go take a walk around the block, get some air. A walk is not gonna help either. Nothing\u2019s gonna change the fact that Victor was right, right above what that this is my fault.\tWell, agent Graham, it appears we\u2019re at a standoff. The name is my Moisher. Dimitri of UN there. Well mine here, it really doesn\u2019t matter what your name is, we\u2019re still at a standoff. So in an order to ratchet down tension, I\u2019m gonna take this gun and I\u2019m gonna set it on this table here.\tSo how do we resolve this? But you just did, you put your gun down and now I shoot you. I know that\u2019s, it\u2019s true. You, you could, but you wouldn\u2019t profit much from that, would you? Do you have any idea how much those other Dera bastards would pay for my safe return? Oh, that is certainly something to consider.\tAnd, uh, upon further reflection, no, I think I\u2019d just still like to kill you both.\tSecond time, I\u2019ll take my chances with the isa.\tUh oh. That sounded like a gunshot to me. You don\u2019t think I was stupid enough to come here alone? Do you, so you have a host of Eyes Agents, a Black Patch investigator, and the Navy Seal, the Messers Johnson and Michaels, right? Yes. We have been expecting you. And that\u2019s why everyone on this ship is armed to the teeth and has standing orders to shoot, to kill.\tI got another one out in the corridor. I had the situation under control. Yeah, sure. I, I could tell. Did you have to fire your weapon and let everyone on board know that we\u2019re here? Don\u2019t feel like you gotta thank me for just saving your ass.\tThank you. Let\u2019s go find.\tTalk Don Maggie. I did and I told her that I was in the room for the meeting and, and, and said that if I was in the room and I didn\u2019t keep you in line, that Titan might be in the market for a new PR firm. You called to talk her outta firing me and she threatened to fire you. It\u2019ll all be fine, at least for me.\tBut Alex, I\u2019m so sorry. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s gonna give you your job back at least anytime soon. She seemed pretty upset.\t", "Auntie, if you just give me a chance to explain. Okay. I guess I don\u2019t get a chance to explain. She hung up. Are you sharp? Means she\u2019s embraced. Maybe the call got dropped. She told me there\u2019s nothing else to talk about, and she hung up. So she called to tell you there\u2019s nothing to talk about. No, she called to fire me.\tI can\u2019t believe that Seth Burns had the nerve to fire you. He found it unprofessional of me to not show up for work and not call in what you were being held captive. Apparently I needed a note from my kidnapper. I have to say, I did feel kind of sorry for him though. He clearly was disappointed that I wasn\u2019t dead.\tOh, what a little worm. You know, he is a little worm. That\u2019s why he caved so quickly when Stephanie gave him a preview of the disaster PR campaign that he\u2019d be facing. Ugh. There\u2019s still no word from Steve, huh? Nope. What time is it in Greece? You know, it doesn\u2019t matter. Years of experience has taught me that I am not gonna hear from Steve until he and Chad fight Kate.\tI patch clearing. Are you amazing? As a parrot cream beer, you\u2019re hilarious. Oh, and you\u2019re in over your head. The penalty for boarding the ship will stop permission. That\u2019s death, ready to wipe the plank.\tBall bastard. He fought hard and still ended up dead on that wall just like you\u2019re going. Don\u2019t.\tSo you don\u2019t want immunity for your crimes? Oh, no, no. I do. Along with something else. And I need everything. And it\u2019s precise place in order for me to achieve my goal. Please don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going after that damn peacock again. No. What I\u2019m after is of a much more personal nature. You see what I\u2019m hoping, Chad?\tThank God you\u2019re okay. I knew it. Yeah, you Thanks Are tad premature. You see Kate and I are on a date and you\u2019re not invited.\tLike sand through the hourglass. So are the days of our lives.\tSorry, pal, but you\u2019re not going anywhere. Sorry pal, but I don\u2019t think you thought this one through. Now how are you gonna kill me without hitting Kate here as well? And I doubt you\u2019re a very good shot, Mr. Damara. Oh, so you remember me? Of course I do. You\u2019re yet another one of Stefano Dara\u2019s bastard children.\tOh, I prefer love child. Mm. Well you certainly have his arrogance, but none of his cunning. You see, he wildly overplayed your cards by bursting in that door right there, brandish your little cap pistol. You if guaranteed that neither one of you are. Getting off of this boat a lie.\tI don\u2019t suppose we can talk about this. You can talk to the boss now. Drop the gun, start walking. Keep your hands up.\tYou\u2019re kind of dumb, aren\u2019t you? And you\u2019re going to be kind of dead. Hey, listen, if I were you, I wouldn\u2019t be making pirate jokes. I\u2019d be asking myself, where\u2019d this dude come from? Hmm? You think I just made a wrong turn in the middle of the agenda? Now listen man, this boat that you\u2019re defending, it\u2019s part of a global search, and the fact that I\u2019m on board means that global search was a success.\tThe Isa Interpol. Fbi, they all know where I am. Q E D. They know where you are, which means you don\u2019t have a rat\u2019s ass chance of getting away, and you don\u2019t have a rat ass chance of staying alive. Hey, hey, I\u2019m an ISSA agent. You know what happens if you kill an ISSA agent? Huh? The entire agency is devoted.\tTo making new pay. And when they get you, which they will, they\u2019ll put you in the deepest, darkest hole you\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019ll make Guantanamo Bay look like a vacation paradise. If you kill me, they will hurt you so bad, you\u2019ll be begging them to kill you.\tI love Maggie, but she should have given you a chance to explain why she was right. I blew the deal. Alex, you did not blow the deal. That guy, Yuri, he got cold feet, which may only be temporary. He said he was gonna sleep on it. Remember Alex? You didn\u2019t hear her voice stuff. She wasn\u2019t angry. She was just sad.\tYou don\u2019t know what she has put up with from me. And I moved in with her and Uncle Vic and I moved into her home and I treated it like a frat house. I was arrogant and I was rude. And Auntie Maggie was Auntie Maggie. You know, she\u2019s just always seeing the good in everybody.

She\u2019d been working this whole time with him to get to me and mama. So I, I tried to warn mama, so I, I tried to find her and then when I called her, he answered Colin Bedford.\tYeah, him. And he told me to knee him up on the ends roof. And when I got there, He had a gun and he, he said that he was gonna make mama jump.

I know that she\u2019s been lying to us.\tWhat was she really in that deep? Did she know what he was planning to do? She admitted everything.

I\u2019m gonna tell you everything that I know.\tAre you raised? Mama? Just freeze. There you go. Now it was brought in for a head trauma. Oh, when? When? How long was he lying on that floor? That, oh, that man. He beat his head in and he wouldn\u2019t even, lemme call.\tEveryone here loves ape. No one is gonna let anything happen to him. Okay. Not her. Not her. Please rape.

You think you could just say you are sorry? No, no. When you tell, you, tell your girlfriend that I\u2019m glad her brother went off that roof. Wait, I don\u2019t understand what happened to Abraham.

I hope the brother is dead.\tI\u2019m his sister. How is he alive when she\u2019s a miracle? How bad is it?

God, Talia, the things you did, the lies you told me,\tthat\u2019s not you. He lost both of his parents, Jada, it wrecked him. You know, a lot of people have been through a hell of a lot worse than calling Bedford and they don\u2019t try to kill people. And you knew it was all wrong. That\u2019s why you called me and thank God you did. I am trained to handle situations like this.\tWhy didn\u2019t you just let me handle it? Look, I know. Okay. I just, I just wanted to stop him from hurting Chanel. That\u2019s all I ever wanted to do, and I never met him to blow off this roof. Why do you give a damn about him?\tI heard those two bitches right where I wanted them, and then Talia showed up with her cop sister and everything went to hell. She was supposed to be on my side. And she pushed me.\tWhy are you up there in the first place? Why? Why? I had to be on the roof. Why did you do any of it? Why didn\u2019t you leave?\tGod, I told you I was gonna go to the police if you didn\u2019t back off. Colin, I miss mom and dad as much as you do, but there are limits you can\u2019t kill. You gave up. You told me that you met someone. You wanted to have a life here. What kind of life is that? You could see the two people who did this to us park in a restaurant and a damn bakery free.\tWalking around still alive.\tWhat kind of life is that?\tI dunno.\tI just did what I had to, I guess. Yeah, and I did what I had to\ta different Sloan.\tI can\u2019t forget what happened. How everything is SW apart. I\u2019ll never forget\tthat.

What\u2019s there? Well, we, uh, he was still interested and I do like him and we did end up going out one night.\tReally? Because right now you don\u2019t exactly sound over the moon about it. Well, I just, I don\u2019t like not knowing what I\u2019m feeling. Okay. I get so angry with Johnny, but I like him the trip. He\u2019s just, he\u2019s so easy to be with and I know I have to choose, but I just, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m gonna do it. Why? Huh? Why do you have to choose?\tBecause.\tBecause I don\u2019t know why, because you don\u2019t have to choose.

No, I have my moments.\tI told Johnny I wouldn\u2019t be gone long. Wonder if he thinks I was lying to him about how I feel about Trip, given the way it was the last time I saw him. I think he\u2019ll take what he can get. Oh, well that\u2019s romantic. Flattering too. Okay. Didn\u2019t come out the way I meant it too. Okay. Mm-hmm. I mean, you have the upper hand.\tYou wanna take your sweet time to figure out what you want. They\u2019ll both wait because you\u2019re worth waiting for. What\u2019s up?

And you have more guys than you know what to do with.\tSo Wendy was kind of vague about it, but I really thought she\u2019d be back by now. What you think she stayed to beat with Trip? I thought you said she believed you about why you proposed to Chanel. Yeah, she said she did, but Guy was here. Tripp was there.

How many patients do you think you have treated over the years?\tI don\u2019t know. I never thought about it. Oh, looking for you. I have now. You started psychiatry in the seventies, right? Yeah, 76. Yeah. So I got to thinking if you were to take your annual average caseload and then multiply that by the number of years you\u2019ve been at it, that\u2019s like 5,000 patients.\tI think you\u2019ve gotta check your math on that. Oh, I did. But whatever the number is, it\u2019s a lot. You know what? That needs to be celebrated and baby, that\u2019s exactly what you and I are gonna do.\tSo what does one order to commemorate reaching the 5,000 patient Mark? I told you he\u2019s nowhere near this. Be close doc. Come on. No, no, no, no. And I, unlike you have not tried ever to count. It\u2019s okay. Fine. So you haven\u2019t kept up with the math here, but I\u2019m, I\u2019m sure you have kind of reflected back, you know, on when you first started your practice, right?\tI have from time to time. Yeah. What stands out the most?\tProbably my very first patient. Oh, that would\u2019ve to be Mickey Horton. Yeah. Mickey. Tough case. Lovely man. We developed a, a very dear friendship.\tI\u2019m trying to figure out how to threaten that queen without endangering a keep peace. Try the night. Yeah, of course. Right there.

No, I\u2019m a psychiatrist.\tI see.\tHey. Doing okay? Of course, of course. I was just, um, Thinking back to when I was first in Salem. Hmm. Sure. Things were a little bit different back then, huh? They were. They were. But you know what makes Salem so special is all the, all the people that live here. It\u2019s what made it so comfortable to develop a practice.\tShall we eat? You know, I was just thinking it\u2019s not too late to maybe go to some place, a little fancier for the celebration. Like maybe the bistro? No, no, no. Not the bistro. Uh, my, my client may be having his business meeting there and I. I don\u2019t wanna show up in throw a m office game.\tSo, Yuri, what do you want to discuss?\tListen, I\u2019m all about optionality. Okay. The more avenues we have to create Mayan, the greater chance we have to kill it. Right? Right. Yeah, totally. Well, according to this, This expansion plan is kind of weak.

We suspected someone can\u2019t used to escape from Megan\u2019s compound. It was washed up near a small island, mostly rocks, uninhabited. Okay, so what about Kate? Well, they searched everywhere within a hundred mile radius using the most advanced technology, and unfortunately, there were no signs of life.\tWhat does that mean? The Coast Guard says they don\u2019t think Kate could have survived.\tOh, well it\u2019s enough time. Where\u2019s my dinner? The captain wants to see you. Why no questions.\tLike sand through the hourglass. So are the days of our lives.\tWell, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t care what the Coast Guard says. We\u2019re not gonna give up, right?

So as far as I\u2019m concerned, Kate is out there alive. All right.\tThat\u2019s what\u2019s our next move? Well, we\u2019re thinking, uh, Kate could have been picked up by a passing ship. So now that we have the location of her boat, we can check that against the sea lanes in the area and we\u2019ll try to figure out who picked her up. Makes sense. Except if Kate did board a ship, wouldn\u2019t you have tried to reach out to us?\tOkay. What do you want with me, Kyle, please call me Dimitri Vanner Powell Graham was just the alias. I used to, uh, fool Your clueless daughter. Oh, clueless. Really clueless enough to take you down. So what about the ransom? Did you call my husband? Not yet.

That is a really lovely invitation, but you can shove it up your ass.\tThank you for coming. Of course. How are you feeling? Nervous. I just got off the phone with Auntie Mag and I played it. Cool.

Not only is she extremely capable, savvy, and smart, she is highly respected among her peers and her peers would be what? The cast of the Golden Girls dude. I mean, this is not a brand for me.

The guy cooling his heels in prison is an imposter.\tHe escaped. How long ago? Well, uh, faint Dimitri\u2019s not talking, which means the real Dimitri could be on that cargo ship and he could be holding Kate hostage.\tBetter, Kate, you look stunning.\tShall we die?\tI still can\u2019t get ahold of Andrew. Should we just reach out to the Coast Guard? Maybe they can make contact with the ship. No, no, no. I don\u2019t like the idea of giving Dimitri a heads up. It\u2019s better than taken by surprise.

I was hoping to see the display for the deceptor, make sure everything is in order. Is it cool if I go on set?\tNo, it is not cool. If you think I\u2019m gonna work with someone as unstable as you, you really are crazy.\t[Dramatic music]\tN\u2019neka, let me have another martini.\t[Dance music playing]\tAnd another round for you too?\tOh, I\u2019m done with seltzer.

You\u2013you rescued aunt liesl, and because of that, willow now has a fighting chance. I\u2019m really grateful. Thank you.\tWell, you\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m\u2013I\u2019m so thrilled that this is happening for willow, and all that\u2019s left to do now is pray.\tYeah. I\u2019m on it.\tOkay.\tIs everything okay, or\u2013\tyou mean since the sec dragged me out of here?\tYeah, that.\tThank you.\t[Indistinct chatter]\tDo you want to say hello?\tI better not. Ever since I arrested cody at the nurses\u2019 ball, things have been tense between us.\tImagine that.\tExcuse me.\tMr. Baldwin.\tOh, goody, it\u2019s you.\t[Chuckles] It\u2019s good to see you too, scotty.\tJust keep your grubby, sticky fingers away from my wallet.\tAll right, I did not steal that damn bracelet, okay? I was set up.\tBy who?\tWell, you agree to represent me, I\u2019ll tell you.\tI am so worried about maxie. She sounded just awful on the phone.\tWell, at least she took your advice and got someone to fill in for her. Who was it, anyway?\tHmm, maxie didn\u2019t say.\tThis was not our agreement. Where is maxie jones?\tMaxie is sick. She asked me to fill in. I explained all of this to your producer, russell.\tWell, no one informed me.\tTrust me, haven. Your audience is going to love the deceptor, and I\u2019m more than capable of co-hosting the segment.\tOh, hello, miss de havilland, you are looking at the face of deception.\tSo? Will someone get me russell, now?\tBoy.\tThanks for the assist.\tOh, anytime.\tWait. What are you doing here? You don\u2019t work for deception anymore.\tMaxie didn\u2019t tell you? I\u2019m back.\tWhat are you talking about? Where are you going?\tI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m so sorry, joss, but I can\u2019t stay in port charles. I can\u2019T.\tOf course you can.\tNo, not anymore.\tThe video of sonny during the pikeman deal, that\u2019s footage of him breaking the law. You gave that to michael, right?\tYes, but\u2013\tokay. Then it\u2019s only a matter of time. Because willow\u2019s gonna get the transplant, and she\u2019ll be fine. Then michael\u2019s gonna give the video to the feds. And then sonny is gonna be arrested.\tBut that\u2019s just it. Michael\u2019s not turning sonny in.\t[Scoffs] What?\tSonny\u2019s not going to prison.\tSince when?\tSince michael backed out of our deal.\tFirst of all, I wanted to say thank you for throwing the sec off of drew\u2019s trail. It bought him time to find liesl and bring her back home. So willow and I are forever grateful for that.\tWell, I\u2019m just glad it all worked out and willow\u2019s gonna get the bone marrow transplant.\t", "Because victor ordered her to.\tHe needed it to find mikkos\u2019 bunker in greenland.\tThose cassadines, they like to keep things interesting, don\u2019t they?\tI\u2019ll say.\tWell, wait a minute. Wait a minute. If holly survived this fake explosion, did the necklace as well?\tYeah. We wanted victor to think that it was destroyed while holly tried to figure out where he was holding ethan.\tSo where\u2019s the necklace now?\tWe don\u2019t know, scott. It was lost when the wsb sank the haunted star.\tWell, that necklace is worth about 35 million clams, wouldn\u2019t you say?\tIt\u2019s worth nothing now, seeing how it\u2019s gone.\tThis is way too far\t[Indistinct chatter]\tShe\u2019s on her way.\tExcellent.\t[Tense music] Is it done?\tEveryone on our production staff is on social media, talking up sasha\u2019s appearance tonight and speculating what could possibly go wrong.\tOh, that\u2019ll get them watching.\t[Laughs] And when they watch, they buy.\tExactly.\t[Chuckles]\tI know that the last time I was here, I almost tanked the company.\t[Sighs] Look, I am worried about you, not the company right now, okay? I think it\u2019s so brave of you to step up and take maxie\u2019s place. But if you\u2019re not ready, you do not have to do this. I mean, come on. I could do this segment in my sleep.\tThank you, lucy, truly. Your support means everything to me. But I am the face of deception, and I am a partner in the business, and I really want to pull my weight.\tWell, how does it feel to be back here?\tIt was a little overwhelming at first. But I\u2019m okay now. I keep telling myself that this is an entirely different situation. I was self-medicating back then. I was deep in my grief for liam. And then to be asked to model a baby carrier\u2013\tout of nowhere, by the way.\tI wasn\u2019t prepared.\tOh, come on. No one\u2013no one\u2013 would have been prepared. You weren\u2019t expected to be prepared for that. What they did was absolutely awful. But look at you now. Look how far you\u2019ve come. It\u2019s so good. And I\u2019m so proud of you.\tAnd if anyone tries to interrupt your segment tonight, I will tackle them before they even reach the set.\t[Laughs] I would love to see that.\t[Tense music]\tSasha?\tSasha? What on earth are you doing here?\tThe cards weren\u2019t in your favor tonight.\tI\u2013well\u2013I thought I had a strong enough hand. But then that damn cody bell with his flush.\tMr. Bell had luck on his side.\t[Scoffs] Either that or he\u2019s a big, fat cheater.\tNo one cheats selina wu.\tRight. [Chuckles] Of course. Mm, I guess I should be getting home.\tNot until we discuss how you plan to cover the money you borrowed.\tChange of plans, my friend. I will represent you.\tI thought you said $20,000 wasn\u2019t enough.\tAh, that\u2019s chump change compared to what we\u2019re gonna get. N\u2019neka, another martini.\tOh, my goodness. What is going on in my kitchen? That smells amazing.\tI am making you my amatriciana sauce. It\u2019s simmering. I\u2019ve also just recently uncorked a very posh bottle of chianti.\t[Gasps]\tAnd I\u2019d like to let it breathe.\tOh, would you?\tBut something tells me you could use a glass.\tYes. Just fill it to the brim, please.\tHow was the briefing?\t[Groans] It went on forever. I mean, seriously, I just\u2013ugh. I feel like somewhere in the metaverse, I\u2019m still answering questions. They wanted to know everything about greenland and your father and the pathogen. And I\u2019m very tired. I just want to drink wine, eat pasta, and fall asleep in your arms.\tThat\u2019s all you want to do, is it?\tDepends how good your pasta is.\t[Chuckles]\t[Doorbell rings] Oh, just ignore them, and they\u2019ll go away. Oh, my lord. Do you know\u2013\t[Doorbell rings] There are only two people that ring my doorbell like that. One is obrecht. And the other is\u2013 hello, robert.\tWord of advice. Next time you want to pretend you\u2019re not home, don\u2019t leave the lights on.\t[Dramatic music]\tObviously, the idea of running away with you sounds amazing. But I have no one, joss.\tYou have me.\tNo. You know what I mean. I don\u2019t have any friends or family to fall back on. I don\u2019t even have the military anymore. It\u2019s just me and my skill set. But you, you have this incredible family that not only loves you but needs you. I got to meet two more of them today. And wiley and amelia are the sweetest. Wiley hero-worships you.\t[Somber music]\tI think he was more impressed by you.\tNo, I\u2019m just some guy that used to be a soldier. But you, you\u2019re his aunt joss, who\u2019s gonna be a doctor, by the way. You love being pre-med.\tI do, but\u2013\tno buts. I cannot possibly be to you what you are to me.\tAnd it would be incredibly selfish of me to say yes, run away with me so that you end up needing me as much as I need you.\tI do need you, though.\tYou like me, and you want me.\tBut you have so much else going on in your life. And that\u2019s a good thing. If you came with me, it would be exciting at first\u2013 new identities, new lives.\t", "Hey, we can make it work.\tFor a while, till one day, you wake up next to me, and you realize that you don\u2019t want to be a waitress named trixie.\tWell, I would never pick the name trixie.\tYou\u2019d realize that you miss your friends, you miss your family, that you miss your life. And that would be my fault.\tyou lost what you came in with, then dipped into my bank for $85,000.\tI\u2013I\u2013I\u2013 I\u2019m good for it.\tI should hope so.\tCan we discuss a payment plan?\tYou know the rules. When players borrow from the house, payment is due at the end of the night.\tI\u2013I understand, but I don\u2019t have that kind of money at my fingertips.\tSasha gilmore does. And don\u2019t you control your daughter-in-law\u2019s finances?\tI\u2019m so sorry. I had no idea I\u2019d be seeing you here tonight.\tWell, the feeling is very, very, very mutual.\tIs one of your products being featured?\tA new line of baby bath salts called change your moody. The little ones just love it, and so do their momm\u2013\tit\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay. You can talk about motherhood and babies in front of me. I am so sorry for my behavior last time.\tNo, no. Don\u2019t you dare apologize. I feel terrible about what happened to you and about the role I played, however unwittingly, in it all, which begs the question, why, of all people, would I be asked to participate tonight?\tBecause someone is trying to push sasha over the edge.\t[Tense music]\tOkay. So leopold\u2019s necklace was not destroyed in that explosion?\tNo. Due to the wsb\u2019s itchy trigger finger, the jewels went to the bottom of the ocean.\tSo I\u2019m back to where I started.\tWell, that\u2019s where you\u2019re wrong. Because the necklace is part of dominique\u2019s estate, meaning that you and serena are owed a portion of that money.\tWell, yeah, I agree with you 100%. But regardless of how the necklace was lost, it\u2019s still gone.\tWell, the wsb is the reason why your big payoff and serena\u2019s went the way of the titanic.\tWait, so you\u2019re saying\u2013\tyeah. We sue the wsb.\tNina, I know you think that carly is the reason that you don\u2019t have a relationship with willow.\tWell, I actually just spoke to carly about this.\tRight\u2013three-plus years of treating willow like dirt because you dislike her\u2013 obviously, that\u2019s the reason. And I know that everything changed once you found out you\u2019re mother and daughter. But everything didn\u2019t change for willow.\tNo, I get it, and I\u2019ve given willow more than good reason to be untrusting of me. But drew, for the first time, my daughter asked something of me.\tReally? What\u2019s that?\tShe wants me to stop fighting with carly, and I want to give it to her. But I don\u2019t know how to do it. If we\u2013if we could just start fresh\u2013\tnina, you\u2019ve got to accept that\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s just not an option.\tPeace is what I\u2019ve always wanted, but I appreciate you meeting me halfway.\tYeah, well, give willow credit.\tNo. It takes strength from you too. I mean, you know, I shouldn\u2019t be surprised that you stepped up for the greater good. I mean, that\u2019s why you gave her avery back at the end, because you didn\u2019t want to tear the family apart.\tSo we have an understanding?\tWhen it comes to you, your sisters, and your kids, yeah. What about when it comes to nina?\t[Somber music]\tPlease talk to me.\tI don\u2019t know what to say.\tAnything. Whatever you\u2019re feeling.\tWell, I feel conflicted.\tFair.\tI mean, am I ready to\u2013 to give up all of my life to be with you? Am I ready to say that?\tI\u2019d be worried if you were.\tBut I like you\u2026a lot.\tI like you too.\tI like what we have. And I want to figure out where it could go. I don\u2019t want this to be over, and I don\u2019t want you to leave. But I really don\u2019t want you to die. And I really don\u2019t want you to spend the rest of your life in prison.\tBoth of which are now possibilities if I stay in port charles.\tSo yeah, I understand, conceptually.\tYou\u2019re ready to go, and you probably should. But, um, the thought of losing you\u2026 hurts my heart, and it makes me very scared and anxious.\tI don\u2019t want to lose you either.\t[Dance music playing]\tLooks like scott\u2019s gonna be cody\u2019s lawyer.\tIs that a good thing or a bad thing?\tFor all his faults, scott\u2019s a decent defense attorney.\tDoes that mean you want cody to beat the charges?\t[Phone ringing]\tIt\u2019s the department.\tI\u2019ll give holly your regrets.\tChief scorpio.\tI won\u2019t steal from sasha.\tDidn\u2019t you already cross that line when you sold me your son\u2019s garage?\tExactly\u2013sold. I didn\u2019t give it away.\tYou and I both know I hardly paid market price.\tI can\u2019t do that to her again.\tThen it would appear you and I have a problem.\tThe only thing we can prove is that the necklace belonged to taub. There\u2019s no evidence that he gave it to dominique outright.\tYeah, but either way, the money is yours and your sister, serena, that you\u2019re gonna share with her, right?\tYeah. No, absolutely. Where do we start?\t", "Okay. Come by my office tomorrow, and I\u2019ll have an affidavit for you to sign, testifying that you are taub and dominique\u2019s son.\t[Tense music]\tBye.\tBye.\t\u201cFace of deception returns to h&h\u2013meltdown part two? Stay tuned, #home&heart.\u201d Home & heart is implying that sasha\u2019s gonna have a meltdown tonight on the air to get people to watch.\tThat is despicable. I refuse to be part of a disgusting sales grab.\t[Laughs] Oh, haven and her producers better buckle up, \u2019cause I\u2019m about to lift off.\tLucy. Lucy, don\u2019T. Let it go.\tSasha, you can\u2019t be okay with this.\tNo!\tThe more people watching, the better for the deceptor debut. It\u2019s free publicity.\tBut it\u2019s exploiting your mental health. Okay, you know what? Haven is obviously trying to rattle you. Why else would I be here, you know? I say we just call the whole thing off.\tNo. Haven is betting against me. Time to show her she\u2019s making a huge mistake.\tNina\u2019s part of my life, and she\u2019s not going anywhere.\tI understand that. I even respect that. But I need you to respect the fact that it\u2019s up to willow to decide what kind of relationship, if any, she wants to have with nina.\tThat\u2019s fair.\tCan you\u2013can you get her to back off, help her to understand that willow, you know, she\u2019s fighting for her life?\tNobody knows that better than nina.\tI know. I\u2019m just\u2013I\u2019m asking you to stop her from pressuring willow.\tI can\u2019t tell nina how to deal with her own daughter any more than I want anybody to tell me how to deal with mine. I got to give her that courtesy.\tOkay. Well, then, can you promise me not to advocate for nina, not to pressure willow or me?\tYou feel pressured?\tNot openly. You\u2019re too smart for that. We both know you\u2019re very good at getting what you want.\tI agree to let nina and willow figure out their relationship on their own. Can you do the same?\tI can live with that.\tOkay. I should get back to gh.\tHey, listen. If\u2026 willow needs anything, and I mean anything, I\u2019m here.\tOkay. Thank you.\tI\u2019ll see you at the hospital tomorrow. And I just want you to know that we\u2019re gonna keep our distance. But we don\u2019t want to be kept from our family.\tAre you saying that carly will never forgive me?\tNo, I\u2019m saying that you can\u2019t erase the past or wish it away. A quick fix just doesn\u2019t exist in this case. And to assume it does sabotages the future that you say that you want.\tDrew, listen, I do want it.\tOkay. All right. Great. So are you willing to work for it?\tWhatever it takes.\tSo you gotta be honest, nina. You gotta be honest with yourself\u2013 I mean really honest. And with everybody else, you have to acknowledge your mistakes. And then maybe, maybe willow will find a place for you in her life.\tStay.\t[Somber music]\tWhat?\tStay, and we\u2019ll figure something out.\tEven if it means I continue working for sonny?\tYeah, for now. Together, we\u2019ll come up with a solution, okay? Just don\u2019t give up on us.\tOkay.\tReally?\tI cannot imagine never seeing you again. I\u2019ll stay.\tWe\u2019ll think of something, I promise.\tAll right. Is an affidavit really necessary?\tYes, it\u2019s just very important that we establish that you\u2019re leopold taub\u2019s son. Do you understand?\tNo, no, no. This is horrible.\tFelicia, what\u2019s wrong?\tSasha is on home & heart tonight, and they\u2019re promoting it by suggesting she\u2019s going to have another breakdown.\tOkay, I have to go.\tWait a minute. Wait a minute, you. You\u2019re still on board, right?\tYeah, sure. Yeah, I\u2019ll call you tomorrow.\t[Sighs] How am I supposed to get that much money together so quickly? It\u2019s impossible.\tThere might be another way for you to repay your debt.\t[Indistinct chatter]\t[Tense music]\tHey, you\u2013 you sure about this? We can bail at any time.\tI am sure.\tAll right. They\u2019re coming.\tEverything set?\tWe\u2019re a go.\tGreat. Flora, darling, what a lovely surprise.\tIs it, though?\tWhatever do you mean?\tYou know exactly what I mean, you little how\u2013\tlive in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Action.\t[Soft music]\tWelcome back to home & heart, everyone. I\u2019m your host, haven de havilland. And tonight, I have two very special guests, flora gardens and sasha gilmore.\tThank you for having me, haven. Your viewers are in for a treat.\tOh, I hope so.\tRobert, I just got off a long flight. I am very tired. It would be great if you weren\u2019t here.\tHmm.\tOr you could just help yourself to a glass of wine, I suppose.\t[Wine pouring]\tOh, valentin, I see you made it out in one piece.\tYeah, thanks to the lovely anna.\tYeah, I heard\u2013 heard all about the heroics. Ah. Dashing into the chamber of death to save your sorry carcass again.\tYeah, we\u2013we take turns. Sometimes she saves me. Sometimes I save her. Sometimes we get trapped together. We like to mix it up.\tNext time, try doing it by yourself, and leave her out of it.\tI chose to go on the rescue mission, robert. I chose to do that.\tMuch fun as this is, I\u2019m gonna go put the pasta on.\tI like mine al dente.\tI have no idea why I would need to know that.\tYou need to stop. Because I know what you\u2019re going to say.\tGood. Then let\u2019s say it together. Anna devane, what were you thinking?\tMichael, I\u2019m gonna light a candle for willow.\tOkay. Willow will appreciate that. And I do too. See you tomorrow.\tYeah, tomorrow.\t[Somber music]\tSo, sasha, this is your first television appearance since last year.\tIt is.\tHow are you holding up?\tI am fantastic. And I am thrilled to introduce deception\u2019s newest product, the deceptor.\tOoh. I\u2019m still using my deception products, and I just love them.\tI am so happy to hear that.\tBut it must have been a very trying year for you.\tAnd now meet the deceptor wand.\tOoh! What does it do?\tI am so happy you asked. The deceptor will help any woman of any age look her absolute best.\tOh. Well, we could all use that, am I right, ladies?\t[Laughs]\tAbsolutely.\t[Tense music]\t[Baby crying]\t", "Yeah, that\u2019s why I\u2019m\u2013 that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. Willow. She\u2013she asked me to call off the war between us.\tIt was never my war.\tAnd to honor your place in the lives of people I love.\tWell, you think you can do that, michael?\tFor willow and for my family, yes.\tWait a minute, brook lynn. I\u2019m confused. Last week, you said you needed to be freed up to follow your passion.\tWell, I realized that was a mistake. I love this company. And there\u2019s no reason why I can\u2019t have it all, right? Music and deception\u2013 I\u2019ll make the time.\tWow. That\u2019s awesome. Welcome back.\tThank you.\tHey. Hi. Wow, it\u2019s so sweet of you to come support sasha here today.\tOh, that\u2019s what teammates do.\tTeammates? What, did you join some sort of sports team or something together?\tOh, no, the deception team.\tI\u2019m not following.\tBrook lynn is back at deception. She already spoke to maxie.\tThat\u2019s right.\tReally? No, because I just spoke to maxie not two minutes ago. She did not mention anything about it.\tOh, you know what? She just must have not realized it in her feverish state. Anyway, today is not about me. It is about you and your big comeback.\tOkay, you.\t[Sighs] Are you sure? Are you absolutely sure you\u2019re ready for all of this?\tThe last time sasha gilmore was on this show, it was a disaster. And she thought a doll was her dead baby.\tThat was almost a year ago. Maxie\u2019s assured me sasha\u2019s stronger now. And besides, if she did freak out on camera, would that really be so bad?\tIs that an actual question?\tOur ratings were at an all-time high after sasha\u2019s breakdown last july. It reminded our viewers that anything can happen on live tv.\tYou know, our ratings have been a little sluggish lately.\tRight?\tMaybe we could make this work to our advantage.\tScott, listen\u2013\tdon\u2019T. You want me to represent you.\tYeah. It should be an easy gig, considering I\u2019m innocent.\tSays you. But unfortunately, you can\u2019t afford me.\tI got 10k in my pocket that says otherwise.\tWell, that\u2019s pocket money. Uh, so no.\tOkay, fine. 20k.\tI\u2019m not interested.\tI knew it.\tWhat?\tThat you had an ulterior motive, not only when you said that you would come tonight, but you picked the savoy as well.\t[Sighs] I love holly. And of course I want to celebrate her safe return. What better place to do it at?\tMm-hmm. Chief scorpio, why are we really here?\tOh, two of my favorite people.\tSince when?\tMind if I join you?\tWhat can we do for you, scott?\tWell, for starters, why is holly sutton running around chloroforming people when she should be in a burn unit in europe?\tI\u2019m sorry this is happening to you.\tYeah. Look, I\u2019m told this is an ongoing investigation. And beyond that, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m just not comfortable discussing it with you.\tYeah, understood.\tOkay. So you, um, you here to see willow?\tOh, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not gonna go into her room, you know? The last thing I want to do is to upset willow or michael.

Obviously, I\u2019m happy to have been chosen for this position, but I just hope I can do some good, you know? Maybe bring some healing to this hospital. Lord knows it can use it after losing epiphany. Yeah. I mean, it\u2019S\u2026 hard on everyone, but I think you\u2019re the right person to do it. Bring back a little of that humanity that we all need. Thank you. Welcome. I keep telling myself that this is not about me, this is about my service to the patients and all the staff who work so hard. I have been linked to this hospital my entire life. I mean, my grandfather was dr. Hardy, the symbol of virtue, the true hero of general hospital. It\u2019s in this place that I have had my highest highs. And my lowest lows. This place has put me back together more times than I care to count. And let\u2019s not forget all the legends of the nurses\u2019 station. There\u2019s jessie brewer and bobbie spencer and epiphany. Sometimes I wonder if I\u2019m strong enough to be like them. No, you are strong. In the end, you might be the strongest of them all. I bailed you out, remember? If I thought you were a thief, I wouldn\u2019t have bothered. Thanks. You know what? Maybe it\u2019s best if we do handle this legally. Why don\u2019t you ask dante for help? I didn\u2019t want to compromise him. Wait. What? But compromising me, not a problem? Well, I mean, I could just skip town, but then you\u2019d be out your bail money. No, I would find you in a heartbeat. I have no doubt. Ah. Just kills me that sasha doesn\u2019t know who gladys really is. Which is why we need to prove that that bracelet was planted. Sasha needs to know that gladys corbin can\u2019t be trusted. Uh\u2026 so does port charles. Let\u2019s just focus on keeping you out of jail, please. Let\u2019s not bite off more than we can chew.

I mean, the other day, amelia, she \u2014 she looked up at me, and she smiled at me for the first time, like she really saw me. And it was \u2014 it was incredible, chase. It really was. But willow, she wasn\u2019t there. She \u2014 she was here. You know, I try to record everything I can on my phone, but it\u2019s not the same. Willow, she \u2014 she \u2014 she needs to be there, you know, experiencing it firsthand to see the look on amelia\u2019s face light up. It\u2019s time that she\u2019ll never get back. She\u2019ll be able to watch those videos forever, and she will treasure every single one of them even more because she will know that you took the time to record when you were going through your own hell. I just met with dr. Montague. He\u2019s the psychiatrist the court appointed to evaluate me. And\u2026how\u2019d it go? Pretty good, I think. It\u2019s hard to know for sure. Well, I am sure dr. Montague was very impressed. Why wouldn\u2019t he be? You\u2019ve survived things that would\u2019ve broken anyone else. You\u2019re one to talk. Well, having the support of friends and family has made all the difference. Same. And like it or not, willow, but nina was a big part of that for me. She was there for me when I gave her every reason to hate me. I pretended to be the thing that she wanted more than anything. She was searching for her daughter. And what valentin and i did was horrible. But nina somehow found the strength and love to forgive me. And that could not have been easy. Sasha, I see what you\u2019re doing, but nina has put me and the family I love through the wringer. Some things just can\u2019t be forgiven.\tTime for a hardy to be in charge again.

How\u2019s willow doing? Hey. Well, she\u2019s \u2014 she\u2019s holding her own. Sasha\u2019s in there with her right now. Wait. So no more phones? Yeah. Yeah. We still have to wear masks and gowns, though, to keep the room sterile, but, yeah, she\u2019s only allowed one visitor at a time. Well, that\u2019s great. I mean, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll appreciate the human contact. Yeah. Uh, what about you? I\u2019m actually trying to avoid human contact. Yeah, everybody\u2019s gathered up on the 10th floor waiting on word about ned, and I don\u2019t really want to get in the way of, um\u2026 of, uh, yeah, brook lynn\u2019s sweet granny tracy?\t[ Door opens ] How is he?

Did you just call me nerd? Oh. Wow. You just beat the nerd. I think I like this game. Robert told me that his complicated life just got less complicated. And isn\u2019t that attractive? Anyway, and then our conversation became a whole lot more complicated after olivia quartermaine walked over and started pressing robert for inside information on the sec case and was there a possible deal on the table where my client carly could give up my client sonny. And you were all ears, weren\u2019t you?\t[ Chuckles ] Well, of course I was. Robert didn\u2019t seem to appreciate that. I\u2026 I just don\u2019t know if we\u2019re compatible.

Well, neither do I, but just stay with me. It\u2019s a digital-currency security startup, and our client is the C.F.O.

And according to my associate, her husband is a real shark. So where does the shark swim, and what does the shark eat? Are you having a stroke? What are you talking about? Hunger. I may not know anything about tech bros, but I know something about bros. And if it were me, I would be looking into the proclivities and the extracurricular activities of this certain C.E.O., And you might find something that his wife doesn\u2019t like.

Ah, but that\u2019s not really your style, is it? No. No, I gotta face things head on. I just don\u2019t want brook lynn to have to run interference with tracy. Then again, it could give her something to do to take her mind off her dad. Right. Uh, how is ned doing? I know they were waiting for dr. Ashford to wake him up from the induced coma. Brook lynn brought leo in to sit with him earlier. Well, tell her I\u2019m thinking about her, okay? I will. And send willow my love. Will do.

The hope is that the induced sedation allowed ned\u2019s brain to rest, preventing any further swelling and even decreasing it. \u201cThe hope\u201d \u2014 that\u2019s carefully worded. We medical professionals are discouraged from giving blanket assurances. But I can tell you that ned\u2019s medical team is cautiously optimistic. Thank you. Okay. So, uh, what\u2019s next? We\u2019ll wake him up and further evaluate his cognitive state. I was \u2014 I was told that there was a slight chance that, uh\u2026 that there would be some lasting effects. Like what?

Being a lawyer is like voluntarily signing up to go into battle with an army of paperwork and legal jargon. It\u2019s like navigating a perverse maze of precedents and cases that have no mercy. Yes, but \u2014 but cracking the case, wiping the smug grin off the face of opposing counsel. You never did that to me, of course, but then there\u2019s winning, winning, winning! Pages and pages and pages of statutory law that you have to memorize only to find out that it\u2019s just been revised. It\u2019s like putting together a giant puzzle. No sleep. You get no sleep. You have no life because you know that you have to be in court for the next 20 days in a row. That\u2019s why we have caffeine. Only to watch an innocent person be exonerated and order restored to a chaotic world. Oh, my god. I miss it so much. It\u2019s like losing a limb. I miss arguing in court. I love to argue.

You met tracy. Yeah, it was quite the experience. Although, you know, she\u2019s a mother who\u2019s worried about her son. You know, they\u2019re all worried. Yeah, exactly. Dante is worried. We were at the hospital supporting his mother. So if you wouldn\u2019t mind just keeping this brief, what\u2019s your plan? Okay. Well, that\u2019s what I need your help with. Uh, wait.

Besides, you have proximity to the corinthos family.\tYou could gain inside knowledge on gladys a hell of a lot easier than I could.

But \u2014 and this is all my fault, but there was a time when nina and I were at odds. Remember? And now you\u2019ll tell me again how that\u2019s all changed? It has changed. Nina just wrote me the most wonderful letter of recommendation to end my guardianship. Sasha, that\u2019s great. I\u2019m so proud of you. Thank you. I am finally ready to move forward. How about you? So, tracy\u2019s putting you through the paces, huh? Oh, yeah. Now I know how comet feels. You know, she\u2019s not as bad as she seems. Really, really, look, when the chips are down, she loves her family, and she\u2019s \u2014 she\u2019s extremely loyal. Maybe \u2014 maybe too loyal. But she loves brook lynn. Even though they have this whole love-hate thing going on. Yeah. But brook lynn can hold her own. It\u2019s actually kind of fun to watch. Oh. Well, it looks like someone\u2019s getting desensitized to the quartermaine ways. Never. Do you know what I want to know, though? How are you holding up through all this? Honestly, it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a bit of a roller coaster. But we\u2019re getting to the other side. I\u2019m just very, very thankful for, uh, the nanny, because with wiley\u2019s endless energy and trying to keep amelia on track, it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a nonstop juggling act. Yeah, I can\u2019t imagine that. It\u2019s got to take a lot of strength and patience, especially while worrying about willow. How long is this gonna take? What, do you have a pickleball championship? Why don\u2019t you go wait outside with dante and leo, okay? Tj said it could be 20 minutes, it could be a few hours. You\u2019re acting like a 6-year-old on a road trip. Just stop. Where is the doctor? Can\u2019t they be doing more? What happened to the quartermaine name? Monica has let this place run down. Seriously, you cannot sit in your own son\u2019s icu room without complaining about everything? He\u2019s used to it. It\u2019s just like home. Dad? I rest my case. Sweetheart?

I sometimes shine a light on a story that\u2019s important. But those stories hardly ever happen. I mean, for every impactful story, there\u2019s a gazillion mundane, stupid ones about celebrity gossip or\u2026 fashion. It\u2019s like finding a needle of significance in a haystack of triviality. It\u2019s not exactly woodward and bernstein. Hardly. Or maybe I\u2019m just spreading myself too thin and I need to take advantage of my support team, you know, and do some serious outreach. Yes. Your support team. That now includes \u2014\t[ Clears throat ] \u2014 The wonderful esme prince. Yeah. Yeah, you\u2019re right, chase. I, uh\u2026 I need to focus on the future. Because once willow\u2019s released, we\u2019ll have the rest of our lives to make more moments \u2014 together. And you will. But until then, don\u2019t forget to send a flare up when things get tough. Your friends are here. We want to help. Thanks. I will tell you one thing, though. Despite all the angst and the craziness with the kids, man, I would not trade being a father for anything. I can see that. So, what about you? You ever think about children? Wow. Talk about turning the tables. That a touchy subject? No, no, of course not. I mean, I grew up in a great family. My dad was always there, and my mom was kind of busy, but they both loved me. So, what about it? Do you want kids of your own? Let me put it this way. I definitely love kids. And brook lynn and i are back together. But as for my own, I mean\u2026 that\u2019s a long way off in the future. Well, I\u2019ll tell you what. Your future kind of has a habit of catching up to you. Sooner than you think. Your relationship with nina is complicated, but so is mine. I lied to her, I conned her, I broke her heart, and I put brando through hell with my addiction. Both times I was the recipient of grace. Forgiven. And just recently, I wrongfully accused a friend of something. And you were forgiven? He doesn\u2019t hold it against me, but\u2026 he\u2019s not sure he can be my friend. I\u2019m sorry. So am I. It\u2019s painful wanting to connect to someone you\u2019ve wronged, even if they don\u2019t owe you a thing. Sam: Your innocence is gonna be a lot easier to prove than gladys\u2019s guilt. Tell that to my lawyer. What lawyer? Scott baldwin. What?! Scott baldwin? Why \u2014 why isn\u2019t he dealing with this? He\u2019s working on something else for me. Something bigger than a conviction for grand larceny? We have to prove that gladys was in your pants the night of the nurses ball. My jacket, thank you very much. The pcpd already looked into all this. Okay? There was no surveillance footage. There are other ways.\tWant to play? Yeah, I want to play. Are we still talking about backgammon?\t[ Both laugh ] Yes, finn, we\u2019re talking about backgammon. Okay.\t[ Both laugh ] Just checking. All right. I\u2019m a little afraid.\t[ Laughs ] I think you cheat. Oh. I want that cup, though. That\u2019s my lucky cup. Give it to me. Thank you. Lucky cup it is.\t[ Dice rattling ] You\u2019re pretty when you shake. Oh, thanks.\t[ Laughs ] Okay. Okay. That wasn\u2019t good. According to what was said earlier, no.\t[ Dice rattling ] Okay. So, do i move these over? How did you \u2014 how did you beat me? I don\u2019t know.\t[ Laughs ] How did you beat me? I don\u2019t know what to do. Okay. There you go. Esme prince, the latest entrant to the cassadine family squid game?\t[ Both laugh ] Yeah, I did that as a favor for laura. That\u2019s some favor. Esme is A\u2026 not-nice person. Snake? Snake. That\u2019s mild. You sure that\u2019s wise? Since when have I done anything that\u2019s wise? Honey, you\u2019re one of the wisest people I know. Sometimes you just get a little\u2026 led astray by \u2014 by your passion and idealism. Well, in this case, I was just trying to provide some stability to esme so she doesn\u2019t run off with laura\u2019s grandchild in tow. Very generous of you. Actually, I have a soft spot for esme. Oh. I know firsthand what it\u2019s like to have a psychotic parent, and she\u2019s got two. And gregory actually keeps her calm. Gregory? Yeah. He\u2019s agreed to join the editorial board. Well, I thought you were persona non grata after you went over his head and called the dean. Yeah, well, we have an understanding now. I can be his friend and care about him. I just can\u2019t meddle. And the editorial board is actually really happy to have him, and he\u2019s happy to be in his erudite element. So all\u2019s well that ends well. To quote the bard. Can I read you something? Sure. \u201cSasha gilmore is not defined by her past. No matter our mistakes, shortcomings or circumstances, everyone deserves another chance to build a life that once seemed impossible.\u201d That\u2019s what nina wrote about you, isn\u2019t it? She writes well. \u2018Cause she writes from her heart? But maybe\u2026 she was also writing about herself. Maybe it\u2019s a prayer of some sorts. All I know is that nina\u2019s capacity for forgiveness is massive. Something tells me that it might be hereditary. You know, I am glad that you and brook lynn are back together. You\u2019re good for each other. Well, there\u2019s never a dull moment, that\u2019s for sure. Last weekend, she took me to the beechers corners flea market. And would\u2019ve thought that logan\u2019s or the cartullo showroom was more of her thing. Yeah, me too. But she said she had a surprise for me, and then she whisked me away on this whirlwind tour, but, dude, she was possessed. It was like she had a sixth sense for finding vintage clothing. That sounds wholesome enough. Brook lynn is usually all over the place, but you ground her. You know she can be her own worst enemy. I\u2019ll say. But you\u2019re like a moral compass for her. You know, it\u2019s just\u2026 it\u2019s important that each person brings something to the relationship so they can complement each other. That\u2019s what willow does for me. She really helped mellow me out and focus on what really matters. And you do that for brook lynn. Really? Definitely. Okay. Well, if I do that for brook lynn, what does she do for me?\t"], "answer": [1, 3, 0, 4, 2]}

So you, me and Summer can convince him to get medical help?\tDiane: I\u2019m going to see what Kyle has to say.\tDiane: Kyle isn\u2019t responding to my text.\tPhyllis: Exactly.

It was kind of moving, too.\tDaniel: Yeah. Yeah, okay, a little, maybe. Maybe it got me a little, too. She\u2019s crossed a thousand lines, but \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 maybe I\u2019ve been too tough on her?\tKyle: Guys, her behavior was out of control.\u00a0 You needed to set some boundaries.\tSummer: I know.

Well, I-I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it were Victor. He cares about you. He always has, since you were a teenager. Look, Devon, everything that you were worried about is gone now. You were worried about losing control of the company. That\u2019s gone. Even the people you were worried about \u2014 Nate, Audra, I mean, even Billy. They\u2019re all gone. It\u2019s just us. So, look, we can streamline operations, you know? I\u2019ll back off and give you everything that you need to do to run your division how you want.\tDevon: And you expect me to do the same thing for you?\tLily: Yeah. We can each run our own operations the way that we see fit. You know, we won\u2019t have shareholders breathing over our shoulders.

But the more I think about it, the more I realize that Tucker McCall has been playing us.\tAdam: You guys talking about McCall?\tVictoria: Excuse me. This is a private conversation.\tAdam: [ Chuckles ] Which you are having in a very public place. Has the plan to acquire McCall hit a snag? I saw you talking to Tucker earlier. Or are you the one throwing up the roadblocks?\tVictor: Son, we are all working toward a common goal, alright?\tVictoria: I wouldn\u2019t go that far.\tAdam: Mm. So, you both want to buy Tucker\u2019s company, but you have different visions on what happens to it after that. I see.\tVictoria: You know, Adam, I really wouldn\u2019t concern myself with this because, however it shakes out, you\u2019re never gonna be CEO.\tElena: I know you\u2019re frustrated, but I do admire your efforts in trying to get Devon and Lily communicating again. When we got back together, you told me that you would work on being a better person. And, lo and behold, you have, which makes me feel like this leap of\u2026 Nate.\tNate: I\u2019m sorry.

How dare you plant a mole the way you did?\tTucker: Oh, well, if you\u2019re referring to Audra \u2014\tJill: And the worst part of it is you thought you could get away with it. You thought we were too stupid to catch on.\tTucker: If it\u2019s an apology you\u2019re seeking, then you got it. I apologize.\tJill: Oh, don\u2019t hand me that. You\u2019re only sorry because you got busted.\tTucker: [ Sighs ] Jill, we\u2019re both players, aren\u2019t we? It\u2019s who we are.

Does that mean that you have something to say to me?\tPlease. I, um\u2026 I talked to dad. My real dad, my, um \u2014 my always dad, no matter what. I-I-I know what you mean. And, yes, no matter what, marcus will always be your dad. He\u2019s amazing. I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s not more upset at you not telling us the truth. Mm, well, your father is a good man. I\u2019m just sorry that he had to rise to the occasion in the first place. So am I. I, uh, know that you spoke to \u2014 to curtis and, um \u2014 and don\u2019t worry, he didn\u2019t share anything. It was all private. I just didn\u2019t want you to think that I was keeping something from you. Again. That\u2019s right. That\u2019s right, again. Your slideshow for the post-impressionists.

But, um, it was really good to see you. Mom? I miss you, too. Doc, I\u2019m just trying to wrap my brain around what you just said. I have no indicators, as in zero? That\u2019s what the test results show. How is that possible? M-my dad\u2019s been taking medication for decades. Are you saying he doesn\u2019t have schizophrenia? I\u2019m not saying that. I\u2019m not a psychiatrist. We\u2019ve spoken about how testing for schizophrenia has come a long way since you were diagnosed, and there is much about genes and gene mutation we still don\u2019t understand. That\u2019s a lot of qualifiers, I know. But looking at those tests, you\u2019re saying the person in those tests, he\u2019s not at risk for schizophrenia? No more than anyone else. Do you think that you were able to get through to esme? Does she understand that the baby is going to be better off with me? I tried, spencer. Oh\u2026 but, unfortunately, elizabeth admitted to esme that your father held her captive at wyndemere for months, so now she is wary of all cassadines. Okay. But that is my father, that\u2019s not me. All I want is what is best for my little brother. Okay. I think I managed to convince her that I care about the baby, I want what\u2019s best for the baby, and that she can trust me. Which is why I\u2019m really hoping that we can find an arrangement here where esme is not cut out entirely. Uh, no, that is never going to work, grandmother, because of my father. Esme is never going to believe that there is a situation or [Stammers] A scenario in which the baby is better off with me, so we\u2019re going to have to take this thing to court. Spencer, I was really hoping you wouldn\u2019t say that. Okay, look, I need you to know something. I will never stop looking for an amicable solution. Amicable? Yes, for everyone involved here \u2014 you, esme, and even your father, when he comes back. You think that there\u2019s such a thing as an amicable solution when it comes to esme? It is a fight that that woman wants, so it\u2019s a fight that she\u2019s going to get. So I\u2019m going to go to the nursery and I\u2019m going to see if they\u2019ll let me hold my brother one more time before he is stripped from me. Okay, wait. There\u2019s something you should know. Esme and the baby are being taken back to spring ridge tonight. Is that your dinner? I had a late lunch. So are you going to just sit there, staring at me disapprovingly all evening, or are you going to tell me what scott did or didn\u2019t do to get you to finally come to your senses? He lied to me.\t", "[ Door opening ] Mom, are you okay?\t[ Knock on door ] Hi, esme.\t[ Door closes ] Do you have a few minutes to talk? No. Why not?

Because you could have gone straight to victor. You needn\u2019t worry. I know better. If victor found out that there\u2019s a recording of me confessing to setting you up, I\u2019d be seen as a liability \u2014 probably killed. Probably? It\u2019s good that you\u2019re clear on that.

Trina, things have gone from bad to worse. What happened? Esme said that my father kept her prisoner at wyndemere. What? I actually had to jump off a turret to get away. I-I could have been killed. I could have lost my baby. And you didn\u2019t say a word about any of this. I\u2019m sorry. I only recently found out about this. Yes, but why should I believe you? I can\u2019t trust anyone.

Why don\u2019t you take a seat? Alright. So\u2026 we need to understand your involvement with victor and what it is that you might know. Uh, I don\u2019t know how much I can tell you. Why you? Let\u2019s start with that. Why would he want a mole in the mayor\u2019s office? Well, at first, it was all about laura. He wanted me to keep tabs on her. Why is that, do you suppose? He wanted, I believe, to keep her from focusing on him? He told me to undermine her whenever possible. And was he more interested in certain information? He wanted to know if the pcpd was investigating him, but other than that, he didn\u2019t give me any details. How convenient for you. We\u2019re not partners. Victor made that quite clear. I work for him and I do what he tells me to do. And since he promised to back my political aspirations, I had no idea that he would be killing people that got in his way. You know, that\u2019s not very shrewd of you, failing to vet someone like victor when you\u2019re about to become his flunky? Come on, robert. Eileen was lured in by the promise of more. Weren\u2019t you? More power, more money. It was never about money. Victor said he believed in me. It was only until I started working for him that my eyes were opened. What did you see? Mom, are you okay? You\u2019re not sleepwalking, are you? No! No, I fell asleep. I was waiting up for you, and I just \u2014 I fell asleep. I\u2019m sure seeing me sleeping on this couch brings back bad memories for you, but I can assure you, I\u2019m not in that dark place anymore. Okay. I\u2019m glad to hear that. And I\u2019m glad you waited up for me. Yeah, why? What\u2019s up? I\u2019m going to play soccer for stanford.\t", "[ Laughs ]\t[ Gasps ]\t[ Both laugh ]\tI don\u2019t know what game you\u2019re playing, but I\u2019m not interested, victor.

I just want to be left alone to try and eat, something nearly impossible to do these days with a lump in my throat. I do so just as a matter of health and to keep up my strength. I truly am sorry about your daughter\u2019s death, liesl, but you must understand how blessed you\u2019ve been. You speak of blessings? You\u2019ve enjoyed the love of your children. Valentin came into my life for a very short while, and \u2014 and we hardly had a loving father-son relationship. In fact, we hardly had any relationship at all. Then, before I could repair the damage, he was taken from me. Not the same hell that you\u2019re experiencing, I grant you, but it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s hell nonetheless. I suppose I can feel sorry for you for that much. Then perhaps we can comfort each other, however slightly. At least let me keep you company until scott gets here. He\u2019s not coming. Oh? No? Where is he? I don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t care. The only person I want to talk to less than you is scott. I got the e-mail this morning.

Oh, my god!\t[ Laughing ] Oh! I can\u2019t believe it! Oh, wow! I am so proud of you. Thank you, mom. But what\u2019s up? You waited up for me. What\u2019s going on? Esme\u2019s remembered? No. Esme claims that elizabeth baldwin confessed to helping my father. Cam\u2019s mom\u2026 helped your dad hold esme prisoner? And you think that\u2019s true, don\u2019t you? Yeah, I can see that my dad would do something like that. And I think that my father had enough influence over elizabeth to put her in that position. Though, when my grandmother was out here, she didn\u2019t say anything to that effect. But I don\u2019t know. Maybe my grandmother and uncle victor don\u2019t know about this yet. Can you call her? She\u2019s in there with esme right now. Maybe she\u2019s finding out.\t[ Sighs ] Either way, I really hope that my grandmother can get through to esme and to help her see reason. Reason about what? Esme\u2019s lawyer filed a petition. She wants to take the baby back to prison with her. Have I ever given you any reason to believe that I was lying to you? No, you\u2019ve\u2026 been really good to me, especially when I was giving birth to ace. I couldn\u2019t have gotten through it without you. I was really glad to be there for you, and I\u2019m happy to be here for you now, and I promise you, I will make sure that you are treated fairly. Why do you care about me?

You\u2019re the mother of my grandchild, and, sweetheart, I think I have a pretty good idea of what you might be feeling right now.\t[ Voice breaking ] I was your age when I had my first baby, and I was frightened and trapped and surrounded by enemies. You were? What happened? I ended up being separated from my son for many, many years. Which is exactly what\u2019s going to happen to me. No, honey, you haven\u2019t even stood trial yet. So much can change between now and then. Yeah, but ace should be with me. I mean, I\u2019m his mom. Yeah, I know. Uh, sweetheart, you have to think about what\u2019s best for your son. Ask yourself, is prison really the best spot for a baby? What have you witnessed working with victor? He\u2019s cold. He\u2019s ruthless. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d have no qualms about killing me if he found out I was talking to you. Then you better make sure he doesn\u2019t find out. Do you know who actually shot lucy coe? Holly sutton. How did holly come to work for victor?\t[ Scoffs ] I have no idea. I\u2019ve never even seen her with him. I only know how pleased he was when he found out that anna was charged with lucy\u2019s shooting. Pleased? I mean, how did you know? One night, he told me how he loved the idea of using holly against you and anna. So victor confides in you, does he? This relationship is personal as well as professional? Sometimes. How personal?\t[ Scoffs ] If your taped confession goes public, you will never see the light of day again. You understand that? When does victor confide in you? When we\u2019re in bed together! Trina\u2019s not ready to take a dna test. Then you\u2019ve spoken to her? Yes. How is she doing? She\u2019s not responding to any of my calls and my texts, which I completely understand, but I\u2019m still worried about her. Trina\u2019s going through a lot nowadays, portia. I know. I just want to see how she\u2019s \u2014 you know. What was said between us will remain private. Of course. It\u2019s just a little information would be comforting right now. Trina\u2019s strong. You know that. Thankfully, she has a lot of support from me and taggert and josslyn, my dad \u2014 hell, even spencer. That\u2019s good. It\u2019s good that she doesn\u2019t need me. Trina will always need her mom. Thank you for that. I gotta go. I\u2019ll think about coming home.\t", "[ Voice breaking ] I will do anything to fix what has happened between us.\tBecause, if so, I understand. Applying for the scholarship is completely different than actually getting it. No! No. Obviously, I\u2019m going to miss you. We all will. But I am so happy for you to go. You worked so hard for this. You deserve it, and you\u2019re gonna be such an asset to your school. Academically, athletically \u2014 okay, okay. So then what\u2019s wrong, mom? Can we talk for a minute? I did something. Something I-I deeply regret and I need to tell you about. Okay. Um\u2026 ever since my run-in with esme on the docks, I\u2019ve known where she was, and I kept it a secret. What? Why would you do that? I thought I was doing the right thing, and by the time I realized it was wrong, it felt too late and I couldn\u2019t come forward. Okay, hold up. Hold up. Y-you knew where she was? Where \u2014 where was she?\t[ Sighs ] Nikolas kept her at wyndemere. She was locked in a room in the north tower. Victor: Well, well. The unlikely lovebirds have fallen out. Oh, come on, do tell. What was the breaking point, hm? The horrible wardrobe choices or his abysmal table manners? Oh, come on, liesl. Throw me a crumb. You and baldwin on the rocks? I\u2019m beginning to feel better already. I\u2019m not surprised. Sadistic narcissists are always amused by other people\u2019s suffering. Well, I won\u2019t put mine on display for your sordid entertainment.\t[ Chuckles ] Why are you grinning like an idiot? Ah, there\u2019s the feisty woman I know and admire back again, the liesl who spits fire and never backs down. Oh, come on, you have to admit, that feeling of adrenaline pumping again is a lot better than slipping into the pit of despair, isn\u2019t it? Yes, I suppose so. But you\u2019re familiar with that pit. I\u2019m sorry you lost your son, victor. I\u2019m sorrier that you didn\u2019t get to fulfill that relationship. So am I. Thank you. Was valentin\u2019s body recovered? Yes, it was, but I\u2019m having trouble getting the french police to release it to me. Ach so. Don\u2019t you worry. I won\u2019t rest until I can bring my son home. You\u2019re sleeping with victor? Off and on, for months.\t[ Scoffs ] It was casual. Two consenting adults, and all that. But lately, victor\u2019s been\u2026distant. Nothing my father ever does is casual. Everything is strategic. When did things change? After the explosion that destroyed the necklace that victor wanted. Mnh. I\u2019ve never seen him so angry. Did he ever tell you why he wanted that necklace? He said he needed the necklace to find something. Find what? Oh, I don\u2019t know. Yeah, you do. Think. What has he told you, exactly? One thing stands out. He said that the necklace would lead him to\u2026\t[ Sighs ] \u2026Somewhere. A-a place he was looking for. I can\u2019t get over esme being held prisoner at wyndemere. That must be why she was in the harbor on new year\u2019s eve. She came all the way from spoon island on her own. Yeah. She\u2019s a survivor, alright. Do you think she always knew that ryan chamberlain and heather webber were her parents? I mean, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s a lot to survive right there. Considering that she was only at boarding school in paris because I was there, I think that she knew about ryan for a while. What are you talking about? Ryan told ava right before commissioner scorpio shot him that ryan and esme had been working together. That was the whole reason why she was in france, was to get close to me. Our entire relationship was a setup.\t[ Clears throat ] She had instructions from ryan to get close to me and to widen the gap between me and my father and drive us apart. Looking back on it, she manipulated me beautifully from the very beginning. She was reeling me in, while at the same time encouraging me to get revenge on my father, hoping that she would drive ava and my father apart. I am so, so sorry, spencer. That is truly awful. Everything that she has told me from the very beginning has been a lie. I feel you. It\u2019s the worst.\t[ Footsteps approach ]\tCameron. I just \u2014 I-I don\u2019t get it, alright? The police suspected esme of being the killer, and they were looking for her everywhere, and you just knew where she was? Why didn\u2019t you just call them and have them handle it? I wanted to. I did. But nikolas convinced me that we were protecting the baby as well as everyone else. And for a period of time, there were no more hook attacks, so we thought we were doing the right thing.\t[ Sighs ] Until officer cabrera was killed, and then we realized it couldn\u2019t be esme. And why didn\u2019t you call the police then? I really \u2014 I really struggled with it, but I was in too deep. I didn\u2019t want to go to jail and leave you guys. And then esme showed up with \u2014 with amnesia, and a part of me thought, well, there\u2019s no reason to come forward. That would have been the easy way out. So, yesterday, I went to the police and I told them everything, and they gave me an immunity deal. Do you think you can ever forgive me? Cameron, talk to me. Just tell me what you\u2019re feeling. Let me explain what we found. You were concerned with the genes that can be indicators of schizophrenia. Right. Right. I know that there are \u2014 there are 10 genes that the scientists have linked to the disease. It\u2019s also possible to have schizophrenia without those gene mutations present. Doctor, you \u2014 you don\u2019t have to beat around the bush with me. I\u2019ve lived most of my life with this diagnosis, so, come on, give it to me straight. How many of the genes do I have? Your test results show that you do not have a single gene mutation that would indicate schizophrenia. We need to know more about this place that victor\u2019s hoping to find. What else can you tell us? Only that victor\u2019s been searching for it for years. And he believes that the necklace is the key to finding it? Yes. But he never said how or why, just that now that the necklace is gone, he\u2019s back to square one. This is good. But it\u2019s not enough. We need more. What else can you tell us? I-I don\u2019t have anything else. Well, maybe you can get victor to give you something else. How about a little bit more pillow talk? Are you suggesting that I sleep with victor to get information? No, we are not suggesting anything. However, your prior relationship with him might get him to open up. How do you propose I do that? Well\u2026 I want you to listen to what I tell you very carefully. Guard: Excuse me, mayor collins? Laura: Yes? Ms. Prince, arrangements have been made for your transport to spring ridge this evening. So soon? Yes, ma\u2019am. The orders just came in. What about my baby? The infant is going with you.\t", "[ Chuckles ] That surprises you? Scott chose someone else over me. He put someone else\u2019s needs above mine and my britta\u2019S. Well, not only is that foolish, it\u2019s unforgivable.\t[ Sighs ] So, it seems that you and i are both destined to a solitary evening. Unless, of course, we keep each other company. That will never happen. Scott\u2019s misstep can\u2019t compare to everything you\u2019ve done to me. If you think I\u2019ve forgotten, then you\u2019re a fool. I assure you, I am not. You will never touch me again, victor. I\u2019d rather be alone. The decisions we make now will affect this baby for the rest of his childhood. If we alienate esme now, we set in motion a cycle of hearings in family court. There\u2019s nothing more we can do right now. Hi. Hi, baby. No one expects a new mother to have all the answers, but ask for help if you need it. Thank you for being so kind to me. I understand I was horrible to your daughter. You\u2019re obviously a very kind person. I bet you\u2019re a great mother. I hope I can be that for my child, too. I\u2019m just doing my job, esme. Let me check on your release papers. Hi, ace. I missed you. You remember me? I\u2019m your mom, yeah? And you\u2019re my ace. We\u2019ve been through a lot together and we\u2019re kind of a mess, but we\u2019ve got each other, and nothing is gonna change that. I promise to protect you with my life.\tI don\u2019t know what to think, mom. It\u2019s a lot to process. I mean, I-I get that you think that esme is dangerous and shouldn\u2019t roam the streets. I wouldn\u2019t want her to be, either. But the way you guys went about the whole thing, it\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s a lot, and I can\u2019t believe I had no idea that you were dealing with all this. You couldn\u2019t have known. I worked very hard to keep it from you. And I am so, so sorry for letting you down like this, especially on a day when you should be celebrating this major milestone in your life. You can feel however you want about this. If you have questions, will you just come to me, and I will answer them honestly? I\u2019ll let you know. I just \u2014 I need to think about this, alone in my room. Mom? I love you, okay? And I \u2014 I am proud of you.\t[ Exhales deeply ] It must have taken a lot of guts to admit that to the police. You\u2019re a good person. I don\u2019t know how I got so lucky to have a son like you, but I\u2019m really glad I did. Thank you for still believing in me. Victor said that luke was making his life difficult. Yeah. And then he killed luke for the ice princess, without knowing that luke had already started to cut the diamond up and sell off key pieces. And then when victor examined it, it didn\u2019t have the coded messages that he was looking for. Which led him to the necklace made from diamonds cut from the ice princess. And thanks to robert, we have the diamond and the codes. Which are obviously some kind of coordinates to this place that he desperately wants to find. We\u2019re gonna figure it out. Together. Sorry we quarreled. Want to make up? I\u2019ll be damned.\t[ Chuckles ] Maybe \u2014 maybe portia was right. Right about what? She\u2019s been suggesting I might not have schizophrenia.\t[ Sighs ] Could I have been misdiagnosed all those years ago? And if so, why? Everything okay? You guys look upset. Esme\u2019s going back to spring ridge tonight. She\u2019s taking my brother with her. Already? Ace is coming with me. For now. Will the baby be warm enough? It\u2019s cold outside. He\u2019s just going down to the transport van in the parking garage. Let me see that. He\u2019ll be fine. Maybe you should, um, take this with you. No, thanks. You know, uh, it might be good to have an extra one around. You never know.\t[ Ace crying ] Thank you. Hey, it\u2019s okay. Laura, um, you can visit us at spring ridge, if you\u2019d like. I would like that. I\u2019ll see both soon. Say \u201cbye.\u201d Say \u201cbye.\u201d\t[ Ace fussing ]\t[ Chuckles ] It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m so sorry, spencer. Maybe she\u2019ll come and \u2014 she\u2019ll let you visit her, too. No. My baby brother is not going to be in there for long, and I\u2019m going to make sure I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to keep that kid away from that lunatic.\t"], "answer": [1, 2, 3, 0, 4]}

Uh, no, actually she\u2019ll be a consultant and obviously I don\u2019t need you to cosign on that. No, of course Nazi, we consulted on that and he\u2019s absolutely right. It\u2019s a man ej.

All right, and perhaps I\u2019ll remind the jury that this ex priest posed illegally as a paralegal to interfere with a police investigation.\tI seem to remember that you weren\u2019t so happy about that.

You know, I was thinking the same thing. The more we can nail it down, the more we can start eliminating suspects. Yeah. And zeroing in on the purp. No time like the present. What are you calling? Well figured. If we\u2019re gonna go back to the beginning, we might as well start with the source.\tOh, step right up folks. Best pastries in town. Buy a long shot. Hey, you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You, yeah. Buy muffin a cookie, something. Okay, mama. It\u2019s okay. We, we probably shouldn\u2019t sound too desperate. Oh. It\u2019s Jada. Hey, did you arrest her? No. Did you arrest Sloane Peterson? I\u2019m sorry, Chanel. The investigation is still ongoing, which is why I like to go over everything with you again, people, I already told you everything that I know, which unfortunately isn\u2019t much, but yeah.\tRight.

Great. So as any good evaluation starts at the top to your brother, Gabby\u2019s first order of business will be to evaluate you.\tYou want to evaluate me? Mm-hmm.\tIf there are any inefficiencies at the top brother, it certainly doesn\u2019t stem from me. Well, I\u2019ve been focusing on the day-to-day at the company.

Well, it was tall, his recipe, so I know this is kind of intense, but it\u2019s just routine. Okay. Promise I\u2019m not gonna shut to bright. Lighten your eyes or bark any questions at ya. Don\u2019t need to be nervous. Well, I thank you, but um, I\u2019m actually not nervous at all.\tI\u2019m just here to help however I can so you can nail the person who\u2019s doing this to my friend Chanel.

Uh, it would be, um, whole wheat flour, baking powder, salt, yogurt, honey butter, and buttermilk. Okay. So they couldn\u2019t have been tampered with before you got to work? No. If, if something was off with them, then I would\u2019ve known. And you didn\u2019t stray from Talia\u2019s recipe?\tNo, not at all. It\u2019s a great recipe. Well, normally it is. We made a lot of those biscuits. I mean, it\u2019s a new item and we were giving away free samples. Um, anyways, when we were done with the dough, um, we set it aside to rest, and then we close a little early for the day. Since we\u2019re usually busiest in the morning, in the afternoon, things slow down.\tHow early did you close. What time? Uh, about four Talia and I said goodbye. We went our separate ways and then I went home to my mama\u2019s and then I came to the police station and I talked to you. That\u2019s right. Yep. You were looking for your sister and I was maybe a little too pushy. I mean, talking to you about her, you know your possible feelings towards her.\tI remember. Yeah. Yeah. But let\u2019s stick to the topic at hand, shall we? So where\u2019d you go after you left here? Oh, um, I went back to the square. I wound up going back to the square so that I could grab dinner from me and my mama from the bistro. And before I left, mama told me about Sloan\u2019s threatening text, and I was angry.\tReally, really angry. Horrified, actually. And then I ran into Sloan and I actually got there just in time because Sloan and Chano were having this. Knocked down, drag out fight and I had to stop him. Sloane was saying all sorts of like cruel things about Chanel and her mom, and then she stormed off. Chanel was actually very, very upset.\tShe made a cut on her arm. I just tried to calm her down. So we went back to Sweet Bitch. There is a first aid kit in the kitchen, TAA patch me up and the dough, it was still there resting. Untouched and we turned off the security system when we went back in so no one could have gotten in there before then.\tAnd um, when we were done, Chanel asked if I wanted to have dinner with her and her family. I guess I was just really excited about that. It was such a nice invitation and I really wasn\u2019t expecting it. So, um, I forgot to just turn an alarm back on. You were excited. Chanel\u2019s a new friend. That\u2019s exciting, right?\t", "We don\u2019t have the evidence that we need to tie Sloan to any of this. Oh, no fingerprints. No, no security footage.

She\u2019s still new with the job.\tAnd Sloan Peterson is still walking streets. With all due respect, Mr. Mayer, we can\u2019t even be sure that Sloan was the perp.

I\u2019m so worried about being drugged.\tSuddenly got got a little worried myself because I know that was a one-time awful thing that you and Talia had nothing to do with. Uh, so gimme that delicious beer claw. In fact, gimme a whole tray of \u2019em. I\u2019ll show you how much I support you. You know not to mention how much I love Sweet Fit, and it\u2019s the finest bakery on the planet.\tOh Mama. It\u2019s okay. Look, you don\u2019t need to prove anything to me or Talia. We both know that you\u2019re on our side. It\u2019s just I\u2019m feeling a little sensitive this morning because Sweet Bids business is doing really bad for the first time ever, and. Well, we all know who\u2019s to blame that evil. Sloan Peterson, she came to Salem to ruin me, and she thinks I took her mother\u2019s life.\tAnd that isn\u2019t news. But what is news is she\u2019s succeeding. Her plan to destroy me is going real, real well. Oh,\tOh, look after me baby girl. I will not stand idly by while Sloane continues her heinous attacks on us. On your business, on decency itself, and I swear to you, should now mommy your phone. Oh, it can wait. No, no, mom, it\u2019s okay. Just take it. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m going anywhere. Okay, honey, but I\u2019ll be right back.\tI love my mama and trust me, she can move mountains when she puts her mind to it. But it\u2019s not like she can single handedly convince everyone to trust our treats. Talia, I I don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna be able to keep you on. Hey, don\u2019t worry about me right now. Okay. Listen, I\u2019ll be fine and so will you. And yes, unfortunately people are worried about what sweetest has to offer.\tBut it\u2019s gonna make eight grand recovery. I know it. Okay. And it\u2019s gonna be better than ever. Come on, you\u2019ll see. I appreciate your optimism, but I don\u2019t know. I look, I, I still think you should keep your options open. Okay. So I, Hey, I, I can reach out to my friend trip and I, I can see if he could put in a word for you at the hospital.\tNo, you\u2019re a doctor after all. No, listen, I\u2019m a baker now. This is where I belong. Look, I, I, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re hearing me. Okay. There is zero money coming in. You can\u2019t work for free. Sure, I can. Why would you do that? Because I believe in you. Look, I know that I\u2019m new to all of this. What Chanel working here with you?\tI don\u2019t know. It just, it all seems right, like it was like sort of meant to be or something. You know? How tall you, you\u2019re the best.\tAre you saying that you believe that Sloan is innocent? Mr. Mayor, as you know, we don\u2019t have any definitive evidence and until we do. Is my job as an investigator to study all of the facts and keep an open mind. I\u2019m with my detective here. Hey, is it possible that maybe, maybe you\u2019re too close to this, could be, um, clouding your judgment?\tMaybe it is because it is personal, deeply personal. Hmm. I love my family and I love this town, and right now both are under attack. You can spew your grandiose threats all you want on Melinda, but you know damn well that if these Salem Keystone cops actually had anything on me, I\u2019d be in custody. Not necessarily, and since it\u2019s fairly obvious that this crime was committed on the night before, everyone was tripping on those biscuits.\tYou\u2019d better start inventing your alibi for saided night. She doesn\u2019t have to invent one because she was with me all night. Yeah. Well, you better hope someone can corroborate that Ms. Trask in order for somebody to corroborate that. That means they would have to have been there. Sloan and I are not into that kind of thing.\tWhen we spend the night together. We like just to be two of us together and what a wonderful night it was.\tThis, this is preposterous Stephan moving Gabby back into my family home without consulting me acting like it\u2019s his God-given, right?

It\u2019s the happiest time of my life and now you\u2019re back here where you belong. Pretty soon, your divorce from Lee will be final and we\u2019ll be back to being Mr. And Mrs. Steph and Damara again forever. This time. For now, do you think we completely press in the place?

I mean, how can I not God, Eric, it seems like every time something awful happens in this town, I\u2019m the one that\u2019s getting blamed for it. It\u2019s so unfair. It is. I know,\tI know. You know, I\u2019m sorry. I should be focusing on the positive, you know, like you and I are officially a thing now. You sing. Sounds so official To hell with everything else, Eric, Brady and I are officially thanks. Hey, I, I already feel better. Good.\tAre you sure you want to eat that? Sloan? What? I\u2019d expect retaliation if I were you after drugging all of Salem\u2019s breakfast, including mine.\tHi.\tSorry, it\u2019s just, um, no, no, I, I understand, but I promise I am not hallucinating anymore. I even skip breakfast just to be sure. I am not happy with you two. I\u2019m not happy at all. I dunno what, what\u2019s wrong? Am uh, please tell me that Sloane Peterson didn\u2019t go public with what she saw. Not that I know of. And I don\u2019t give a damn about that kiss that happened between the two of you when you were hallucinating or whatever.\tWhat I do give a damn about is there has been no arrest. In this insane drugging debacle, you know, the only person that\u2019s paid a price is my stepdaughter, whose career is in jeopardy. So what is the hold up? Why the hell is Sloan Peterson still walking the streets?\tReally? No one, and we can\u2019t even give this stuff away. People see me standing here smiling, and then they just turn, tell and run. Even old Mrs. Weaver, who is always here bright and early every morning, you know, I\u2019m so sorry. Those breakfast biscuits were my recipe. I feel terrible. Why? It\u2019s not your fault.\tIt\u2019s not like you drug those biscuits. What are you feeling guilty about?\tMorning girl. Morning mama. I have a bearclaw.

I, um, honey, is, is something bothering you?\tI\u2019m just a little tired. I mean, Aren you, after all that racket coming from Stefan\u2019s room last night. Oh yeah. That was quite a performance and I\u2019d say Act three was a bit unnecessary. Yeah, that\u2019s, that\u2019s the problem. Those noises weren\u2019t a performance, not this time. It was all too real. A bloody siren call to troubled waters.\tYou think they heard us downstairs? I think they heard us in Cat Mando. But who cares? Not me. I love you. I love you. I can stay with you like this all day. Yeah. Mm-hmm. What are you doing the rest of the year wide open. We both know we do some pretty important plans today. We certainly do. Yeah.\tPlease. You know, It\u2019s one thing for Paulina Price who\u2019s totally ignorant to how the law works to make an accusation with absolutely no proof whatsoever, but it is unseemly, if not despicable and unethical for someone with a law degree to do the same. I assume you do have a law degree in Melinda. Yeah, and I also have a brain, which is why I deduce that you are the only person that hates Chanel Dupree enough to want to kill her business.\tAnd don\u2019t even get started on these conspiracy theories that her and her mother are masterminding a frame up because both of us know that that is patently ridiculous. Ms. Trask, if you don\u2019t mind, I believe that Sloan pointed out that you have no evidence to prove that she ever tampered with the biscuits, which means this is heading towards slander.\tWould I be correct, Sloan? Oh, this is not slander Mr. Brady. It is personal, you see, because I was also drug by whatever the hell was in those biscuits. I ended up assaulting Stephan Damira and I wound up spending the night in the hospital. And do you know who was in the room? Across from me, the police commissioner.\tOh. How awful for you. I\u2019m so sorry, but why should I give a damn? Since I had nothing to do with this? Here\u2019s why you should give a damn Ms. Peterson. You have caught the wrong people in your net, powerful people who do not like being screwed with. So get your affairs in order because I am going to make sure that you go down for this and you will go away for a long, long time.\t", "Sure. Yeah. And you forgot to turn the alarm on? Yes. Um, she even asked me to do it, but I guess I just wasn\u2019t thinking. And what time was that at? Uh, probably 15 after five, somewhere around there. And you returned to work when? Five the next morning. So roughly 12 hours unaccounted for. Ado just sitting there in the kitchen with no alarm set and no security camera on, which is all my fault.\tI, I, I, I really can\u2019t believe I forgot. This is not Holly\u2019s fault. I mean, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s in the habit of turning on the security system, you know, she hasn\u2019t even been working there that long. Right? So later at your place, nothing to tell. We had takeout from the bistro and just sat around the table talking, listen, nice evening.\tAnd then I went straight home to rest up for the next morning. Well, you know the rest, it was a disaster.\tThanks again, ladies. We appreciate your cooperation. Yeah, I just hope this helps nail Sloan and that she\u2019s locked away for good. She\u2019s the only one who could have done this. Yeah, I agree. I can\u2019t think of anybody else who would wanna hurt Chanel like this. Well, I\u2019ll see you at home later. Um, hey, uh, you don\u2019t have to come back with me.\tI\u2019m just gonna go and lock up for the day or for the rest of our lives. Chanel, stop. Don\u2019t say that. Okay. The customers will come back. I know it. We\u2019ll see.\tHi. Were they here? Is there a new development of Shanova? Just going over the timeline. There\u2019s a 12 hour window when those biscuits could have been tampered with. Well, you got your work cut out for you. I just saw Sloan and she\u2019s got a solid alibi for the night before Eric Brady. He spent the night with her.\tShe could have slipped out during the night while he was asleep. No villa proven it. Any other suspects we\u2019re working on it.\tHey, ugh. It\u2019s a hell of a way to start a day. Don\u2019t let trash get underneath your skin. You got the truth on your side. You would be shocked how little that actually matters. I didn\u2019t drug that dough, though it wasn\u2019t me. Someone did. Someone drugged it and made everyone in this town go totally nuts, including you and Nicole.\tWell, well, well, Mr. Damira, you outdid yourself. Oh, I\u2019m glad you approved. Oh, not only approved, I was impressed as I was with you. I put you on the spot there, but I knew I could count on you. Mm-hmm.\tReady to go beam up to the mothership. Excuse me. Oh, I\u2019m just messing with you brother. Figured we could carpool though. No more the merrier. Right? You can drive. Oh, I intend to brother. Let\u2019s do this.\tI dunno if we could only think of someone else who could have done this. I mean, who else has it in for Chanel, that\u2019s a tough one. Since everybody in this town seems to just love that girl and her mother. Melinda did make one good point though. I mean, at first I thought for sure it was Paulina and Chanel that were doing this, but why would they hurt Chanel\u2019s business by drugging half the city just to get at me?\tNo. Well, no, it wouldn\u2019t be worth it. You\u2019re right. So if we\u2019re gonna figure this out, we need a first thing. Who was the intended target exactly. Was it Chanel or was it me and I have 5:15 PM as the time they left Sweet bits for the last time that day without setting the security cameras check. Yeah, the rest was pretty inconsequential.\tThey both had dinner with Pauline and Abe. Yeah, I got that too. Yep. And then your sister went straight home after that. Chanel stayed behind and they didn\u2019t see each other till 5:00 AM the next morning. So check out, huh? Oh yeah. 5:00 AM Yep. Got it. Wait, what did you just say?\tThanks for watching everything. Oh, it was no problem, baby girl. Well, uh, you are officially relieved of duty. I\u2019m just gonna close up for the day. Well, how\u2019d it go at the station? I\u2019ll fill you in later. All I can think about right now is I\u2019m gonna lose my bakery. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You are not. I will not let that happen.\tNo. It\u2019s gonna be okay, sweetheart. I promise you. No, mama. It\u2019s not. Yes, yes, daughter. It is. And I\u2019m going to convince you of it tonight. Mm-hmm. Over a wonderful meal, which I will cook for you and Talia, and we\u2019ll have a lovely meal and then we\u2019ll figure out how to get your business up and running again.\tThat is really sweet. But I already sent Talia home. For the day.\tI don\u2019t understand. All I did was ask you what happened after Chanel and Talia left sweet bits, and you not only haven\u2019t answered, you seem kind of upset. What\u2019s up, Jada? I just realized.\tNatalia told you is not true.\t"], "answer": [3, 2, 0, 1, 4]}

Well, if that were true, Gabby would\u2019ve told me about it, and I would\u2019ve heard first.\tI can\u2019t speak to Gabby\u2019s willingness to share information, but if I were to guess what\u2019s going on here, it sounds like Lee is trying to get her interested in a new business opportunity. So she loses interest in his DEMIRA shares and by extension, You. No way that\u2019s gonna happen. Gabby loves me and she wants nothing more than to be back together.\tNo, Wakely distract her by waving some shiny new business opportunity in front of her face. But if she gives in to her feelings for you, she could lose her mirror shacks. How do you know about that?\tYou wanna ride to the station? Sure. We can talk about what a bummer it is, being the older sibling. And you can tell me what you and Talia were talking about when I walked up. I mean, it\u2019s none of my business. It\u2019s just what? Hmm hmm. Oh, just the look on your face is when I came. Nevermind. Oh, you know, it, it\u2019s Sean.\tUh, you know, we\u2019ve been trading info on the case we have, so I should probably take this. You you go ahead. I\u2019ll drive myself. Hunter.\tSo you never went to culinary school? No, um, actually I had a different focus, but baking is just something I know. Do you also know that you\u2019re talking to a couple of criminal. You think you\u2019ve won, don\u2019t you? Oh honey, we know we have. Well, you are wrong. I am not giving up on making YouTube bitches pay for what you\u2019ve done.\tLook, I don\u2019t know what your problem is, but you can\u2019t just talk to them like that. They\u2019re my problem. This one\u2019s a murderer and this one covered it up. Your lawyer may have pulled a rabbit out of her. But you are not off the hook. You listen to me, Sloan Peterson, you have lost and you will keep on losing and losing.\tSo how about you\u2019ll find something better to do with your time than trying to hurt me and my family trying to drag us a court to satisfy your sick need for revenge. When my daughter and I, we have done nothing wrong. Do you hear me? Maybe. Maybe I don\u2019t need court to get my revenge. Ever thinking that,\tso Stephan called and you didn\u2019t think to tell me. You saw the notification before I had a chance. Uh, it was a very brief call. He asked for you and I said you were getting ready for a meeting. Needed to stay focused. Lee, I don\u2019t need a secretary, nor do I need you answering my phone without my permission.\tWell, I I, I\u2019m sorry. I, I just, I wasn\u2019t thinking, uh, why don\u2019t you call him back now if you like. I mean, it might make us late for the meeting at Saxon\u2019s, but. We can probably make up the time on the break. No, I don\u2019t wanna be late and there\u2019s no, we okay. It\u2019s just me remember. Fine. Um, the only thing is they\u2019re expecting me to, and I wouldn\u2019t want them wondering why I didn\u2019t show up.\tThat would be an unnecessary distraction, and I wouldn\u2019t want to spoil your pitch before you even get to make it.\tYou\u2019re driving.\tOh. Uh, Lee\u2019s little sister, Wendy, she mentioned something about her morals clause in their, uh, marriage contract. Wow. Surprise Lee would share that information with her and that she would just impart that knowledge onto. Well, no one\u2019s ever accused Wendy of discretion. Look, I\u2019m sorry if I spoke out of tone.\tI didn\u2019t know that this clause was on a need to know basis. Either way, I, I, I don\u2019t envy you, Stephan. It certainly is a very tricky situation. It is indeed. He\u2019s watching us like a hawk waiting for me and Gabby to give into feelings for one another, and I, I can\u2019t figure out a way.\tWell, Stephan, maybe I can help you. How? Well, maybe, um, yeah, I can arrange for you and Gabby to meet privately. I mean, after all, Lee\u2019s not watching.\tIt\u2019s a very kind offer. What can I say? I\u2019m, I\u2019m a romantic at heart, and I just, I really want you and Gabby to be happy together, and since you two boys have made peace, I\u2019m on your side as much as EJ is.\tThat\u2019d be amazing. Thank you. Of course. But I, I\u2019ll, uh, I\u2019ll get to work and. I\u2019ll let you know as soon as I come up with something. I\u2019m very grateful, Nicole, and I know Gabby will be too.\tWell done Oscar worthy. Now I was just following the plan.

I\u2019m not so sure what, I dunno. Something\u2019s missing. Trying to figure out what it is. Brown sugar? Mm-hmm. . Oh yeah. How come I didn\u2019t think of that? You know, it\u2019d be more perfect that you had added a little bit more of a caramel note too. Caramel note, huh? Yeah. Everything else is great though. I mean, I still can\u2019t believe you get to roll out of bed and have breakfast like this waiting for you.\tWhat? Well, don\u2019t get too used to it. Now that you found a job, you\u2019re gonna have to find your own place too. I don\u2019t plan on sharing my bed with my little sister forever. Why not? It\u2019s not like you\u2019re sharing it with anybody else.\tCommissioner, find a house. Call come bearing documents. Still think you\u2019re making a mistake, but uh, you want to drop the charges against Brady and Eric, you\u2019re gonna need to sign on the dotted line. I do. Don\u2019t come in. Okay. Look, don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s not like I enjoyed being kidnapped and worked over by a met scientist, but gotta say I can\u2019t complain about the end.\tCome. Right? Yeah. You made that clear. So why did the police commissioner find it necessary to run this errand in person? Well, actually, I\u2019m not just here to have you sign documents. I\u2019m also here about my sister, Gabby,\tyou won\u2019t regret agreeing to take this meeting, Mr. Sax. Hmm. In fact, I\u2019m, I\u2019m very confident that you\u2019ll be impressed with my wife. She\u2019s not only a a, a brilliant businesswoman. She\u2019s extraordinarily creative. Good morning, Mrs.\tGood morning, and it\u2019s been a very enjoyable one so far.\tOh, a text really this hour. It\u2019s not a text. It\u2019s an alert.\tIt\u2019s an alert to let me know if there\u2019s any job opportunities for a photo. and it\u2019s may be covered because of you and I appreciate it, but I need to fill my daytime hours.\tWhat a lovely way to wake up. Did you sleep well? Better than I have in. O I don\u2019t know how long, uh, well, not having a drug-induced hangover probably helps, no doubt. You know, maybe what also helps is you and Stephan finally sitting down and hashing everything out. Yeah, about that. There\u2019s a bit more to the story.\tHmm. We\u2019ll film in, please. Yes, Ste and I hashed things out, but that doesn\u2019t mean everything\u2019s settled far from that, you see. Though my brother may not know it. I\u2019m as committed as I am and was to taking him down\tlike sands through the hourglass. So are the days of our lives.\tStop. Stop. What? The alert. Just cancel it. Sorry. I need a job. Right. No, I get that. But not just any job. You\u2019re incredibly talented. Eric, a wonderful photographer. So who needs a boss? Hmm? You should be your own boss. You should open up your own gallery.\tI don\u2019t understand. I mean, not that I expected you and Stefan to become best friends. I understand. Look, I said all the right things to him. But I did have my fingers crossed behind my back, as did my brother, I\u2019m sure. And it\u2019s obvious he wants what he\u2019s always wanted Lee out of the way, Gabby in his life, and the two of them running the mirror, which I am not going to allow to happen, meaning I have to stop the two of them teaming up to sme.\tOkay? And how are you gonna accomplish? Well, they\u2019re forming my own team, of course, which I\u2019ve actually already done with Lee Shin.\tMm-hmm. . I look forward to it as well. Yeah, talk soon then. Thanks. So how much did you hear? I heard your comments about me, your very effusive comments, all of them sincere. You want this deal for your fashion line to go through at Saxons, don\u2019t you? What I, no. I haven\u2019t even agreed to go in and pitch them and hear you her setting it up.\tWell, you seem intrigued enough last night you took all the paperwork to bed with you. Just curious. That\u2019s all. It doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m ready to make a deal. It\u2019s just an initial meeting and no one\u2019s gonna rush you into anything. Gabby, I want you to have an outlet. This incredible creativity of yours and Saxton seems very interested, but if, if I\u2019m being too pushy, I can always call them back and cancel the meeting.\tSo can I assume that Gabby living with Lee bugs the hell outta you as much as it does me. I hate it a lot. Figured as much, although I will admit, I, uh, don\u2019t really know all the details of their arrangement considering Gabby, uh, well, she stopped confiding in me since she knows how I feel about Lee as opposed to all the warm and fuzzies you feel about me.\t", "one, which I might be able to take advantage of. Aj, you\u2019re playing a dangerous game. What if Stephan finds out what you\u2019re doing behind his back? ? Well, I like taking risks. That\u2019s the fun in life, isn\u2019t it? Wouldn\u2019t you say? Yeah, bet. I guess it depends on what that risk is. Wow. Getting involved with someone romantically.\tThat\u2019s risky business, isn\u2019t it? Since one. You can have that poor little heart. True, but it\u2019s definitely fun nonetheless. Wouldn\u2019t you agree? Yes.\tThe hell do you think you\u2019re doing? Getting dressed. This is my bedroom. Remember living out a suitcase over here, unless of course you wanna change our sleeping agreement, invite me into your bedroom. Nice try. I\u2019m gonna go get ready myself. Hey, listen for breakfast, um, egg white omelet with spinach butter toast, coffee, black.\tComing up.\tHello Stephan Lee. What the hell are you doing? Answering Gabby\u2019s phone.\tUh, sweet bits. They\u2019re going out of. Well, Chanel and Paul might not know that yet, but yes, and once I win my case against them, the space is mine. I want better use of it than for your gallery. Are you sure about this? Did it all win? No. Yes. No. No, no. But this is a good idea. Look, I get it. You don\u2019t wanna take business away from Chanel and you won\u2019t be, you know, that\u2019s, that\u2019s my job.\tAnd believe me, I\u2019m really looking forward to doing it. You\u2019re just like the beneficiary. And with the cash I win from my judgment against them. I mean, hey, I can even be an investor too,\tme with Brown Gallery. Oh, don\u2019t say no because it\u2019s Complic. Say yes because it\u2019s thrilling.\tYou better get that. This maybe. About the case. Hold on, on Peterson here.\tWhat?\tGod, I hated this never ending war with Sloan. Oh, believe me. Believe me. I hate it too. And you are right. This is war. That\u2019s why we need to think strategically now. If you hire this girl, it\u2019s gonna look like you\u2019re trying to put one over on the court, and then the judge will penalize you and then Sloan wins\tit\u2019s bill. Well, well answer. It\u2019s probably about the case. Hello? What\tBella are you. Oh, no, no, no. She knows right here. She\u2019s right here with me now. Y Yeah. Okay. No, I have to call you back. Oh. Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord, Lord, mama. Stop calling for the Lord and tell me what happened. Come on. What did Bell say? Mama? Mama. You\u2019re scaring me. Oh, I\u2019m sorry. I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re gonna do now that we\u2019re gonna have all this free time since Bell got the case thrown out.\tOh, baby throw we free, which\tGood morning, brave. Hi. Hi. So, uh, you enjoying your time in Salem so far? You know, I was until about 20 minutes ago when my big sister was saying I was cramping. Her style. Need to move out stack. But little does she know you have to have style to cramp first. . Please feel free to ignore her. Yeah, duly noted.\tThat\u2019s, what were you guys talking about a second ago when I walked up? This seemed kind of intense. You know, it\u2019s funny you should ask, didn\u2019t you say you have the new Java Co too? You know, we didn\u2019t want you to be late. Oh no, it\u2019s. A good point. You know, now that I\u2019m a baker, I have to get used to the early morning shifts.\tWait, wait, wait. You\u2019re going to be working at a bakery? Mm-hmm. at Sweet Bits in Horton Town Square. You know it. That\u2019s your new job. What\u2019s wrong with that? Sweet Bits has the best donuts in town, and they\u2019ll be even better now that I\u2019m there. What\u2019s going on? Why would you work as a baker? What\u2019s wrong with Bakers?\tNothing. That\u2019s your chosen field, but it isn\u2019t yours now, is it? What am I missing here? It\u2019s just that tie here is not a baker. She\u2019s a doctor.\tYou\u2019re a doctor? I have a medical degree, yes. Stop making it sound like you just got your learner\u2019s permit. She got her degree from Stanford, one of the best medical schools in the country, and she graduated top 10% of her class. Top 5%. Actually, you know, you\u2019re only proof my point, right? How is working at a baker using any of your talents?\tI\u2019m a very talented. When you said you got a job, I assumed it was at University Hospital. I thought it was always your dream to follow in daddy\u2019s footsteps. No, it was daddy\u2019s dream to me. Follow him into medicine. It doesn\u2019t make it mine. But you worked so hard.

Oh, you can hire, uh, baker\u2019s dozen of Talia if you want to. Oh, did you see what I just did there? Uhhuh. . Yeah. I, I did what?

Dust\tI wondered how that witch is taking it.\tYeah, yeah, yeah. It\u2019s okay. Okay. It\u2019s okay. Please. Everything is not okay. That whole lawsuit, everything, everything relied on that, and now it\u2019s dead in the water. They\u2019re murderers, and they won again. Right. It was just a civil case, right? No one was going to prison. It\u2019s about money you have. It was never about the money.\tThey\u2019ve torn my family apart and they just keep getting away with it because they\u2019re cute and cuddly and fun and everyone loves them.

It sound like your case was unimportant.\tIs my last shot my,\tcan I help you? You can help me Lee, by giving Gabby her phone back. I\u2019m afraid. My wife is a little busy right now. Doesn\u2019t have time for Chit Chat. She\u2019s getting dressed for a very important meeting. What meeting? If Gabby thinks it\u2019s any of your business, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll tell you. It\u2019s just not my place.\tThe clock is ticking on that little six month deal you. You know what happens when time runs out? I know what will happen if you keep calling here. I also know what will happen if by some bizarre chance you actually succeed attempting her into some secret rendezvous thought of that scares you to death, doesn\u2019t it?\tIt should scare Gabby to death because she fails to resist you. She\u2019ll lose all those dememer shares and she\u2019ll have you to thank for that because you couldn\u2019t keep it in your pants. So do her a. Do yourself a favor and stay away from my wife, Lee.

Oh, I am revising the budget for Sweet Bits with Talia on board. I\u2019ll be able to add back some of the popular items to our menu, and thanks to Bill, I will be able to actually pay my new employee\tI didn\u2019t know that was an issue. , but I\u2019m certainly happy that you can.

Mm-hmm. . Any relation to Detective Jada Hunter? Yeah, she\u2019s my sister.\tYou know her? No, but I do know of her. My partner arrested me once.\tI just don\u2019t get it. She spent all those years in medical school just to become a baker. She\u2019s trying to change her life, pursue her dream. Her dream was to become a doctor and she pursued that dream with a vengeance. Totally driven. Little Miss Overachiever. You heard the way she corrected me about where she graduated at Stanford.\tI mean, who does that if they\u2019re not proud of their. Well, it\u2019s certainly something to be proud of. Exactly, but I know better than to try to sit her down and set her straight. It\u2019d be a complete waste of breath. I wanna hear that. I mean, Garo and Gabby, they have made some curious choices over the years, despite my excellent advice.\tMust be hard being right outta the time. Mm-hmm. , . And also being the older sibling, you know, we were born to be, um, ignored, disrespected, and resented, but we love those disrespectful, recent, resentful, young ones anyway, don\u2019t we? Dearly .

Yeah, but it\u2019s my pitch. I can do it myself. I don\u2019t need help with that. They are expecting both of us. That\u2019s fine. I can just tell \u2019em that you\u2019re Stephan called.\tI dunno what my problem is. His name\u2019s Lee Shin.\tHe just told me that Gabby was too busy to talk because she\u2019s headed to some important business meeting, and I\u2019m sure that creep made the whole thing up as another ploy to keep us apart. Well, maybe it wasn\u2019t made up. What do you mean? Word on the street is Saxon\u2019s, maybe partnering with Gabby on a new fashion line.\t", "Well, let\u2019s just say that he makes you look. Uh, now with that said, I hope to hell you, uh, haven\u2019t given up on getting her away from. Oh no. Never giving up on that. You can bank on it. Good, good. Just be careful. You know, Shannon obviously already tried to pull the plug on you once. I, uh, don\u2019t think he really likes competition.\tI\u2019m not competition shin. I\u2019m gonna blow that son of a bitch out of the water.\tA gallery. Me. Well, when I couldn\u2019t fall asleep last night, I spent a good hour going through your portfolio. Eric, you would have no trouble filling in entire gallery\u2019s walls, especially with those photos you took in Africa, . Now you\u2019ve been building this whole library of images. And meanwhile, you set alerts on your phone for someone who has a 10 of your talent, hoping that they\u2019ll dein to hire you.\tListen, I need a job, Sloan. No. What you need is to take charge of your career. You know, I appreciate your support, but I mean, God getting a gallery space, do you know what it takes? It takes money to buy the supplies, not to mention a gallery. So how am I supposed to find that I have the perfect place? It\u2019s called Sweet Bits.\tYou may remember the person I hired. Her name is Talia and she is perfect for sweet bits. I remember her fine. You are the one forgetting we can Scott throwing money around Chan. Now every penny we spin is being watched by the court. Damn it, mama. I can\u2019t believe Sloane Peterson got that judge to sign off on a plan like this.\tPlease tell me that bail is working on getting that freeze on our accounts reversed. Believe me, she\u2019s trying. I mean, she\u2019s hoping to get the whole crazy case that\u2019s missed, but we have to be realistic. Baby girl. She\u2019s a lawyer, not a miracle worker. Okay, well, neither am I and I can\u2019t rent a successful bakery without any.\tI need to swoop in and lock Talia down before I lose her. But what if you made this girl an unpaid intern? No. Nope. Just until the lawsuit is over. I cannot do that. Mama. She worked at one of the most successful bakeries in New York City. I mean, I have to offer her a competitive salary or else someone else in Salem is gonna snap her up in.\tNow I guess you need to win the lottery.\tI open my door to you, give you a place to lay your head, and this is the things I get grief about my love life. I was just joking. Really? You thought that was funny? Ugh, you\u2019re too sensitive, Jada. And look, I\u2019m not with anyone else either right now and it\u2019s fine. Me and you we\u2019re independent women, right?\tWe do just fine on our own. That we do. So here\u2019s to the both of us flying solo.\tSo how long has it been, since what? Since that flying solo and here I thought we were dropping the subject. Fine. It\u2019s none of my business. No, it\u2019s. But I, I have nothing to hide. I broke up with someone a few months ago. Wow. A few months. It\u2019s a long time. My breakup was pretty loose. I\u2019m doing fine, Talia, and I\u2019m sure you are.\tBut is there someone new on the horizon at least?\tAfter my brother and I got honest with each other, I invited Lee over to tell him that I\u2019m willing to join forces, and now he knows that I fully support his reconciliation with Gabby, and I\u2019m willing to do whatever it takes to make that happen. Okay. And what did you tell him about the situation with Stephan?\tNothing he can use against. Leon knows what I want him to know, and more importantly, Leoni heard what he\u2019s willing to hear, and in return I got an earful. Meaning, meaning he\u2019s cooked up some wonderful distraction for Gabby one, which she\u2019s just made.\tDon\u2019t cancel. The meeting won\u2019t look on either one of us if I bail now. So I\u2019ll go in beat with sex and see what happens. I actually know what will happen. You\u2019ll go in there and press the hell out of them. Before you know it, everyone will forget all about Gabby Sheik and your new designs will leave them in the dust.\tOkay. You can dial down on the flattery. I know how good I am. Oh, it doesn\u2019t hurt to be reminded, does it? I\u2019m gonna go get ready for this meeting. Oh. Then I\u2019ll make you breakfast to remember.\tSo Gabby might have a new fashion line through Saxon\u2019s department stores. Department starts, right? So while Stephan\u2019s forced to sneak around, try and statue a few stolen moments with. She\u2019ll be going to bed every night just a few feet from the man who revived the artistic side of her career. My Gabby\u2019s in love with Stephan, and she\u2019s mourned him for years.\tShe\u2019s never gonna be able to stay away from him. Mm. And that\u2019s where things get interesting. Oh boy. How so? He filled me in on a very important stipulation in his and Gabby\u2019s deal. She will get his Demir shares if she remains in the marriage for six months, but only if she remains faithful. Oh my God. The contract actually has a fidelity.\t"], "answer": [1, 4, 2, 3, 0]}

Love you too.\tWant me to check the security system? Um, about that. Pause. See, I can explain. You see a No, this price look come alone. Come on Paulina. Paulina. Everything that happens in this room is confidential. You don\u2019t have to explain anything to me. Oh, no, no, no. But I want to, um, I\u2019m not lying to my husband. Oh, of course I was.\tI flat out lied, but it wasn\u2019t meant to hurt him. It, it was to, to see he worries about me and I don\u2019t want him to, it\u2019s not good for him. Like I said, you don\u2019t have to explain anything to me. Okay. Now, could you, uh, tell me why you\u2019re here? Well, I have an appointment with Dr. Greenberg. I guess he\u2019s running late.\tUh, no, he actually got called into surgery. He asked me to handle your initial workup and. This is Chanel made the appointment for you and when Dr. Greenberg\u2019s a cardiologist, were you experiencing heart palpitations? I thought I was having a heart attack, but, um, Chanel\u2019s new hire, she said it was just a panic attack.\tWell, it\u2019s a good thing you came in. I\u2019d much rather you get a diagnosis from a doctor than someone who I, his cakes for a living. Well, Talia Hunter is a great baker, but she also happens to be a full-fledged doctor. Doctor.\tOh, well good evening, detective. It\u2019s, it\u2019s nice to see you. I\u2019m off duty. Why not call me Jada. Okay, Jada, you know, I\u2019ve been hearing really good things about your work. I love my job. And has Commissioner Hernandez been treating you right? Oh, absolutely. He\u2019s a great boss. Yeah. That\u2019s good to hear. Mm-hmm. You have a nice night.\tYou too.\tSo you\u2019re up work. It\u2019s not work if you love it. I just made a strudel that was a masterpiece. If I do say so. You know, it\u2019s, it\u2019s kind of weird hearing a doctor, well, X doctor be so happy to triple their customer\u2019s cholesterol levels. Look, I know you think I\u2019m wasting my medical degree, but once a doctor, always a doctor, whatever, you say, oh, you don\u2019t believe me.\tAsk my boss\u2019s mother. She\u2019ll tell you, just today I performed a medical miracle.\tSo you performed a medical miracle? Yes. Chanel\u2019s mother was convinced she was having a heart attack, and I diagnosed it as a panic attack. Wow. You know, that\u2019s right up there with the loaves and fishes. You always minimize my achievements. I\u2019ve always spoke very highly of your cupcakes. The works of art.\tHuh? You know, I just see Paulina having a panic attack. That Peterson woman is just dedicated to ruining her life and Chanel\u2019s. So what\u2019s happening with that investigation? It\u2019s ongoing. Oh, you\u2019ve got fuck Kiss, right? You want me to dish your little hot cross buns? Look, ongoing means first thing in the morning.\tWe\u2019re gonna go through everything we have and find some hard evidence to. Counselor Sloan Peterson in a cell where she belongs first thing tomorrow. Uh huh So that means you\u2019re off tonight. Yeah. So what are you gonna do? Get some takeout, watch tv. You know, life in the fast lane. Hmm. Okay. Stop. Let me ask you this.\tWhen\u2019s the last time you\u2019ve been on a date since that X, please. Five. Your silence speaks volumes. Girl, you need to get back out. What about that hunky cop guy that I always see you with? Hmm. Sean\u2019s my partner and he\u2019s married. No, I\u2019m not talking about him. I\u2019m talking about your boss, the Hernandez guy.\tHmm. Hey, commissioner. Hello, Mr. Mayor. Check in, see if there\u2019s anything new on the break here, and call me the sauce. Yeah, well, unfortunately we didn\u2019t have enough evidence on Peterson to hold her, but Jada and I will start over tomorrow. Jada Hunter, right? Mm-hmm. I just ran into her. Yeah. So how\u2019s she doing over here?\tGreat. Terrific instincts and, uh, getting better every day. See you like it? Yes. Did I not make that clear? I didn\u2019t mean professionally. There\u2019s nothing going on between the two of you. Is there, so, uh oh. Where\u2019s this coming from? I know the rules that would violate your new policy, uh, superiors and subordinates getting involved.\tYes, yes, it would. Mm-hmm. Now, I don\u2019t mean to drag this out, RA, but I still haven\u2019t heard a denial commission. Now are you or are you not romantically interested in one of your detectives?\tSo Stephanie figured it out. He went along with us setting him and Gavi up, and then at the last minute he got Melinda Tross to play his love interest, hard to understand how he could penetrate such a subtle cunning plot. And the hell did he get trust to go along. You think that\u2019s the important issue?\t", "my hands are tight. Right. Thank you. Okay. Take care, Monday. Yeah, thanks.\tSo given the new rolling, Ray and I can both lose our jobs, even if we so much just go to the movies together. Hmm. Interesting. I ask you about a great looking guy and all you can do is quote the departmental rule book and you never not say you\u2019re not in. Why are we still talking about this? Because you\u2019ve been defensive ever since I brought him up.\tLook, even if I was interested, he just got off of a really bad divorce and my last relationship pretty much ended like the Hindenburg. So neither one of us is ready to jump into that pool anytime soon. Are you sure he feels that way? Look, it\u2019s bad idea no matter how you slice it. When I was with Eric, I was practically stalked by his jealous ex-wife.\tUgh. I hated her. And then did I mention race divorce? Well, he divorced his wife because she was growing her ex-husband. Oh, and did I mention that his ex-wife was Nicole and the ex-husband that she was screwing was Eric, my ex. So I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t think that both of us being unemployed or having a mutual hatred for Nicole Walker is a good basis for a romantic relationship.\tSo, so can we just drop this and just go get some damn dinner?\tSo this geyser you\u2019re talking about has been building up for a while. That\u2019s right. Mm-hmm. And yet, just the other day, you were saying how Gabby was the only woman for you. Oh, sorry. District attorney Trask. Maybe that was indiscreet. And I know how you treasure discretion, Ms. Hernandez, or whatever your name is.\tNow, you know, Nicole, you\u2019re right. Being confused like this. I, I did say those things about Gabby, but, well, it\u2019s just now occurring to me that, uh, I was feeling reminiscent for feelings that Gabby and I once had for each other once upon a time. Sadly, or I don\u2019t know, maybe. Luckily that image was shattered last night.\tSee, shortly after you left, Gabby got cold feet. She was afraid we were gonna get caught, and\tturns out she values those damn shares more than she does me.\tSo the scales fell off your eyes and you realized you\u2019d be happier with a. Old fashioned girl like Melinda here, DIR like, actually I see our relationship is anything but dir. Stefan, did I tell you I had a dream about you last night?\tYou know, it just occurred to me that I promised Melinda I would show her. Stamp collection in my room right next to your etchings. So if you\u2019ll excuse us, I cannot wait to show you my inverted dunman. Ooh. And it is inverted. Let me tell you.\tMaybe she could lick it.\tWhat? Gabby lied to me, practically daring me to contradict her, and of course I couldn\u2019t without telling her that you. Your brother played you and now he\u2019s playing me. You made me look like an idiot and I don\u2019t like it. Ej not one damn bit. Take a breath. Take a breath. Look, we both know those two are going to find a way to hook up and we\u2019ll catch them.\tI promise you. We just need to be more clever about all this. What you need to do is go. Why did I ever get involved with you in the first place? I, I don\u2019t want to humiliate Gabby and torpedo the deal. I want her, you don\u2019t have Exxons in hell. Of getting her back. You remember your wedding where she found out that you not only didn\u2019t tell her about the love of her life and that he was alive, that you actually tried to brainwash him into hating her, and there was something else as well.\tUm, what was it? Oh, that\u2019s right. You tried to kill him. I don\u2019t think couples therapy is going to help her. Damir shares are the only thing that you could possibly salvage from that train wreck you call a marriage. You are wrong. I don\u2019t give a damn about those shares, but that\u2019s all you care about. So you stay the hell away from my marriage.\tYou make one move, I swear you\u2019re gonna regret it.\tWell, this is nice. Now I have a chance to trample over your personal boundaries and tell you how to live your life.\tOops. Sorry. Doesn\u2019t look like you have time. Commissioner Hernandez over here. Don\u2019t do this. Hey, well this is nice. You should join. Yeah, I was actually just picking up it to go. Yeah. Told you the commissioner probably has plans for tonight. He has to eat dinner somewhere. Right. Go get your food and eat with us.\tWell, um, so, um, Jada was just telling me about those anti delian fraternization rules. Wow. That was a mouthful. But there are three of us. And come on, what could possibly happen with her sister watching this is the shy sister. Right. Well, thanks for the invite. I\u2019ll be right back. I\u2019m going to kill you. He seems like a Sagittarius.\tWhatever you do, just don\u2019t be too pushy. They hate that.\tI hope you\u2019ll think about what I said, and I don\u2019t think you heard a word that I said because, and I say this with a love and affection. You were wrong. Meaning I didn\u2019t agree with you. Meaning you are making a huge mistake. I remember when I met Chanel\u2019s father, oh. I was immediately smitten. Oh, wow. But he was dating someone else and I, I almost walked away.\t", "Not only did I look like a fool last night, but Stefan and Gabby now know that I\u2019m onto them. She said that No, she\u2019s sticking to the script. She said she saw through Nicole and that the Dememer shares mean more to her than Stefan does. She said all that with a straight face. Thanks to you, Mr. Damara. I can\u2019t help but think that Stephanie and Gabby now have the upper hand.\tNo, I don\u2019t know about that. I mean, just how long can they keep up the Shirad?\tSo is there anything more wonderful than love\u2019s first bloom?\tSo me, uh, when did you two first, you know, Connect home. Say it\u2019s been building for quite some time. Brewing like a percolator. Like a geyser ready to blow. How vivid. So anyway, last night fit blue, right? Maybe I\u2019ll face here in a cold, but. You don\u2019t seem very happy for us.\tSo value was right. It was just a panic attack. So far it looks that way. Uh, but Dr. Greenberg\u2019s still gonna gonna look at these results himself and make his own determination. Uh, but if it was a panic attack, we can give you the names of people who.\tSo I heard you\u2019re sleeping in my daughter\u2019s bed. Yeah, I have, uh, Chanel\u2019s old room at the apartment. Wish she was still there. Uh, I don\u2019t think she does. I have a lot of bad memories there for her. Hmm. Probably, right? I was just thinking, um, maybe you can do something else from me when you\u2019re finished with that report.\tUh, and what would.\tI know you know that Allie, Brooke Chanel\u2019s heart, I mean last year was tough enough on her with that horrible Peterson woman attacking us, and now she\u2019s worried about me, my health. You want me to call her and let her know that your e kg looked good? Actually, I want you to ask her on the date. Uh, the other thing about the thing about it now, yo, you too, you had sparks and they were real, remember?\tYes. And I also remember that you kind of put the kibosh on the whole thing really? Well, that just doesn\u2019t sound like me. Well, anyway, you\u2019re still attracted to her, right? Well, and so, you know, so my question is, well, are you keeping your distance from her because of Allie? That\u2019s part of it. Yes. And uh, and I do like Chanel as a friend.\tWell, maybe it could lead to something more than friendship. Something a lot more fun than friendship. Unless, is there someone else, you know, I\u2019m gonna get these results to Dr. Greenberg and you can call us office some morning. Okay. Who is it? I, I, I heard you. I just chose not to answer. I\u2019ll hound you till you tell me.\tYou know, I will.\tThis is my roommate, Wendy, but she\u2019s seen Giant, the mirror. So you just gonna step back, seed her to him? Oh no, you\u2019ve gotta fight back. But I don\u2019t think you understand. She seems to really like him. Maybe she likes you more. Oh, doctor, remember faith hearts nail one fairy lady, I\u2019m telling you. Tell her how you feel, or you may end up regretting that you didn\u2019t for a very long time.\tOkay. Trip. So what\u2019s the story? Yeah, the story is that he\u2019s sharing the rent on this place. Okay. That may be how the story started. No. How this chapter in this story started, but I saw you two in Hong Kong. He and Joey were like two stallions Pauling at the ground. Oh. So I was the prize mayor. How flattering.\tAnd he never got over you. Yeah, you have a very vivid imagination. If you\u2019re obtuse, good God. He\u2019s a doctor. He doesn\u2019t need roommates. He wanted to live here. He wanted to live with you. And I\u2019ve seen the way you two are finishing each other\u2019s sentences. It\u2019s pretty obvious. You wanna Okay. You love living it with him.\tWe\u2019re friends. Yeah. Well, I, I\u2019ve seen the way he looks at you. I think just friends. It\u2019s not his choice. Okay. Hong Kong, he and Joey were two stallions pawing the ground. That was classic male sibling rivalry. And you know, I played the game because I like the attention. Flirting. Then yeah, trip and I still play the same game, but still it\u2019s holiday.\tIt\u2019s, it\u2019s not real. It\u2019s, it\u2019s just a cane. Not from where I\u2019m sitting.\tOkay. Um, well then let\u2019s rewind, shall we? Uh, I am not seeing Jada. Is that clear enough? It is, it is. It is. Look, I, I\u2019m sorry to push you like this, but it is my job and I understand it. I. Well, since we\u2019re talking, there is something about the new policy that does bother me and that\u2019s, um, well, hope and I, we were both involved while we were on the force.\tAt first when things started, she was my boss, and then later on I was hers. Um, but, uh, no one in the department, even though they knew about what was happening, ever said a word. Well, when the two of you were seeing each other, you were. You are equals, and that\u2019s the difference. Look, great. I changed the rule for you, especially now with how things turned out with Nicole, but\t", "First thing in the morning, we\u2019re gonna go.\tI haven\u2019t seen you all day. Hmm. How did it go with the Salem in last night went great till we locked in\tfinally. Sorry. I did locked in meetings all day. You my priority. Lucky. So what happened when you caught Gabby and Stefan and bear together? Did you take Becky to mirror shares and kick Gabby to the curb? No, I didn\u2019t. And why not leave? Not only did she break the terms of your agreement, but she betrayed you.\tI mean, she slept with another man, was s step, except she didn\u2019t sleep with them.\tHi. Hi. Oh my gosh. You\u2019re back from work. I completely lost track of time.\tAre you okay? I\u2019m fine. Just working on my new collection for Saxons, right? Temp. You talk to anyone? Okay. What\u2019s up? Why? Why are you asking me if I\u2019m fine? Why? Why are you asking me if I\u2019ve talked to. Then you don\u2019t know. Don\u2019t know what it\u2019s about. Stephan. Stephan is something wrong. Paul kind of. He\u2019s sleeping with the district attorney.\tCome on in. Ah, DH ra. How can I help you? Well, the last time we talked, I told you that if you didn\u2019t hand me an airtight case against Sloan Peterson, my office would have to drop the whole thing. Yeah. Since then, radio silence. So either you are still lining up your evidence or you don\u2019t have the faintest idea who broke into Paulina Price\u2019s office.\tWhich is it?\tOh, hey. Hey. What\u2019s up? Well, I was wondering where you were. I\u2019m still at the office. I\u2019m still trying to clean up the mess the sled and made when she trashed the place.\tUm, I\u2019m gonna be stuck here for, for a while. Sorry.\tLike sand through the hourglass, so are the days of our lives.\tWe had to cut Peterson loose after she denied everything, so calling her in here was a Hail Mary. But you hope she\u2019d break down sobbing and admit to everything? Well, actually calling her in is standard operating procedure. In a case like this, you mean a case where you don\u2019t have a shred of evidence? If there\u2019s evidence out there, we\u2019ll find it.\tWell shred lightly because if Counselor Peterson decides to sue us for harassment and she is a litigious kind of gal, This one\u2019s on you. We never met.\tAlways a pleasure, man. Da.\tStephan is sleeping with D Trask. Where did you hear that from? I\u2019m so sorry. This must suck for you. I just, I saw an item about it and lady whistleblowers column, and they spectator, come on. You don\u2019t really believe anything you\u2019re reading in that rag, do you? I mean, the very idea is preposterous. Why are you looking at me that way?\tI guess I just, I thought you\u2019d be more upset. I mean, how can you be so sure that it\u2019s not true?\tSorry, just had to send that. Um, No problem. So you were saying Lee walked in, stormed in. It\u2019s more like it. Ever since he left us at the end, I was worried about it happening and EJ assured me that he would have his best people on Lee\u2019s people and he would be kept off the scent. This, this is awful. How did Lee even figure it out?\tLook at ejs gonna be furious. He\u2019s gonna be furious. So how ugly did it get? It didn\u2019t get physical, did it? Wow. Not to mention Gabby\u2019s shares. She\u2019s not gonna get any now. She must be a wreck. No, no. Gabby and Lee\u2019s deal is still on. Really? Hmm. Even though he found you in bed with her, Lee found me in bed.\tOoh. Somebody else,\tI, I don\u2019t understand. You did go to the Salem in last night, didn\u2019t you? I followed the plan Exactly. I burst in and caught step infl grande. Wait, I thought you said that didn\u2019t sleep together. I did. Gabby wasn\u2019t there. You just said you caught in Infl Grande. What a solo act. No, he wasn\u2019t alone. He was in bed with Melinda Trask.\tMelinda Trask, the da. The iron fist in the iron glove, the same. You\u2019re joking. Oh, believe me, this is not a joke. This. This doesn\u2019t make any sense. When Nicole left the room, Gabby was in there with Stephan and you were on your way with the key card that you so thoughtfully provided me because you were helping me, right?\tOf course I was. Nicole and I both were. While either your friend Nicole\u2019s lying or somebody pulled a fast one on you, a somebody called Stephan.\tI, I\u2019m sorry. S Stephan, I, you\u2019re gonna have to start over. Lee found you in bed with someone other than Gabby. That\u2019s right. But who\tyou\u2019re here after last night? Wild Horse couldn\u2019t stop me.\tSo if you really think that Stephan and the DA have a thing, if you really think you turned to her after me, Paul, I mean, he can\u2019t be with you because of the deal you made with my brother and. You have to admit she\u2019s beautiful. Okay, Wendy, let\u2019s get real here for a minute. Leo. Stark lies for a living.\tStephan, Mr. Damara, they pay off das. They don\u2019t sleep with them. All right, so let\u2019s change the subject. Let\u2019s talk about your love life. Yeah. I don\u2019t think Johnny and I have much of a love life. It\u2019s more like a hangout and watch movies life. Yeah, I wasn\u2019t talking about Johnny. I was talking about Tripp.\t", "I decided, well, you can\u2019t win the game if you don\u2019t get on the field. So I made my move, Paulina, no. Shrinking by like you took action. It\u2019s a damn good thing I did. I made that man very happy in our time together and Chanel\u2019s here because as usual, well actually as always, I knew what was best for everyone.\tSo ignore my advice at your own peril.\tNow, can I ask you a question? Mm-hmm. Do you ever take any advice, advice from someone who not only cares about you, but actually has some experience in the matter at hand? Mm. I walked right in on that one, didn\u2019t I? Oh, tell a what\u2019s going on. And I understand you don\u2019t want him to worry, but he not only loves you, he, he knows you.\tI know you\u2019re keeping something. And he\u2019ll probably imagine something much worse. Someone\u2019s actually happening. And if this is anxiety related, then keeping a secret is very, very stressful. And think about it, you know, how would you feel if a was keeping someone like this from you? And another thing like, hell no, no, I, I don\u2019t need another thing.\tOh, it\u2019s. It\u2019s irritating to get a lecture from a 12 year old, but it\u2019s infuriating if he\u2019s right. Well, I wasn\u2019t lecturing, I was just, you know, thinking out loud. Why can\u2019t I get dressed and go while you have some more thinking out loud to do? No, you are free to get dressed and go. You\u2019re a good doctor and you are a good friend.\tYou know, I still don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so interested in me and Tripp, unless this was a diversionary tactic. So we\u2019d stop talking about Stephen. There\u2019s nothing to say about Stephan.\tSorry, I gotta deal with this. Hey honey, come home. You\u2019re here too because I, uh, live here and we\u2019re just one big happy family, right Gabby? Hi Lee. I gotta go delay. I was hoping for a cozy night at home. I just got a text from David Stack and he wants to talk about the launch at this hour. Hmm. That sound very considerate.\tWould you like me to go with you? It\u2019s the bistro, right? Yeah, but stay I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll handle it, but I\u2019m the one who set up the deal. Yeah. And I appreciate it, but sometimes, uh, one-on-one is better.\tWell, I was uh, gonna order in. So what do you feel like on a one-on-one? Huh? Sorry. Um, I just remembered there\u2019s something I gotta do. Don\u2019t wait up.\tOh, you better get yourself a drink cuz you\u2019re not gonna believe when I\u2019m about to tell you that. Lee called Stephan and the district attorney in bed together last night. Trust me, I\u2019ve. But there\u2019s more. Ugh. What I don\u2019t understand is how in the hell he talked, trust pretending to be his lover. Are you sure they\u2019re pretending?\tWhat? Well, about a half hour ago, Melinda just paid a little visit and then they sat on the couch pretending to be a couple of foreign teenagers, and then pretended to get carried away and went upstairs to his room where? Right about now they\u2019re pretending away.\tWell, that was fun. But I still don\u2019t get it. Uh, EJ is gonna tell Nicole about last night. I don\u2019t get why we had to do encore performance for her benefit. Okay. You\u2019re right. That was a little more of a prologue, but you know how much I appreciate your help and I will never forget what you\u2019ve done. Okay.\tCut to the chase. What do you want now? I did not ask you here to stick it to Nicole. Melinda actually needs you to be my decoy.\tWell, would you look at that? You guys ordered the same thing. Wow. Great ones. Think I like. Yes, Talia. It is just momentous that RA and I both like hamburgers. God, maybe we both like water, right? Oh my God. I just realized I have to call an old colleague tonight. She\u2019s on the East coast and I wanna catch her before she goes to bed.\tI\u2019m gonna take this with me. Enjoy your burgers.\tFinally, it must be famished. Uh, yeah. It was covered for Dr. Greenberg. Right. Well, there\u2019s still some chili in the fridge. You can nuke it. Are you leaving? Yeah. Johnny said something about hanging out with friends in the square. A date? No, I just thought I could catch up with him. Hang out. Okay. Well have fun.\tAlright. Enjoy the chili. Hey Wendy. Wait. Uh oh. Is something wrong? Yeah. Uh, no. Um, well, Won\u2019t be if I just say this, cuz if I don\u2019t say this now, I might not ever will say what I, uh, have feelings for you.\tOh, hey. Oh. Mm-hmm. I stopped by the office earlier, but I, I guess I just missed you. Oh, well. I wasn\u2019t there. I lied to you before. Okay. I wasn\u2019t at the office. I was in the hospital.\tOh, Stephan.

May I infer from that, that, uh, she declined to represent you? Infer away, God, I mean, your own sister bailing on you. You must just feel pretty desperate. Did you come down here to gloat?\tSee, it must seem like only a world class lawyer could get you out of this. The thing is, is. I happen to know where you can find one. Yeah, the internet, the world class lawyer.com. I like it when a man cracks jokes as he\u2019s drowning,\ttidying up. How domestic of you? I\u2019m always tidy with evidence of a crime, especially when I\u2019m in on it. You are not in on a crime. Stefan was trying to drug me. All we did was turn the tables on. And what did that Astra ever do to you? Uh, it\u2019s a house plant in the Dira living room. Okay. It\u2019s been doused with poisons and mine alling drugs since it was a seedling.\tAnd it\u2019s not an Astra. Well, I like saying Astra. Mm-hmm. , you know, I\u2019ve been thinking about that unexpected call from Gabby. I\u2019ve decided it is a stroke of good fortune. So we are drugging Stefan to make him seem unfit to serve as Damira, C E o. So Gaby is actually the perfect witness to his first little episode.\tYeah, I mean, he really was excited to see her with a kid on his first date, but, If that drug works the way we think it will, it might spoil the mood. Oh, come on. Catastrophic first dates a romantic staple, down the road. Both of those kids will look back on this and laugh.\tare you sure you\u2019re okay? Fine. I\u2019m just a little dizzy. You have that effect on me.\tGabby\u2019s not at Ari\u2019s school. She lied to me. My wife lied to me.\tLike sand through the hourglass, so are the days of our lives.\tOf course. I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re free. I just hope you don\u2019t end up in prison for kidnapping. I\u2019m pretty sure Bell\u2019s gonna be able to get the charges dropped. Oh yeah, sure. Without a doubt. I mean, no big deal. Right. Just kidnapping someone and subjecting them to a Force D programming powered by small kitchen appliances.\tOkay. Under the direction of a mad scientist slash escaped convict. I know, I know. . Right. You know, it\u2019s not a big deal. It\u2019s practically a prank. Uh, did I mention that this was all against Stephan\u2019s? Will, I really tried to get him to go along with it, Chloe, and what part of No. Did you not understand? So you\u2019re not happy with the way I went about things, huh?\tNo, I don\u2019t think that happy would be a term I\u2019d use right now. Okay. Well, let me tell you something right off the bat here. I would\u2019ve. What I did and a lot worse to make sure that you and I found our way back to one another at the end of the day. Stefan is glad I did it. Gabby is glad. I\u2019m glad. How about you?\tWell, in your defense, you were just trying to undo what Kristen and Lee did. They\u2019re the ones who played God with four people\u2019s lives. Mm. Those four people\u2019s lives are back where they started and they are happy about that. Yeah, we are back to where we started. Rachel still hates me. This is not exactly a happily ever after moment, but no, it\u2019s different.\tIt\u2019s different now. Kristen is not around to manipulate the situation anymore. She\u2019s not gonna be whispering. Lies into my daughter\u2019s fear about. It is all new. It\u2019s a new start. And where do I start? What do I buy, Rachel? A pony. Well, you don\u2019t, don\u2019t do that. We can just take it slow. My father is bringing Rachel here for lunch, and I would love, I would love if you would join us, please.\tWhy would you wanna represent. Remember telling me to go to hell. Mm-hmm. , of course I do. And I remember why you could have lost me my license trying to spring ro from custody, but Ralph and Lee are free now. Alls while it ends well, well it only ended well because I\u2019m such a damn good lawyer. I freed Lee and I can do the same for you if you\u2019d let me.\tIf I had a white flag, I\u2019d be waving it. Jing one. I\u2019m sorry. I I I thought you had left. I, oh, so you just wanted to trash my apartment? Not causing me bodily harm. Are you hurt? Tell me you\u2019re not hurt. No, I\u2019m fine. See, I\u2019m worried about whatever happened to my brother with ice water in his veins. Gabby, I found out she lied.\tHey, what did she lie about? She said she couldn\u2019t spend the day with me because she had a mix up at Ariana\u2019s school, and so I called the school and found out Gabby had made it all up, which I suspected. In fact, I knew she did, so I tracked her phone. You. No wonder she lies to you. You\u2019re stalking her.\t", "I really, really wish she was here. You know, she, um, she wasn\u2019t technically my mom, but. She loved me like she was, but she was Grandma. She\u2019s not. I never loved her, and I want her gone.\tThank you for agreeing to the hearing, Ms. Tr.\tMr. Shin, what can I do you for the contract you drew up for me and Gabby? Yes. I\u2019m having some second thoughts about it and I\u2019d like to ask you a few questions.\tHey, you busy, uh, just installing some new software? Hmm. How you doing here? Well, I was going to see if you wanted to go grab some lunch with me if you don\u2019t already have plans with your new roommate trips at work. Hmm. And uh, I was running a little late this morning. I just got here a little while ago, so I think I should maybe try to clock in more than 20 minutes before I head out.\tOh. You know, I actually have an in with your boss, so I think it\u2019d be okay. My dad really likes you, by the way. Oh, yeah. Mm. . Well, I would like it to stay that way, so I\u2019m hoping you kept my name out of it. When you asked him about the vial you found and, uh, we were both thinking you might have been using, he has no idea you knew anything.\tI promise you haven\u2019t, uh, seen anything else suspicious around here, have you? No. But if that file wasn\u2019t your dad\u2019s, I think we should probably try to figure out who it did belong. Yeah. Yeah. Right. You know, don\u2019t you? Well, and you\u2019re not gonna tell me I promised my dad that I wouldn\u2019t. Okay. Why would he care?\tUnless he shares this office with your uncle. Oh my God. It\u2019s Steffens, isn\u2019t it? Well, uj, you were very convincing. When you said, I will do anything to help my brother with his drug problem,\tI know it\u2019s scary. What a gifted liar you are. Hmm. I mean, so much coming from you.\tYou can say that again,\tbut don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a risk? And Johnny is really fond of his Uncle Stephan, right? Enough to keep an eye on him, help him with the result being he\u2019ll see Stephan sad decline step by step and back me up when I make the case to throw the BA out of the mirror. The bastard sad climb that you orchestrated.\tWell, you don\u2019t want to be of anything up to Charles, do you?\tLook Gabby, of course, I want you to leave Lee so that we can be together, but we need to think through this. Obviously I won\u2019t you as my c E O. What about ej? Screw that guy. He knew what Lee was doing to me and he covered for him. But here\u2019s the thing, getting EJ out of Damara, that\u2019s one thing. Getting you installed in his seat, that\u2019s, that\u2019s another, and that requires board approval.\tAnd if you leave Lee, he retains his vote and he would use his vote against me. Yeah. So that, that leaves EJ with his seven votes to our, let\u2019s, excuse me, Jake, Kristen, Peter, Jake, Steven, you said Jake. Right. Uh, I\u2019m sorry. How many, how many does that goes with? It\u2019s five. Hey, are are you sure you\u2019re okay? No, no, I\u2019m fine.\tI\u2019m just feeling a little fuzzy. Thank you, wolf. The bottom line is we don\u2019t have enough votes without le leases. Yeah. Even if I give Lee\u2019s shares back, we have a tie. And the tie reverts the status quo. Unless, unless what? Unless. EJ becomes tragically incapacitated.\tDid I hear you right? You wanna cancel the conflict with Gabby back out of the deal? That\u2019s what I said. Why the hell would you do that? You\u2019ve got her right where you want her. She has to live with you for six months. If she moves out, she loses her shares. If she cheats on you, she loses her shares. If she even Jay walks, she\u2019s losing her shares.\tHold on, please repeat that. Oh, come on. You got the gist of it. You\u2019re in the catbird seat here, Lee. No, repeat what you said about her cheating. Well, the contract doesn\u2019t state it explicitly, but it\u2019s clearly implied under clause 2.6 in marital duties. Oh my. You\u2019re a genius. Thank you so much. I have to go.\tUh, please forget that I ever called.\tCome on, dad. Is there any possibility that you could take her home? You don\u2019t wanna go home? I\u2019m, I\u2019m sorry, Kate. You know, I would if I could, but I\u2019m meeting with Steve and it\u2019s pretty important. I\u2019m sorry. Be Richie. Try to think about what Papa just said. Okay, honey,\tyou just tried to get rid of me. No, don\u2019t. No. Sweet. I just thought it would be best if I talked to you separately and maybe to Chloe separately, but I would love if we could just have lunch. You know, why don\u2019t we all go to lunch and we\u2019ll talk my lunch? You invited her to my lunch with you. Okay. I\u2019m just gonna go, no, Chloe, please don\u2019t.\t", "She\u2019s my wife and right now she\u2019s in the park and I know exactly who she\u2019s with. You sure you\u2019re okay? Yeah. Yeah. I\u2019m fine. I am. I am very happy to be here with you and happy that we are finally back together. Yeah, it\u2019s great. You don\u2019t sound like you think it\u2019s great. No, I mean, we\u2019re, we\u2019re together. We\u2019re here sitting at the park together, but we\u2019re not together.\tNot the way we should be. Okay. Not to spoil the moment here, but whose fault is that, Lee? Everything is Lee\u2019s fault. Not to spoil alone again, but Lee did not hitch over the head with his club take you back to his cave for six months. Luke chose to stay married to him to live with him.\tYou don\u2019t love what? No, of course I don\u2019t love him. How could I love somebody that\u2019s said horrible things to you? To us? Okay then why\u2019d you agree to his? Because he made me an offer I can refuse.\tWell, whatever drug Stefan was going to give you doesn\u2019t affect house plants. At least not immediately anyway, but it will work on him. Stefan wasn\u2019t about to dose me with something that wasn\u2019t going to. Which is something of a problem. How so? Well, as we discussed before, Stefan knows all about this drug and its effects, meaning he might start to get suspicious when he\u2019s experiencing them.\tMaybe he\u2019ll think it\u2019s Gabby\u2019s perfume. I know. It gives me a headache. Oh, the lingering effects of Dr. Roll\u2019s treatment.\tEj, you don\u2019t think the drug. I don\u2019t know too permanent damage. Steve, you? No, I don\u2019t think he would risk that with me anymore than I would risk it with him. I\u2019m just going to screw with his head until he makes enough mistakes to justify Stephan being booted it out there. Did I just hear you say you\u2019re planning to boot Uncle Stephan from the company?\tBrady, my joining you and Rachel for lunch today. I\u2019m not sure. That\u2019s a good idea. Fuck on it. It is a good idea. She just, Rachel just lost her mom. She, she lost her grandmother. I think it would be nice for, to have a, a woman to talk to, you know, to turn.\tHey. Hi sweetie. I missed you last night. I missed you too, daddy. Hi Rachel. My daddy was at jail last night. It\u2019s all your fault.\tSo you\u2019re offering to be my lawyer? Yeah. Don\u2019t thank me or anything. No, I\u2019m just trying to figure out why . I take it, you haven\u2019t seen Lady Whistleblower\u2019s latest column in The Spectator? No, my subscription, it ran out. So who is this lady? Whoever you said, it\u2019s Leo Stark\u2019s gossip column. Check it out.\tAccording to my sources, the savvy Solicitor says she\u2019s enjoying the best sex of her life. With a Defrock priest. What? Geez. I mean, I\u2019m flattered, but Yeah. Well, she wasn\u2019t that far off the mark. And yes, Eric, I am still furious with you, but maybe I admit I was a little hasty when I ended things so fast since I find myself missing all the fun we had together.\tAnd I\u2019m not talking about the good clean time either. Oh, come on Eric. I know you miss a deal, and if you do, I think we can work out a deal.\tI\u2019m not sure what you think. You heard, John, I think I heard you say that you wanted Stephan to make enough mistakes for you to be able to push him out of Dera. Is that what I heard him say? Well, the fact is your Uncle Stephan has made a. A serious one. Remember that vial of drugs you found at the Yahu and you thought was mine?\tYeah. It wasn\u2019t. It was your Uncle Stephans.\tSo Lee gave you his Demari shares in exchange for six more months of marriage. That\u2019s right. And you agreed I did. Uh, so it\u2019s more like a, uh, limited partnership than, right. You negotiated the terms. So it\u2019s, it\u2019s kinda like a holding company, right? With a clear designation of duties and, uh, revenues. So really, it, it\u2019s more like a, a, ah, what is it, short term merger than a marriage.\tYou wanna know if we\u2019re having sex? Yeah. I wanna know if you\u2019re having. No, it\u2019s off the table. Not happening, wasn\u2019t negotiated. Uh, Lee says he is doing this to show me how much he loves me, that he\u2019s committed to me, and that really puts me in the driver\u2019s seat. He can\u2019t do anything to upset me at all.\tRight. And I, I did this because I was feeling rejected by you. I really thought that you weren\u2019t ever gonna be over. Chloe and Lee pointed out accurately that he could hold up this divorce for longer than six months, and I wouldn\u2019t have the shares So, It, there just didn\u2019t seem to be a downside at the time, but now there is.\tAnd that is, are you kidding me too? I, I wanna be with you, so obviously I\u2019m gonna tell Lee that he, he can take his six months and his shares and shove where the sun don\u2019t shine.\tOkay. So you beg for like six. To prove your love and devotion. And then on day two or something, you start stalking her. I can\u2019t lose her. No, you don\u2019t have her. You don\u2019t own her. I don\u2019t want to own her. I want to be her husband.\t", "I\u2019m not going anywhere. She\u2019s going.\tIt\u2019s done. That\u2019s the fastest bill hearing in history. I work so magic. Wait here for the guard and you should be a free man and a Jiff. See you later. We\u2019ll talk about my retainer.\tPlease don\u2019t say anything to my dad. Of course I won\u2019t, especially since I\u2019m not even certain. I believe it. What do you. Okay. Your uncle was presumed dead for four years. Brainwashed the works. He finally gets what he wants. He\u2019s c e o of the company, totally on top of his game at work. He\u2019s not the one who\u2019s screwing things up around here.\tAnd what are you trying to say? Are you sure your dad was telling you the. That he\u2019s not the one who\u2019s using.\tI\u2019m a little nervous about what I\u2019m gonna find at the office today. Brady doesn\u2019t seem too focused. Uh, I would think given his business expertise, the office would\u2019ve benefited from his incarceration. Well, I guess we\u2019ll see.\tAre you okay? I am. Ooh, I, I, I, I dunno. Hey, what\u2019s, what\u2019s going on? Good. You bought it. Oh. Stephanie needs to think that he is successfully in drugging you, so I need to behave accordingly. It is going to be a fun afternoon at the office.\tSo I\u2019ve been drugging him, ej, that\u2019s why he is been acting so weird. That\u2019s how he tanked the stock price with his loose lips. Oh, any more incidents like that. And the board will remove him for. Oh, well, couldn\u2019t have happened to a nicer five and that I lose his voting power unless, unless he assigns someone else\u2019s Kate\u2019s proxy.\tOr pull some other stunt. All right. E. E. Either way, if we don\u2019t get this done, it\u2019ll be next to impossible to install you in his seat or even remove him from Dera permanently. Please. What are you saying? I\u2019m saying that Lee\u2019s shares are our insurance policy. That\u2019s why you need to hold onto. And that\u2019s why you need to stay married to Lee,\tEric. Hey, what I just read that you and Brady were in jail. Uh, yeah, my attorney just got me out on bail. Oh, well good for bell bell\u2019s. Not my attorney slowness.\tWhy would you even say that to me? I mean, it\u2019s not like my Uncle Stephan hasn\u2019t been acting a little weird lately. Okay. Okay. Yes. His personal life is a mess because he was brainwashed. His work product has been amazing. If you were using people would. And your dad. On the other hand, I hate to say this, but people are starting to talk, so what you\u2019re telling me is that my dad lied to me.\tNo, no he didn\u2019t. I\u2019m sure of it. Okay. He was genuinely worried about Stephan. I could tell. Okay. I\u2019m sorry. I said anything didn\u2019t mean to upset you.\tLook, trust me. Okay. My dad is totally back to his normal self. I even overheard. Talking about having stepped and removed from his job. Now if, if he, if he was gonna do that, he, he obviously believes that he, you know what? I shouldn\u2019t have said that. Um, I\u2019m sure my dad probably doesn\u2019t want that getting around.\tWhy not? If your uncle has a drug problem, then we\u2019re removing him. Should be pretty straightforward. Of course, the first thing we should be doing is getting him help. Yeah, that\u2019s what my dad said. My dad said that he wants. Stephan . You know what he said? He, he said he wanted to help Stephan while he was standing in the room with my no-nos portrait.\tMy no-no is a Nobel Prize winner for lying. What if my dad\u2019s trying to groom me as his star witness against Stephan? I mean, what if my dad is the one drugging Steph?\tYou can understand, can\u2019t you? This wasn\u2019t exactly the response I thought you were gonna have when I told you I\u2019m leaving my husband for, you thought you were gonna sweep me off my feet into a passionate kiss, but instead you came up with a brand new business model. I\u2019ve let you down, haven\u2019t I? No, actually I find it kind of exciting.\tYeah, we can hear it all. You and I, what\u2019s six months between captains of the universe? You do know I love you. Right, right back at you.\tIt\u2019s okay, Brady. I\u2019m gonna go No, no. Hey, please, please, please don\u2019t go. Don\u2019t. I don\u2019t want her to think that she can get away acting like this. She has been through too much, way too much lately. It\u2019s important that she feels and that she knows that she comes first. You work all that she has, right?\tUh, Sloane is your lawyer, Sloane Peterson. Do you know of any other Sloan? Well, you told me you two broke up and that she was furious with you. She was. Okay. Then why did she take your case? We made up. What is that? So close to me exactly what it sounds like. Why would I give up the best sex of my life and why would he write, sweetheart?\tUm, what are you doing here and what are you two co-conspirators up to this time?\tYou convinced, I love you now and I love you. God, I missed you so much and I you, I\u2019m so sorry for how I treated you. No, don\u2019t apologize. It\u2019s not your fault. What matters is that we\u2019re together now.

I swear it is.\tI believe you. Thank you. No, don\u2019t thank me yet, Lee, you forced me into the position of having to quote Occidental. If you left something, set it free, okay?

No, she was on her tablet. I thought she was playing cookie cutter. The paper also said weird things about Uncle Eric. Babe Fa baby. Listen that paper. Is, is, is, is a very nasty newspaper, okay? All they do is they print lies and the only reason they do that is so they can sell more papers.\tThen were you in jail or not? Did you kidnap Uncle Stephan because of her? Was the paper lying about that?\tI appreci. Your offer for professional services. And I admit I could use good attorney right now, but honestly I don\u2019t have a job. So I don\u2019t think I can afford you.\tMaybe I could, um, take it out and trade.\tSo you\u2019re saying the vial was Uncle Steffens that. And I took it to the lab and had it analyzed. Apparently it\u2019s some sort of synthetic recreational drop and you\u2019re sure you\u2019re sure that it\u2019s Steffens. His fingerprints were on it and it was found in an office that we shared, and I know it\u2019s not mine.\tLook, son, I\u2019m. I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019m really afraid that Stefan\u2019s on drugs and it\u2019s not surprising, considering everything he\u2019s been through, and I know this is going to sound harsh and though I will do anything I can to help. My first duty is to make sure he doesn\u2019t do any damage to the company my father\u2019s legacy.\tJohnny, I\u2019m asking you to keep what I\u2019ve told you to. I do have to investigate what Stefan\u2019s been doing and has done, but there is a part of me that\u2019s opened beyond hope that I\u2019m wrong, son, I\u2019m asking you to trust. Okay?

Do you really want a wife who\u2019s in love with another man?\tDid you hear what I just said? I told you I\u2019m leaving Lee to be with you. Yeah, I did. Well, I thought that you\u2019d be a little happy and made me even smile. No, Gabby, look, I Of course. I want you to leave Lee. I want us to be together. I\u2019m also convinced that all of this will soon.\tUh, look, we belong together, right? But we\u2019re not these star crossed. Do we hide lovers? We belong together because we get each other. We know what we want, and we want it on our terms. What terms are those? You and I running Dara together To that end. I was scared to even ask. I think you need to stay with Lee.\tYou got my mommy said to y\u2019all and not my daddy. Hey Rachel, Rachel. Enough. It, it was not Chloe\u2019s fault at all.

Now look, we know that you\u2019re dealing with a lot right now and your daddy and I are trying to do everything we can to help you by letting you walk around saying things that aren\u2019t true is bad for you, and we\u2019re not gonna let that happen.\tNo. I know it\u2019s very, very hard when a kid loses their mother.

And you know, who else knows that\tyour daddy here.\tCome with Poppy for a second. I want to tell you a story about your daddy. Just sit right up here. Here we go.\tNo, your daddy was just a little bit older than you. He and Grandma Marna, they didn\u2019t get along very well. Ah, correction. I didn\u2019t get along very well with grandma. That that was, that was all on me. I, that, that, that, that, that\u2019s immaterial here. Here. The fact is you were having a very rough time and Rich, you know who understood that?\tDo you know who was eventually able to get your daddy to see? She wasn\u2019t there to try to replace his mommy or anybody else. All she wanted to do was love him. You know who that was? That was your grandma. That was Grandma Marlena. Because grandma always knew that people\u2019s feelings could be so strong. He could hurt so much that sometimes they would think things that aren\u2019t true.\tOh God.

And I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s not what happened. No. Reality did set in, it just settled in for me, not him. And he told you what? That he didn\u2019t want to be with you?

Come on, honorable my ass. I am the best thing that has ever happened to that man and he will never know God. Who do you have to shout to get another refill around here?\tHello? Oh, hey, hey, hey.

And yes, I did ruin things with the best woman I\u2019ve ever met in my life, but that\u2019s not the reason why I\u2019m here tonight.\tMm-hmm. and Royal, you. I am here tonight because of Sarah Horton\u2019s mother.\tMm-hmm. . Why am I telling Sarah\u2019s mother all ? Maybe because you expect me to get in touch with her and let her know that you still love her. No, I mean, unless you want to. I told you before, I wish the two of you had worked this out, but I\u2019ve learned my. I mean, I, I made my feelings clear to Sarah and, and I told her that this time I\u2019m gonna stay out of it.\tI understand that I\u2019ve lost Sarah and now I\u2019ve driven Gwen away too. Seems I can\u2019t help but hurt the women in my life. Mm. Well it seems to be a lot of that going around.\tOkay. Someone tell me what this is about. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing. Yeah, of course. Well, it says Johnny won\u2019t tell you. I will. You see, he came asking for my help for some lab results for his father. I told him there\u2019s nothing I could do, so he stole my id, impersonated me and stole those results from the lab.\tThat\u2019s how you got those results? Yeah. He put my good name and reputation at risk all because he and his family always think they\u2019re above the.\tI know how much he admired my father. He was a flawed and complicated man, but his drive and determination was unmatched , and he never ever let someone get the better of him, which is why I\u2019m trying to follow in his footsteps.\tLook at him over there, droning on trying to impression. Doesn\u2019t he know droning is your specialty? . Stefan will get what\u2019s coming to him soon enough. I love a good tour wreck dinner party. Mm-hmm. . Let\u2019s join them. See how things are progressing. Whoa, whoa. You okay? All good.\tGood job buddy. I seven believe that you\u2019re drunk, but maybe tone it down Well, shin\u2019s looking okay. Is it a little warm in here? I just me,\tI\u2019m glad you were raised his dinner party, ej. It\u2019s given me a chance to, uh, stress the importance of rising up our stock price. Of course, it\u2019s all he\u2019s thinking about. I can vouch for that. Okay. EJ is the first to admit that this stock slide was due to an unfortunate mistake. But believe me when I say that, he\u2019s doing everything in his power to make sure it never happens again.\tIsn\u2019t that right? Ej? Uh, of course. And he\u2019s using this opportunity to make changes within the company. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve developed a new program to teach all DER employees media strategies as we navigate this new environment. And I know EJ is fully on board. See, when I, I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not finished. When one employee is able to cause this big a crisis by opening his mouth, that tells me that the culture needs to be changed.\tAnd I can assure you that we are going to change that culture. Stop talking.\tMr. Shim heard you the first time. For God\u2019s sake, the man is old, not deaf.\tSo, uh, if you\u2019re distancing yourself from Gwen, does that mean you\u2019re quitting the spectator? No, Gwen certainly doesn\u2019t want me there, but you own half of. Yeah, but it\u2019s, it\u2019s Gwen\u2019s legacy, not mine. So you\u2019re unemployed again. We\u2019ll see. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll find some non-legal way to fill my own. Well, then maybe you could fill in Harry Titan.\t", "\u200aI am sorry. I don\u2019t remember inviting you to sit here. You didn\u2019t Then why are you here? Well, because US members of the Bad Day Club have to stick together. This Spencer can\u2019t argue with that. You are. Um, Alex, that\u2019s. And you are Gwen.\tWell, I would say nice to meet you, but we have so many people in common. It\u2019s almost if we\u2019re old chums. Mm-hmm. . Does feel that way. Huh?\tSo who puts you in such a rotten mood when your rotten cousin Zander?\tOh,\tsorry. Your talk with Gwen didn\u2019t go so well. Yeah, well, It went about as well as Lincoln\u2019s nights at the theater actually. Sorry. So was it, um, bad business wise or relationship wise? Both. Oh, I\u2019m sorry. Yeah. No, I\u2019ve made Gwen so angry. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any relationship left. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Where\u2019s all this anger coming from?\tOkay. I don\u2019t get it. Yeah, neither do I. What do you think Johnny did? What do I think he did? No, I know exactly what he did and he can\u2019t dodge this one cuz I have the receipts.\tYou had fun at the museum, didn\u2019t you? Oh, I\u2019m not gonna complain about seeing Van Gogh paintings of clothes. Hmm. So much beauty in one place. The art was pretty good too. Are we gonna keep doing this? What compliments. Going into the exhibit was your idea. Remember, after I found you and s Stephan together, I thought you were trying to make amend.\tI was trying to make the best of the situation. I didn\u2019t know dinner was gonna be a part of it. What\u2019s wrong with dinner? I\u2019m not hungry. Ah, you said the same thing when I made you ch laquila for breakfast and then you scarf those down. Come on. You love the steak here, just like you love the exhibit. And then what?\tBy the time our, our six months deal expires, I\u2019m gonna. Just let go of s Stephan and love you again too. Yeah, that\u2019s right. Except, uh, things can happen a lot sooner than that.\tOnce again to D Mirror,\tOh, soit is so brave that you came over for dinner.\tI\u2019m so glad you were able to join us, Mr. Shin. I\u2019m very glad to be here. Yeah, and I know that Shep is making beef Wellington, so I hope I see your liking. Oh, it sounds wonderful. This feels like it\u2019s going to be a night to remember. Couldn\u2019t have said it better myself, brother.\tLike sand through the hourglass. So are the days of our lives.\tWell, I hope you don\u2019t hold it against me, that Zander and I are related, even though blood is just about the only bond we have, especially after the whole kidnapping mess. I do not wanna talk about that. Fair enough. Besides Zander\u2019s, actual crimes are really the least of my issues with him. Oh yeah. You know, he tried to be good in his own way.\tHow about you? Did you try to be good? Mostly? How\u2019s that working out for you?\tWhat do you think? Right. So it seems to me that in a weird way, you and Zander are a pretty damn good match, except it\u2019s not the match that he wants, despite the fact that she wants absolutely nothing to do with him. Zander will never stop loving Sarah Horton,\tyou know? Realized I was doing the very thing that I told you I didn\u2019t want to do. Leading G went on. Mm-hmm. So you made her think you were gonna be a couple again? Only cuz I believed it. I mean, I really did think that, you know, once I saw the final divorce decree in my hands, I would finally accept that Sarah and I are over for good.\tI don\u2019t think it works that way. No. The feelings didn\u2019t miraculously disappear. I can\u2019t lie to going about that. Even if Sarah hates me, she doesn\u2019t hate you. She\u2019s just done with you. Now you\u2019ve got to get over her. Are you gonna end up alone?\tYou know, you really need to work on listening when people. Like, like I am not in love with you. Or six months or six years he and I are not happening. Hmm. I heard you say those things and yet they\u2019re not sinking in because you keep talking about winning me back and you\u2019re starting to sound delusional.\tI like to call it hopeful. Okay. Well, you can call it whatever you\u2019d like. It\u2019s still a pine tree only because you\u2019re treating it like it\u2019s some kind of chore because it is. It doesn\u2019t have to be Daddy. This quality time we\u2019re spending. Look at it like I\u2019m doing you a favor. A favor. Yeah. Yeah. The more time you spend with me, the less time you spend fighting your temptation to be with Stephan.\tOr even worse, giving in. So you\u2019re helping me out. If you cave, you force me to invoke. Cause 2.6 of our deal and you lose out all my damer shares is one night of nostalgia. Was Stephan really worth that?\tSo I found this startup in South Africa. They\u2019re making incredible breakthroughs on clean energy. They are hungry for investors. I\u2019m intrigued. I must have missed a memo on this one. Oh, I was gonna brief you in the morning, get your sign off. You know, I\u2019m sure it was just a misunderstanding. Yeah, of course.\tSorry, I, I\u2019m sure you were caught off guard just as I was caught off guard when you told me that Mr. Shin was joining us for dinner tonight. So guess we\u2019re even, I\u2019m going to check in on how, see how those appetizers are coming. Nicole, would you like to join me? I know you had a request for the chef. Oh, yes.\t", "Mostly I raised myself.\tBy the way, it doesn\u2019t seem like either of us have gotten what we want.\tIt\u2019s misery.\tWhere is mine\tto misery?\tSo you wanna get outta here?\tLook. I\u2019m sorry. Okay. That I got trip in trouble, but he gave me no choice. Okay. How do you figure, I asked you for your help. He didn\u2019t wanna give it to me, so I borrowed your badge for like 10 minutes. Okay. No, you didn\u2019t borrow trip\u2019s. Badge, you stole it. So what you, you, you think that what my dad is doing to s Stephan is okay, but both things are bad.\tYeah. One\u2019s a hell of a lot worse. You knew this was wrong or you wouldn\u2019t have kept it from me.\tYou should go, Wendy. No, I\u2019m serious. Johnny, what do we have? If I can\u2019t trust you, I\u2019ll text you tomorrow. Once you\u2019ve had time to think about this, you\u2019ll understand.\tLook, I\u2019m sorry. Are you okay? Ali warned me about how impulsive and selfish shawny can be.\tI guess I\u2019m still trying to learn what that means.\tIt\u2019s a great idea to have Harold set us up in here with coffee and desserts. Mr. Shin. Nicole, can I get you coffee? No, thank you. Ah, I\u2019ll pass. Aj, you\u2019re not gonna say no. Only if you join me.\tThis is one of my favorites. See why it\u2019s one of the only abstracts we own.\tAnd father acquired this squad in Tuscan. I agree. F l had Yes indeed.\tWhy don\u2019t you show Mr. Shin that incredible sculpture you purchased at the auction? Oh, I would love to. It is so special. Believe it or not, our father actually owned it in the sixties.\tYou tracked him again and maybe he didn\u2019t get enough in the first trick, but this time, this time, He\u2019s going down.\tSo you wanna know if your shameless flirting is working. What\u2019s so shameless about it? I was just remembering what it was like to be in bed with you that night and hoping that by the time September rolls around and we\u2019ve made new memories, you\u2019ll be. Stephan, who\tI admire your persistence.\tWhat else do you admire about me? Uh, check. Please check. Oh, we can\u2019t leave yet. Why not? I pre-ordered the souffle for dessert. We can get it to go. You want to go back home just like last time?\tI am sorry. I know I was hard on Johnny there. No, you had it coming to him. You have every right to be pissed. It was my first day back at the hospital, you know, and I wanted everything to be perfect and just, I dunno. I feel like such a responsibility to honor Kayla\u2019s memory and I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be proud.\tI know I\u2019ll never. Go the doctor she was. But that\u2019s important to me that I don\u2019t do anything that\u2019ll stain her reputation or even this point, my dad, while still breathing. Hey you, nothing wrong today.\tThanks. Okay. I\u2019m really sorry Joani put you in this position.\tIf I known what he was gonna do, I would\u2019ve.\tOh, Stephan, why don\u2019t you share some of the numbers with Mr. Shin for the South Africa project? You sure you want me to do that now? Why not? Oh, Johnny. Hello Uncle Stephan. My son. What a grand addition to the group. I Hey dad, . Oh, have you? Have you two met? You\u2019ve got to meet my boy. Hey, can I talk to you for a second?\tIn a minute. In a minute. I\u2019m sure you know all about this young man. Way after all. He could be the air to the Damira throne. Well, I am will aware. Hello Johnny. Mr. Shin. Hello. Come on. You can do better than that. Johnny Tuck. Oh, oh, oh. Of course, Mr. Shim is a legendary judge of character and talent, so I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll find Johnny completely amazing when he finally gets his chance.\tHuh? Hey, right, and let\u2019s not hold against him. That whole new devil possession thing, wife, you need to go. Now. Why? Because there\u2019s been a mistake. The only mistake I see is two CEOs, okay? That, are you all right? I got this. Ej. Hey, I don\u2019t know what is going on with you, but you need to make an excuse. Go upstairs and lie down cause I\u2019m not tired.\tYou need to lie down. Before you embarrass yourself any further, embarrass myself. Who the hell do you think you are? Ej, clearly you are messed up. I am not messed up. You are three.\tOh, okay. That was clearly not supposed to happen. Okay. You know what? Ha didn\u2019t sleep much. He was up all night. But I switched it. I, I, I, I know I switched it. Just come with me. Uh, excuse us.

No, I can\u2019t see that happening, but you can take this with your chamomile. What in the hell were you thinking?\tSummer: I\u2019m not in the mood for this right now.\tMariah: You know, I\u2019ve never had an especially high opinion of you, but even I was surprised that you could keep phyllis\u2019 secret, knowing how deeply it would affect diane and kyle.\tSummer: You know what? What would you have done if sharon was the one that needed protecting? Especially after you went the trauma of thinking that you lost her forever? Yeah, it\u2019s really easy to judge when you haven\u2019t been through it yourself.\tMariah: I suppose if sharon had been the one that I thought I lost forever, then yes, I would do anything to keep her safe and close.\tSummer: Okay.

I just think it\u2019s clear who\u2019s to blame for the nightmare we\u2019ve all been going through.\tSummer: I agree. It is clear. This was all a part of stark\u2019s master plan. He\u2019s the one who started all of this trouble to begin with.\tDiane: Well, I guess, technically, that\u2019s true.\tSummer: You know what? If you wanna go all the way back to try to place blame, how did we even hear stark\u2019s name in the first place? I think it was you that brought him into our lives, diane.\tDiane: Oh, wait a minute. I\u2019m not the one who invited him to town.\tSummer: But you\u2019re the one who had history with him. You\u2019re the one that burned him. Everything is unintended consequences.\tDiane: Unintended consequences? Summer. Summer, we\u2019re getting way off track here. Yes, this plan was the work of jeremy stark, but he could not have faked phyllis\u2019 death without her full participation and it is naive to think that your mother is somehow innocent in all of this.\tSummer: No, my mom didn\u2019t do any of this on her own. She was coerced and threatened and maybe even blackmailed into doing what she did.\tDiane: Is that what phyllis is telling you? That she was blackmailed into that performance at the gala?\tSummer: Diane, you were the one who brought stark to town and maybe you didn\u2019t commit murder, but you\u2019re not innocent and I\u2019m not ever gonna let myself forget that.\t[ Diane sighing ]\tNick: All right, sharon.

I\u2019ll never forget it.\tNick: Takes a lot of courage to do what you\u2019re doing. I still hate this plan, but cameron is crazy. He\u2019s already in your head, he\u2019s got our daughter\u2019s life in his hands. He knows where you\u2019re most vulnerable.\tSharon: Of course I\u2019m vulnerable where my child is concerned. I\u2019m so afraid for her right now, I could scream. I know first hand what cameron is capable of. It\u2019s taken everything inside of me not to fall apart. And the thought of facing him again?

I mean, there were days that I wasn\u2019t sure I was gonna make it through, but I did and I came out a better person for it.\tDaniel: You were kind of an okay person before that.\tLily: Look. I know that my experience is the exception to the rule, okay? I know that not everyone comes out of prison saying, you know, \u201coh, that was amazing. I learned so much.\u201d But I did. And you know what? It might be good for phyllis to get a different perspective on things. To see women who are facing struggles much harder than she is, right?

When the airstrike destroyed it, I thought, it\u2019s gone, the place where my britta had the best night of her life and I my worst. I didn\u2019t know what to think, how to feel. But then I heard that you were instrumental, however inadvertently, in its destruction. And it felt like\u2026 a gift.\tA gift? Well, maybe I did do something right.\tYou\u2019ve done many things right. But as much as I love you, scott, it\u2019s just hard for me to even look at you right now. All I can see is elizabeth and how you sided with her. And while I understand you see her as a daughter, I must side with a memory of mine. That is our truth,\tmeine liebe, and unfortunately, it does not set us free.\tLook, dex, I\u2019ll give you all the money you need to start somewhere new, okay? Somewhere sonny can\u2019t touch you. It\u2019s the least that I owe you.\tThat isn\u2019t what I agreed to. The deal was I would get evidence for you to put sonny away forever and then I would get out of his business.\tYou did everything that I asked you to do. You gained sonny\u2019s trust, you braved the brutality of his world. And I can\u2019t thank you enough for everything that you\u2019ve done. And I realize, me changing the terms like this, it comes at a great risk to you.\tBut you\u2019re not gonna change your mind, are you?\tNo. No, I\u2019m not.\tThen I am screwed.\tDex, dex, you knew that this job could go wrong a million different ways. You signed up for that, too.\tNo, I signed on for a job with exactly two possible outcomes; either sonny goes to prison or he catches on to me and I end up dead. And since option one is off the table now, the only one left is me not breathing.\tListen, there\u2019s a way for you to escape with your life. If you let me help you get away, sonny, I\u2019ll protect you from him.\tIf I disappear, I have to give up my life. And I\u2019ve gotten very attached to\u2013 to this city.\tYou\u2019ve grown attached to the city or attached to josslyn?\tJosslyn. I\u2019m so happy to see you.\tI\u2019m surprised you\u2019re even awake. How are you feeling?\tWell, if I\u2019m being completely honest, this chemo is taking a lot out of me.\tI bet.\tBut it\u2019ll all be worth it, provided liesl\u2019s donation takes.\tIt will. Is there anything that I can do for you? Anything at all?\tYes. Tell me what\u2019s going on. What\u2019s happening in the outside world?\tOh, right, um\u2026\tthis doesn\u2019t have to be anything major. Just tell me something small and personal. Like, how are you studying for your finals? Are you a flashcards or an outline student?\t[Chuckles] Ok. You have lowered the bar. We can do better than that. Um\u2026 I\u2019m sort of seeing someone.\tRight. Well, michael and carly sort of hinted that you were, but they didn\u2019t give me any details. I was very annoyed that they respected your privacy like that. So tell me, is he anyone that I know?\tThe cargo was a lot riskier than we discussed.\tWhat was the cargo?\tOh, just one of the most powerful plastic explosives in the world. Did you know that?\tI knew that they dealt explosives. I didn\u2019t expect them to ask you to traffic it, not on your first job with them, anyway.\tI\u2019m not in the market of arming terrorists.\tNo, you\u2019re not arming terrorists. Their main client is the us military. They make limited, covert exports to small countries who need to defend themselves against larger, better equipped hostile forces.\tMeaning that there are other countries who have vested interest in making sure that pikeman doesn\u2019t move their merchandise.\tYeah, that\u2019s right.\tRight.\tAnd that would go to extremes to eliminate anyone facilitating the movement of said merchandise.\tThere is no way I\u2019m gonna sit back and be pikeman\u2019s collateral damage.\tSo you want me to tell them no deal?\tNina, I love you, but that is a terrible idea.\tIt\u2019s the only thing that I can think of. I mean, this whole thing is horrible. They froze drew and carly\u2019s assets.\t[Chuckles]\tIs that funny? It\u2019s not funny. It\u2019s not\u2013\tI mean, it\u2019s not funny when it comes to drew. But carly, considering she lost her shirt in the very deal she\u2019s being investigated for, she\u2019s lucky she has any assets left to freeze. It\u2019s funny, and it\u2019s delicious.\tYou know willow\u2019s not gonna see it that way. They are in a lot of trouble. They\u2019re gonna face serious prison time. And if there\u2019s any way of salvaging this, building any kind of relationship with my daughter, I\u2019m just gonna have to come clean. I\u2019m gonna have to apologize to willow for all the pain that I put her and her family through.\tNina, let me remind you something. None of the current or former members of the corinthos family are forgiving people. That includes willow. If you come clean, she will be furious with you.\tYeah, but what if she finds out from someone else later?\t", "hey.\tHey. Hey, finally. Let\u2019s get this party started.\tThank you.\tTrina and your aunt are home safe and sound, which means willow has her donor. So what should we drink to first? Hm. You don\u2019t look like you\u2019re in the mood to celebrate anything. What\u2019s wrong?\tI have to say, not having to hide our relationship\u2013\tmakes the whole sec investigation worth it?\tI wouldn\u2019t say that.\tAh.\tBut it is the one silver lining.\tDon\u2019t mind me.\tHey.\tWelcome home.\tThank you. I\u2019m so happy to be here. You have no idea.\tActually seeing you, it\u2019s like confirmation that everyone\u2019s going to be ok; willow, trina, spencer. Thank you so much.\t[Tense music]\tNina and I have never had a relationship, not a good one, anyway. Us being estranged doesn\u2019t affect anyone. There\u2019s no collateral damage. But with you and sonny, it affects everyone you love. And I truly believe that keeping our family whole is more important than bringing sonny to justice.\tYou, and all your lies, your disloyalty, violence, crimes, eventually that will be forgotten, like you never even existed.\tI love you. You\u2019re my son. I\u2019m always gonna love you.\tYeah, so you keep saying.\tBut I\u2019m not gonna forget this. And if you want me to forgive, you\u2019re gonna have to beg.\tYour guest is here.\tLet him in. Hail the conquering hero.\tHello, sonny. Uh, you can just call. You don\u2019t have to send your staff.\tYeah, I don\u2019t mean to inconvenience you, but there are some matters that we have to discuss and no one\u2019s leaving this room until we do that.\t[Dramatic music]\tHave you talked to trina? Have you seen her?\tNo. She\u2019s with her mom and dad. I mean, she texted me that she and spencer are alive and back in port charles. Thank you. I mean, you rescued my best friends.\tAre you kidding me? It was a huge team effort. Spencer and trina were pretty heroic themselves.\tI am just so grateful that you were able to get dr. Obrecht back in time to save willow. I mean, seriously, you are a hero.\tOk, let\u2019s not get carried away here, people.\tJosslyn\u2019s right. Although you didn\u2019t get the hero\u2019s welcome you deserve.\tWait, why? What happened?\tAva, I really appreciate you coming out with me tonight.\tBut?\tWell, maybe you should go see trina. I know how worried you were.\tTrina is\u2013she\u2019s safe. She\u2019s with her parents, and we should celebrate. At the very least, we should raise a glass to your aunt liesl. She survived being kidnapped by victor cassadine again and she made it home in time to save willow\u2019s life. I mean, she did, didn\u2019t she?\tYes. My aunt liesl had the procedure to donate her bone marrow and willow is going to get that transplant as soon as she completes her chemotherapy.\tOk, well, that\u2019s wonderful. So why so glum?\tThis morning, willow\u2013 she offered a way for me to make peace.\tAnother reason to celebrate.\tIt would be, except I already screwed it up.\t[Monitor beeping steadily]\t[Knock on door]\t[Phone ringing]\t[Breathes heavily] Hello, aunt liesl.\tI\u2019m sorry I kept you waiting, but I was abducted by a homicidal madman.\tDon\u2019t let it happen again.\tDon\u2019t worry, it won\u2019T.\tI\u2019m just glad you\u2019re all right.\tI too am quite pleased by my survival.\t[Chuckles] It was a great relief to donate my bone marrow today.\tSo it\u2019s done?\tYeah.\tAre you ok? Did it hurt?\tI had the easy part. I was under anesthesia. And aside from some mild soreness, I feel absolutely fine.\tI don\u2019t know what to say. Thank you doesn\u2019t even\u2026 begin to cover it. I\u2019ll be able to watch my children grow up\u2026\t[Sobs] Grow old with michael. I\u2019ll be alive, all thanks to you.\tI did what I had to. After all, you\u2019re my family.\t[Tender music]\tHey, dex. Look, um, thank you for helping josslyn bring wiley and amelia to see willow at the hospital. It meant a lot to the both of us.\tI was happy to help. How is willow doing?\tShe\u2019s tough. She\u2019s determined to pull through for her family. But true to form, she\u2019s more concerned with others than herself, which is, uh, why I called you here.\tI think I know what you\u2019re gonna say. I\u2019ll admit, I thought you\u2019d want to wait until your wife was better to turn sonny in.\t[Dramatic music] Is there another problem?\tI spoke to anna. She told me how you got trina, spencer, and liesl home.\tWell, he was my father. It was kind of on me to stop him.\tWhatever the reasons, nina got her aunt back and now willow is gonna get her bone marrow transplant that I hope saves her life.\tI\u2019m just glad that liesl made it back in time.\tYou know what? You stepped up. I\u2019m not gonna forget that.\tThank you. I appreciate that.\tNow, can we talk about how your associates nearly got me and my people killed?\tOk, so that there\u2019s no mistake, I would never get in the way of your operation, much less do anything to harm your people.\tLet me explain the new developments in the pikeman deal, which you facilitated. It seems like you left out a few important details.\tWith respect, I told you everything that I know. I\u2019m just a middleman. They\u2019re not gonna give me the specifics.\tOk, well, you went on the run right after this, so let me fill you in.\t", "Then she\u2019ll be furious later. If you admit what you did, carly will be out for your blood, not to mention michael and drew and the whole quartermaine clan. And of course, there\u2019s sonny.\tWhat about sonny?\tCarly is the mother of his children. Do you really think he\u2019s gonna be fine with you turning her over to the feds?\tNo, but he loves me.\tYes, he does right now. But if he finds out that you threw carly to the wolves, I promise you, that will change.\tI know, I know there\u2019s gonna be consequences. Shouldn\u2019t I face them?\tWhen you dropped the dime on carly and drew, were you lying?\tNo.\tNo, you weren\u2019T. Exactly. They committed an actual crime. All you did was report it. If they didn\u2019t want to go to prison for insider trading, then maybe they shouldn\u2019t have done it. Nina, all you will get for your honesty are lifelong and very powerful enemies. You will lose willow forever. You will lose sonny forever. Do you really want to throw away everything that makes you happy?\tJust tell me this. Are you happy?\tYeah, I am.\tGood.\t[Tender music] Thank you for sharing at least that much with me.\tI\u2019ll share everything with you eventually, ok? I promise.\tI\u2019ll hold you to that. And thank you so much for being here. It means the world.\tWell, it\u2019s not just me. It\u2019s michael and my mom and drew. We\u2019re all here and we\u2019re gonna be here for you every step of the way, ok? All of us.\tThe love and support from the whole family has kept me going through all of this, the way everyone\u2019s coming together.\tWe love you.\tI love all of you, too. And\u2026 as nervous as I am about the transplant, I\u2019m also feeling hopeful for all of our futures again. Bye.\tBye.\tI feel the same way.\tI want you to deliver a message for me. I might be open to another deal, one that would facilitate another shipment, the way it was before, not under these circumstances. Pikeman needs to get their affairs in order, figure out who came after me. Then\u2026 we can move forward, but not until then.\tI will convey that message, and I\u2019ll get back to you.\tYou bring up some good points.\tMm-hmm. That you obviously hadn\u2019t considered.\tSo where do I go now? I mean, do I just go forward with this huge secret hanging over me and everyone I love?\tYep.\tWhat if I get caught?\tHow? Is anyone besides me aware that you knew carly and drew were romantically involved at the time of the merger?\tWell, martin grey.\tAttorney-client privilege. He can\u2019t say anything.\tHe\u2019s the one who informed the sec about the insider trading and he assured me that there\u2019s no way to trace that tip back to me.\tWell, great. I\u2019m not gonna say anything. So good news, nina. You\u2019ve already gotten away with it. You\u2019re the last person anybody would suspect.\tWhy would you say that? My animosity towards carly isn\u2019t a secret.\tNo one\u2019s animosity towards carly is a secret. Aurora\u2019s assets were frozen, too, right? And aurora owns crimson, so why would you undermine your own business?\tOh. That\u2019s true.\tNina, you\u2019ve gotten away with murder. Don\u2019t tell anybody where to find the body.\tDrew, I was only too happy to step in and get you released. But moving forward, it would not be in your best interest to have the same representation as carly.\tI don\u2019t understand. Won\u2019t it help if we have the same strategy?\tNo, because the sec is gonna pit the two of you against each other. If this goes to trial, you will be separate defendants, so you should have separate attorneys fighting your respective charges.\tWell, then you should represent carly.\tNo. You are the ceo of aurora. You engineered the merger. You should have the better representation.\tThe qs have a shark tank full of lawyers that I can use. I mean, you should have somebody that knows you implicitly, somebody that\u2019s represented you and your family for years.\tBut\u2013 diane, what do you think?\tI think he\u2019s a very smart man that makes a very compelling argument.\tOk, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do.\tGood. I\u2019m glad that\u2019s settled. Carly, I will be in touch. In the meantime, the two of you look great together.\t[Dramatic music]\tNow what?\tOh.\tIs that scott?\tOh, he\u2019s got that lost puppy dog look.\tHe\u2019s ok. Hey, scott.\tHi.\tAre you all right?\tWhat\u2019s up?\tOh, hiya, girls.\tOh, what happened? Are you ok?\tWell, I tried to mend some fences with liesl, but, uh, we\u2019re finished.\tNo, she\u2019s just been through a lot.\tNo, I know. I thought she might, you know, come to my waiting arms, but no such luck.\tJust give her some time.\tYeah, yeah, the woman obviously loves you.\tWhat do you mean, obviously?\tWell, if she didn\u2019t, she wouldn\u2019t be so mad at you. What did she say exactly?\tWell, she said that our truth does not set us free, which translates to me that even if you love somebody, if you mess with their family, there is no coming back.\tOk. So how do you think the sec is gonna pit us against each other?\tLook, if they want to play dirty, let them. We can handle whatever they throw at us.\tThat\u2019s right.\tThe way I see it, we can take on the world as long as we\u2019re together.\t[Dramatic music]\tAll right, girls, I\u2019m not good company. I\u2019m gonna go have some martinis.\tOh.\tSo what are we doing here? Are we celebrating? Or are you planning to ruin your relationship with willow?\tAll right, you\u2019re right. You\u2019re right. I can\u2019t tell willow that I turned in carly and drew to the sec.\tExactly. Trust me. Nothing good will come of clearing your conscience.\tAt least not this time.\tAlmost never. Ok, to\u2013 to seeing reason. Everything is going your way. Liesl is gonna save willow\u2019s life. Carly and drew will\u2013 they\u2019ll face the consequences of their actions. Best thing for you to do is keep your mouth shut and your eyes forward.\tAnd hope for the best.\tHi. Why did you need to see me? Hey, what\u2019s going on?\tI have to say goodbye.\t[Knock on door]\tCome in.\tYou have another visitor.\tI\u2019m not expecting anyone.\tYou\u2019ll want to see this one.\tSend him in.\t[Dramatic music]\t", "Fine. I\u2019m listening.\tI was preparing my first shipment and a sniper tried to take me out. Fortunately, he missed.\t[Dramatic music] When we were discussing this deal, you said something about there\u2019s gonna be significant risks. Was that code? Did you or did you not know that I could have a target on my back?\tI truly am grateful for everything you\u2019re doing and have done. It\u2019s just\u2013\tyou don\u2019t really know me, certainly not well. And I understand your fear that accepting me into your life also means accepting nina, whom you think you do know well. But I want you to know that I have no agenda. Regardless of how you feel about me, I\u2013 I consider you family. I have lost almost all of my relatives. When that happens, we tend to latch on to whatever family we have left. Sometimes we even put too much pressure on those relationships.\tIf that\u2019s a hint for me to be more receptive to nina\u2013\tthere\u2019ll be a time and place for you to consider what role, if any, you want nina to have in your life. It doesn\u2019t matter right now. The important thing is that you heal so that someday you may have the opportunity to make that decision and a lifetime of other happier ones.\tI can\u2019t make any promises about nina. Right now, I\u2019m just praying I come out the other side of this.\tYou will.\tYou sound so certain. Why?\tBecause I\u2019m aware of the tribulations you\u2019ve endured in your life. Tell me, does it annoy you when people assume you\u2019re fragile? Or do you use it to your advantage and get them to underestimate you?\tI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever thought about it that way.\tNo matter. I see you for the strong woman you are. Even in this weakened state, it\u2019s obvious. You are a survivor. I know\u2026 because it\u2019s in your blood.\tMy daughter asked me for a favor, which she\u2019s never done before. So I think that\u2019s a step forward.\tSounds promising. What\u2019s the favor?\tUnfortunately, it\u2019s something I can\u2019t give her.\tWell, what is it? What does she want?\tShe wants me to drop my vendetta against carly.\tOh, that\u2019s all?\t[Chuckles] I mean, I fail to see the problem here, nina. I know how much you hate carly, but compared to having a relationship with your daughter\u2013 listen to me. Do it. Do this for willow. Lay down your arms.\tAva, it\u2019s too late. I made sure of that when I ratted out drew and carly to the sec.\tYeah, then diane showed up and she kind of shut the whole thing down, at least for now.\tI cannot believe they dragged you out of there after you risked your life to rescue victor\u2019s hostages.\tOk, the important thing is, is that we haven\u2019t been charged with anything yet. This is an ongoing investigation.\tThat\u2019s right, and diane is on her way here now to discuss the case.\tOk, well, if diane\u2019s on it, then I\u2019m not gonna worry too much.\tI do need you to know that while the sec is conducting this investigation, our assets and accounts have been frozen.\tOk, well, do you need me to get money out of my trust fund?\tNo. No, no, I just want you to be aware. I don\u2019t want you worrying about me because diane is working on it and we\u2019re gonna figure it all out. Ok?\tWell, how long do they think this is gonna take?\tThere\u2019s really no way to tell, unfortunately.\t[Phone ringing] Oh. These are the lawyers from aurora. I got to take this.\tOh, go. Go, go.\tThis is drew.\tIt\u2019s really great to see you two together, out in the open. And I can tell that you\u2019re so happy, despite everything.\tYeah, we are. But speaking of a secret relationship being out in the open, you showing up here with dex, you want to talk about that?\tI\u2019ve decided I am not using the pikeman evidence against sonny.\tDid you find something else to use against him?\tNo. I\u2019m not turning him in at all.\tWhy not?\tBecause willow helped me realize that by sending sonny to prison, I\u2019ll just be tearing my family apart.\tBut you said you were willing to accept that.\tYes, for myself, but not for my siblings. Yes, josslyn, she wants to see sonny face justice. But kristina, she\u2019d never forgive me. And my younger siblings, donna and avery that we stuck in the middle, it\u2019s not fair for them to have to choose between kristina and josslyn or me and my father.\tYou\u2019re the boss. You have the right to change your mind. But I was hired to do a job, a job I have risked my life for a year now getting done. I have been shot, hung from a meat hook, beaten, and threatened with torture. I\u2019ve had to spend every day with the knowledge that if sonny finds out I\u2019m working against him, I\u2019m dead.\tThen I came to work for you. I decided it was worth it. I\u2019ve since come to understand sonny better, but that doesn\u2019t change anything for me. My options are limited here.\tI know, look, dex, I know I put you in a tough spot and for that I am sorry. But look, for my family\u2019s sake, I can\u2019t turn sonny in.\tGreat. Really happy for all of you. One question, michael. Where does that leave me? Because the way I see it, I only have two options here. Either I keep working for sonny indefinitely or I put him away.\tThere is one more option. You disappear.\tLook, pikeman has a lot of enemies, the kind of people that are gonna want to keep pikeman\u2019s merchandise out of their own enemy\u2019s hands. Ok? Now, I didn\u2019t know you were going to be targeted. I can\u2019t say I\u2019m entirely surprised.\t", "The pikeman\u2026 rep gets cagey every time I try to ask him about any information.\tThat\u2019s gonna be the case with any pikeman employee. It\u2019s all need to know, sonny.\tThe sniper was a ghost. But here\u2019s the thing. He wasn\u2019t a mob hitman. He was a black ops from the espionage world, your world.\tI\u2019m not gonna get anyone to pikeman to confirm or deny that. But listen, I have good news.\tWhat\u2019s that?\tI spoke to my source at pikeman. They\u2019re very happy with the way the shipment went down. They want to work with you again.\tTell them I\u2019m not interested.\tHey, hi. You\u2019re back.\tYes.\tAnd in one piece, I might add.\tI am unharmed. I should be going.\tOh, wait, wait. Did you hear that I moved heaven and earth to try and find you? And I got chloroformed for my trouble.\tYes, I heard.\tYeah, I\u2019m sorry. I almost got you blown up. But liesl, I had to do something.\tOn the bright side, your misguided efforts to save me rather effectively blew up victor.\tGood riddance to him.\tYes. As I said, I should go.\tWait, wait, hang on a second. You know, listen, liesl, I know that we\u2019ve had a lot of problems before victor grabbed you and we got a lot of stuff to work out. But, you know, I\u2013 I think about every morning when I wake up and I think about you before I go to sleep, except the trouble is I don\u2019t sleep anymore. So I was wondering if you feel the same way. I mean, not that you don\u2019t sleep, I wouldn\u2019t wish that on anybody. But maybe we might be able to get things back on track? I mean, is there any way that things might work out with us?\tDex was a big help getting the kids here to see willow. And there\u2019s no real reason that we have to hide our relationship anymore now that sonny knows.\tBut you could\u2019ve told me.\tHello, you two. Am I interrupting a mother-daughter catch-up?\tNo.\tI can come back.\tNo, no. No, nothing we can\u2019t talk about later.\tOk.\tAnd we will. Thank you so much for coming here. You know, I didn\u2019t want to stray too far from willow.\tOf course, I understand.\tWell, I\u2019ll leave you two to it. I know you have a lot to talk about. Diane, now that I know you\u2019re the one helping out, I\u2019m sure it will all be ok.\tI appreciate the vote of confidence. Have a great meeting.\tYeah.\tBye.\tBye. Where\u2019s drew?\tOh, he went to take a call. Thank you so much for getting him released.\tYeah. It was a little too easy. That said\u2013\tdiane, thank you so much for coming. Sorry to interrupt there. So let\u2019s hear it. What are carly and i looking at?\tWell, unfortunately, it\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better.\tI hate that I turned in carly and drew to the sec. You know, I just\u2013I let my jealousy get the better of me, for carly becoming more like a mother to willow. And now I did something that I can\u2019t take back.\tWhen willow asked you to make peace with carly, did you tell her it was too late?\tNot exactly. I lied a little bit and i told her that I wouldn\u2019t get into it with carly anymore.\tTechnically, that\u2019s not a lie, though, because you tipped off the sec before you promised willow, right?\tWell, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s gonna matter to willow. That I took revenge on carly before she asked me not to. That loophole is not gonna work for me here.\tYeah. Knowing carly, she will weasel her way out of it somehow, hopefully after she suffers a little bit.

{"content": ["Lauren: Yeah \u2014\tPhyllis: Hey, but I want to talk about you. You \u2014 you\u2019ve been planning for the bicentennial party. So, I want to know all about it.\tLauren: What\u2019s going on?\tPhyllis: What do you mean?\tLauren: Well, the last time i saw you, you could not have been more miserable, and now you\u2019re just, like, vibrating with positive energy or energy of some sort. What happened between then and now?\tJack: No, it was not the threat of jeremy stark that led me to propose.\tKyle: How could that not have been a factor?\tJack: If anything, it might have put things in perspective for me. And by that, I mean I realize i no longer want to keep looking backwards, rehashing the past. It\u2019s not fair to diane. And we\u2019ve done it too long.\tDiane: Yeah. I don\u2019t expect people to forget all the things I\u2019ve done or to just let it go. I mean, I\u2019m aware that forgiveness has to be earned, and I will continue to win people\u2019s trust by the way I live my life.\tJack: When diane first came back into our lives, I was suspicious of her motives, of her intentions.\tKyle: We remember.\tJack: I was trying to protect you, kyle. Now, I can\u2019t remember the exact moment when I fell back in love with her, but I know it happened shortly after I realized she was trying to protect you, too. When I saw the love she had for you and for harrison, yes, it was a change of heart for me. I realized then that she is not the same person, that she is a different person with different \u2014 different priorities. Not everyone\u2019s going to agree with me, but as far as I\u2019m concerned, diane has nothing left to prove. Kyle, I asked her to marry me for one reason. I love her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I have not been this happy in a very long time. You have to also remember that this love started many years ago. Yes, it has been put through unbelievable tests, and still the flame has not extinguished. And we feel the full force of it now. And we can\u2019t \u2014 we won\u2019t deny it any longer.\tDiane: And we also have the wisdom and experience that we didn\u2019t have the first time we were together. We\u2019ve both been through so much. And we have matured into different people. And we are better together than we are apart. I love my hardwood floors.\tJack: Kyle, diane is already an integral part of this family. She\u2019s your mother. She\u2019s harrison\u2019s dee dee. She adores that little boy every bit as much as we adore him. This is the natural next step.\tKyle: I can see how strongly you both feel. I appreciate that. But you must know not everyone is going to see this as a natural next step.\tJack: We are well aware of how others might react to this. We can\u2019t let them dictate our decisions. We have chosen each other. We want to embrace this wonderful thing that has happened to us, and we are sincerely hoping the both of you can do the same.\tKyle: No, we want you to be happy. You have to know that.\tDiane: We do.\tSummer: And you do seem happy.\tKyle: But I am still struggling to understand why you feel the need to get married now. It\u2019s a lot to process. We just \u2014 we need some time to let it sink in.\tDiane: All right, that\u2019s fair. We don\u2019t want to push. We just hope that you can see it in your hearts to give us your blessing \u2014 at some point.\tJack: And we are trying to keep this quiet for right now. Of course, we wanted to tell you both, but if you could keep this to yourselves, we would appreciate that.\tSummer: I will be very quiet, silent.\tJack: Well, we are headed to society. We\u2019ll talk later.\tDiane: Oh, kiss harrison for me.\t[ Sighs ]\t[ Door closes ]\tSummer: What the hell was that?\tNick: I\u2019m not worried about adam making inroads with sally, if you\u2019re asking if I\u2019m jealous.\tVictoria: Are you?\tNick: No, but I am worried that he\u2019s going to cause sally a bunch of stress that she and the baby just don\u2019t need.\tVictoria: Well, just do your best to protect her. Make sure you keep your guard up.\tNick: I will. I would tell you to do the same, but I know your guard is always up when it comes to adam. And just so you know, adam did confirm dad\u2019s plan.\tVictoria: And what plan is that?\tNick: Once newman enterprises acquires mccall unlimited, adam\u2019s gonna be placed in charge.\tVictoria: [ Laughs ] That is never gonna happen.\tNick: Look, vick, I know fighting with dad is like a newman family staple, but i really think you should consider staying out of this one. Dad wants to bring adam closer to the family, and you know how he is. He\u2019s not gonna quit until he gets what he wants.\tVictoria: Well, then I guess he\u2019s just gonna have to find another way to get what he wants.\tNick: By letting adam run mccall, it keeps him out of our business and lets him focus on something else.\tVictoria: But then adam wins.\tNick: Who cares, vick? Let him, if it keeps him out of our hair.\tVictoria: My plan is to fold mccall into newman, and I\u2019m not gonna let dad and adam derail that.\tNick: Newman doesn\u2019t need mccall. We\u2019ve made a bunch of greatacquisitions. The company is doing great. Let\u2019s just focus on what we have. Let adam and dad go off and do whatever they want away from us.\tVictoria: Look, nicholas, i understand where you\u2019re caution is coming from, but I am not gonna pass on this phenomenal opportunity so that dad can use mccall to lure adam back into the family, which is only gonna make him more beholden to dad, like some emotional hostage. It\u2019s bad business. It\u2019s miserable parenting. You and I \u2014 we\u2019ve seen this movie before. We know that it ends in disaster for both of them.\t", "Nick: So, now you\u2019re worried about adam\u2019s emotional well-being?\tVictoria: I don\u2019t want to fight with you right now.\tNick: Alright. Should we reschedule this fight for some other time?\tVictoria: Hi, nate. What a pleasant surprise.\tPhyllis: After that very unfortunate evening I had with you and michael, um\u2026 I had a moment. I had a wake-up call.\t[ Chuckles ] I\u2019ve been self-sabotaging. And it\u2019s made me very unhappy. I don\u2019t want to do that. You know? It\u2019s not what I want.\tLauren: Well, good. I\u2019m glad to hear it.\tPhyllis: Yeah. And I am sorry.\tLauren: Wow. Look who\u2019s getting better with the apology thing.\tPhyllis: I know! I know!\tLauren: Wow.\tPhyllis: Practice makes perfect.\tLauren: Yeah. You know, I so want to believe this change is positive and legit, but I still think you need some, you know, perspective and \u2014 and distance.\tPhyllis: Okay. Sure. What do you have in mind?\tLauren: I have a great idea. Girls\u2019 trip. Let\u2019s go for the weekend to vegas. I have some business there, and it\u2019s not gonna take too much time, which means you, my friend, can have some fun.\tPhyllis: That\u2019s great. I would love that. You know, um, why don\u2019t we do that, but just not now. I can\u2019t get away at the moment.\tLauren: Really? I mean, don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but you don\u2019t have a job and you\u2019re fighting with your kids.\tPhyllis: Why would I take that the wrong way?\tLauren: Look, I\u2019m just asking you, what is keeping you from leaving?\tPhyllis: I-I just have a lot of things going on, other things, and I just can\u2019t leave town at the moment. You can\u2019t run away from your problems, right?\tLauren: Honey.\tVictor\u2026 why are you still\tliving with odors?\tJack: Evening. Lauren. Phyllis.\tLauren: Hi, jack.\tPhyllis: Hey. You two look amazing.\tDiane: Thos sincere.\tPhyllis: Well, I\u2019m just pointing out the obvious. That\u2019s all.\tLauren: So, let\u2019s just leave it there then, okay? An unspoiled, surprisingly civil moment.\tPhyllis: I mean, I made an effort. That\u2019s what I did. I get points for trying.\tDiane: Oh, is that because you\u2019re always keeping score?\tPhyllis: That\u2019s right. I was always keeping score, wasn\u2019t I? I played a game, and I lost. And you know what that caused me? Nothing but misery. Nothing but misery. But, see, I want what you guys have. That\u2019s what I want. I want romance and love and beauty. I want what they have. And, uh, that\u2019s hard to get, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s harder to sustain. Right? Especially in your current circumstance.\tJack: What circumstance?\tPhyllis: I\u2019m just surprised to see you back in town.\tNate: So, elena crashed as soon as we got home, but I still had all this energy, so I wanted to see you. The latest developments with tucker\u2019s company have my mind working overtime.\tVictoria: Yeah. That makes two of us.\tNate: I was thinking maybe we could continue strategizing about the deal?\tVictoria: Yeah, of course. Um, nick and I \u2014 we just bumped into each other by chance.\tNick: Huh. Yeah. Um\u2026 I was just coming by to see sally.\tVictoria: Well, you\u2019re welcome to stick around for the discussion, if you\u2019d like.\tNate: Absolutely. I would love to hear your input, nick.\tNick: Yeah, maybe next time. I got to get upstairs. You, uh, have a great conversation.\tVictoria: Actually, I have been going over some of the numbers that I wanted to show you.\tNate: Okay.\tVictoria: Well, this page here.\tNate: Yeah, I was going over this, as well.\tSally: Why are you here?\tAdam: You know why, sally.\tSally: Refresh my memory.\tAdam: Because we are meant to be.\tSally: I didn\u2019t say that.\tAdam: It doesn\u2019t matter because it\u2019s something that we both know is true. Do you remember how perfect things were when we were together? I mean, of course you do. It was impossible to forget.\tSally: I remember.\tAdam: And up until that moment, both of us had lived lives like we were on the outside, like we were at war with the world and ourselves. And then suddenly there was this person in front of us that understood us. I mean, I saw you exactly for who you are. I accepted you. I loved you in a way that made you feel like you didn\u2019t know what love was until that moment. We had a connection of a lifetime, and I know that you feel it just as much as I do. We are meant to be together. And that is what this baby represents. This is our love that is real. You and me, whoever, we\u2019re gonna create this incredible person. Sally? Sally!\tSally: [ Breathing heavily ]\t[ Knock on door ]\tNick: Sally! Sally? Sally, if you don\u2019t open this door, I\u2019m gonna call security! On the count of three. One, two \u2014 are you okay?\tSally: [ Exhales sharply ] Get in here.\t[ Door slams ] Want luxury hair repair that doesn\u2019t cost $50?\t\u201cThe young and the restless\u201d\twill continue.\tSally: [ Breathing heavily ]\t", "Sally: No, look, that\u2019s just it. The last time we ran into each other, I was ready for a whole nother round of name-calling and accusations. But she told me that you had talked to her, so I don\u2019t know if that had an effect on her, but for summer, she was very muted. Like more than muted. Like she actually really wanted to try and make peace.\tNick: Hmm. I don\u2019t see the problem.\tSally: It was just strange the way the whole conversation went. Like she started off as a concerned daughter, which I get, and then a concerned friend to me. And I would not say that we\u2019re friends, but then the whole conversation veered into talking about adam, like how adam and I were so happy when we were together and this bond that we share. And now that we\u2019re having this baby, it\u2019s like we\u2019re meant to be.\tNick: Well, obviously, i don\u2019t agree with that. Did it bother you because maybe you were thinking you and adam were a better match than you and me are?\tSally: Of course not. Look, we don\u2019t \u2014 we don\u2019t have to get into all that again.\tNick: Well, you\u2019re the one that brought it up. I just think that summer\u2019s words are hitting you on a level you haven\u2019t acknowledged yet. Are you still feeling conflicted?\tKyle: I want my mom and dad to be happy. I see how much they love each other and it makes me remember when I was a kid, that was all I wanted \u2014 to see them happy and together.\tSummer: But you\u2019re an adult now.\tKyle: But seeing them this happy, it makes me worried. My dad has put his whole heart and soul into this, and it\u2019s clear how much they love each other. But is getting married the right thing for them? It\u2019s happening so fast, and there\u2019s so many reasons why they\u2019re not on the road to happily ever after.\tSummer: Starting with jeremy stark.\tKyle: Even if he didn\u2019t exist and he wasn\u2019t on his way to europe to track them down, it sounded like my dad wanted to ignore reality. It\u2019s like he\u2019s setting himself up to be hurt again.\tJack: Excuse me. You said you were surprised we were back in town. Why?\tPhyllis: I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting at. I mean, I knew you were going out of town. You were going to be gone for a while, but then you came back, and here you are. I mean, I guess that makes sense.\tJack: What do you mean? Makes sense how?\tPhyllis: Well, I mean, summer and kyle must have told you that jeremy stark was flying to paris to find you.\tDiane: How did you know that?\tLauren: Yeah, what is all this about?\tPhyllis: [ Laughs ] I was the one who told him. Dry skin is sensitive skin, too.\tVictoria: I\u2019m gonna get a room upstairs. I\u2019d really like for you to join me. I won\u2019t be insulted or take it personally if you choose not to. But this has nothing to do with your job or our professional relationship. One has nothing to do with the other. Either way, that\u2019s up to you.\tSally: It\u2019s just that summer was really friendly after that, like she was, like, putting on airs and I just\u2026 I just wasn\u2019t buying it.\tNick: Well, it sounds to me like she was trying, but the animosity is still there. I mean, you two had quite the history.\tSally: Yeah, I\u2019m sure she believes I deserve a head game or two after what I did to her.\tNick: You know what? My daughter may be trying to pull one over you, but I don\u2019t want that for you. I don\u2019t like the effect it\u2019s having. I just want you to exist in this bubble of peace and harmony.\tSally: I\u2019m gonna tell you the truth, okay? There is no bubble of peace and harmony.\tNick: What?\tSally: Yeah.\tNick: Oh, man. Okay. You know, regardless of my daughter\u2019s motives, are you feeling any new conflict where adam is concerned?\tSally: No, I\u2019m not.\tNick: Are you sure?\tSally: I just have been having these stupid thoughts, like these anxiety dreams of what the future might hold and what it might look like for me and all the grief and negativity that might be coming my way as we move forward.\tNick: Well, it\u2019s not gonna be easy. But we\u2019re gonna get through it.\tSally: Yeah. I just seriously wonder if I\u2019m gonna be able to handle the onslaught that\u2019s about to come from your family.\tSummer: You\u2019re worried that diane could break your dad\u2019s heart?\tKyle: And that they\u2019re in danger and she may have to leave again. There are so many unknowns, including the looming threat they want to ignore. Do they think that he\u2019s just going to go away on his own?\tSummer: Getting engaged is definitely not gonna get rid of jeremy stark.\tKyle: And if it\u2019s so right, why are they keeping it from people?\tSummer: Well, we know why. Because they know how problematic it is and that no one is gonna welcome this news.\tKyle: No one.\tSummer: Oh, my gosh. Oh, just wait until my mom hears about this. It is not gonna be pretty.\tPhyllis: Oh, gosh, I\u2019m embarrassed to admit this. Here it goes. Jeremy stark came to me and asked me to be part of his scheme to get to you.\tDiane: It\u2019s not surprising.\tPhyllis: Well, I told him i wanted nothing to do with it.\tDiane: You know, phyllis, there\u2019s something about this\tPhyllis: You know what? Jeremy stark scares me. He is a very, very dangerous guy. I mean, I saw in him right away what you eventually came to see. But I don\u2019t want him in any of our lives.\tDiane: Maybe you should have thought of that before you called him to begin with.\tPhyllis: You know what, you are right. My fight with you cost me so much, diane. It cost me my relationship with my kids. And I\u2019m working very, very hard to fix that and make amends. And that\u2019s why I went to summer and kyle and told them that jeremy was on his way to europe to find you. So\u2026 hey, enough of me. Enough of me. Go enjoy your dinner. Go, go, go, go. Enjoy.\tJack: Yeah.\tPhyllis: What?\tLauren: That was quite a performance.\tPhyllis: What are you talking about?\tLauren: What the hell are you up to?\tPhyllis: I\u2019m not up to anything. Really. See, I wish for diane and jack nothing but happiness.\t", "Kyle: You are engaged?\tSummer: Uh\u2026wow.\tKyle: Getting married. Did not see that coming.\tJack: I know it sounds a little out of the blue, but if you think about it, it\u2019s really not. It seemed \u2014 well, it made perfect sense to us.\tKyle: Yeah, perfect sense to you, but you have \u2014\tSummer: Is that something that you\u2019ve been thinking about for a while or \u2014\tKyle: Why didn\u2019t you say anything?\tJack: Well, I suppose the moment actually, uh, surprised me.\tDiane: Both of us.\tJack: But our relationship has been heading in that direction for some time now, and it felt right.\tKyle: Why this weekend? At the cabin? The timing is weird.\tDiane: What do you mean, kyle?\tKyle: The two of you leave town because stark has returned, to avoid whatever potential revenge he has planned, and you come back engaged? I have to ask \u2014 is this engagement because of the threat of jeremy stark?\tPhyllis: I am. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m carrying out the next phase of our plan. But it\u2019s gonna take some time. Because we need personal items of diane\u2019S. That\u2019s not gonna be easy to get. It takes maneuvering and finesse. And I feel like I need to remind you \u2014 please do not endanger my family while I\u2019m making this happen. Mr. Stark, you don\u2019t get to make threats and be impatient. I am telling you, do not hurt my family. Uh, I have to go. Alright. Bye. Bye. Hey!\tLauren: Hey, phyllis.\tPhyllis: Hey, lauren.\tNick: Hey.\tVictoria: Hi there.\tNick: What are you doing here?\tVictoria: Uh, I\u2019m just getting a little work done and having a glass of wine. Are you on your way up to see sally? How\u2019s she doing?\tNick: Uh, physically, both she and the baby are doing great.\tVictoria: \u201cPhysically\u201d?\tNick: It\u2019s a tough situation emotionally.\tVictoria: [ Sighs ] Yeah, because of adam. Whenever he gets involved, somehow it becomes more difficult.\tNick: It\u2019s been difficult the whole time. I will give adam credit, though. He seems to be behaving like an adult and respecting the rules.\tVictoria: Well, that\u2019s a first.\tNick: Sally was very explicit about what she wanted his role to be during the pregnancy.\tVictoria: Mm-hmm. And he\u2019s not using the fact that he is the father to his advantage? He\u2019s not trying to manipulate sally to suit whatever his agenda might be?\tNick: Not yet. But I\u2019m ready for anything.\tSummer: I just can\u2019t help feeling in my bones that things aren\u2019t over between you and adam yet. I sense some sort of eternal connection there, as if\u2026\tSally: What?\tAdam: As if we\u2019re meant to be.\tIt\u2019s the most wonderful\ttime of the year\tAdditional sponsorship\tprovided by\u2026\tVictoria: You know, one of the things that I love the most about you is that you have this ability to see the best in people. You have a very big heart.\tNick: You\u2019re just jealous because you don\u2019t have a heart at all.\tVictoria: [ Chuckles ] Well, maybe that\u2019s true, but not in all cases. Anyway, it comes in handy when I\u2019m dealing with certain personalities, like adam\u2019S. You know, you have to remember who he is and what he\u2019s capable of, and you cannot take him at his word.\tNick: I know. I\u2019ve been burned by it too many times.\tVictoria: Yeah, we all have. So, the fact that he is suddenly acting like a responsible, mature adult \u2014 that should be setting off alarm bells for you.\tNick: Oh, I know. They are clanging in my head loud and clear. But I appreciate the reminder, especially since I know that you would prefer it if adam and sally ended up together.\tVictoria: Well, I mean, i can\u2019t lie. They do seem like they\u2019re better suited for one another.\tNick: How so?\tVictoria: I don\u2019t know. I mean, their personalities just seem closer. Look, nicholas, I\u2019m not judging you. I\u2019m just saying, my observation when I look at sally and adam, they just seem like a more natural couple than you and her. Don\u2019t you agree?\tNick: No. But I guess I could see why you would say that.\tVictoria: Okay. Well, if that\u2019s true, then maybe you should be asking yourself, \u201cshould I be concerned?\u201d\tSally: [ Chuckles ]\tAdam: Roses. I know. Alarmingly clich\u00e9.\tSally: But still very sweet. I love some good old-fashioned romance from time to time.\tAdam: Well, good, because that is what you\u2019re gonna get with me.\tSally: Ahh. I remember when you brought me flowers on my first day as ceo of newman media.\tAdam: You didn\u2019t exactly have a classic response to those.\tSally: What, I didn\u2019t thank you?\tAdam: I think it was more along the lines of, \u201cthis is such a big risk. I don\u2019t know if I have the experience.\u201d\tSally: God, yes. I had a total freak-out. I\u2019m very sorry.\tAdam: Well, don\u2019t be. It was honest. And it was endearing.\tSally: Sure. Yeah. We\u2019re gonna go with that.\t[ Both laugh ] Look, I really appreciate how much you\u2019ve believed in me since the very beginning.\tAdam: Of course I did. Because I know you like nobody else does\u2026or ever will.\tLauren: That looked like a pretty intense phone call.\tPhyllis: Ah, no, that was nothing. Thank you.\tLauren: Thank you. Well, it sort of felt like something.\tPhyllis: Really? No.\tLauren: Yeah!\tPhyllis: I mean, I was just talking to the salon. I\u2019m trying to get a mani-pedi appointment, and they can\u2019t get me in till next week, and i just \u2014 look. Look how horrible my nails are. I need to get them done. So, that\u2019s all that was. I\u2026 hey. Thank you. Thank you for pointing out that I was intense. I really appreciated it. You know what I\u2019m gonna do? I\u2019m gonna call that salon and I\u2019m gonna apologize to them. That\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do. I\u2019ve been apologizing a lot lately.\t", "Victoria: You know tucker. He has been a bit unpredictable. I thought I knew what fueled him \u2014 to win at all costs.\tNate: Mm. You definitely understand that.\tVictoria: Well, so do you. I mean, we\u2019re both very ambitious, but it feels like tucker\u2019s taking a different path.\tNate: Hmm. So, what do we think has changed?\tVictoria: I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure, but something is definitely different. Maybe after everything he\u2019s been through, maybe he\u2019s getting a little soft.\tNate: Is that what age and life experience do to you?\tVictoria: Mm. Well, not to me, but for tucker, maybe. Or maybe he really does want to bridge the gap between him and devon. He has a grandchild now. And apparently he has a woman that he can\u2019t get off his mind.\tNate: You\u2019re talking about ashley, who bought up his debt.\tVictoria: You know, he has been pursuing her since he came back to town. Ashley \u2014 she bought up all of his debt, yes, maybe to keep him engaged, maybe to keep him under her control.\t[ Sighs ] Are they mixing what happens in the boardroom with the bedroom? I have no idea. At least, not yet. But regardless, buying up all of that debt was a very smart move on ashley\u2019s part. It was very powerful. Something that I might have done. So, if the goal is to get tucker to sell his company to us, then we have to figure out why ashley did what she did. What does she want?\tNate: Control.\tVictoria: Yes, that\u2019s a very powerful motivator. Most people crave that.\tNate: Some more than others.Just me honest about it.\tNate: Okay, um, let\u2019s try to connect the dots. Ashley is in a position to make demands of tucker. You think tucker offered to sell his company to devon. Is it logical that she\u2019d use her leverage to force him into it?\tVictoria: Logical? No. No. Why would ashley care about tucker\u2019s company or who he sells it to? Why would she work so hard to try to repair the relationship between devon and tucker? No. It\u2019s occam\u2019s razor. The simplest answer is usually the most likely. They\u2019re two very dynamic and powerful people with a passion for business and for each other.\tNate: She\u2019s testing him to see how far he would go for her.\tVictoria: Yeah.\tNate: It\u2019s a game.\tVictoria: Exactly. It\u2019s a game, one that most men, I think, enjoy playing. We\u2019re not talking about ashley and tucker anymore, are we?\tNate: We\u2019re talking about us.\tVictoria: Yeah, that\u2019s right. We are. Nate, we should just stop dancing around this. What is going on between the two of us?\tKyle: Look, I\u2026 I-I\u2019m not crazy. This engagement is impulsive, right?\tSummer: Buying a pack of gum at the register \u2014 that is impulsive.\tThis is madness.\t[ Exhales sharply ] We have thought about this being a possibility before.\tKyle: Yeah, but now it\u2019s real.\tSummer: It\u2019s a little too real. I don\u2019t know if I should tell you what I\u2019m actually thinking right now.\tKyle: Please do.\tSummer: Kyle, I\u2019m wondering if this was diane\u2019s plan all along.\tKyle: You know how diabolical she would have to be to come to town to try to marry my dad?\tSummer: Maybe it was an unconscious thing. But then again, she did lure jack to L.A. Using mysterious texts and inserted herself in his life in underhanded ways. And, honestly, what about her has been on the up-and-up? It\u2019s been secret after secret. And if you tally it all up \u2014\tKyle: No, no, no, people aren\u2019t equations. Most of the time, they\u2019re a bundle of messy emotions. You and I are examples of that.\tSummer: I\u2019m not disagreeing with you there. I am just worried that you and jack are turning a blind eye to something.\tKyle: And I\u2019m worried you\u2019re never gonna be able to let go of your suspicions and give my mother a chance.\tSummer: Are you serious right now, kyle? I have given your mom so many chances. But, no, I\u2019m not gonna ignore that they are rushing into this, and it\u2019s a red flag. Come on. You can\u2019t actually think that them getting married right now is a good idea. We both know that things are moving way too fast.\tNick: I mean, you barely let me get a word out before you had my clothes off.\t[ Chuckles ]\tSally: Are you complaining?\tNick: No. No way.\tSally: I should hope not.\tNick: No, it was [Chuckles] Amazing. Um\u2026it just seemed a little urgent. Again, not complaining. I just was wondering if there was something behind it.\tSally: Well, I thought you liked my urgency and spontaneity.\tNick: I do so much. Don\u2019t stop.\tSally: [ Chuckles ]\tNick: I guess I\u2019m talking more about the look that was in your eye when I first got here.\tSally: What do you think you saw?\tNick: [ Stammers ] I don\u2019t know, uh\u2026like maybe you were trying to lose yourself in the sex or something. Is\u2026 is there something going on i should know?\tSally: [ Sighs ]\t[ Inhales sharply ] Ohh. You\u2019re right. There is something. She found it.\tSally: [ Sighs ] Yes. Something has been bothering me.\tNick: Tell me.\tSally: It\u2019s summer.\tNick: I\u2019m so sorry that you have to deal with that. I\u2019m gonna talk to her again and just make sure she fully gets it. That you and I are good together.\t"], "answer": [3, 0, 1, 4, 2]}
{"content": ["Ashley: And you did the same thing with diane, jack.\tJack: Diane and I are getting married! This game you\u2019re playing and tucker lives under our roof and stays in a guest room, that\u2019s so you can control him. You keep him at a distance, but you can still influence things.\tAshley: Okay. You know what? I don\u2019t have to listen to this\u2013\tJack: No, wait, listen to me.\tAshley: What?\tJack: Listen, I know what you\u2019re feeling because I felt it myself when I was falling back in love with diane. I didn\u2019t want to get hurt. I didn\u2019t want to trust that the change I saw in her was real. I know what\u2019s happening to you because it happened to me.\tAshley: Okay. If you understand that, then why is it okay for you but not for me?\tJack: Because tucker hasn\u2019t changed. He is the same manipulative operator he has always been.\tAshley: Okay, but diane, who\u2019s actually charged with killing another human being is a brand new woman. Just look at yourself. You\u2019re exhausted. All you do is deal with diane and her issues. She\u2019s turned you into somebody I don\u2019t even know anymore, jack. But you\u2019re making better choices than me. You can take your psych 101 crap and shove it.\tJack: Hey, wait. Your armor\u2019s already up again. You can\u2019t even be vulnerable with me. The way you\u2019re acting, you could never trust tucker, or anybody else for that matter. And you know what? That gives me an advantage over you. I have something you don\u2019t\u2013 the ability to open my heart. To let someone in, to trust. Don\u2019t pity me too much. Save some for yourself.\t[ Door slamming ]\tTucker: Okay, truth time. Uh, no offense, but I don\u2019t think you have it in you to have killed phyllis.\tDiane: Gee, thanks. None taken.\tTucker: But here\u2019s the reality. There\u2019s plenty of proof to convict you. And your past is going to enter that courtroom for sure. Your fake death, the way deacon sharpe helped you frame everyone in town. Everyone you\u2019ve ever crossed is gonna hate you all over again, which is gonna make the proof look even worse.\tDiane: Thanks for trying to cheer me up, tucker.\tTucker: I\u2019m trying to help you. This trial will force jack and kyle to live through everything you did to them, all over again. And this time you can add summer and harrison as collateral damage. And how long before this destroys kyle and summer\u2019s marriage? Do you want to be responsible for that? Poor jack. He is going to be crushed when you\u2019re facing life in prison.\tDiane: [ Scoffs ] This is the worst pep talk ever.\tTucker: You don\u2019t need a cheerleader, diane. You need a way out of here. I can give you that.\tSally: This baby is exactly who I\u2019m thinking about. She is the only reason why I\u2019m considering adam\u2019s offer. And like I said, I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m gonna do, but I have a child to support.\tNick: Your baby will be very well taken care of as a newman.\tSally: This baby is a spectra, and making sure that she\u2019s provided for is my sole purpose now. And I\u2019m not just talking about some job. I need to assure that I have a career. That is important to me. It is a part of my identity and I want to be a strong role model for my daughter.\tNick: You will be. Sally, you are, you don\u2019t need a job from adam to prove that.\tSally: Adam and I worked well together. And I am perfectly capable of being able to separate the professional from the personal.\tNick: Well, you may be, but adam isn\u2019T.\tSally: I need something career-wise, and maybe this isn\u2019t it, but maybe it is. I just need the sense of purpose that comes from having a profession. I have had one failure after another and I don\u2019t know, maybe this is the chance for me to get back in the game.\tNick: And that is exactly what adam wants you to think. Sally, you may not want to hear this, but I\u2019m gonna say it anyway. If you go and work for adam, it\u2019ll be one of the biggest mistakes of your life. Are you tired of clean clothes that just don\u2019t smell clean?\t\u201cThe young and the restless\u201d will continue. (Buzz) are you guys telling secrets?\tSally: I didn\u2019t ask for your opinion, nick. In fact, I asked you not to rush to judgment.\tNick: I\u2019m not rushing into anything, all right? I speak from years of experience.\tSally: Okay. Well, then maybe I should\u2019ve also added, please don\u2019t insult me by assuming that I can\u2019t read the situation without your insights into how the newman mind works. I\u2019m becoming an expert and it\u2019s not as complicated as you all might think. It\u2019s all about ego and power.\tNick: Do not lump me in with adam and dad. Look, I\u2019m telling you, if you go and work for adam, he\u2019s gonna chip away at every boundary you set until you have nothing.\tSally: I\u2019m not naive to adam\u2019s motivations. Please give me some credit. Look, I have somewhere to be.\tNick: Please don\u2019t go.\tSally: We will talk about this later.\t[ Sighing ]\tChance: Everything good?\tDaniel: Obviously not, given the circumstances.\tChance: You know, I\u2019ve seen a lot of families pull together after a traumatic loss like this. But I have also seen a lot fall apart. And I really hope that you and summer can find some way to lean on each other.\tDaniel: That\u2019s a struggle. Um, so, diane\u2019s out on bail. You know when her trial\u2019s gonna be? It looks like there\u2019s a lot of evidence against her and\u2013 think she\u2019ll be convicted?\t", "Jack: Ash, I am too tired to do this with you. Could we just put a pin in this fight over diane and talk to each other? You\u2019re my sister. I care a great deal about you and I\u2013 I\u2013 I miss you.\tAshley: Okay. Okay. I have a couple of minutes, sure.\tJack: Okay.\tAshley: So, what did you want to discuss?\tJack: I want to talk about us, about this. This tension, I hate it.\tAshley: I don\u2019t like it very much either, jack.\tJack: Look, I know diane is not your favorite person, but are you really this bitter and angry?\tAshley: I am, unfortunately.\tJack: I don\u2019t buy that.\tAshley: Well, do you want to tell me how I\u2019m feeling?\tJack: I think you\u2019re using me and diane as a punching bag to avoid some realities in your own life.\tAshley: Okay. So, what am I avoiding exactly?\tJack: The possibility that you are not as tough and in control of your life as you pretend to be. I think these attacks are defensive. I think it\u2019s about self-preservation. I think you\u2019re trying to avoid feelings that you have for tucker that you know you shouldn\u2019t have.\t[ Diane breathing deeply ]\t[ Footsteps approaching ]\tTucker: Hi.\t[ Diane sighs ] You must miss the jailyard, huh? You want to lift some weights or should we have a knife fight?\t[ Diane scoffs ]\tDiane: You know what I love most about this house? How spacious it is. Don\u2019t you have somewhere else you could be?\tTucker: I gotta give you credit. You\u2019re back to the old diane, you know? Tenacious nerves of steel. Although, I\u2019m amazed you\u2019re willing to take this chance.\tDiane: You know, clearly you\u2019re looking to bother me with this conversation. So, why don\u2019t you go ahead and say what you want to say so I can go back to enjoying some fresh air and sunshine? Hmm? Hey, go ahead. You got my attention.\tDaniel: How can you accept all of sharon\u2019s sympathy and kindness? It\u2019s like every second you stood there, it was like another lie.\tSummer: Oh, my\u2013 why are you being like this?\tDaniel: Like what?\tSummer: So self-righteous. I hate this as much as you do. Probably even more. But you\u2013 you seem to think that there\u2019s one clear answer: Save diane.\tDaniel: And you want to send your husband\u2019s mother to prison for a crime she didn\u2019t commit. How is that the solution?\tSummer: Oh\u2013 that\u2019s not what I want. And I think you know that. But you weren\u2019t there when mom came to me. You didn\u2019t hear directly from her the hell that she\u2019s been going through.\tDaniel: That\u2019s one of her own creation.\t[ Summer scoffs ]\tSummer: That right there. That judgment. Mom was completely terrified and she didn\u2019t come to you \u2019cause she knew that you wouldn\u2019t look out for her. And I really thought that she was wrong, but clearly, I made a mistake in telling you. I should\u2019ve listened to mom.\tDaniel: Don\u2019t you\u2013 don\u2019t you dare tell me that I don\u2019t care about what happens to our mother. You know she called me, too? Trelegy for copd.\tDaniel: I got a mysterious phone call last night. The person on the other end didn\u2019t speak. But I\u2013 I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that it was mom trying to reach out to me.\tSummer: You\u2019re sure that it was her?\tDaniel: No, summer. That is the whole point. I mean, it could\u2019ve been a wrong number. It could\u2019ve been a total stranger that I\u2013 I\u2019m talking to like it\u2013 it\u2019s our dead mother. Or it could\u2019ve been someone we know who\u2019s wondering why I\u2019m talking to our dead mother. I mean, don\u2019t you see that this is driving us both crazy?\tSummer: Look, I told you that I just need time. I\u2019m trying to figure this out. I\u2019m trying to learn all the evidence that they have in stark\u2019s murder. And I\u2019m researching what the burden of proof would be for self-defense.\tDaniel: Are you gonna get a law degree? Are you gonna become a homicide detective?\tSummer: Daniel, I\u2019m struggling here. I\u2019m trying to help our mom and I\u2019m scared for her. God.\tDaniel: Listen, the longer we wait, the worse this is gonna be for her and for everyone else. I mean, don\u2019t you see what this is doing to us?\tSummer: I hate it, too.\tDaniel: [ Scoffs ] You know, meanwhile, I\u2019m wondering if she\u2019s halfway around the world somewhere, living a new life, while she\u2019s reveling in the fact that diane\u2019s being convicted for a murder that she didn\u2019t commit.\tSummer: No, mom\u2019s focus is on getting back to us. But she can\u2019t do that if you blow this open. And if you tell kyle and he realizes that I knew, you\u2019re gonna blow up my marriage, too. How can you not see that?\tJack: I think you have real feelings for tucker. I think he has reawakened the flame that the two of you shared together and that makes you feel vulnerable and I know that\u2019s terrifying for you.\tAshley oh, don\u2019t stop. I love that you\u2019re an expert on my feelings. Please keep going.\tJack: I know you longer than anyone on this earth, ashley. Think about this. Every time you told me to stay away from diane, to not get involved again, you used yourself as an example. You were better than I was because you knew not to get involved with tucker. And here we are, he\u2019s now invited into our home.\t", "Chance: Look, I\u2019ll, uh\u2013 I\u2019ll be honest with you, man. I don\u2019t think that diane acted alone.\tDaniel: So, there are other people of interest? Are there any leads that you\u2019re following that could exonerate diane?\tChance: Look, I can\u2019t make you any promises, but even if we were to find that accomplice, with the case being so strong against diane, I am very confident that there will be justice for your mother\u2019s murder.\tTucker: You know how to disappear. You\u2019ve done it before. I can give you anything you want. Money, I.D., Anything stark did to set you up with a new life, I can do. Only with no strings attached.\tDiane: [ Scoffs ] You\u2019d like that, wouldn\u2019t you? Or should I say ashley would like that? And then she might invite you into her bed instead of relegating you to the guest room.\t[ Chuckles ]\tTucker: I\u2019m talking about what you want, diane.\t[ Diane sighing ] I know how much you care about jack and kyle. You worked so hard to redeem yourself with them, to rebuild your relationship with them, right?\tDiane: That\u2019s right.\tTucker: That\u2019s right. I can relate to that.\t[ Laughs softly] I admire it, even. I know what you\u2019ve got to lose here. Can you deny what watching you get convicted will do to jack and kyle, the whole family? You really want to put them through that?\tDiane: Thank you for your consideration, tucker. This conversation\u2019s over.\tChloe: What is this important offer I had to rush over to discuss? Please tell me, did jill reconsider and I get to go buy all those desk lamps because we scored our first big fish client?\tSally: Unfortunately, no change of heart from jill.\tChloe: Okay. So, what has changed since we last saw each other?\tSally: I was offered a job.\tChloe: What? Where?\tSally: With adam. But before you say anything\u2013\tChloe: Absolutely not. No, no, you are not going to dump our plans just so he can suck you back into a black hole. No way.\tSally: Okay, that\u2019s basically what nick said. But look, this is not just an offer for me, okay? It\u2019s for both of us. Adam made me a blanket offer: Craft the job you want with the people that you want, and that includes my business partner.\tChloe: How did nick not talk you out of this?\tSally: He tried, but it\u2019s not his decision to make.\tChloe: So, he obviously thinks it\u2019s a bad idea. And I couldn\u2019t agree more.\tSally: So, you hate adam so much that you\u2019re ready to ignore an opportunity like this?\tChloe: Yes.\tSally: But we worked with him before.\tChloe: And it was excruciating.\tSally: Okay, look, I-it\u2019s just an option, okay? I\u2013 I haven\u2019t agreed to anything.\tChloe: So, if you are willing to consider a job from adam, then will you revisit nick\u2019s offer to invest?\tSally: You know how I feel about that.\tChloe: How could you choose a business partnership with adam over nick? It just doesn\u2019t make sense.\tSally: Okay, stop, okay? I\u2019m tired of everyone thinking that they know better than me about my own life. So I didn\u2019t think I needed swiffer.\tChloe: You\u2019ve obviously got to do whatever\u2019s best for you. But remember what it was like in the early days, working for adam at newman fashion.\tSally: Yeah, but, I mean, that was a lifetime ago, and things were complicated with chelsea then. I mean, that was a dynamic that was never gonna work. And that was before I proved myself as C.O.O. And C.E.O. Of newman.\tChloe: And that was before you got into a love affair with adam that went horribly awry. And now you\u2019re going to be in a lifetime commitment of co-parenting with him. Do you really want the extra complications of working with him, too?\tSally: I mean, of course, I would love something cleaner. But I have to start dealing with the reality that I need to provide for my daughter.\tChloe: So, you\u2019re just going to abandon our plans because jill decided to put things on hold?\tSally: I\u2019m doing my due diligence of talking to you about a prospect for both of us.\tChloe: Okay. Well, then I\u2019m gonna tell you where I stand. I don\u2019t want to work for adam again. I don\u2019t want my income to be dependent on his moods. And when he realizes that he can\u2019t get in between you and nick, I don\u2019t want to find us out the door again.\tSally: You\u2019re right.\tChloe: And?\tSally: I hate that.\t[ Objects clattering ]\t[ Groans ]\tChloe: All right. Well, you know what? You are right about one thing. This is your life. You know what\u2019s best for yours and I know what\u2019s best for mine. And that is not working for adam again. So, you can do whatever you want. But if you choose to accept this offer\u2026you\u2019ll be accepting it solo. Just\u2013 just take a deep breath. Okay? And just really think about what you want. Freedom or to be tied to adam in every way possible?\t[ Door slamming ]\tNick: Hey, what the hell are you thinking?\tAdam: Uh, that it\u2019s a beautiful day.\tNick: Didn\u2019t waste any time accepting dad\u2019s offer to run mccall, huh?\tAdam: Well, it was too good an offer to pass it up. I mean, what\u2019s the problem? I thought you were all for it. It keeps me away from newman.\tNick: Is, uh, running mccall\u2013 does it have anything to do with business, or are you just doing it to get sally back into your life?\tAdam: Okay. So, this is about sally?\tNick: She told me about your offer, to lure her to mccall. Whatever she wants, as long as she works for you.\t", "Daniel: Can we meet?\t[ Sighs ]\tSharon: Summer, you\u2019re not leaving already, are you?\tSummer: I\u2013 I forgot I have something that I really need to take care of.\tSharon: Well, wait, let me get you a cup of coffee first, or a hug.\t[ Sighs ]\tAshley: Thanks for the break. I should get back to work.\tTucker: Hold on. Not until you\u2019ve told me why you\u2019ve been distracted this whole time. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve grown inured to my charms.\tAshley: Is that even humanly possible?\tTucker: No.\tAshley: It\u2019s her.\tTucker: Oh, diane?\tAshley: Of course. How did this happen? How is she out on bail and living with us?\tTucker: Karmic payback for something we did in our past life, or this one? Hard to say.\tAshley: You know, I don\u2019t understand. Jack and kyle think she\u2019s so wonderful. They think she\u2019s a saint after everything that she\u2019s done to them and now she\u2019s charged with murder. It doesn\u2019t matter. How does she pull this off?\tTucker: She\u2019s a master manipulator. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re so upset about it.\tAshley: How could I not be upset? Jack thinks I\u2019m unreasonable because I have qualms about sharing a home with somebody who\u2019s been accused of murder. She can\u2019t go anywhere because of her ankle monitor. I\u2019m stuck with her. God, then she\u2019s driven this huge wedge between jack and me.\tTucker: How does any judge allow a flight risk like diane out on bail? The woman knows how to disappear.\tAshley: [ Sighs] I wish she\u2019d do it again.\tSally: [ Groans] There, are you satisfied? Can I get back to work now?\t[ Phone ringing ]\t[ Sighs ] Hello.\tAdam: Sally, great news. Mccall is officially all mine.\tSally: Congratulations.\tAdam: Victor agreed to my terms. No meddling. I have complete autonomy, which includes all staffing decisions.\tSally: Well, I still haven\u2019t had a chance to\u2013\tAdam: Yeah, I know that you wanted some time to think it over and I\u2019m not trying to pressure you. But I have been digging into the mess that tucker made and I am eager to get my team in place. There\u2019s so much to do and I think that you\u2019re gonna be as excited by the challenge as I am.\tSally: Well, I have to talk to chloe before I can get back to you about the offer.\tAdam: This could be a real opportunity for us to turn a total failure into a major success.\tSally: Okay. I will let you know.\tNick: Sounds like good news. Let me guess, jill loved your pitch and is ready to offer you a lucrative contract.\tSally: Not quite. I need to talk to you about something.\tNick: Okay.\tSally: But I need you to promise me to hear me out and not rush to judgment.\tNick: What\u2019s going on? She\u2019s feeling the power of listerine.\tAdditional sponsorship provided by\u2026\tTucker: I realize that having diane under the same roof is a nightmare for you, but let\u2019s not forget that you also invited me into your home.\tAshley: I know, I\u2019m partially to blame for the tension.\tTucker: No, no, no, no, no.\tAshley: I get it.\tTucker: No, what I\u2019m saying is while I\u2019m there, it will be my mission to distract you with more, uh, pleasurable thoughts.\tAshley: Oh. Well, I like that. It\u2019s not good for me to be so angry all the time.\tTucker: No, it isn\u2019T. And if it\u2019s any consolation, I\u2019m gonna do my best to make sure that diane\u2019s stay is as unpleasant for her as possible.\tAshley: Okay.\tAdam: Ashley.\t[ Ashley groans ]\tAdam: How are you?\tAshley: Good.\tAdam: Tucker.

I\u2019m now in charge of trying to salvage your failed company.\tTucker: I did hear that. I\u2013 I heard that victor intended to hand it over to you, as a bailout for your failures at jabot and newman.\tAdam: [ Chuckles ] Uh, actually, victor knew that I wanted a challenge. It\u2019s kind of hard to know what to tackle first. I mean, the mismanaged books and the exodus of any talented staff you once had, or just the terrible mccall name. I mean, can I ask you a serious question? How did you let things get so bad?\tAshley: I think he was busy becoming a better person, adam, and got a little distracted. Didn\u2019t notice that incompetence had kind of run into the ground.\tAdam: Mm. Well, self-improvement can be a burden.\tAshley: How would you know?\tAdam: Uh, luckily, I understand the value of a work-life balance. Although that\u2013 that\u2019s gonna be put to the test trying to make this company better.\tAshley: Ooh, that\u2019s hilarious. You should be so grateful that you are allowed to run anything bigger than a lemonade stand.\tAdam: Oh, it\u2019s gonna be fun\u2013\tAshley: Mm-hmm.\tAdam: \u2014 Turning this into a major success, something much bigger than you could\u2019ve ever imagined.\t", "Tucker: I hope it flourishes.

You\u2019ve reached enlightenment.\t[ Ashley sucking on straw ] Was that before or after my father paid the, uh, inflated price for your broken company?\tAshley: [ Sighs ] Bye, adam.\tAdam: Have a nice lunch.\tAshley: [ Whispers ] How did you not just punch him in the face?\tTucker: It\u2019s just mesmerizing watching you come to my defense like that. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m\u2013 if I\u2019m just moved or a little bit turned on right now.\tAshley: Really?\tTucker: Mm-hmm.\tAshley: I\u2019m frustrated that the adams and the dianes of the world are actually failing upwards.\tTucker: Right here.\tAshley: What are you doing?\tTucker: You can say whatever you want. I\u2019m starting to believe that you actually care for me.\tAshley: Um\u2026\tSharon: It\u2019s good to see you out and about. Nick said that you\u2019ve been spending a lot of your time alone and you haven\u2019t replied to his texts or calls. He\u2019s worried about you.\tSummer: Uh, yeah, I\u2019ve just been trying to conserve my energy for harrison. Trying to keep things as normal as possible for him, which is a challenge.\tSharon: I get wanting to conserve your energy right now. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to go through this alone. You know, there are plenty of people who love you and understand what you\u2019re going through. The grief, the shock, the pain, the anger, whatever it is that you\u2019re feeling, it\u2019s perfectly normal under these circumstances. Just know there is a community of people here for you every step of the way.\tSummer: Yeah. To be honest, sharon, I mean, all the support, it\u2019s actually just making me feel like I need to take care of other people\u2019s feelings about my well-being. And it\u2019s just easier to be alone. So, thank you for the hug and for the coffee. I promise I will answer my dad.\tDaniel: Excuse me. Um, sorry, I need to talk to my sister, please?\tSally: Uh, I was hoping to have some more time to think this through, but now it seems I have to make a decision sooner than I thought.\tNick: Well, I\u2019m ready to be a sounding board.\tSally: So, chloe and I got some not-great news. Jill does not want to lock us into a contract. Maybe down the road, but not right now.\tNick: Really? That is surprising. I thought you had a killer pitch and you guys were gonna close that deal today.\tSally: Yeah, I mean, I thought it was gonna happen, too, but jill delivered the bad news before we even had a chance to present our newest plans.\tNick: Okay. Uh, good news delayed.\tSally: Yeah. I mean, it could still happen, but that would mean hoping for a maybe as opposed to betting on a sure thing.\tNick: You can\u2019t knock a sure thing.\tSally: Right. Which is exactly why I\u2019m giving this serious consideration.\tNick: Does this mean you\u2019re ready to take me up on my proposal to invest in your business? Because, sally, I would love to partner with you on this.\tSally: [ Laughs softly ] Um, it\u2019s actually about another opportunity.\tNick: Why are you being cagey?\tSally: Because it would mean working at mccall. For adam.\tWhen moderate to severe\tulcerative colitis\tNick: Are you actually considering taking the job?\tSally: Well, I have to make a living, so\u2026 yeah.\tNick: But my offer to help you set up your own business was met with a resounding no. But you\u2019re willing to go and work with adam at this company my father bought for him? In what capacity?\tSally: I don\u2019t know, adam didn\u2019t go into details. And like I said, I don\u2019t even know how I feel about it. I thought I was gonna have more time to think this through, but that was adam on the phone and he\u2019s eager to get his team in place.\tNick: Yeah, this is clearly his way to insinuate himself back into your life. He saw an opportunity and boom, there you go. I mean, he will do whatever it takes to stay close to you.\tSally: Right. Because it couldn\u2019t possibly be about my skill set you know, I did a pretty great job as C.O.O. And C.E.O. Of newman. So, maybe adam recognizes that?\tNick: That\u2019s why i wanted to invest in you. That\u2019s why I fought so hard for you to stay at newman. Why I went to bat to get you that second meeting with jill, because I believe in your talent. That\u2019s why I advocate for you every day.\tSally: Right. Unless it involves working with adam.\tNick: Look, he just\u2013 he always has an agenda. He and my father are alike in that way. You\u2019re kidding yourself if you don\u2019t think my father\u2019s gonna have a hand in everything that goes on there.\tSally: He\u2019s giving adam carte blanche to run it the way that he wants.\tNick: Is that what he told you? Sally, he bought that company so he could get adam back under control. I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re walking into a minefield. This is my dad and adam trying to exert control over you, and you and your baby don\u2019t need that.\tAshley: Oh, well, hello. Are you gonna try to kick me out of the office, too?\tJack: No, I just came to pick up some work to take home.\tAshley: Of course, because the woman who\u2019s in lockdown must be kept company at all costs.\t"], "answer": [3, 4, 1, 0, 2]}
{"content": ["Abby: And what are those reasons?\tDevon: Oh, just the safety-net argument. You know, in case things don\u2019t go well with this lawsuit and getting back hamilton-winters, obviously getting the company back is my priority. But I have to be smart. You know? And I have to consider whether there\u2019s a benefit to rebuilding a company with tucker.\tAbby: Look, I know that i have been the one that was kind of pushing this whole mccall-tucker thing, but, honestly, I-I don\u2019t know if I can fully trust tucker, and I would never want you to get burned again.\tDevon: We did riff off each other pretty well when we were talking about our ideas for fixing the company.\tAbby: Okay, well, I guess it\u2019s great to be on the same page as the person running the company before you, but it\u2019s not like you would be moving forward, working together. I mean\u2026\tDevon: Well, there\u2019s another element to this whole thing. He said that if I were to buy the company, he\u2019d want to come on and take an advisory role and report to me.\tAbby: Wait, so, he would want to take a lesser position?\tDevon: Mm-hmm.\tAbby: How do you feel about that?\tDevon: It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s probably a sign that he\u2019s being honest about wanting to actually fix things between us, \u2019cause I know he doesn\u2019t like to take orders from anybody.\tAbby: Yeah, agreed. That\u2019s true. Um, I guess it shows that he\u2019s trying to form a connection. But I mean, that\u2019s if we are giving him the benefit of the doubt.\tDevon: Right. And should we?\tAdam: You obviously don\u2019t have your ears as low to the ground as I do. Um, [Inhales deeply] I\u2019m actually no longer at jabot.\tTucker: No, I know that. Ashley told me you underperformed your way out the door there.\tAdam: It wasn\u2019t a good fit.\tTucker: The c-suite press-release lingo. Did you also quit to spend more time with family?\t[ Chuckles ] Of course, that doesn\u2019t track, because your family can\u2019t stand you.\tAdam: No, victoria, dad, and I \u2014 we have our issues, but, uh, at the end of the day, we\u2019re family. And we always will be.\tTucker: Mm-hmm.\tAdam: I know you can understand that, with everything that\u2019s going on with devon.\tTucker: Indeed, I can. Father-son relationships are, uh, huh, complicated. Yeah.\tAdam: Yeah, that\u2019s the thing about victor me, is we \u2014 we understand each other on a cellular level because we are so much alike.\tTucker: Yeah. Yeah, you are. You\u2019re both miserable, ruthless.\tAdam: See, you, on the other hand, you are nothing like devon. You know, him being principled, thoughtful.\tTucker: [ Chuckles ]\tAdam: Yeah, you really botched that relationship. It sounds like he doesn\u2019t want anything to do with you, including acquiring mccall. Which means I might actually end up being the ceo of your empire.\t[ Slaps bar top ] We should drink to that.\tTucker: Adam\u2026\t[Sighs] Over my dead body will you ever have anything to do with my company.\tNate: [ Sighs ]\t[ Lock rattles ]\tVictoria: [ Sighs ] I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.

I just didn\u2019t want to be rude and not respond at all.\tVictoria: Oh. So, instead, you decided to come here in person and tell me to my face that you\u2019re not interested.\tNate: You know full well I\u2019m interested. And that is the problem. I\u2019m already in two committed relationships, okay? One with elena, and the other with newman media. And I\u2019m not about to screw up either one. For copd, ask your doctor about breztri.\tVictoria: [ Inhales deeply ] Do you want to sit down and talk?\tNate: [ Sighs ]\tVictoria: Oh, of course. Okay, well, both feet on the ground at all times.\t[ Chuckles ] This isn\u2019t exactly great for a girl\u2019s confidence.\tNate: As much as I\u2019d like to throw caution to the wind \u2014 and trust me, part of me wants to more than you know \u2014 there\u2019s a logical side of me that\u2019s holding me back. Okay? Not only because I\u2019m in a relationship with a woman I care about, but I would hate for this amazing connection we have at work to somehow be tarnished. I\u2019m happier at newman than I\u2019ve been in a long time.\tVictoria: Does some of that happiness have to do with me?\tNate: Of course. I love working with you. You\u2019re a great boss, great leader, a true visionary.\tVictoria: That\u2019s it?\t[ Chuckles ] You know, the same could be said for my father.\tNate: [ Chuckles ] You look better in a dress.\tVictoria: [ Chuckles ]\tNate: [ Chuckles ] Obviously, there are, um, other physical feelings. A lot of desire.\tVictoria: How much desire?\tNate: So much\u2026 desire. But I have to rise above it, okay? We both do, for the sake of our working relationship. I\u2019m sorry if you disagree or you think this makes things untenable for you, but I definitely think it would make things untenable if we act on our feelings. I hope you\u2019re not insulted.\tVictoria: I\u2019m not. And I think your earnestness makes you even more attractive.\t[ Inhales deeply ] You should probably go.\t[ Sighs ] I\u2019m gonna just enjoy my little nightcap alone.\tNate: Are we okay?\tVictoria: Yes, of course we\u2019re okay. I\u2019ll see you at the office tomorrow.\tNate: [ Sighs ]\tAdam: So, when you sell mccall to newman, victor, um, intends to install me as ceo.\tTucker: Hmm. Well, in that case, it\u2019s a good thing I have no intention of selling to newman\u2026\tAdam: Hmm.\tTucker: \u2026\u2019Cause having you at the helm would be a surefire way to run it into the ground. And your intel about my relationship with devon is old news. I don\u2019t know what wild promises your father is making to you, but you should know better than to fall for them. The scenario you described is absolutely never going to happen.\tAdam: Hmm.\t", "Tucker: So I would tell him and your sister to just move on.\tAdam: Well, your deal with devon isn\u2019t done yet. And there\u2019s two things that I know about my family. One, they don\u2019t give up and just walk away. And two, everyone has their price. And the newmans will pay that price.\tNick: Well, look at this. You boys love to hear yourselves talk so much, I\u2019m surprised there\u2019s any oxygen left in the room.\tTucker: What is this, a newman convention?\tNick: Just came for some takeout. Not interested at all in whatever this is.\tAdam: Well, tucker was just throwing down the gauntlet, saying that newman enterprises will never get its hands on mccall unlimited, which kind of sounds like the opening of a negotiation to me. So, you know, what would it take for you to change your mind?\tTucker: Hmm. Well, devon means everything to me. And you \u2014 you mean less than nothing. So\u2026 how\u2019s that for negotiation? Thanks for the drink. Okay?\tNick: Well, there you go. You got your answer straight from the man himself. He\u2019s never going to let newman buy mccall. Are you ready to let this go yet?\tAbby: Well, you have a lot to think about.\tDevon: Hmm.\tAbby: Hmm. And I love being your sounding board, but I should probably take dominic and head home.\tDevon: Take dominic?\tAbby: Mm-hmm.\tDevon: Why you gonna do that? He\u2019s asleep. You don\u2019t want to wake him up.\tAbby: Well, I guess I could leave him here and come get him in the morning.\tDevon: I have a better idea. How about you just don\u2019t go home.\tAbby: Hmm, but I have to get up very early in the morning.\tDevon: Oh, then I can wake you up very early in the morning.\tAbby: Can you?\tDevon: I can.\tAbby: [ Chuckles ]\tDevon: And you just had wine. You don\u2019t need to be driving anywhere.\tAbby: Oh, is that what you were thinking when you poured me that glass?\tDevon: No. No. No, not at all. And I have so much on my mind, you know I\u2019m gonna be lousy company for myself. I\u2019m not gonna get any rest.\tAbby: Are you suggesting that I put you to sleep?\tDevon: Well, that depends on if you think you\u2019re up to that.\tAbby: I am always up to that.\tDevon: You are?\tAbby: Mm-hmm.\tDevon: Hmm. Then be my guest.\tAbby: Hmm.\t[ Chuckles ]\tIf you, like many people,\tAdam: It\u2019s going to take more than tucker walking out of here, pouting, for me to give up on mccall. We just have to make sure that devon does not accept his offer.\tNick: Tucker wants devon to have the company. Tucker usually gets what he wants. And well, it might be harder for him to win back his son than he thinks. And if there\u2019s one thing that I know, it\u2019s how to work the angles on a fractured father-son relationship.\tNick: [ Sighs ] Look, adam, even if devon wasn\u2019t in the picture, it\u2019s tucker\u2019s call to make. What makes you think he\u2019s going to sell mccall to newman? I mean, he clearly doesn\u2019t want you anywhere near that ceo chair.\tAdam: Yeah, but victor does. And tucker is no match for our father.\tNick: Well, that may be, but you know who is? Victoria.\tAdam: Okay, well, she\u2019s not gonna come out on top on this one.\tNick: [ Sighs ] You know the reason you and vick don\u2019t get along? Because you\u2019re too much like dad. You\u2019re both willing to fight tooth and nail for this acquisition, and then you will tear each other apart.\tAdam: Yeah. I mean, so what? It \u2014 it\u2019s our normal.\tNick: Mnh-mnh. It\u2019s weird and it\u2019s toxic, and you guys need hobbies. And I have no interest in being a part of another newman family drama. It\u2019s why I\u2019m working so hard to keep things civil between you and me when it comes to sally and the baby.\tAdam: I appreciate that.\tNick: Okay. So is there any chance you could let go of this dream of running tucker\u2019s company? Adam, you can do whatever you want. You have several high-profile options. Start your own damn company. The world is your oyster. Why does it have to be tucker\u2019s company that will satisfy you?\tAdam: Because now I have a reason to fight for it. I have a baby on the way, and i want to leave a legacy behind \u2014 a newman legacy for both of my children.\t[ Sighs ]\tAudra: Nate.\tNate: Hey.\tAudra: What are you doing here? I thought you had a date night with elena.\tNate: She had a long day, so it was an early evening.\tAudra: Listen, I still feel terrible if I caused any misunderstanding between the two of you. If there\u2019s anything I can do \u2014\tNate: There\u2019s not. I cleared it up with elena.\tAudra: Oh. I\u2019m glad. Uh, then what are you doing here now and not at home?\tNate: I just had a restless night.\tAudra: Then, definitely, the thing you need is coffee. Why don\u2019t you join me?\tNate: Look, I still have a ton of work to do at home. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here, to fuel up.\tAudra: Okay, no worries. See you tomorrow. Did you see victoria this evening?\tNate: Why do you ask?\tVictor: Hello, son. Sit down. Now, you made it sound urgent on the phone.\tAdam: Yeah, well, I wanted to talk to you before morning. I, um, ran into tucker tonight.\tVictor: Hmm.\tAdam: And he seemed awfully determined to make a deal with devon.\tVictor: Well, what tucker wants and what he thinks devon will do \u2014 you know, two different things. Okay? Victoria tells me that she had a conversation with devon, who informed her that he wanted nothing to do with his father.\tAdam: Okay, well, then maybe something has changed. I mean, tucker seemed pretty confident, pretty adamant that he could get devon to make him an offer.\tVictor: Listen, tucker mccall has always been full of confidence. He\u2019s been full of bull.\tAdam: I just \u2014 I-I think mccall is gonna be an uphill battle, but I don\u2019t want to let it go. Okay? I\u2019ve gotten pretty excited about this idea.\t", "Nate: [ Sighs ]\tNate: Trust me, the only thing that\u2019s going on between me and victoria is business. I admire her, the way her mind works, her business acumen. Look, I am learning a lot from her, and I won\u2019t deny that we work well together. I-I don\u2019t understand why we have to go through this again.\t[ Cellphone touches bar top ]\tVictoria: Right now I need as much information as possible so that I can make my move, \u2019cause information is power. And power \u2014 power is control.\tNate: And you like having control.\tVictoria: It\u2019s every bit as important to me as money, if not more so.\tNate: [ Breathing heavily ]\tNate: [ Sighs ]\t[ Sighs ]\t[ Elevator door closes ]\t[ Footsteps approaching ]\tTucker: Adam.\tAdam: Hey.\tTucker: [ Grunts ]\tAdam: Hey. Um, can I buy you a drink?\tTucker: Hmm, it\u2019s an interesting offer.\tAdam: It is? I, um \u2014 I didn\u2019t mean it to be interesting. I just, uh, wanted somebody to drink with, you know.\tTucker: Actually on the upswing these days. If you\u2019re looking for someone to commiserate with, you got the wrong guy.\tAdam: Do you want a drink or not?\tTucker: Uh, I\u2019ll have a bourbon, neat, please. Thanks.\tAdam: So, is, uh, one of the things on the upswing you selling mccall?\tTucker: [ Sighs ] You\u2019re not much of a small talker, are you?\tAdam: Well, word on the street is, your company is for sale.\tTucker: Word on the street? Ah. You and I must be hanging out on different streets. Where\u2019d you hear that? Thank you.\tAdam: Well, you know, I keep my, uh, ear to the ground.\tTucker: Hmm. Your sister and dad told you, right? I didn\u2019t know you were in the newman inner circle these days.\tAdam: Yeah, we\u2019re, um \u2014 we\u2019re tight. We\u2019re \u2014 we actually, um \u2014 we\u2019ve never been closer.\tTucker: Hmm. I\u2019m sure. You relish your role as the black sheep of the family, don\u2019t you? Having plunged a dagger into your dad\u2019s heart by going to work for jack abbott, I can\u2019t imagine that put you on his good side. Frankly, everyone knows victoria\u2019s distaste for you. So, honestly, where did you hear this?\tDevon: Thank you so much for getting this food. I didn\u2019t realize how hungry I was.\tAbby: I didn\u2019t want you to starve to death. I know you. And I know that you\u2019re not gonna take a break, so I had to come over here and force you to take one with just a few of your favorite things.\tDevon: Hmm. Are you talking about you and dominic?\tAbby: Well, I was referring to the empanadas, but, yes, us too.\t[ Chuckles ]\tDevon: No, they were delicious. But nothing beats spending time with you and our little guy. Just looking into his face always puts things back into perspective. So I appreciate you bringing him over here.\tAbby: Well, he loves you, and you certainly wore him out, because he has not made a peep since you put him down.\tDevon: I \u2014 right.\t[ Both chuckle ] I know. He\u2019s always been a good sleeper, though. I just love this age and getting to see the world through his eyes, \u2019cause it\u2019s like you\u2019re discovering everything for the first time. You know?\tAbby: Doesn\u2019t it make you want to be a kid again?\tDevon: No.\tAbby: No?\tDevon: It\u2019s not \u2014 not me. No. But today did remind me of why I\u2019m fighting so hard to get my company back and why I\u2019m considering buying mccall, because it\u2019s not for me at all. It\u2019s for our son\u2019s future.\tAbby: Look, I \u2014 I know where you\u2019re coming from, but you don\u2019t have to wrestle back your company for dominic. Who knows? He might not even want to be a part of the business when he gets older. He\u2019s going to be his own person, create his own career, his own path.\tDevon: Yeah, I know. I know. And I would never force him to do anything he doesn\u2019t want to do. But I just mean, I want him to be proud of me. You know, I want him to be proud that I\u2019m fighting to protect the family legacy.\tAbby: Well, he is gonna be proud of the man you are, no matter what. I promise you that. And look, I hate to segue back into business, but are you still considering buying mccall?

She still around?\tNate: I\u2019m not sure. We finished up a while ago. You know, I don\u2019t always know where she is or what she\u2019s up to, right?\tNick: Yeah, nate. I\u2019ll call her later. Where are you headed to?\tNate: It\u2019s personal information. I like to keep it that way. But elena and I had an argument earlier. That\u2019s why I decided to come out, you know, have a drink and clear my head.\t[ Clears throat ]\tNick: Interesting. When I saw you earlier, you made it seem like you came to meet with vick to talk about the mccall deal.\tNate: Yeah, that\u2019s how i clear my head these days \u2014 scotch and strategizing about newman media. Business is sometimes a good distraction from your personal life. You know?\tNick: And vice versa.\tNate: Anyway, I\u2019m too tired to face what\u2019s waiting for me at home, so I thought it\u2019d be a good idea if I give elena and me some space and crash here for the night.\tNick: Well, good luck with that.\tNate: It\u2019ll be fine. Good night.\tNick: Good night.\t[ Elevator door closing ]\tDevon: I told tucker that I knew about him offering his company to newman first.\tAbby: Mm. And did he have an explanation?\tDevon: He did, yeah. And it made some sense. But the more I think about it, I realize that it doesn\u2019t really matter that he went to newman first, \u2019cause he pulled that offer. As long as he\u2019s being sincere about what he\u2019s offering me.\tAbby: Well, sincerity is always in question when it comes to tucker.\tDevon: Right, right. I just \u2014 I feel like my reasons for wanting to buy the company are more important than whatever his reasons are for trying to sell it.\t", "Victor: So have I. I want it for you, and I want for the family.\tAdam: Hmm. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s gonna be one big happy family as you\u2019re envisioning, but \u2014\tVictor: I\u2019ll work that out.\tAdam: Hmm. You\u2019re gonna work out victoria\u2019s lifelong animosity towards me?\tVictor: We\u2019ll take things step by step. And the first step is to acquire mccall unlimited.\tAdam: Okay, well, the key to our success there is devon. We need to make sure that he is not interested, because tucker made it clear that he plans to sell to him, and that is his end game.\tVictor: Leave it up to me. (Terrie) if you\u2019re a smoker.\t\u201cThe young and the restless\u201d\twill continue. For bathroom odors that linger.\tVictor: I agree with you. I think we do need devon\u2019s help.\tAdam: Well, I think it may be more effective if you meet with him. You know, he seems to admire you.\tVictor: I respect him, as well, so I\u2019ll see what I can do. Alright?\tAdam: Okay. Maybe go meet with him tomorrow morning, yeah?\tVictor: To hell with that. I\u2019ll meet him tonight.\tAdam: Perfect.\tVictor: Now, I\u2019m sort of feeling that the tide is turning in my favor. I see you sort of coming back into the family.\tAdam: Only under the conditions that you promised. This is not a warm and fuzzy reunion. It\u2019s a totally selfish move.\tVictor: You don\u2019t think I know that?\tAudra: I was curious where things stood with the mccall acquisition. I know victoria had some further thoughts on newman coming in with a strong offer.\tNate: Yeah, I, uh, saw her, and we talked about it.\tAudra: Tell me.\tNate: I guess I can spare a few minutes, since we\u2019re talking shop.\tAudra: And I always love having the boss\u2019s ear.\tNate: Well, victoria had a conversation with tucker, and she tried to convince him that newman was the right place to sell his company.\tAudra: Was she successful?\tNate: Not sure.\tAudra: Listen, I still think you can be instrumental in this deal. Why not give it a shot by talking to devon?\tNate: I don\u2019t think that would ever work. And frankly, I don\u2019t want to even try. Still too much anger and hurt feelings there. I want to bridge that gap eventually, but that isn\u2019t the way. If I try to mix business with personal problems, it\u2019s only gonna make things much worse. I need to make peace with devon slowly and carefully.\tAudra: I know victoria wanted you to make inroads with devon, as well, so she\u2019ll be disappointed. But I\u2019m sure you can smooth that over.\tNate: I already let her know where I stand on that.\tAudra: A woman like victoria can be hard to say no to. But I\u2019ve noticed you hold your own with strong women. And victoria will get over it. Ultimately, you know, she\u2019ll admire you for wanting to mend fences with your family, the same way I do.\tNate: Hmm. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019d ever work, but thanks for the talk. Guess I needed to decompress more than I thought. Well, I should get going.\tAudra: Yeah. Try and get some rest. I\u2019m sure elena\u2019s probably waiting up for you.\tNate: Hmm.\tTucker: Well, well, well. Working late, I see.\t[ Knock on door ]\tDevon: [ Sighs ] Uh, just a second.

Now, I want to know from you whether victoria was right when she said that, um, you weren\u2019t interested in buying his company.\tDevon: Well, I may be changing my mind about that.\tVictor: And why is that?\tDevon: Uh, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a complicated situation. I\u2019m not really sure you\u2019d understand.\tVictor: Huh? Pardon me, but try me. Devon, try me.\tIt\u2019s the most wonderful\ttime of the year Hi, my name is tony cooper.

That\u2019s what happened. Would it be better if I told you I went for a walk?\tElena: Are you asking me if you should lie to me? No, nate, you shouldn\u2019t lie to me. But obviously you thought about it.\tNate: I am telling you the truth because I want you to know you have nothing to worry about.\tElena: Hmm.\tNate: Victoria and I have a work relationship, nothing more.\tElena: It\u2019s funny. That\u2019s exactly what I used to say to devon.\tNate: Oh.\tElena: But I guess that wasn\u2019t entirely true. And it wasn\u2019T.\tNate: The difference is, victoria and i aren\u2019t doing anything. Look, she\u2019s determined to get mccall. We had to go over all the different permutations, find the best path to bring tucker\u2019s company into newman. She wanted to talk about it so we can cover every aspect of the deal. Okay?\tElena: Yeah. Victoria is ruthless. When she sets her mind on something she wants, she won\u2019t stop until she gets it.\tTucker: So, were you working on acquiring my company or landing nate?\tAudra: The two things don\u2019t have to be mutually exclusive.\tTucker: Hmm. I like your new target. Much better than carrying a torch for your ex. Your quest for noah was getting quite boring, and you weren\u2019t getting anywhere. This going any better?\tAudra: It\u2019s too early to say. Nate\u2019s quite the catch, so I\u2019m not the only one in the game.\tTucker: Mm-hmm. Including his girlfriend. You better be careful.\t[ Sniffles ] Elena might have more teeth than she appears to have.\tAudra: Elena\u2019s a do-gooder doctor with a holier-than-thou moral code. I don\u2019t see her as my competition.\tTucker: Hmm.\tAudra: I\u2019m actually more worried about victoria newman.\tTucker: Victoria and nate?\tAudra: Not yet. And I plan to keep it that way.\tTucker: So, you\u2019re planning to insert yourself between your boss and your boss\u2019s boss?\t[ Chuckles ] Hmm, it\u2019s gutsy. It also seems a little shortsighted and reckless. How do you survive if you steal the man victoria newman wants?\tAudra: I\u2019ve landed on my feet after messier situations than this one.\tTucker: Yes, I can attest to that. Still, risky business.\tAudra: The bigger the risk, the bigger the reward.\tTucker: And you love big rewards, don\u2019t you?\t[ Chuckles ] God, you know, it\u2019s too bad that devon doesn\u2019t trust you anymore. Would have been nice to point you in his direction. Could have used your help trying to convince him to take over mccall.\tAudra: What makes you think I would have helped you?\tTucker: [ Clears throat ] Yeah, transactional woman. I would have offered you something that you wanted in return.\tAudra: What could you possibly offer that would interest me?\tDevon: So, you know that I\u2019m trying to get back control of hamilton-winters.\tVictor: Oh.\tDevon: Right?\tVictor: I\u2019ve heard. And to be honest with you, I am rather saddened by the fact that there\u2019s conflict between you and lily. I mean, I admire and respect both of you. Sad that it\u2019s come to this.\tDevon: Yeah, I\u2019m sad that it\u2019s come to it, too, but lily and jill have given me no choice. And I\u2019m being forced to do this to protect the legacy of neil.\tVictor: I understand the idea of protecting a legacy.\tDevon: Good.\tVictor: But why try to do that whilst attempting to get ahold of mccall unlimited?\tDevon: Because it would be a safety net for me in case this lawsuit doesn\u2019t go the way I want it to.\tVictor: Well, let me tell you something. You\u2019re talking to a man with a lot of experience in business. Safety nets are no good. You know why? You never fight to the very end to get what you want.\tDevon: I would agree with you in most cases, but this is a very different situation, because I\u2019m about to go up against lily and jill and the whole chancellor-winters legal team. The only thing I could propose is that if you were able to convince jill and lily to let me keep my company, I might be willing to forget about mccall altogether.\tVictor: Let me see what I can do, alright?\tDevon: Sure.\t[ Footsteps on stairs ]\tAbby: [ Sighs ] Dad, um, what are you doing here?

I\u2019m sure he was shocked by it, but, I mean, we\u2019re not doing anything wrong. Not hurting anybody. You and chance are divorced.\tAbby: Yeah. And my dad always wants me to be happy.\tDevon: Well, that makes two of us. And if I haven\u2019t told you lately how happy you make me, you need to know that. I never want to lose it.\tElena: Why are you so defensive?\tNate: Because you\u2019re putting me in that position. You keep insinuating something is going on with victoria, and I\u2019m trying to reassure you that is not the case.\tElena: I can see that. And the more you try to reassure me, the more worried I get.\tNate: Oh, I can\u2019t win. I can\u2019t win.\tElena: Well, I can\u2019t either, nate. I hate feeling like this. I don\u2019t want doubts creeping in my mind about our relationship, but I also tend to trust my instincts.

No, no, I left a message, but I didn\u2019t want to push. I hear you. It\u2019s hard to know where that line is with an ex. Mm-kay, now we\u2019re talking about you and chase. Am I right? Whew!

It was a major get. One you should be proud of. The glory is not all mine. I couldn\u2019t have done it without you. Look, man, I know you hate not being on the force \u2014 especially after a big operation like the one on spoon island.

I have every reason to believe that the board is going to see your merits and they\u2019re going to reinstate you. We\u2019re still a long way off. Aw, would you have some faith, man? I\u2019ll try.

But on the bright side, soon enough, we will no longer have a professional relationship, and he will be free of me completely. Did he fire you as his manager? Music was never chase\u2019s dream.

It makes him happy, and I\u2019m happy for him. That\u2019s great. How do you really feel? I\u2019m actually happy for him, maxie. Look, chase, he deserves to follow his passion. Yeah, so do you. And I am. In fact, aside from the ones he already sold, linc gave me back my catalog. That\u2019s great news. Yeah. So, you know, I can shop those around, build my slate of artists. Hmm. So why don\u2019t you seem happy? Because I still don\u2019t get what I want. What-whatever you need, I\u2019m at your service. You look kind of tired, maybe? Are you sick?

No, I am not, but what i am telling you to do is maybe report him. I don\u2019t know. I know it\u2019s difficult, but maybe see if you can convince some of these women to come forward. You know as well as I do, these types of allegations are hard to prove. Either everyone comes forward or no one does. Okay, I get direct involvement, but for you \u2014 for you, it\u2019s a bad idea. Why? These women endure this because they think that if they don\u2019t, linc will end their music career. I don\u2019t care if my music career ends. In fact, I can\u2019t wait. I am the perfect person to take him down. Okay, but you know how this works. You take him down, he\u2019s liable to take you down with him. And then what happens? The ccrb gets wind of your little one-man operation, and there goes your chances of reinstatement. I-I know there are risks, but I don\u2019t feel right about leaving these women in linc\u2019s orbit to do this alone. No, and nor should you. That\u2019s admirable. But, just to be clear, are we talking women plural or one woman in particular? Is everything okay with you and chase? Nothing major. Just music-business stuff. Well, I admire you, brook lynn. The way you\u2019re juggling two careers? I crumbled under the pressure of just one. What? No, you didn\u2019T. What you went through was not a reflection of your capability or professionalism. Don\u2019t sell yourself short. Oh, you know what? I think I left my phone in my coat pocket, which is really strange of me, but it happened. So you two, uh, talk amongst yourselves. I think it\u2019s so incredible what you\u2019ve done with chase\u2019s music career. Thank you. Are you thinking of taking on other clients? Actually, it\u2019s probably time to explore new horizons. The question is, why are you willing to let this go? I know my limits. The only limits you have are the limits that pcu has shackled you with. You should just quit.\t[ Scoffs ] Alexis.\t[ Sighs ] You find journalism gratifying, yes? Well, certainly more than I thought.

Now, this may sound flowery, or probably just plain pretentious, but I really feel that the knowledge I\u2019ve imparted is my bequest to a better world. Okay, that\u2019s lovely. And if anyone should understand how painful it is to give up a career that you\u2019ve poured your heart and soul into\u2026 I get it. Besides, just because I\u2019m not officially working here doesn\u2019t mean that we can\u2019t continue to collaborate. As you said yourself, why bust up a good thing? What are you thinking? I\u2019m thinking there must be a way to build on the momentum of this story. And my ideas are yours, free of charge. Who\u2019s ready for a toast? Oh, pour me some sparkling water, please, because I think I got a little bit of food poisoning when I was in england. Okay. Tj, say when. Actually, sparkling water for me, too. I\u2019m due at work, and the hospital\u2019s really strict about their doctors drinking. You guys are squares, both of you. Molly, you won\u2019t let me drink alone, will you?

Okay, I\u2019ll admit, I was short with you when you were talking to warden brewster about the spring ridge escape. You clearly did not want me there. Yeah. And it wasn\u2019t the first time that you actively kept me out of the loop when it was important that I stay informed. But being informed is not necessarily being involved, eileen. Okay. [ Sighs ] I\u2019ll admit it. I have been keeping you at arm\u2019s length. May I ask why?\tI think I owe you an apology. Yeah, well, I let my personal sensitivities cloud my judgment, you know? But then I realized that we don\u2019t have to be adversaries, do we? It\u2019s just that, you know \u2014 it\u2019s just that you\u2019re such a strong administrator, and you will be a great successor when I decide not to seek reelection, but it\u2019s just that I need to know that I can count on you when it matters.

Okay, well, um, the reason that I asked you to meet me here. Yes. Anna devane\u2019s body has been recovered. Or rather, I-I should say, what the french authorities believe are anna\u2019s remains. My condolences. Thank you. I hope this gives you and anna\u2019s loved ones the closure that you need. When will the body arrive? It\u2019s already here. Anna\u2019s body is down in the morgue.

I mean, come on. We\u2019re good together. So why bust it all up? Suddenly, I\u2019m sensing a return to a subject we put to bed. I just don\u2019t understand why pcu won\u2019t let you work at the invader. I told you, conflict of interest. I know, conflict of interest, and I\u2019m telling you that I have researched six publications, and all of them have actual professors working in their editorial department. So why is pcu setting a different standard for their faculty, specifically you? Alexis, why can\u2019t you just let this go? I\u2019m going to stop linc brown, end his career as a music manager, maybe get him charged, just for good measure. Maybe you should remember that he\u2019s one of the reasons you were suspended in the first place. You add harassment to the assault, you\u2019re not going to get back on the force. Brown gets handsy with his clients, and I mean really handsy. He is abusive, he\u2019s controlling, he\u2019s manipulative, and that\u2019s all that we know about. There\u2019s probably so much more. I knew the guy was a sleaze, but I didn\u2019t know he was doing that. Yeah, that\u2019S\u2026 that\u2019s no good, and he needs to be stopped. Why don\u2019t i have a chat with him, then? No, it won\u2019t do anything. Well, how is that not going to \u2014 how are you going to do good by working for him? How\u2019s that going to stop his behavior? Proximity gives me opportunity. Sooner or later, he is going to slip up in a way that is verifiable. Right. Okay. And when he does, you better be far, far away from him. I take it you are referring to chase. Chase and I are over. He has made that more than abundantly clear. In fact, I think he\u2019s moved on. Chase is interested in someone else? Who? Sasha. Sasha\u2026 are you sure? Not \u201csure\u201d sure, but they\u2019ve certainly been spending a lot more time together lately. Okay, well, they\u2019re friends, and I\u2019m sure they\u2019re just being supportive. How sure? Like 98% sure. You need to talk to sasha. Why? Whatever\u2019s going on between them, it\u2019s none of my business. Look, chase and I are over. I may not have him, but I have my music back. Yeah. You still don\u2019t seem that pleased. Because it came with strings. I had to sign a non-disclosure agreement. What\u2019s wrong with that? Well, one of my main goals when I started was to nail linc to the wall, you know, for sexual harassment and coercion and all the other sleazy stuff he does. And you persuaded chase to help you. I did. And he was totally into it. So when he finds out I signed an nda and can no longer speak publicly about what linc did to me, he could think that I prioritized my career over doing what\u2019s right. I don\u2019t think the nda is going to be your problem. You need to check with a lawyer, but there\u2019s this little thing called the speak out act. An nda can prevent you from talking about work product, like intellectual property. Lyrics, contracts, deals. Exactly. But any contract that restricts your ability to talk about how you\u2019ve been treated, like misconduct in the workplace or sexual harassment, those can\u2019t be enforced anymore. You should look into it. I will. But that still doesn\u2019t change what I did. Chase is understanding. I am sure he will forgive you. What does chase need to forgive you for? So, exactly how offended should I be that the pleasure of my company just wasn\u2019t enough for us to meet? Your company in itself is reward enough. Oh, stop. Go on. I wanted to bring you up to speed, given some recent events. Yes. You mean heather webber being identified as the person who stabbed me with a hook? Well, she\u2019s confessed, which means we\u2019re removed from the problem of having a trial. Which means I don\u2019t have to testify. How nice. \u2018Cause, believe me, I was not looking forward to reliving that. You know, it\u2019s interesting. I put my clients on the stand every day, but, boy, it\u2019s different \u2014 when you\u2019re the one that\u2019s attacked. I get it. Yes, well, of course you would. I mean, you yourself were the victim of an attack recently. Shouldn\u2019t one of ms. Devane\u2019s actual relatives make the identification? Well, it\u2019s just that, um, well, her daughter lives all the way across the country. But what about D.A. Scorpio? They were married. Yes, they were. It\u2019s just that, uh, well, the french authorities have made it clear that, um, well, the body, there\u2019s been some decomposition, so\u2026 I\u2019m sure you can understand why I wouldn\u2019t want to expose one of her loved ones to a visual like that, unless that was absolutely necessary. Of course. So, unfortunately, it\u2019s my duty as a city official to assist the gendarmerie.\t[ Sighs ] But, so help me, I have been here for hours, and I just can\u2019t do it. Oh. You need support. I need you to do it.\t", "[ Sighs ] Good old alfred. To tennyson. You know, I was thinking about you during that time, and I was hoping that tennyson was getting you through. Not just tennyson. I hope you find the perfect singer for every song and make stars out of all of them. That\u2019s the dream. It\u2019s tough to make many moves under this guardianship, but I\u2019m starting to think about my own future. And does that future include anyone else? Are you trying to ask me something specific, brook lynn? Oh, my phone [Chuckles] Was in my purse the whole time. What do you know? So, what\u2019d I miss? I\u2019m going to ask you a question. I want you to answer it honestly. Instead of lying and evading like I usually do?\t[ Chuckles ] Yeah. You and brook lynn team up to take down linc. Are you \u2014 are you worried about your feelings for her coming back or anything like that? I mean, maybe they will. Maybe they won\u2019T. Either way, it\u2019s worth it to see this through. Do you remember how aimless I felt when I got suspended the first time? For a guy who\u2019s wanted to be a cop longer than he can remember, it didn\u2019t feel good to lose my purpose. And what about singing? That\u2019s a paycheck, not a purpose. Look, I want to help people, and if I can\u2019t do it as a cop, I\u2019mma do it this way. Dr. Kevin collins would lend a unique point of view to a think piece. Kevin is not only ryan\u2019s brother, he\u2019s his twin and his victim. To share your exact dna with someone who\u2019s both your physiological and moral opposite? It\u2019s a great angle. I like it. You think he\u2019d be willing to talk about it? There\u2019s only one way to find out. I\u2019d also like to interview esme, even though that young lady has got some problems of her own right now. That\u2019s right. Oh, I apologize. I completely forgot that congratulations are in order. You\u2019re an aunt again. That\u2019s mean.\t[ Chuckles ] Oh. Yes, I know nikolas is having another son. I also have no idea where he is. Well, then, it\u2019s a good thing you have a knack for solving mysteries. Gregory\u2026 about the job. Just when we were having such a nice chat. Humor me. One more question.\t[ Sighs ] Fine. If pcu hadn\u2019t gotten in the way of you taking the job at the invader, would you have accepted it? I\u2019d have liked nothing more. Tj: Thank you, sam and kristina, for this very thoughtful surprise. Yes, of course. You\u2019re very welcome. Growing up, I never knew what I was missing, but through molly, I have sisters.\t[ Chuckles ] Thank you both for always making me feel like family. Well, you are family. Yeah, and you\u2019re trapped, and there\u2019s no escape. But it\u2019s only because we love you.\t[ Molly chuckles ] I love you, too. All of you. We do. Seriously. I\u2019ll see you tonight. Okay. Bye. Bye. Well, as we know, tj is traditional, and I am\u2026not.\t[ Chuckles ] Mm-hmm. But I really do appreciate you guys celebrating the commitment that tj and I made. Well, love is always worth celebrating. Right back at you and dante.\t[ Chuckles ] Aww, my sisters are happily in love. It could almost give a girl a complex. Oh, come on, stop. When you meet someone \u2014 and you will \u2014 they will not know what hit them. Because I am a wrecking ball. Because you are fantastic and smart\u2026 ah, stop. \u2026And beautiful. Yeah, face it. We are kind of magnificent, and we only deserve the best. And that includes you. Only good things for the davis girls. I\u2019ve never been healthier.\tYou know, I\u2019m lucky to have friends \u2014 old and new. You\u2019d better be calling me new.\t[ Chuckles ] Alexis: Oh, if it isn\u2019t my two favorite members of my former profession. Am I interrupting? Would it matter? Uh, as it turns out, I have another appointment. My, how time flies. Thank you for breakfast. Oh, yes, thank you so much. Was that business or discovery? It was breakfast. I want to thank you, by the way, for alerting me before the identity of the hook went to print. Well, it\u2019s the least I could do. How you feeling? Like I no longer have any excuse not to go out, live my life, take a breath. And you? Deciding what shelf to dust off for your pulitzer? That\u2019s a bit of a stretch. You\u2019re on your way. I would be more on my way if pcu weren\u2019t being obstructionist. And what is that august institution up to these days? The school\u2019s administration won\u2019t allow gregory to join the editorial board. Why not? Conflict of interest. How? Exactly. Well, what does he have to say about this? Nothing. He doesn\u2019t want to give up teaching, so he\u2019s accepting it. Oh. And I\u2019m guessing\tyou\u2019re not? No, because you know how I am. Mayor collins. Hey, tj. Oh, uh, sorry.

Why don\u2019t you take a look, and I\u2019ll be back for the form you have to sign? Great. Well, it sounds to me like you\u2019re going to go after linc no matter what. Yeah. Okay.

Who are you going to take down with a bum shoulder? Ow! You gotta get that checked out, dude. You know I don\u2019t like hospitals.

Does that mean she\u2019s doing better? Uh, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. But you should stop by, see her. I will. I need to meet little amelia. Hmm. Yeah, my mother, she\u2019s got some fierce baby fever going on right now. She keeps hinting whether or not \u2014 trying to find out if me and sam are going to have kids or something crazy. Do you want them? We haven\u2019t discussed it. Oh, I see that you switched from bubbly to sparkling. Is everything okay? Yeah. I\u2019m just feeling a little under the weather. Okay. Um, well, I already opened the bottle, and it\u2019s like a sin to let it go flat. Are you sure you don\u2019t want any more, molls? Yeah, no, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m sure, but I could use something sweet. Is there any dessert? Um, yeah, in the bag over there. Yeah, I\u2019ll get it. Okay. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Sounds good.

He just doesn\u2019t want to give up teaching. The professor is a big boy. If he wants it so badly, he\u2019ll find a way to get it \u2014 on his own. Not necessarily. Here we go.

Speaking of the dark menace. He\u2019s late. You should put that in your next report. Add something in there about Nicole. She\u2019s Mia too. Yeah. Well, at least she has an excuse.\tWhat\u2019s that? She was in the hospital last night. Hi Kayla, it\u2019s Nicole. I, I know we can\u2019t do the DNA test for a few weeks, the, the paternity test, but I wanna make an appointment now because I need to find out who the father of my baby is as soon as possible.\tEric. Hi. Uh, I was just talking to Kayla and I don\u2019t know if you heard, but No. I, I didn\u2019t, are you okay? I, I\u2019m fine, but forget about me. Eric, you, you, your face ej and I, we got into it last night. I heard, but I I didn\u2019t think it was that bad. Said I\u2019m fine. I was worried about you. Actually, I left you a message.\tI was trying to warn you that EJ found out about us. Yeah. Thanks to Sloan, but I didn\u2019t get the message until after EJ confronted me. Now we spent timing. More like bad judgment on your girlfriend\u2019s part. Why the hell would Sloan tell EJ that you and I slept together? What the hell is she thinking?\tNo, don\u2019t gimme that hassis crap. When you missed me. I missed you a lot. Like hell you have. If that were true, you\u2019d have told me you were in town. I know what you\u2019ve been doing, little brother. So close the door. We need to talk.\tNo answer. The first call went to voicemail, so I\u2019m trying her again. Remember, Sloane Peterson is our prime suspect. Yeah, but I still wanna know what my sister can tell me about this calling guy. He\u2019s part of me is afraid to hear it.\tDid you wanna kiss that?

Well, I figured. Get down to the station. You\u2019re looking guilty here by the minute. Somehow wasn\u2019t the right approach. Please let there be something that explains us all away.\tAnd what is it that I\u2019ve been doing? Oh, there it is. The same. Who me act you\u2019ve been doing since we were five. You know it never bothered me until the time whenever you snuck out with the car and you cracked the taillight and let mom and dad believe that was me. I was grounded for a month. Yeah, sorry about that.\tOh, stop playing innocent Collin cuz I\u2019m not buying it. Okay. No more games. Just advice leave now. The less you know, the better. Too late. As I said, I already know what you\u2019ve been doing.\tSloan and Miss, she made a mistake. Hmm, that\u2019s big of her. She also thought Youj already knew. Since you and I have been drugged and what happened between us wasn\u2019t our fault that you would\u2019ve already told EJ and that maybe he wouldn\u2019t have made such a big deal about it. Well, clearly she doesn\u2019t have a full appreciation of the complicated history you share.\tShe does, but I filled her in some. She also assumes that some of our complications are in the past. Frame in the past. Is everything okay between you and ej? Mm-hmm. Yeah, fine. We\u2019re fine. And you? What about me? Well, you just said you were on the phone with Kayla and you seemed a little bit startled when I walked in.\tIs everything okay?\tEJ Damaris Pro. Perpetual tardiness is emblematic of his job performance at large. It demonstrates a failure of commitment to the company, a contempt for his coworkers, and a shocking lack of self-awareness. He\u2019s c e o, not a king, Gabby. That\u2019s great. Thank you. And I\u2019ve got more, yeah, more of what? Hi, ej.\tYou\u2019re late. It\u2019s getting to be a habit. Not that I answered to you, or you\u2019re so-called consultant, but I was tending to Nicole. Is she okay? She\u2019s fine. Oh, good. I for one, I\u2019m glad that this little episode hasn\u2019t interfered with her work. Mother thought I was a hell. Is that supposed to mean. You know her work.\tYou hired her to evaluate my job performance. Surely that hasn\u2019t slipped your mind now. No, it hasn\u2019t. Right? How could it anyway, I was, um, a little concerned, given Nicole\u2019s obvious bias against me, that she would be anything but fair in her reports to board. But turns out, I had nothing to worry about. You see, she was a total pro.\t", "What are you talking about? Oh, you haven\u2019t seen it? No. I happen to have a copy of Nicole\u2019s hand work right here.\tDira shows upstanding attention to detail. Fosters positive cult Wish he\u2019d stay in this position forever. That one is my favorite, and believe me when I say I\u2019m gonna do everything in my power to make sure that becomes a reality. Nicole didn\u2019t write one word of that crap. Nobody has her name on it, and it was sent from her email address to Shin and the rest of the DER board.\tI don\u2019t know how you did it, but you obviously pulled something while Nicole was at the hospital. Wait a minute. That wasn\u2019t the only report you submitted to the board last night, was it?\tEverything\u2019s fine. It\u2019s nothing really. Nicole, you, you just said you were on the phone with Kayla. You looked a little rattled. Come on. You know me. I get a little twinge and I immediately jump to the worst case scenario and you know, let the doctor checks me out, says I\u2019m fine. But I of course insist on follow up tests.\tIt\u2019s silly. Really? Yeah. So just a little twinge. Well, last night I, I got some cramps that were pretty painful, so I, I went to the hospital. You, you were at the hospital last night. I was there too. Kayla said she saw you. I ran into EJ on my way out. Oh, you, you didn\u2019t say anything before. I must have blocked it out Anyway, he said, the two of you talked about what happened between us and.\tUnderstands what happened and it didn\u2019t mean anything and I should just let it go, which is not a problem for me. I mean, we can get past that. Right, right. There is one thing that\u2019s a bit strange. What\u2019s that? EJ mentioned he went to the hospital to get his hand checked. But obviously he was there to see you.\tAnd why would he lie?\tChanel, I\u2019m so sorry. I thought you were alone. Okay, mama. It\u2019s okay. Oh, I didn\u2019t mean to hold alone. Don\u2019t panic.

Well, I didn\u2019t realize that things were moving so fast between you two. We were just. Hanging out and then it sort of happened. Oh, well in that case, huh? Maybe it\u2019s a good thing that I interrupted.\tWhat does that mean? Why don\u2019t you let me talk to Talia? Give yourself a break. No, it has to be me. I know her better than anyone. Sure. Yeah. But you know, maybe in this case a little less, uh, closeness could be a good thing. Are you saying that I can\u2019t be objective? I\u2019m saying she\u2019s your sister. Exactly.

He was evasive, uncooperative, and he wouldn\u2019t even admit that he knew Talia. Even after I had two witnesses that swear they saw her leaving his room. All right, Talia, who still has no motive whatsoever. I know. I know. And even if she did, I just. I can\u2019t figure out how this call-in guy even fits in. You know, if this joker won\u2019t tell me what I need to know, then I\u2019m gonna find out myself.\tMeaning he can play dumb, he can stonewall, but he can\u2019t stop me from investigating. I am gonna find out everything there is to know about him, starting with what kind of car he drives. I\u2019m in his place. See if he\u2019s in the system. I\u2019m gonna go back to that nasty motel room and see who else is stopping by to see him.\tHow could I have not seen this sooner? Yeah, seriously, and not usually this low. I am sorry. Old habits. Look, you\u2019ve put enough time and the effort in trying to make that little slut pay for what she did to our mom and to dad. And now it\u2019s my turn. Your turn. This isn\u2019t a game. What I mean is that you tried to get justice for our parents using the legal system and it didn\u2019t work.\t", "clarity?\tBecause I don\u2019t wanna be guessing what\u2019s going on with my body. I wanna know for sure\tMr. Shin. Yes, I was just informed that you received the reports, but you must understand there\u2019s a lot more going on here than please ignore everything you read about Steph. And the report on my brother was tampered with, uh, someone hacked into my evaluation. That is, that is, that is pure fiction. We both know how Gabby Hernandez is deeply biased and.\tI am not a HR disaster waiting to happen, and the last thing I am is temperamental and those quotes about me being imperious are totally made up.\tYou want me to do what? Take anger management classes. I\u2019ll show you anger management.\tYou boss it, use of offensive language. Put that in your report too, didn\u2019t you? Sure did.\tRay didn\u2019t want me to know any of this. He kept saying it was nothing. They suspected TA for a moment. But I, that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t understand. The police interviewed us twice. I guess there was some slight discrepancy, bat Talia story, but you cleared it all up. What discrepancy are you talking about? Well, I think it started with the, where she went, you know, after she had dinner here.\tSomething else about my keys or nothing of any consequence besides, she had no motive whatsoever to want to hurt us, and yet the police considered her a suspect with Sloan. The person who\u2019s obviously behind all of this, just right in front of them. This is beyond ridiculous baby. I\u2019m with you. But I think, you know, I think Ray, he just wanted to be thorough, not leave any stone unturned.\tOkay. Well then he should have asked me about Talia. I spend more time with her than anyone else around here. I think. I know she was out to get us\tgetting Chanel\u2019s Bakery shutdown was just the beginning for you. Nice way to gloss over a felony. You know, that\u2019s the kind of thing they send people to prison for. Yeah, we\u2019re lucky for me. My sister is a brilliant barrister. Besides, what\u2019s the problem? Nobody got hurt. They just ate a few biscuits and made them PR around like they\u2019re at Woodstock again.\tHmm. It all looked pretty fun to me. Yeah, well tried telling that to the police commissioner and the DA who ended up in the hospital. I, I read about that in that cheesy gossip column. Sounds like he snogged his lead detective first, but she is pretty hot, so maybe he thinks he\u2019s worth it. This is all just a big joke to you, isn\u2019t it?\tYou say nobody\u2019s getting hurt, but people are getting hurt, Colin, including me. Yeah, but like I said, there is no way that they\u2019re gonna be able to pin this on you. That\u2019s not what I meant is this.\tI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, bud. This is the first time since I got to this stupid town that I might actually have something. Good going. Not that I came here looking for it or even wanted it, but, but I\u2019ve found it and I don\u2019t want anything to mess it up. Are you talking about a guy? I like him. Okay.\tHe\u2019s important to me. All right. I promise going forward that whatever I do will not affect him. Promise. Well, it\u2019s too late for that because you know what? He ate one of your biscuits and got drugs and ended up poking up with his ex that I had the pleasure of walking in on.\tI know you think what you\u2019re doing is honoring mom and dad\u2019s memory,\tbut the only thing you\u2019re doing is you are ruining my life. It stops here, Colin. It\u2019s over.\tYou, you wanna talk about? Claims his last name is Firth. Why Dove Motel room 1 0 6? I, I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t understand him. Neither do we. But Zander Cook and Chloe Lane both said that they saw you leaving his motel room, so I went there to talk to him. Wait, wait. You talked, I asked him some questions, which he took Great pleasure in refusing to answer.\tSo, uh, Are you gonna do the same or are you gonna tell me what\u2019s going on? Was it you that they saw leaving Collins Motel room?\tYes.\tI lied to you. Okay.\tThe night that everybody got high off of those biscuits, I didn\u2019t have a headache. And, um, I didn\u2019t go take a walk around the lake. I went to the motel and I went to go see Colin, Jennifer, uh, Talia. Stop. I, I need to repeat your right. No, you just let me explain please. Okay. I, I have to say this now. Okay. Uh, go ahead Colin.\tHe\u2019s my ex-boyfriend from New York. The night that, um, I went. To have dinner with Chanel and her family. He texted me completely out of the blue, but he said that he was in town and that he wanted to see me. And yes, I know that we\u2019re broken up and everything and I know that I said I was completely done, but.\tI went to the motel and I slept with him.\t", "Why didn\u2019t you just say that in the first place? Because I shouldn\u2019t be seen calling at all. Okay. He\u2019s no good for me and I don\u2019t like who I am when I\u2019m around him. I heard his voice on the phone. I got weak and everything that I thought that I knew, it went completely out of the window. And what he wanted, I don\u2019t know.\tI just did. Okay. I mean, I knew you had a boyfriend in in New York, but I didn\u2019t know you felt like this, but he made you feel like this. Why didn\u2019t you say anything? God, what? Isn\u2019t it obvious? This, this is humiliating to me, and I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know why God lied to you. Okay. When I saw those people in the hallway coming out of his room, I had just told him that I don\u2019t wanna see his face ever again.\tThat I wasn\u2019t done this time for good. Okay. So you could have been upset. I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know. Listen, it\u2019s okay. No, Evan, you heard enough Detective, have I Have I finally convinced you that I\u2019m not a terrorist, that I\u2019m a just apathetic loser who slept with her ex-boyfriend. Want me to provide more details for you?\tReally dive into the death of my shame. Or do you believe me? Down. So this, this can all, you can just stop, please. Of course I believe you. I gotta go\tnow. No one understands what you are feeling more than I do. I felt that every single day since mom died. The sorrow, the grief, the rage. I\u2019ve spent hours obsessing over how to make Paul and Chanel pay, how to make them suffer the way we suffered, but by some miracle. Colin, I want something more than revenge.\tI found something. Beautiful that I wanna protect, and you are making that very, very hard. Last thing I wanted to do was to hurt you, but I just, but you need this. If you need it. I know I\u2019ve been there, but it is a lonely place, Collin, I didn\u2019t even realize how lonely it was until I found somebody who showed me that there was so much more to live for.\tI want that for you too.\tMoving on does not mean we forget them. We will never forget. But you should want more for yourself too.\tLook at the police. Come looking for Megan. I\u2019m gonna tell them it\u2019s you. The truth. You got that?\tYes. This is EJ Damira for Mr. Shin. What the hell do you mean? He\u2019s not available? I just spoke to him. Please let him know that I cold. Thank you. I can believe our work here is done. Are you hungry? My love. I was thinking about going to lunch to celebrate. Oh, I am ravenous, but um, not for lunch.\tSo just to be sure. Everything that EJ said at the hospital is true, right? I mean, everything\u2019s cool. No more lingering issues between us. I sure hope not.\tYou know what? This, this is ej of course. Probably just it\u2019s good to see him. I hope everything goes well with the test.\tEj Hi. Can you come to the office right away? We have a bit of a situation here. Um, sure is everything all right? You sound it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll be there soon.\tOh, mama. That\u2019s awful. Sloane Peterson strikes her again. Okay, well we have to do something. Oh, baby, I\u2019m trying. I insisted that wave get her down to the station for questioning. Mm-hmm. Of course she denied everything. She\u2019s lying. Oh. Problem is we, we can\u2019t prove it. Well, okay, so, so what can we do? Tell you what we don\u2019t do?\tLet Sloan get so much as a hint that the, the police are spectacular. Oh, knowing that lion crepe, she\u2019ll find a way to incriminate the poor girl. I still can\u2019t believe that Ray thought that Talia was behind all this. And then Jada suspecting her own sister. I know, baby. It is nuts. But you don\u2019t need to worry.\tYou don\u2019t need to worry. They got their eye on the prize. Uh, so anyway, uh, tell me about, you went, Talia, I assume you too. Were having a nice time before I bought you on Well, You know, I, I assumed after our date last night that that was the end of the romantic road. Oh, it didn\u2019t go well. Well, it, it started off great, but then towards the end things got kind of awkward and then I, I just assumed that she wasn\u2019t into me and then she showed up here today with flowers.\tOh dear. That\u2019s beautiful. Yeah. And then we started talking about last night and why she seemed so uncomfortable, and it turns out that she doesn\u2019t have much experience with, with, with girls, with anyone. A woman like her, that\u2019s hard to believe. I know, but I, I guess there was one guy in New York and she fell pretty hard and, and they broke up.\t", "And that\u2019s not an insult. All right? You\u2019re brilliant at what you do, but this, this requires someone who\u2019s willing to go to more extreme measures, and that\u2019s someone in me.\tColin, have you considered how what you\u2019re doing affects me? I\u2019m being blamed for all of this. Of course you are. So you know that you\u2019ve put me in the cops crosshairs. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s been inconvenient. Inconvenient. My life is a living hell. The DA and the police commissioner are breathing down my neck.\tThey\u2019re out to get me. The only reason they haven\u2019t been able to pan anything is they don\u2019t have concrete evidence and they won\u2019t, no. You know how far Paul Price will go to protect her daughter? Come on. It\u2019s only a matter of time before she pays somebody. To find something to railroad me with. Yeah. But you are way too smart to let that happen.\tOh, so I should just use my brains and just have faith that it\u2019s all gonna work out. You\u2019re gonna thank me when this is done. The most powerful people in this town are out to destroy me and the other half. They hate my guts. God, I consumed my, my license, my practice. My freedom, Collin, I highly doubt. I\u2019m gonna be thanking you.\tLook, if you don\u2019t like the way that I\u2019m doing this, then gimme another suggestion cuz the only other way I see is walking away and I am not gonna do that. I\u2019m not letting those little bitches get away with murder. Don\u2019t you think you\u2019ve done enough damage? You got Chanel\u2019s Bakery closed down. You killed her dream.\tThat\u2019s just the beginning. Why would you interrupting me Antalia be a good thing? I thought you liked her. I, I, I do very much. Okay. Well, if this is because you think I\u2019m rushing into things after I promise to take things slow. No, no, no. It\u2019s not that. Okay. Well, well, if this is about me being Talia\u2019s boss, I told you I don\u2019t have a policy against coworkers hooking up.\tI, I know, I know. As long as it\u2019s consensual. I know, baby. I know you do. Okay, then I\u2019m lost. You know? Forget it, you know, forget what I said. No, I, I can\u2019t. You\u2019re not making any sense. That is because I\u2019m so worried about the Sloan Peterson situation. I, I, I\u2019m not thinking straight. Did something happen? I got another threatening message when I was down at the police station just now.\tNo. Yes, and I pushed Ray yet again to arrest as SL ass lawyer, but he kept going on and on about how they needed to consider all possible suspects. Okay. Well, What does this have to do with you being glad you interrupted? Wait, are you saying the police suspect? Talia?\tI\u2019m headed over to the white dove right now and I\u2019m not gonna come back until I have something solid. Talia, what are you doing here? What? You called, didn\u2019t you? So instead of playing phone tag, I figured I\u2019d come see what you wanted. This time. Okay, then I\u2019ll tell you.\tI wanna know who Colin is and what the hell you\u2019re doing with him.\tPlease tell me you did not submit those BOGUES evaluations to the board. Ogus aj, don\u2019t tell me you can\u2019t handle an honest assessment. There was nothing honest about it. The scathing report Gabby wrote about me was All Lies and Nicole\u2019s report on Stephan was obviously doctored by the two of you to make him look like a rockstar.\tI swear to God, if you sent one word of that rubbish to shin\taj, you gonna answer that?\tEJ was protecting my privacy.\tOkay, fine. You know, he didn\u2019t want you to know that I was at the hospital. Its just when it comes to confiding in people about me, you\u2019re not exactly at the top of his list. Yeah. Okay. I was just concerned, but I, I, I told you No, I know what you told me, but I also know you,\tI can see the look in your eyes, Nicole.\tIt\u2019s not nothing. I mean, you could talk to me about anything. You know that right? You can trust me. Yeah. Yeah. I know that. And I, I appreciate it. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to tell you. It\u2019s just. It\u2019s hard. I know it\u2019s hard to keep a secret.\tHey, if you can just, just open up a little bit, you can talk to me. Maybe it\u2019ll make it easier.\tYou promise\tI promised Nicole.\tThese, these cramps, they\u2019re, they\u2019re not just cramps, then what are they?\tKayla thinks\tthat I\u2019m in the early stages of menopause.

No. Why would she make that up? Well, your secret\u2019s safe with me. And then after that, after we feed the duck, . How about a picnic on a paddle boat?

You think that even given your recent transgressions, that I would come down here and bail your As.\tThere is no way I am taking your case. What Bill? Come on. No, you come on. You blew up every bridge between us and now that you\u2019re a sleazy girlfriend or whatever you wanna call her, said bye-bye. You have the nerve to come to me and ask me to represent you when all you\u2019ve done is disparage my work and refuse to listen to reason.\tWon. You have done his rake, Brady and I over the coals because you were so superior. Oh, well screw that. If you didn\u2019t come down here to represent Brady or I, then why the hell are you even here? Oh, I never said I wasn\u2019t gonna represent Brady, but you, Eric are on your own.\tYou know, you\u2019re a real smug, arrogant, judgmental, thinking that you\u2019re so smart and all because you got a lot of G gritty. Eric, come on. Oh, no, no, no. I remember correctly. You failed the bar like three times. Did you know that? I mean, it\u2019s correct. That mom was like, oh, more poor little bell. All right. It\u2019s good for you.\tPut your damn mouth right now. Yeah. Well, he doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s good for. It\u2019s clear he is hit the floor after his long fall from Graces. No Bell. Listen, listen. He, he, he did all this for me, all right. To help me out. So look, look, I know he\u2019s been a horse\u2019s ass lately. What the hell? No, he\u2019s been the king of the horse\u2019s asses lately since he broke up with Nicole.\tThis has nothing to do with Nicole. Objection. Overruled. Listen, I got him into this mess bell. Please him. I need your help to get him out of it.\tWell, that\u2019s very moving, heartwarming. Brothers sticking up for each other. And yes, it is very clear to me that Eric was only an accessory to your crimes to Brady. And I am sure whoever represents Eric will make that argument in court. But as I said before, and I have not changed my mind, I will not be taking his case.\tWhat would Mom say if she knew you turned your back on me? Don\u2019t dare. Don\u2019t you dare, dare. No, don\u2019t you. You can\u2019t leave me in here Bell watch me guard. I\u2019m taking Brady Black to court for his arraignment.\tYeah, bell offered her legal services to Eric and uh, he went out of his way to refuse. I mean, he didn\u2019t even take her advice. So in other words, he\u2019s been a world-class director. Hmm. That\u2019s kind of shocking, isn\u2019t it? I mean, after his breakup with Nicole, I feel like he\u2019s just gone off the deep end, like he\u2019s turned to the dark side or something.\tYep. How the holy have fallen. And from what I understand, his breakup with Nicole was his doing. Yeah, apparently. Yeah. Well, he might have been without sin when he cast stones at her, but I think he\u2019s more than made up for us since then. Aj. I know I\u2019m supposed to be on that call with the bank this morning, but, uh, I think you should handle this one on your own.\tOh, I, I don\u2019t know. Stephanie, do you really wanna take that chance? Especially since the powers of be all deeply concerned, obviously with the recent calamus decline in our stock, which was precipitated by my slip of the tongue, my, my laps and judgment, all the more reason for you to fly solo on this one, give you a chance to redeem yourself, prove to them you\u2019re at the top of your game, su their jitters, so to speak.\tRight? That is, if you feel up to it, oh, I, I\u2019m, I\u2019m feeling quite fine. S Stephan, thank. But still, I think it\u2019s best that we both take the call, fly in town, demonstrate to them that we are a team with unwavering unity of vision and purposes, co CEOs. So shall I guide us in?\tYes. I, I understand. Yeah, no problem. I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll be right there. Okay.\tUm, I\u2019m, I\u2019m really sorry. It was Ari\u2019s school. Really? Uh, I thought you said you took Arian outta school to go to New Zealand with Will and Sunny. I did. I did that, but, um, will and Sunny need her records to enroll her in this new school. We\u2019ve been having some problems. Transferring them are not something with the vaccinations.\tOh, I see. And I don\u2019t know how long this is gonna take. I really need to get there though. Yeah, yeah. But I mean, no problem. We have plenty of time for ducks another day, but I\u2019ll go with you to Ari\u2019s school. I mean That\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll figure out the mix up. That\u2019s fine. I, I can do that. It\u2019s okay. You sure? Yes, I\u2019m sure.\t", "How kind of you to let her down gently? No, no, no. See, she was the one letting me down gently because as she was expressing her feelings to me about how she could never love a man who was in love with two different women, I looked at her. It was as if all the. That I ever felt for her was gone.\tWell, uh, that\u2019s good news, right? I mean, especially for Brady. I know he could use that right now. So that\u2019s why you missed cocktail hour yesterday. We were waiting for you. My apologies. Oh, please. And I\u2019m required, we\u2019ll have plenty of opportunities to raise your glass together. I look forward to it. As do I.\tSo amay right to assume that this means you will soon be reunited with Gavin. Are you asking me as my brother concerned about my love life or a COCE of Damara Enterprises concerned about his standings within the. I\u2019ll admit to the former and not deny the matter. And yes, it is my fervent wish to be reunited with the woman I love.\tHulton. What are you doing here? Uh, well I\u2019m here with my brother and his friend because for some damn reason Gabby made a commitment to stay with her husband, bonk. Sorry, does my French also hurt your ears? Everything you say hurts my ears. You sure this isn\u2019t S delivery? Come on. You know Mercedes doesn\u2019t make their tortillas from scratch.\tGo ahead, try them.\tOkay. I guess just, okay. Okay. What do you want a medal for? Not screwing up a recipe. Cavi. Um, I\u2019m not asking you to pretend to like me. This arrangement we have, I, I I want you to be yourself authentic. Aw. Thank you for giving me permission. I didn\u2019t mean it that way.\tI know that you\u2019re always authentic and though I know I deceived you in the past, uh, I, I\u2019m determined to be honest from now on and to be. So let\u2019s just, you know, give it a try. Okay. Would you, would you like some more hot sauce? Sure. Why not?\tIf one thing\u2019s painfully clear, I have the devil Rose dev rows no longer run the spectator. Mm-hmm. . Yeah. Gwen Zander may have used this as a hit job, but the thing is they\u2019re not wrong. Oh my God. What Brady and Eric did to Stephan, no wonder they\u2019re in serious trouble. Yeah. Well, I mean, there is one sliver of hope in all this.\tI was on the case.\tOh. Oh, you had no. Right. You had no choice but to pull an insanely stupid and risky stunt because you couldn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know, use your head. Stephan was never willingly gonna let Ralf deprogram him. So, uh, I had to force things a little bit. Yeah. Okay. That\u2019s not an excuse Brady. That\u2019s a confession. He was terrorizing Chloe.\tOkay. Remember Chloe? You\u2019re good friend. You know who she is? I know who is terrorizing her. Okay. What do you mean by he was terrorizing her? By his, by his, by his obsession bell. Yeah. His all-consuming love for Chloe. And the only reason he felt it was because that lunatic Rolf messed with his brain. You understand?\tHey, it was borderline stalking. That\u2019s what it was. She had to leave town just to get away from him to have a little bit of space. You understand why I had to step in and do something, right? Okay. Yes, I understand your motivation. Okay, but you understand we have no case here. Even if I could prove that Stefan was a threat, which is doubtful, your actions were a bit extreme and completely indef defenses.\tAnd what about you, bro? What\u2019s your excuse?\tI am surprised that you have it in for Eric Brady. Did junior paralegal have a falling out? For the record? Eric Brady was never my employee. Never once did he provide professional services for me. And what kind of services did he provide? Ms. Peterson, he stole legal documents from me. That\u2019s what kind of service he provided.\tHe snuck into my briefcase without my permiss. Stole some documents and used them to perpetrate a fraud. All without my knowledge, he caused irreparable damage to my reputation, which was spotless until now, of course, you being so moral and ethical, the only thing I\u2019m concerned about right now is are you gonna do your job or not?\tAre you gonna prosecute this offender to the full extent of the law or just love snide comments at me and then collect your paycheck? How about all of the above? I am a multihyphenate. After all. I can think of one or two other things that you are. I do have one question for you, Sloan, before you go. Um, if I put Eric in three hots and a cot, who\u2019s gonna make you hot in your cut?\tMy excuse is helping Brady do what needed to be done. Right? Yeah. I guess the family loyalty runs deep when it comes to your brother, but when it comes to your sister as just another story, right? Are you seriously gonna make this about yourself? You made this about me when you assaulted my husband. And then questioned my professional judgment for defending Paul and Chanel against your malicious girlfriend\u2019s.\tFrivolous lawsuits. Yeah. Well, not that that\u2019s relevant, frankly, none of your business, but still not my girlfriend. Whatever we are, we aren\u2019t anymore. Hmm. Is that because you took my advice and dumped that bitch, or is it because she cast you? When she, when she realized your idiotic decision to pose as her paralegal and misrepresent yourself to someone in police custody, , which to state the obvious, did real damage to any case they had against Lee Shin, which means that Da Trask now wants your head on a pike outside of the courthouse, and I am inclined to give it to her.\t"], "answer": [0, 4, 2, 3, 1]}

I want to make sure I do all that before I wake up one day and realize it\u2019s too late. Okay. I had feelings for her too! Am I being impulsive? Hell, yes.

Quartermaine \u2014 what do you know about respect?\t[ Sighs ] If you will allow me a moment \u2014 oh, you have had all the time in the world to figure out how to worship the ground brook lynn walks on. Now you want more time? No. Sorry. Time\u2019s up. Is there a problem here? I\u2019m sorry, joss. I can\u2019t use that evidence against sonny. Why not? I told willow I wouldn\u2019T. Why would you involve willow in this? You don\u2019t want to lie to dex. I don\u2019t want to lie to willow. So after our wedding, when willow told me that she wanted me to co-exist with sonny, I showed her the pikeman evidence and I told her my plan to turn sonny in. Look, I get it. Willow wants everybody to get along, but she can\u2019t see all of the damage that sonny\u2019s done? The lives he\u2019s wrecked and the danger surrounding him? I mean, have you \u2014 have you talked to her about morgan? Yes, I talked to her about morgan. I talked to her about you and all my siblings and how much I love you all. And she helped me realize that by turning sonny in, I\u2019d be blowing my family apart, and the ones who\u2019d be suffering the most would be avery and donna. Because you know what? Sonny is their father, and they love him. And if I were to send him to prison, which side are they supposed to choose? Will they keep loving me? Will they keep loving him? And which big sister would they count on, you or kristina, when neither one of you can stand to be in the same room together without giving each other death glares. Okay, okay. I get it. It\u2019s one big, emotional, complicated mess. But there had to have been a better solution than hanging dex out to dry. You think michael\u2019s lying? Well, sonny, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s worth entertaining the idea that he might be stringing you along. He came to you only because willow pushed him to, and you \u2014 you know that he would do anything for willow. And now he gets to determine your placement in the family contingent on you agreeing to his agenda, which means staying silent while willow keeps me out of her life. Now, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not \u2014 I\u2019m not saying that you should refuse his terms. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m just asking you to consider that michael might not hold up his end of the deal. Well, things have been difficult with me and michael for awhile, but, I-I\u2026 I believe that when he came to me, he was sincere and he\u2019s gonna do what he says. Yeah, and I know that you will do anything to reconnect with \u2014 with your family. But you have to understand this \u2014 that excludes me. Hey, ned got us into this mess. Ned is gonna get us out of it. How is he gonna do that? I mean, even if he takes back his accusations, it\u2019s still in the sec\u2019s hands. Y-yeah, but he was at the helm of elq for decades. He\u2019s built contacts. He\u2019s got influence. Michael ran elq for the past 10 years. What kind of influence does ned have? Well, I\u2019m just saying that he\u2019s had plenty of time to build government contacts, right? He\u2019s got lots of favors owed to him, so if he still knows what strings to pull, he could probably get the sec off our backs. Why would ned do that? We just got to find the right leverage to use against him. That could get us out of this. The question is\u2026 what do we use?\t", "Don\u2019t mention it. I didn\u2019t even see you there. Why didn\u2019t you say hello? Uh\u2026 you know, you handled it like a pro. You recovered on your own. You didn\u2019t need me stepping in. Were you ever going to tell me? Probably not. Why not? Honestly, I didn\u2019t know how you were going to react. Like you said, we didn\u2019t exactly leave things on the friendliest of terms last time. I\u2019m sorry. I judged you too quickly. You were defending your mother-in-law, which I could almost respect, if gladys hadn\u2019t framed me for stealing that bracelet. Finn: It\u2019s really great. Violet will love disney world. When were you thinking? Next week. Next week? I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way we can get time off on such short notice. Why not? For one thing, violet\u2019s in school.\t[ Scoffs ] It\u2019s the end of the school year. She won\u2019t miss anything we can\u2019t teach her. I have patients. I can\u2019t request time off on such short notice. And chase just got his badge back. Don\u2019t you both have family leave coming? Come on, I already bought the tickets. Business class for all of us. No, dad, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s great. I just, uh \u2014 I just don\u2019t think we can do that. Why does it have to be now? Ms. Quartermaine, I don\u2019t know what brook lynn has told you. She doesn\u2019t have to tell me anything. It\u2019s all over her face. She moved heaven and earth for you, and you repaid her by breaking her heart. It\u2019s more complicated than that. What it is, detective, is you looking down from your high horse and judging her when you really should be thanking your lucky stars she ever gave you the time of day. So quit stalling. Either forgive her and skip off into the sunset or cut her loose. Personally, I think she\u2019d be much better off if you took your charms and found someone who meets your lofty moral standards and leave her to find someone who is actually worthy of the air she breathes. I can\u2019t believe that you would suggest I throw you under the bus. I can\u2019t believe that you would think I would do something like that. Carly. I know that that\u2019s not your style, but this \u2014 this is not good. This is a bad situation. We got to consider all of the options. I can\u2019t see you go to prison. I can\u2019t see you go to prison, okay? I\u2019m not gonna save myself at your expense. Well, turning on you is obviously a non-starter as well. Great. Then we\u2019re on the same page. I will always protect you. Always. You know, there might not be a way out of this. Diane said the sec has a really good case against us. Yeah, well, I did tell you about a potential merger with elq, and you did buy stock in aurora. Yeah, well, you were just trying to take your family\u2019s business back from valentin, and I was just trying to help you and michael. I know that. I know that. You know that. But the sec, they don\u2019t care. [ Sighs ] I mean, josslyn, she\u2019s old enough to handle anything thrown at her. And michael, he has a family of his own. But I can\u2019t stand the thought of being away from donna and avery. I mean, it\u2019s bad enough that they were away from their dad all those months. How do I look at them and tell them that I have to go away? Look, we\u2019re gonna find a way out of this. We\u2019re gonna beat this. What about you? You were away from your family for two years. How do we beat this without turning on each other? The only way to do that is to go after the person that ratted us out. Michael\u2019s still angry, but willow pushed him to talk to me. Willow\u2019s quite the peacemaker. But peace is never simple. What was michael\u2019s condition? Um\u2026 willow gets to decide if she wants a relationship with you and what that relationship looks like. He\u2019s not going to pressure one way or the other. He\u2019s just going to let her decide. So he\u2019s doing the same thing that carly\u2019s doing \u2014 reinforcing willow\u2019s animosity towards me with his silence. Nina, I want you to have a relationship with willow. I told michael I can\u2019t control what you do. He was clear on that. But I\u2019m not going to pressure willow either. So you have to stay neutral so you don\u2019t lose your son again. You understand, don\u2019t you? Sonny\u2026 what makes you think that you can trust michael? You have feelings for dex, and it\u2019s pretty obvious that he has feelings for you, too. I mean, how could he not? Before he met you, he had no one. No family, no home, no significant ties. He was literally a hired gun, and that\u2019s what I wanted. I wanted somebody who was willing to risk their life for money. And now, josslyn, he is risking his life for you. You\u2019re the only one who can stop this. You\u2019re the only one who can send him away. Well, I won\u2019T. You know he\u2019d be better off. I don\u2019t know what would happen to dex if he left here, michael, and neither do you. What I do know is I\u2019m not gonna lie to him. I\u2019m not gonna tell him that I want him to go when I don\u2019T. It\u2019s dex\u2019s life. He can make his own decisions. The only way to save this is for you to do what you were supposed to do in the first place and turn sonny in.\t", "not that I\u2019m complaining, but why did you bring me here? Yeah. Well, all will be revealed. Here. Have a seat right here. Okay. Okay. Thank you. There we go. You\u2019re welcome. So, yeah. Why\u2026here? Why here? Well\u2026 I thought we really deserved some time together to enjoy each other. And the metro court is just so close to G.H., And if michael and willow need us, we can be there in a minute. But I also realize that you used to be co-owner here, so if being here hurts more than it helps, then\u2026 being with you, here or anywhere, is just perfect. Hey, dad. Finn. Thanks for making time to meet up with me. I know it was last minute. Oh, of course. You said you had news that couldn\u2019t wait. But it\u2019s going to have to wait just another minute. Wait. Did tracy quartermaine actually come back to port charles and just not tell me? She did. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. How are you, finn? I\u2019m happy to see you. And likewise. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m really sorry that I haven\u2019t been in touch. I\u2019ve been caught up in family drama. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. That sounds made up, but you know what? I\u2019m gonna let it slide this time.\t[ Chuckles ] Finn? Oh. Oh, care to introduce us? Yes. No, of course. Professor gregory chase, my father. My very good friend, tracy quartermaine. Nice to meet you, tracy. Likewise, professor chase. Oh, no, please, gregory. Oh. Would you like to join us? Under other circumstances, I would be delighted, but I\u2019m actually meeting somebody. Oh. And there he is now. Don\u2019t worry, I was just leaving. Please don\u2019T. I came here to find you. Why? I want to know why you\u2019re still keeping things from me.\t[ Sighs ] Gladys, so nice to see you.\t[ Chuckles ] So this is about your little iou? So I\u2019m guessing you talked to dex. Yeah, I did. Last night. He asked me to meet him on the hospital roof. I thought he was being romantic, but when I got up there, he was waiting for me, and he pulled me in so close, and he told me that we had to say goodbye. Because of you. That was quite a welcome. Yeah. You okay? What? Something happen? Sonny, I-I-I need to tell you something. I\u2026 I-I\u2019ve been thinking about willow, and, um\u2026 you know, she \u2014 she wants me to make peace with carly. But, you know, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s just one thing I\u2019m never gonna be able to give her.\tI don\u2019t feel like hanging around hearing any more false accusations, so please excuse me. I hear you came to the home & heart studio while I was promoting the deceptor. Ah, that. Yes. Uh, well, what can I say? Big fan of skincare. Can\u2019t you tell by my baby-soft face? Maxie told me you had a different reason for being there. What does she know? I-I don\u2019t remember seeing her at the studio. She knows what lucy told her. Which was\u2026? That you were gonna take off all your clothes for me.\t[ Scoffs ] Finn: Hey. Chase: Hey. Just when did the two of you start socializing? Since I was apprised of chase\u2019s association with my granddaughter. I know a lot about chase, and chase knows nothing about me, so I thought I\u2019d rectify that with a little one-on-one experience. Shall we? I will be in touch about a game of backgammon soon.\t[ Whispers ] Good luck. She seems nice. Does she? To you, for always knowing what I need before I do. Thank you for always making me feel better. I feel exactly the same way. Thank you for being in my life.\t[ Glasses clink ] Well, to us. To us.\t[ Laughs ] Real world incoming. Carly, drew. I\u2019m so surprised to see you both out and about. Well, you know, the sec hasn\u2019t hauled us off to prison just yet, tracy, despite ned\u2019s best efforts. I\u2019m sure justice will prevail. Have a nice night. Is she always like that? Pretty much.Pretty much. Good to know. Oh, can you tell willow I say hi and that I\u2019m sending good thoughts her way? Of course. Thanks. She has such a sunny disposition, you know? Tracy spreads joy wherever she goes. Doesn\u2019t she? Mm. Hey, you want to get out of here? No. Changing locations won\u2019t help. As much as I\u2019d like to, we can\u2019t ignore the trouble we\u2019re in\u2026 or what it means for us. Dex did not actually say, \u201cwe have to say goodbye because of michael.\u201d He told me he was leaving, and when I asked him why, he told me that your deal was off. I literally could not believe what I was hearing. He continued to explain, and then I got it. You changed your mind? I know that you\u2019re upset. Upset? Michael, I\u2019m furious! You hired dex to work for sonny to get evidence against him, and now that dex has risked his life to give you what you want, you don\u2019t want it anymore? I know I put dex in a tough spot. Tough spot? You put him in an impossible spot. The understanding was he was gonna get that evidence, you\u2019d give that evidence to the fbi, and then sonny would go to prison! The job would be over, and dex would have the rest of his life carefree of retaliation. But if you don\u2019t give that evidence to the fbi, then sonny doesn\u2019t go to prison, does he? And dex is trapped. Josslyn, dex understood that there were significant risks that came with this job. Not the risk of you backing out last minute. Now that dex has worked in sonny\u2019s organization for more than six months, now that he knows too much about sonny for sonny to ever let him quit, there\u2019s no way out of it for him. Yes, there is. You just told me that he\u2019s leaving. No, he\u2019s not. He \u2014 he agreed to stay. Because of you? Partly. Joss? Yes. Yeah, okay? He\u2019s staying because of me. How could you do that to him? Sonny: I know it\u2019s an uphill battle for you, honoring what willow wants, but all you can do is try. Well, that\u2019s the thing, sonny. I have tried. I\u2019ve gone to carly like, twice, and I\u2019ve owned up to my actions, and I apologized. I even asked her to try and help me make amends with willow. And carly said no? Well, a simple \u201cno\u201d isn\u2019t good enough for carly. See, when I, uh, ran into her at G.H., I apologized for blaming her for getting in between willow and me, and then aunt liesl and drew, they arrived, so she wasn\u2019t able to respond. And then, last night, she called me and she said, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you come over?\u201d And I assumed it was just to finish our conversation\u2026 right. \u2026And I took it as a positive sign, right? But it\u2019s just that carly, she just wanted me to beg a little bit more before she shot me down. She refuses to help me, sonny. And she says the same thing all the time. She says, \u201cI\u2019m gonna respect willow\u2019s decision, whether it\u2019s for you or against you.\u201d But did she say she\u2019s gonna work against you? I\u2019m just asking. Well, she might as \u2014 she might as well have. I get it. Nobody gets it more than me. I understand why willow is upset with me. I do. I make mistakes all the time. I continue to make mistakes. One of the mistakes is suing michael and willow for visitation rights with wiley. You know, I could have handled that better. But this is the thing \u2014 as long as carly supports willow\u2019s decision to keep me out of her life, willow will never reconsider. I hate that you\u2019re going through this. I love that you\u2019re on my side. It means the world to me, especially when it feels like no one else is.\t", "Guilty as charged. I \u2014 I did threaten to streak on that telecast. Why would you do that? I had heard that you were being trolled on social media. Um, they were suggesting that you were gonna have another breakdown, and, uh, I couldn\u2019t stand for that. So I booked it down to the studio, and when I got there, the producer and the production assistant were playing the sounds of babies crying into your earpiece. Um\u2026 so I started to strip.\t[ Chuckles ] But then I saw that you didn\u2019t need me stepping in. You could handle it yourself. I also did have some words with that host, haven, too. What did you tell her? Let\u2019s just say that it\u2019s safe for you to go back on that channel without ever being messed with again. I can\u2019t believe you did all this for me. Last time I saw you, I told you I couldn\u2019t trust you. No one\u2019s ever trusted me. Story of my life. I\u2019m ready to take care of my debt. Selina: You have the money you owe me? I have something even better \u2014 information. Regarding\u2026? Okay, um\u2026\t[ Whispers ] Sonny\u2019s biggest bruiser was handing cash to one of sonny\u2019s other guys. You saw one of sonny\u2019s employees receive payment?\t[ Stammers ] It was more than just a week\u2019s salary. It was a big, thick envelope. How sonny pays his employees is none of my concern. N\u2013 wh\u2013 I\u2019m telling you, there was something special about this. Something had to have happened for sonny to be spreading the wealth around like that. That may be useful. Yeah. Useful enough to cover my debt? I\u2019ll knock five grand off. But I\u2019m afraid you still owe me 80k. I don\u2019t have that kind of money. This is upsetting, very upsetting.\t[ Scoffs ] So what\u2019s this news you have for me?\t[ Sighs ] I got plane tickets for all of us to go to disney world. It\u2019ll be the perfect family vacation \u2014 you, me, chase, and violet. She\u2019s never been. She talks about it constantly. She wants to visit cinderella\u2019s castle and fly on dumbo. And, oh, she says she needs to have a conversation with all the disney princesses. Of course she does. So, come on, we\u2019ll tell her that it\u2019s for her birthday. It\u2019ll be the trip of a lifetime. Thank you for the invitation, but I am curious \u2014 what did you want to talk to me about? I mean, I\u2019m a detective and I\u2019m stumped.\t[ Chuckles ] Well, you\u2019re not much of a detective, are you? Let me spell it out for you. Do you know how diane said that we would be pitted against each other? Mm-hmm. Well, I was talking to my mom last night \u2014 and she told you to take the deal? No. But she didn\u2019t tell you not to. It doesn\u2019t matter, because I would never do that. Look, we\u2019re going to be getting a lot of pressure, okay? On both of us. Tracy suggested something similar to me. That\u2019s because tracy is a compulsive schemer, and she expects everyone to respond the way she would.\t[ Softly ] Carly. Maybe you should reconsider. Maybe you should testify against me. The only way that dex can stay in port charles is if he continues to work for sonny. Yes, and that\u2019s because sonny\u2019s not going to prison where he belongs, and that\u2019s because of you. Right. Yes. I hired dex with the understanding that he would get close to sonny, gather evidence against him, then turn that evidence over to me, then I would handle it from there. \u2018Cause, dex, he was supposed to be already out of it at this point, and he still could be. I gave him a lot of money. From what I understand, so did sonny. All dex has to do is get on a bus or a ferry to canada and buy himself a new identity. And he might not even have to do that, because sonny wasn\u2019t arrested, so he\u2019s not going to be looking for an informant. He could take off, and I doubt sonny would do much to find him. Okay. Okay. This is pointless, alright? I already told you that he\u2019s not going anywhere. Right, because you want him to stay. Despite the risks. Despite the fact that if sonny finds out, he could have dex killed, and that\u2019s gonna be on me. Oh. Oh, exactly, michael. You just don\u2019t want dex on your conscience. It\u2019s easier to throw money at him and pay him to go away. You don\u2019t even see him as a real person. You don\u2019t give a damn what he wants or how he feels. But do you do. Yeah. Nina, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m on your side. I know what it means to you to have a daughter. I know, you know, the chance to be a mother, especially when you thought that that was stolen from you\u2026 I want you and willow to move forward. Shouldn\u2019t we do it together as a family? Actually, uh, michael came to me. He wants peace. That\u2019s great. But that peace comes on one condition.\t"], "answer": [3, 4, 2, 1, 0]}

I appreciate you saying that, but I don\u2019t think it would do any good. Mm-hmm. honestly. Kristen has done such a good job of turning her against Chloe, that anytime anyone brings up that subject, Rachel just shuts down or she goes on the attack or she has a tantrum.\tWell, I wish I could say I\u2019ve been surprised by Kristen using her own daughter in that manner, but we both know that that woman will stop at nothing to get what she wants. It\u2019s true. The only thing she wants right now, the her, her main goal in life right now. Hmm. It is just to keep cling me apart. Go on.\tWhat the hell do I need to hear? Well, you\u2019ve heard it before, since you don\u2019t seem to retain anything in that pea size brain of yours, and since Stephan dumped you for a woman who actually has a personality, meaning you\u2019re on the market again, and I will say this for the umpteenth time. You stay the hell away from Brady.\tLet\u2019s get one thing straight. Kristin, who I choose to date is none of your damn business. Well, it is my damn business when it concerns the welfare of my daughter. Well, I\u2019m going to say this one more time. Since you can\u2019t seem to retain anything in that evil, twisted brain of yours, I would never do anything to hurt Rachel.\tWell, you obviously not endeared yourself to her. In fact, Chloe, she can\u2019t stand the side of. And whose fault is that? You\u2019ve done everything in your power to turn that little girl against me. Well, I didn\u2019t have to do much. My sweet Rachel is an excellent judge of character. Your sweet Rachel is now a little monster, and if you and Brady aren\u2019t careful, she\u2019s gonna grow up to become just as deranged as her mother.\tThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about,\tYou know, it\u2019s so good to see that beautiful smile on your face again.

No, I don\u2019t know anything about that. I haven\u2019t spoken to Chloe. Why would she come here to see you anyway? Oh, we talked on this new invention called the telephone. Hey, here\u2019s something new.\tWhy don\u2019t you try leaving her the hell alone? Why don\u2019t you do that? Calm down, Brady. I merely offered my condolence suit about the end of her relationship with my brother, and she got testy and she got nasty and she called our daughter a monster Brady. Say this.

You\u2019re sorry, Alex. We are doing the conference room in five minutes and what happened to your. Sander happened. Sander, and what did you, no, you know what? Just scratch that.

But Xander targeted you because of me.\tUm, you know, um, maybe we should just, you know, call it.\tNo way. A little bump on head is not gonna scare me off. Zander be damned. I think that we should let this ride and see what it takes us. What do you think? It\u2019s like a plan. It sounds like a plan.\tI do your makeup next time.\tOh, amazing. So it was all just delivered. Oh, thank you. Of course, Leo didn\u2019t tip your delivery person. He\u2019s such a stingy little creep. Nicole, thank you. I, I owe you my life. Thank. Love you. Bye. Ugh. I am off hook. Leo got his merchandise. Now I\u2019m saved from that gossip column. Ah, Chloe. I\u2019m afraid no one is saved from the lady.\tWhat is that supposed to mean? Leo just turned in this new column, Chloe Lane Brady. Daughter is a deranged monster like her mother. Oh my God. That double crossing snake Xander. After everything that Brady and I have been through, we finally had a chance at a fresh start. Now you still did. You, you tell Brady that is so alive, but it\u2019s not.\tI actually said this. I let Kristin der go me into insulting their daughter, and now when Brady sees this, I am gonna lose him forever. Oh my God. On my God.\tIs this house gonna be till Rachel\u2019s 18? A tug of war of threats back and forth. I threatened to take her away from you. You threatened to take her away from me. You made it the. I did not want it to be like this. Oh, right, right, right. Because I am always the bad guy. You are the one that stoked Rachel\u2019s resentment of Chloe in the first place.\tOkay. You have used our daughter as a weapon against the woman that I love. You are using my love for my daughter against me.

Will that satisfy you?\tMake it glowing,\tWell, you and Stephanie seem to be getting along pretty well these days. Yeah. Yeah. Things are good. And the kids, they love her. Well, dad seems to be pretty fond of her too. I am. I don\u2019t have to tell you how hard it is to move on after you lose the, the love of your life. No. No, you don\u2019t.

You just got done giving me some sound advice, right? So allow me to return the favor. Aunt liesl, don\u2019t shut out people who love you. You know, scott can support you during this time that you\u2019re dealing with britt\u2019s death. Life is so fragile. We need to spend the little time that we have left with the people we love. If josslyn broke up with cameron, that\u2019s her decision. I don\u2019t know. Maybe I just want someone to be mad at, and dex is a convenient target. Why do you need a target, spencer? Because cam is leaving, britt is dead, and my little brother\u2019s in prison bonding with esme when he should be bonding with his real family. Is that long enough of a laundry list for you? Okay, you know what? You have diane working her magic. She\u2019s gonna get you custody of your baby brother. Well, it cannot happen soon enough. Are you leaving? Yes, I am.

Why did i hate you so much? Are you admitting that you\u2019re guilty? I can\u2019t say that. But people have told me the person that I was before, and everybody says that I\u2019m a terrible excuse for a human being. What do you think? I mean, if I really did what I\u2019m accused of, I\u2026 think they\u2019re right. But it\u2019s like they\u2019re talking about someone else, someone who terrifies me.

He doesn\u2019t even know that I\u2019m here. Are you his girlfriend? Uh\u2026 we\u2019re friends. Okay, so if spencer didn\u2019t send you, then what are you doing here? I wanted to see how you were and the baby were doing for myself. Why do you care? Because we all want what\u2019s best for the baby. His name is ace. Ace. Right. Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s best for him to stay with his mother? I think you\u2019re really lucky that spring ridge is letting you have him with you. But is it really the best place for ace to be raised in a prison? Of course not. But I won\u2019t give up my baby. I mean, he should be with me. He needs me. And I need him, and\u2026 I can hardly believe he\u2019s mine, but he is. And I can\u2019t imagine life without him. I love him so much. I can see that. Look, I\u2019m sorry for everything I did to you and your friends, but I\u2019m not that person. I don\u2019t even remember who that person was. So to go to prison now for something that I don\u2019t even remember doing, I mean, it just doesn\u2019t seem fair to me or ace. I wish we could all forget that, too. Look, my parents were insane. And my lawyer says that I\u2019m not responsible because my dad was influencing me. No one forced you to drug me or to record joss and cam having sex. Well, do you know that for sure?

So, mother and baby are down for a nap. How are you? I\u2019m, uh \u2014 I\u2019m fine. You don\u2019t have to worry about me. Not for a second. I do worry about you. I know it\u2019s not easy playing the waiting game. Or watching willow struggle to do the simplest of things. It\u2019s got to be heartbreaking. Yeah, sometimes I have to leave the room just for a moment. Long enough to get myself back under control. So I can be the partner that willow needs me to be. You are. You are. I, uh\u2026 I can\u2019t lose her.\tWe can\u2019t lose her. She has to be okay.\t[ Softly ] Come here. It\u2019ll be okay. It\u2019ll be okay. What do you think I\u2019m lying to sonny about? Joss, for starters. You were told to stay away from her, correct? But as soon as you\u2019d heard that she\u2019d broken up with cam, there you were, moving right on in. Where are you getting your information? Are you denying it? So you\u2019re not sneaking around with joss? You\u2019ve known josslyn a long time, right? That\u2019s correct. Does she seem like the type to sneak around? No. There\u2019s your answer.\t[ Knock on door ] Oh, how long does it take to say, \u201cyes, you can donate,\u201d or \u201cno, you can\u2019t\u201d?

I\u2019m going to be willow\u2019s stem cell donor. Oh! Thank god! Oh! Aunt liesl, it\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re doing, really. But there\u2019s a problem.\tWhose are those?\t[ Sighs ] I asked gregory to give me his car keys. Why? You didn\u2019t want him driving? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to drive when you\u2019re intoxicated. Ooh. Was he over the legal limit? I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t have a breathalyzer with me. He was slurring his words and he was unstable on his feet. Okay. Well, did you smell alcohol on him? No. I don\u2019t think he was in any condition to drive. That\u2019s all. Wow. Have you ever seen him like this before? I have never seen him like this. This is completely out of character. Okay, well, maybe you are starting to see another side. Maybe I just never knew who he was in the first place. Oh, uh, why are there so many guards here? Is sonny here? No, he\u2019s out.\t", "[ Clears throat ] Don\u2019t just stand there. Show my guests inside. What \u2014 um, is trina here? Uh, she texted that she\u2019s on her way. Hey, would you mind giving my friends and I some privacy? No problem. Thanks. I\u2019ll be in my room. Great. So do you guys know what this is about? No clue. Is, uh, dex living here now? Yeah. Unfortunately. Uncle sonny invited him. Can you believe that? Um, so \u2014 so, trina called, and she said that she needed to see all of us, but she hung up before I could know what \u2014 what she was talking about. Well, when she texted that she was on her way, you know, coming over here, I assumed that she was still at kelly\u2019s with you. Oh, she took off after you left. Did she say where she was going? No. She sound okay?\t[ Knock on door ]\t[ Sighs ] Hey. What\u2019s going on? You okay? I\u2019m fine. I-I went to go see esme. Why? I wanted to see the new and improved version for myself.

You don\u2019t believe she loves her baby? What do you think? I think it\u2019s amazing how different she acts now. \u201cAct\u201d being the operative word? If esme\u2019s been faking, she\u2019s very convincing. Which is why I want to go to the D.A. And ask him to drop the charges against her. You want me? Uh, for\u2026the nurses\u2019 ball. I\u2019m, um \u2014 I\u2019m organizing the musical acts, and I want you and blaze to perform for free. Of course. I mean, I can only speak for myself, but I\u2019m in with or without blaze.

However\u2026\t[ Sighs ] \u2026We can\u2019t harvest my stem cells right away. The transplant has been put on hold. For how long? The good news is willow still has a donor. That\u2019s huge. No, it\u2019s huge. Yeah, it is huge, but every day, every second now counts, okay? And now we have to wait for aunt liesl\u2019s medication to get out of her system? I didn\u2019t even know that she was taking anticoagulants. The doctors are taking her off it, but it\u2019s not safe to donate until, you know, it\u2019s completely out of her system. We\u2019re running out of time. My daughter needs a transplant. Now. We can\u2019t afford to wait.\tHe\u2019s furious with me. He accused me of being self-righteous and incapable of admitting when I was wrong. Which is not wrong. He said that I was projecting my alcoholism on everyone else because I am one. No, you don\u2019t do that. Mm\u2026maybe I do. You know, I\u2019m hypersensitive about problem drinking, for obvious reasons. And maybe I just went too far. You know, he did seem a little unsteady to me, but, mom, one day of day drinking doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re an alcoholic. I know. I know that. I know. Something\u2019s not right, though. I mean, what triggered my instinct is how he reacted when I asked him if he had been drinking. He was immediately hostile and immediately defensive. And that\u2019s a classic alcoholic trick. Self-righteousness and then a stormy exit. I know it well. I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just that, given my history, I am telling you, he is hiding something. Trina, the D.A. Isn\u2019t just gonna drop the charges against esme because we ask. He certainly didn\u2019t drop them against you when we asked. Look, as long as esme is in prison, so is ace. We have to do something. I am doing something. And that does not include dropping the charges against esme. She needs to pay for what she did to all of you. And that\u2019s why esme can\u2019t be charged right now. You\u2019ve got mail. I wish I could talk to willow. Don\u2019t worry. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not going to. I know she doesn\u2019t want to talk to me, and I\u2019m not going to upset her. I just\u2026 I want to hear her voice. You want me to make you something? No, baby, I\u2019m not hungry. Do you want to tell me why there\u2019s two bodyguards out front? I\u2019m adding extra security. Why? We\u2019ll talk about it later. No, we can talk \u2014 you\u2019ve got a lot going on. No, we can talk about it now. Uh, there was an incident last night. What do you mean, an incident? Were you \u2014 were you in danger? Are you hurt? No, I\u2019m not hurt. You see I\u2019m here. What happened? You\u2019re the one who decided you didn\u2019t want to know anything about my business. Okay, trina, you\u2019ve lost me. Believe me, I\u2019m in no way anxious to sit through a trial and have our sex tape brought up again. But I will happily do it. Because esme needs to face justice. Mm-hmm.

Let\u2019s give your mom some time. Can you please, for now, just accept the fact that ck is a very dangerous person, and he needs to be avoided at all costs?\tFaith: Of course.

And according to the bartender, he hasn\u2019t been there all day.\tSharon: Then nick was right. It was just another tactic to get to me and it worked.\tNick: Do you have enough now? Clearly, this run-in with our daughter was planned. He\u2019s not hiding out. He is taunting sharon. Can you at least find out where he\u2019s staying?\tChance: Nick. You wanna put this guy away for good, right? Then, we have to play this by the book. I do not have enough to arrest him. I don\u2019t even have enough to question the guy.

I imagine you feel like a bit of an outsider.\tAdam: You know, I was able to be there for her today because she couldn\u2019t reach nick. It just\u2013 it stings that I wasn\u2019t her first call. I\u2019m the baby\u2019s father. But I get why it might be confusing for connor. I mean, maybe, that\u2019s what\u2019s going on with him.

What\u2019s her name? Maybe, um\u2013 maybe, you should, uh, continue to make your case someplace a little bit more private.\tTucker: Now, you see, that\u2019s the kind of million dollar idea that I\u2019m talking about.\tAshley: Okay.\tJack: Okay, why do I get the feeling those two are up to something?\tDiane: Oh, who cares?

A good deal is where everybody gets something\u2026 and everybody gives up something. The night that we met in the motel, I thought we were gonna hook it up, but, uh, well, then, you decided to hit me over the head with that bottle.\tSharon: You were trying to rape me.\tCameron: You know what? I\u2013 I\u2013 I still\u2013 I can\u2019t believe how strong you were. The way you could drag me down all those steps. I didn\u2019t think a little girl like you could do that, huh?\tSharon: I thought you were dead.\tCameron: Yeah. Obviously. When I came to a couple hours later behind that dumpster, covered in snow, frozen\u2026 I don\u2019t think I have ever been angrier in my life.\tSharon: And that\u2019s when you decided to destroy me.\tCameron: What are you talking about, destroy you? Honey, you\u2019re my dream girl. You just weren\u2019t being that cooperative. So, I need to talk to gabe about frank\u2019s demise. All right. You know what? That\u2019s all in our past. You are here now. I\u2019m here. We\u2019re together. And I love you.\t[ Cameron sighing ]\tSharon: The vineyard just sounds so familiar to me, and yet, I can\u2019t place it.\tAdam: Well, what did the card say?\tSharon: Said, \u201cmemories are what life is made of.\u201d\t", "[ Sally exhaling sharply ]\t[ Sally sighing ]\t[ Knocking on door ]\tSally: Oh, nick.

That they hired us to define their new style for chancellor-winters, but I just think it\u2019s really smart to involve them early on because then we can help guide them to what we are envisioning. What? What\u2019s wrong?\tNick: I want extra guards stationed here and regular checks of the grounds. You see anything suspicious, you let me know. All right. Thanks. All right. Security\u2019s beefed up just in case cameron tries to do something stupid, like come back to genoa city.\tSharon: Thank you.\tNick: I\u2019ll let my dad know too.\tSharon: Well, that makes me feel better, but I don\u2019t\u2013 I don\u2019t wanna overreact.\tNick: Sharon, when cameron kirsten\u2019s involved, there\u2019s no such thing as overreacting.\tSharon: I can\u2019t help thinking about those creepy packages. Now, I\u2019m convinced that was blood that we saw on the champagne bottle. And he is trying to send a message with that motel matchbook.\tNick: Try not to let him get in your head.\tSharon: How could I not? They were hand delivered.\tNick: He could have paid someone to do that.\tSharon: Or it could mean cameron\u2019s already here.\tCameron: You okay?\tFaith: It was me. I\u2019m an idiot. My boyfriend is always on me not to walk and text.\tCameron: Don\u2019t you hate it when your significant other is right?\tFaith: Totally. But I am sorry.\tCameron: No harm, no foul. Let\u2019s just chalk it up to, um, a cautionary lesson.\tFaith: I will never multitask while texting again.\tCameron: Yeah. I don\u2019t believe you, but, uh, I appreciate the promise.

Him on drums, me on xylophone.\tAshley: Sorry I missed that. I\u2019m sure it was pretty cute.\tTucker: It was. I\u2019m telling you, man, he is a prodigy.

We\u2019ve got this.\tSally: I know, but it\u2019s just when we landed our first client and there is so much to do. I\u2013 if we do not impress chancellor-winters, our company is dead in the water. So, I really hate to put this on you, but I\u2019m really gonna need you to take the lead on this for now.\tChloe: Of course. We\u2019re gonna figure this out. Okay?

Wait, wait.\tAshley: Why?\tTucker: Well\u2013\tAshley: She\u2019s clearly in violation of her bail restrictions.\tTucker: No, I understand. It\u2019s very suspicious.

I\u2019ve gotta protect my family.\tTucker: How do you plan to do that?\tAshley: You. Yeah, you. If I\u2019m gonna protect my family right from her greedy hands, I need a support system.

[ Laughs ]\tAshley: What?\tTucker: I can just see that brilliant brain of yours working away.\tAshley: Mm, I gotta do something that just stops diane in her tracks before she marries my brother and has even more power.\tAdam: Our little girl\u2019s gonna be strong, fierce.

To the man that I will be forever grateful to and for.\tAshley: Oh, god, I just find them both so nauseating. It just makes me wanna focus that much harder on my plan.\tTucker: Do you care to fill me in?\tAshley: I think that our fake engagement, we could actually use it to our benefit \u2019cause it\u2019s the perfect distraction to make a move against diane.\tTucker: Uh-huh. What move is that?\tAshley: Okay, well, I\u2013 I know that it was billy who told jack, right? I know. But that\u2019s okay, I figured he would, and I can work around him, right? \u2018Cause I\u2019ve already reached out to the board, so I know what we can do.\tTucker: Yeah, you\u2013 you keep saying \u201cwe,\u201d but you\u2019ve only mentioned things you\u2019re doing.\tAshley: I want you to come work with me at jabot.\t[ Tucker laughs ] What? Strike the numbers.\tTucker: Oh, honey. I love how your mind works, you know that, but\u2026 I think you should consider the possibility that you are taking this whole thing way too seriously and putting way too much energy into it. You are talking about the possibility of alienating both of your brothers. Where\u2019s the rest of the family gonna fall if you\u2013 if you draw these battle lines?\tAshley: Well, I have to make them realize that the cost is gonna be huge if we let diane get what she wants.\tTucker: Mm-hmm. What if\u2026 you just let jack and diane have their happiness?\tAshley: No. Absolutely not. That would give\u2013 that would give diane a stronghold at jabot.\tTucker: What if you let her?\tAshley: Why would I do that?\tTucker: Because you don\u2019t need jabot. Hell, you don\u2019t even need the abbott family, for that matter. You know, you and i could build something that would tower over jabot.\tChelsea: Hey. I\u2019m glad I ran into you. Um, I need to talk to you about connor.\tAdam: Um, is\u2013 there\u2019s something wrong?\tChelsea: Well, that\u2019s what has me concerned.

And your instincts are telling you to protect yourself, as well. Look, no matter how good things are right now, you\u2019re already half-prepared for being disappointed all over again. But I believe that people can become the person that you want them to be, that you hoped they\u2019d be. And \u2014 and I hope that diane does that for you.

She told you she would think about it, but she was also feeling a lot of pressure, and she just doesn\u2019t need the stress right now.\tAdam: You know, it\u2019s interesting that you say you understand my situation. You act as if you\u2019ve accepted the baby is mine and that when he or she is born that I will have a role to play in their life \u2014 and in sally\u2019s, by extension. But yet this sounds awfully a lot like a warning to back the hell off.\tNick: I am not threatening you.\tAdam: No?\tNick: I am simply suggesting that you look deep inside and ask yourself, is it fair to put what you want above what sally needs?\tAdam: [ Scoffs ] You know, I\u2019m not surprised you think so little of me, nick. Although a part of me had hoped for better. And, yeah, we did clash when you got together with sally, but we were getting along for a while, and I thought our relationship had evolved. You even warned me about victor trying to screw things up for me at jabot. You know, ironically, I\u2019m not even mad about him for that anymore. He was right. I don\u2019t belong at jabot. I wasn\u2019t fulfilled there.\tNick: What, so, you went from not trusting dad and wanting anything to do with him to this?\tAdam: Trust me. No one is as surprised as I am. But I\u2019m seeing things through a new lens. You know, this whole time, i thought victor was trying to control me because he only saw me as the sum of my worst tendencies.

Not that I don\u2019t appreciate it. It\u2019s just not our usual thing.\tBilly: I can be a supportive uncle when you need me to be.\tKyle: But you\u2019d rather bust my chops every chance you get.\tBilly: Yeah, I\u2019d prefer that.\tKyle: Yeah, well, I got to get out of here. I got to get back to the office. There\u2019s a lot to tie up tonight.\tBilly: Alright. Hey, listen, if you talk to your dad, can you, uh, just ask him to give me a call?\tKyle: Yeah. Something urgent?\tBilly: Yeah. I\u2019m seriously considering his proposal.\tKyle: What proposal is that?\tTrelegy for copd.\tJeremy: So, that\u2019s it. Bare bones. It needs some work. But I can tell by that look in your eye you\u2019re intrigued. It\u2019s a good plan, right?\tPhyllis: No. I can\u2019t participate in your plan.

And afterwards, you\u2019ll be triumphant, a whole new woman.\tPhyllis: Um\u2026right. Well, I-I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good plan, actually. I think it \u2014 I just \u2014 I don\u2019t think it will work. Nothing has worked.

Within reason.\tPhyllis: What does that mean?\tJeremy: I\u2019m moving forward with the plan, but I can\u2019t do it alone. Look, this isn\u2019t for you and you don\u2019t think you have enough of an appetite for justice and revenge, then I\u2019ll find someone else.

I can\u2019t marry you because it wouldn\u2019t be fair to you or \u2014 or to your family.

The people you used and exploited. The people accused of your murder. All you left in your wake was heartache and fear and anger. Some of us got over it. Others? Like kyle? You stole from him something he can never get back. Your tore that little boy\u2019s heart out. And for that, I will never forgive you.\tDiane: Back in la, I hid my past. I was living a lie.

This has been eye-opening for me. I\u2019ve been giving you the benefit of the doubt for a long time now, but if I\u2019m honest with myself, I still have trouble trusting you, and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s ever going to change.\tDiane: [ Sighs ]\tJeremy: I was there for you, phyllis, helping you in your moment of need.\tPhyllis: [ Exhales sharply ] You brought me up here because you\u2019re still trying to devise a plan against diane and you\u2019re scheming and you want me to be a part of it.

I\u2019m gonna be a father to my child, but I\u2019m not looking to interfere with what you and she have. Does that cover the bases to your satisfaction?\tNick: Sounds like we\u2019re on the same page, which makes me happy. I\u2019m not at all worried about my relationship with sally. We are solid.

I have aspirin, too.\tPhyllis: I don\u2019t want aspirin. Thank you. I\u2019m good. I will take care of myself.\tJeremy: Tough. Self-sufficient. I admire that. But I suggest you examine what led to your incident tonight.\tPhyllis: I\u2019m getting a lecture from a felon?\tJeremy: [ Laughs ] Well, from what I\u2019ve seen, your whole world is falling apart, whether you want to admit it or not. And I bet it\u2019s tearing you up. I know what happens when you let things like that fester inside. I spent six long years in prison, and for the first couple, I was consumed with bitterness. Then one day I had a realization which gave me a sense of calm.\tPhyllis: I know you want to tell me about it, so go on.\tJeremy: I decided I wasn\u2019t gonna let those burning feelings eat me alive anymore. I was gonna use them as fuel for a plan aimed at one specific target \u2014 the person that ruined my life. And I believe that approach could work wonders for you, as well, especially since the target of your anger is the same as mine \u2014 diane jenkins. We can bring her down, phyllis.

We don\u2019t keep secrets from each other. And, no, we have no idea what the future holds. But as of right now, we want to stay together and keep building our relationship. So, if nick wants to be with me, that\u2019s his decision to make, and I hope you can respect that.\tSummer: [ Scoffs ] My dad is extremely protective of the people that he\u2019s close with. So of course his natural instinct is to stick by you, whether or not it\u2019s good for him.\tSally: Nick is happy with me. We\u2019re happy.\tSummer: You know, it wasn\u2019t too long ago that I told my dad that I thought that you were using him, but I thought it would be for money or status or the doors that he could open for you. And he told me that I was wrong.\tSally: You are.\tSummer: I knew that eventually you would show your true colors, and it seems like that time has come.\tSally: What \u2014 what does that mean?\tSummer: I think it\u2019s pretty clear, sally.

How am I gonna insinuate myself back into sally\u2019s life?\tNick: Perfect example \u2014 when you asked sally if you could be a part of all of her doctor\u2019s appointments and sonograms like you did earlier.\tAdam: Um, okay.

Just knowing that she\u2019s\u2013 she\u2019s there for me. She\u2019s got my back. I can always count on her. The kids can always count on her. There\u2019s nothing better than that.\tWyatt: Yeah. I mean, look, you\u2013 you lucked out when you married that one.\tLiam: That\u2019s true. There is no one more kind or compassionate, or with more integrity than hope logan.\tWyatt: Yep. Apple kind of fell far from the tree on that one, huh?\tLiam: Hmm?\tWyatt: With brooke? I mean, I don\u2019t mean any disrespect to brooke. Or anything\u2013\tLiam: No, no, no.\tWyatt: She\u2019s a phenomenal woman, you know what I mean? But, I mean, come on, we heard the stories about her when she was younger, when she was hope\u2019s age, you know? And\u2013\tLiam: Yeah.\tWyatt: And that whole thing.\tLiam: Yeah, they\u2019re\u2013 they\u2019re different, you know. Different personalities, different, uh, value systems.\tWyatt: Yeah. It was just\u2013 sometimes, I\u2013 I\u2013 you know, it\u2019s hard to believe that she\u2019s hope\u2019s mom.\t[ Laughing ]\tLiam: No, me too. Hope is definitely her own person. I mean, she\u2019s so\u2013 she\u2019s got, like, such a specific\u2026 moral code.\tWyatt: Right.\tLiam: You know, and she sticks with it. She, like, never strays from it. But that\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s great for me. That\u2019s why I love her so much, right? Like, I never have to worry about that. I never have to question her fidelity. Or her commitment.\tHope: I mean, you know how much I love liam, how\u2013 how hard I fought for him and for our relationship. I mean, hell, steffy, I even fought you\u2013\tSteffy: I\u2013 I\u2019m not\u2013 I\u2019m not disputing your feelings for your husband. I know you love him. It\u2019s just thomas has come a long way. He\u2019s moved on from his dysfunctional ways. He\u2019s not pining for you anymore. And I\u2019d hate to see him get caught up in all of this again.\tHope: Thomas understands that there was never anything between us, there never will be. He\u2019s finally accepted that. And that is why the line is in such a good place. It\u2019s because he and I are finally on the same page. And thomas knows how much I love liam. And between you and me, I mean, liam and I, we\u2019ve never been more connected. So, yes, while I may spend my days at work here with your brother, our relationship is purely platonic and professional. And I\u2013\t[ Clatter ] Oh, sorry. Just\u2013 yeah.\tSteffy: Look, um, I\u2019m happy that you and liam are in a good place. And hey, okay, maybe, maybe my imagination was running wild when I walked in on you and thomas.\tHope: I mean, I get it. I just\u2013 I think you were reading a little too far into things. I have a healthy working relationship with thomas. And I am happily married to liam.\tSteffy: Okay. Just, things are going so well for our families and I\u2013 I don\u2019t want anything to mess it up is all.\tHope: Well, you don\u2019t have to worry about thomas and me. Okay? I promise.\tSteffy: Okay.\t", "[ Taylor laughing ]\tHope: I thought we had already put this issue to rest.\tSteffy: I need to be absolutely sure. There is so much riding on your partnership being successful. And not just for your line, but for thomas\u2019s well-being.\tHope: Look, I get it. You\u2019re being a protective sister, which I would do the same thing if I were in your shoes. But can I ask you an honest question, steffy? I mean, you and your family, you\u2013 you truly do believe that thomas has changed, right?\tSteffy: Yes, absolutely.\tHope: Okay. So, then, am I not allowed to trust that? To appreciate the man that he\u2019s become? Someone who is kind. Who doesn\u2019t just think about himself. Who actually worked hard on the road to self-improvement.\tSteffy: That\u2019s why I don\u2019t want you unraveling all the progress thomas has made.\tHope: Steffy, I would never do that. I am rooting for him just as much as you are. And what you walked in on\u2013\tSteffy: Holding his hands?\tHope: We were caught up in the moment.\tSteffy: What kind of moment?\tHope: One of excitement. I mean, steffy, you know, better than anyone, that my line was on the brink of collapse and your brother helped save it. And not only that, we work together, we\u2019re co-parents and yes, thomas is\u2013 is now a good friend of mine.\tSteffy: That\u2019s why I need reassurance that you don\u2019t have any feelings for him.\tHope: Am I happy for thomas? Yes. Am I proud of him? Absolutely. But are there any romantic feelings, steffy? No, none at all. \u201cLook at this skin, baby.\tTaylor: Okay. So, you know I don\u2019t just come here to\u2013 to check on you, right?\tThomas: I do. Yeah, I do.\tTaylor: No, I\u2013 I\u2013 I come here because I\u2013 I also want to catch up and see your handsome face. Not just the serious stuff.\tThomas: No, you don\u2019t want to just talk about the serious stuff. Like therapy and all my past trauma. What you want to know is, you know, if I\u2019m getting enough vitamins or sleep.\tTaylor: Are you?\tThomas: Yes.\tTaylor: [ Giggles ] Okay, good. Now, honey, I am\u2013 I am, uh\u2013 I am here really for\u2013 for something very important and I\u2013 I just\u2013 I need you to be honest with me.\tThomas: Okay.\tTaylor: Have you seen the season finale of\u2013\tThomas: No, no.

That\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s really painful. Talk about trauma. You\u2019re bringing more into my life. Why would you do that? Wow! Mom!\tTaylor: You\u2019ve been so busy!

So, I kept quiet and I never went to the police. I just hid out in denver and waited for my wounds to heal. It was a really hard time in my life. I just wanted to forget that it had ever happened, but I didn\u2019t have a choice when cameron showed up in genoa city. You have to realize that when you saw me in denver, I was a different person.\tCameron: Oh, oh yeah? When\u2013 when exactly was that? When you were sitting on that bar stool pretty as a picture slamming tequila shots?\tSharon: I was in a very down, a very down time. I was running away from my own life.\tCameron: But now you\u2019re back.\tSharon: And, um, in a way, you\u2013 you did me a favor.

Why not ease up on the work and let her do more of it? I know that she could dazzle chancellor-winters. She could knock their socks off if she had the chance.\tSally: You really think so?\tAdam: As a friend and a colleague, let her show what she\u2019s got. Just\u2013 just delegate.

You can\u2019t do anything until this guy crosses the line and he knows that. He\u2019s smart. He hasn\u2019t made his way to genoa city, but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s on the agenda.\tChance: Look, I\u2013 I get it\u2019s frustrating, but know the guy\u2019s on my radar now, all right? He is a known perp contacting a former victim. That\u2019s a dangerous combination. So, here\u2019s what I think we do. If you guys get any more mysterious messages, keep sending them to me. I\u2019m gonna see if I can find out where he\u2019s been since he got outta L.A.\tNick: I do not want this guy anywhere near sharon or the girls.\tChance: I understand that.

I know. It\u2019s just, you know, I\u2019m feeling my way here \u2019cause things have been so ugly and difficult.\tKyle: Yeah, it has been for everyone. And I appreciate you doing everything you can to try to get past what\u2019s happened. Well, I guess I better get back to the house in case my parents have gone back. Um, don\u2019t forget your tablet for the office.\tSummer: Kyle, wait. Hey, we can both go home together.\tKyle: You sure? What about the gift card and the office?\tSummer: Well, I can get the gift card online and the office, it can wait \u2019til tomorrow.

It\u2019s undeniable. Chance is absolutely sure.\tSummer: That means that the charges against diane are gonna be dropped. You believed that your mom was innocent this whole time. You were right.

It\u2019s just making me dizzy.\tCameron: Yeah. Well, look in\u2013 in your condition that\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s nothing to mess around with, uh. Can I\u2013 can I call somebody for you?\tDaniel: Well, you must be relieved, kyle. Your mom\u2019s been vindicated. What our mother put you and the rest of your family through was brutal. Still can\u2019t believe she would do such a thing.\tSummer: But it wasn\u2019t mom\u2019s fault. You know, it was stark. He was the one that lured her in, manipulated her, threatened to kill her when she didn\u2019t do what he wanted. I mean, that\u2019s what she told you, right?\tDaniel: Right. And, you know, I\u2019m sure stark didn\u2019t expect to wind up dead.\tSummer: If stark had it his way, then mom would be the one that was dead right now. Both mom and diane are stark\u2019s victim.\t", "Kyle: Guess mom couldn\u2019t wait to get back out in the world. So much of rushing home to celebrate. I guess they were in a hurry too.\tSummer: Who can blame them? You know, they must be over the moon. Nobody thought that it would happen this quickly. You too. I\u2019m really happy for you.\tKyle: Yeah. Well, the relief is intense and I imagine it will only get better. But to be honest, I was terrified in certain moments, just like I know you are with phyllis right now, but I promise you, summer, we will find her and we will bring her home.\tSummer: You\u2019re so loving thinking about me and my worries right now.\tKyle: Hey, what else would I be thinking about? You know, we\u2019re a team. I love you, summer. You\u2019ve gotta know that.\tSummer: I love you too. I gotta go.\tKyle: What? Where?\tSummer: I, um, I\u2019ve got an errand that I need to run and since nobody\u2019s here to celebrate anyway\u2013\tKyle: You\u2019re leaving now? Just like that? Looking for a smarter way to mop?\tAnnouncer: The young and the restless will continue.\t[]\tDaniel: You go first.\tLily: No, you go first.\tDaniel: Okay. Um, well, it\u2019s huge. I mean, chance found proof that mom\u2019s still alive and the charges against diane are being dropped.\tLily: That\u2019s great. That\u2019s amazing. See, wasn\u2019t it worth it coming forward with the news about your mom? You did the right thing and it paid off.\tDaniel: It does feel like a big weight\u2019s been lifted.\tLily: So what\u2019s gonna happen to phyllis?\tDaniel: I have no idea how things are gonna turn out for her. And I highly doubt that she\u2019s gonna suddenly come out of hiding and face the consequences for what she did.\tLily: Why do you think that?\tDaniel: Oh, I don\u2019t know. Maybe \u2019cause of who she is and what she\u2019s done so far. Honestly, I\u2019m not really sure of anything anymore. Except one thing.\tLily: What?\tDaniel: Summer definitely knows where mom is, but she\u2019s not gonna tell me. It\u2019s driving me crazy. You know, thinking that she could be close by somewhere and I can\u2019t see her. I can\u2019t talk to her. I would give anything just to be able to hug her and just tell her that I love her and tell her how much I miss her.\tLily: I\u2019m sorry. I know that\u2019s really hard knowing that she\u2019s close by and you can\u2019t reach her. But listen, no matter what, you set something very important in motion and that\u2019s diane\u2019s freedom. So no matter what happens with your sister, you did the right thing.\tDaniel: Summer would disagree, but it was a good thing. It was the right thing. I needed to be reminded of that. What was it you wanted to say?\tLily: Oh, uh, lucy knows that we used to be married.\tDaniel: Who told her that?\tLily: I don\u2019t know.\tDaniel: Okay. How\u2019d she take the news?\tLily: She was thrilled because she now feels like we\u2019re star-crossed lovers who were destined to be together again.\tNick: If kirsten has a nerve to show his face in this town again after what he did, thinking he could weasel his way back into sharon\u2019s life again\u2013\tSharon: We don\u2019t know that\u2019s the case.\tNick: But he was obsessed with you, sharon, and he clearly still is. He\u2019s deranged. The things he did to you, sharon thought he was dead and gone.\tChance: Meaning what?\tSharon: He made every moment a loving hell for me. He started all of that by haunting me outside of a window, somewhere in the shadows, so I could never get a moment away from my crime or my shame. It\u2019s just all pain. Hold me tight. I was on edge, I was unraveling. And then one day, cameron showed up. He was alive and well. He said that he had been away on some island or something. He was acting as if nothing had ever happened. But this time he didn\u2019t want me, just me. He wanted revenge. He wanted me to suffer.\tNick: He framed sharon for murder, then took her hostage.\tSharon: If it weren\u2019t for nick, I wouldn\u2019t be here right now telling you this. Nick, be careful. You\u2019re gonna kill him.\tCameron: We\u2019re both dead already.\tNick: Just like frank barrett, huh? I got the whole thing on tape. You\u2019re going down, bitch. And this is for frank.\tPilot: Mr. Kirsten, everything all right back there?\tSharon: Nick, we are gonna parachute out of the airplane?\tNick: Babe, this may be our last chance to get out of this alive.\tSharon: God! Have you ever done this before?\tNick: Yeah. A couple times. It\u2019s no sweat. Now listen to me. You jump out of the plane. You count to three, you pull this, all right?\tSharon: Okay.\tNick: Count to three. Pull that.\tSharon: Okay.\tNick: And we\u2019re taking him with us.\tSharon: Nick, I\u2019m so scared.\tNick: Don\u2019t be. We\u2019re gonna be fine. Now, come on. You\u2019re gonna be fine. Count to three and pull. Let\u2019s go. Get down there. Babe, when I open this door, you gotta hang on.\tSharon: Okay.\t[ Door opening ]\tNick: I don\u2019t care if you do it or not, but in three seconds, you might wanna pull that cord. Come on, babe. You turn. Come on. You can do this. You can do this. I love you. In three seconds, pull it.\tSharon: Okay.\tNick: Three seconds, okay?\tSharon: Okay.\tCameron: You are so sure that you\u2019ve won.\tNick: We have won. Look at you. You\u2019re pathetic and you\u2019re gonna wish you were dead when all this is over.\tCameron: Then, you better kill me now, slick, \u2019cause if I walk outta here, you are dead.\tSharon: It was supposed to be over then. He was arrested, convicted.\tNick: He still needs to be in a cell.\tChance: Well, unfortunately that\u2019s not the case.\tNick: But you understand what we\u2019re dealing with.\tSharon: He\u2019s relentless, vicious, and I will never let him terrorize me like that again.\t", "Daniel: Exactly. Just let your mom know how happy I am that this part of the nightmare is over for her and I\u2019m sorry that I couldn\u2019t do something to clear her sooner.\tKyle: I\u2019ll certainly pass along your message. And we\u2019ll always owe you a debt of gratitude for coming forward after hearing about phyllis.\tDaniel: It was the only right thing to do.\tKyle: Even so, you could have kept phyllis\u2019s secret. I know you wanted to protect her at all costs, but you didn\u2019T. You came forward and set my mom free.\tDaniel: Well, I can never stay quiet when someone\u2019s entire future is at stake. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to live with myself otherwise.\tKyle: I\u2013 I realize the emotions are complicated for both of you, but the good news is your mother is alive. It\u2019s like a miracle you secretly hope for, but never out loud. I get it. And when phyllis comes forward and explains why she did what she did, christine, the police, they\u2019ll listen. They\u2019ll try to be fair. I know you\u2019re worried about the repercussions, but phyllis is tough as hell. She\u2019ll get through it.\tSummer: There shouldn\u2019t be any repercussions. Anything criminal my mom did was in self-defense. She\u2019s not a murderer. She\u2019s just not. The D.A. Is gonna see that. She has to.

I mean, dad will tell me the truth no matter what, even if it\u2019s that awful.\tLily: Well, no, no, no, no. It\u2013 it wasn\u2019t awful. I mean, that\u2019s definitely an overstatement.\tLucy: How old were you guys?\tLily: Uh, we were not old enough to be married, that\u2019s for sure.\tLucy: This is crazy. I mean, you\u2019re literally my dad\u2019s ex-wife and you guys just act like your old friends.\tLily: Okay, listen. I do not condone what we did at such a young age. I do not.\tLucy: Okay. Okay. I get it. I won\u2019t run off and marry some kid from homeroom. Tell me everything.\tLily: Oh, gosh. Um\u2026\t[ Laughs ] Well, we were married for almost a year, but you know, we were just way too young and, you know, couldn\u2019t handle the responsibility that came our way.\tLucy: I mean, you guys said vows and there\u2013 there must have been a marriage license and then a divorce? I mean, just think about all the teasing I can get off of my dad. And wait, doesn\u2019t that make you guys each other\u2019s first loves? Wow. How romantic is that? Now you guys are together again. I mean, that\u2019s a book I\u2019d totally read.\tLily: Okay, hold on.\tLucy: Wait. And if my dad ever tells me that I\u2019m too young to know what love is, I can just point at you guys. I mean, star crossed lovers destined to finally be together.\tLily: Okay, listen.\t[ Lily laughing ] We were way too young to handle what was coming our way, okay?

This coward, he goes after women.\tSharon: Same thing he did to me.\tChance: Look at this.\tSharon: That\u2019s his girlfriend?\tChance: Yeah. She looks just like you. I doubt that\u2019s a coincidence.\tNick: Well, do you know where he is now?\tChance: No. He was released six months ago and his whereabouts are unknown.\tNick: Doesn\u2019t he have like a parole officer keeping tabs on him or something?\tChance: I read the report and I\u2019ll admit, it\u2019s kinda sketchy.

But most importantly, I just think everybody should know the truth, don\u2019t you?\tThe thing is, when Nicole succumbeded to Xander\u2019s Charmer, whatever you want to call it, she was settled with an arrogant. Self-absorbed neglectful husband. That would be, that would be me.\tI don\u2019t know. I think my situation with Chloe and me is a lot more like yours in Napoles than you think. More than I\u2019d like to think. Meaning you call yourself a neglectful husband. I haven\u2019t exactly been the best boyfriend either. Alright. Kristen and Rachel have been treating. Chloe liked dirt while I\u2019ve just pretty much been sitting back and saying, Hey, Chloe, you\u2019re gonna have to deal with it.\tYou know, why don\u2019t just play this my way?

But not that I can afford it, and to be honest, I\u2019m, I\u2019m just worried that I\u2019m gonna end up in a place like this. So you need a place that\u2019s a step down from where you live, and I need to step up and why don\u2019t you take that step together.\tYou mean we can find a place together? Oh, Xander, that sounds horrifying. You know, I actually thought you\u2019d sparked the idea. Okay. Well, you\u2019ve just recently been nice to me and. Since I did dart you, I\u2019m not gonna dwell on the fact that this place is a pigsty, but I\u2019m gonna point out the obvious, which is you own a newspaper and I am basically broke.\tSo you wouldn\u2019t wanna live in a place where I can afford half the rent. We wouldn\u2019t, we wouldn\u2019t split rent. We, I know you don\u2019t have a job, so just make wherever we find look like I don\u2019t live there, and we\u2019ll call that REM for the time being. Oh. Sounds like you need a housekeeper, not a roommate, Chloe.\tUm, look, one of the most irritating things about becoming your friend and getting to really like you, is I want to atone for what I did to you and a bunch of other people.

You\u2019re serious about this, aren\u2019t you? Yeah, I am. After I started speaking to Dr. Evans, she\u2019s starting to make me realize that, uh, I\u2019m pretty screwed up and Chanel, as much as I would love to help you throw Sloan back in her cage, please do not ask me to sleep with her.\tOr I\u2019m gonna end up right back where I started.\tHoney, you look so glm.

I\u2019m saying that my alibi that night can\u2019t be, I just forgot that won\u2019t fly. Especially since I came up with it after the fact. Then why didn\u2019t you account for it in the first place?\tI am sorry. Okay. I guess I just, just wasn\u2019t thinking. Yeah. Yeah, you weren\u2019t thinking, look, it\u2019s just that they separated me and Chanel and I didn\u2019t know what they were saying to her, what she said. And then I was dealing with the commissioner. Babe. Let\u2019s just, my, my charm just didn\u2019t work on him. Okay. No, no.\tI, I get it.

I\u2019ve just heard the rumors that Sloan is the one who tempered with the biscuits.\tThat\u2019s exactly what they are. Brady rumors, I mean, take that from somebody who was a victim. Really, really. I know. I, I assume you\u2019re okay now. It\u2019s all right. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m fine. What the hell was that like? Hard to remember. I don\u2019t like to talk about it, but look at first, the first thing I was thinking that yes, I thought it was Sloan who tampered with the dough.\tAll right. But I am her alibi is all the reason why. I know she had nothing to do with it. All right, good, good. You know what, I\u2019m just looking out for you, right? And I know you too, Brady.

But I am healing up nicely. I\u2019m happy to report. That\u2019s good. So how often are you changing that bandage? You\u2019re supposed to change it.\tOnly if you don\u2019t want it to get infected. Uh, okay. Not sit down. I\u2019ll, I\u2019ll do it. Really? Yeah. Well, it\u2019s the least I can do after you save me from almost eating that drugged up skit. All right. Sorry if this hurts. Oh my goodness. Look at that thing. Oh, you\u2019re such a man. Oh, I never had any complaints on that score before.\tAnd promise me that you will change this regularly. Okay? Like every day, price, every day. I won\u2019t able to do it as well as you. You\u2019re regular Florence Nighting, aren\u2019t you? Mm. Thanks. And you are not. A regular Mr. Clean. Ah, yeah. Sorry about that. I mean, if it\u2019s the clothes on the floor you find offensive, you should know that they\u2019re, they\u2019re not all dirty.\tSome of them I just haven\u2019t folded yet. Ah, to be honest, Chloe, I\u2019m starting to feel that this place is a bit of, uh, uh, pet not indicative of my current financial status. You know, I was busted when I moved in here. I\u2019ve be saving up some money and I think I\u2019m ready to finally start looking for a new place.\tMm. You and me both. You need someplace new. Yeah. Like yesterday,\tevery time I see Chloe Xander\u2019s there just hovering, hanging around, playing darts with her, whatever, he\u2019s obviously gunning for her, and the thing is, Chloe\u2019s been hurt recently with some of the things that I\u2019ve said. Happened to walk that tight rope with Rachel. She, she, she may be open to him. Does anything happen yet?\tNothing that I know of. Okay. Then take my advice. Don\u2019t get all worked up for no good reason. All they could be doing is hanging out and throwing guards. Just like you said, you know Chloe, she\u2019s smart and she\u2019s gonna see right through Xander\u2019s Act. See, that\u2019s it. Nicole is a smart cookie as well, and she didn\u2019t exactly see through Zander, Zach either, did she?\tI guess you have a good point. Look, it\u2019s nice of you worrying about my sister, but we knew going into this that the cops would suspect her. And I damn sure didn\u2019t want them worrying about you, especially since you\u2019ve put so much on the line.\tYour lawyer may have pulled a rabbit out of her hat. But you are not off the hook. You listened to me, Sloan Peterson. You have lost and you will keep on losing and losing. So how about you\u2019ll find something better to do with your time than trying to hurt me and my family trying to drag us to court to satisfy your sick need for revenge.\tWhen my daughter and I, we have done nothing wrong. Do you hear me?\tThere is definitely no evidence tying someone to that. No Paulina\u2019s office being trashed, right? Because thanks to you getting those keys, there was no forced entry and they can\u2019t know anything else we did on Sloan either because she\u2019s innocent. More importantly, she\u2019s a damn good lawyer. She\u2019s never gonna let them railroad her.\tYeah, but Colin, don\u2019t you think we should probably tell her what we\u2019ve been doing? No. No. That would make her an accessory yet. Plus she would never go for something like this. After she wasn\u2019t able to nail Chanel and her mother in court, she had to pump the brakes. She would never risk a law license doing something illegal, which is when I had to step in.\tChange the game. We need help. Of course,\tTalia told you that she went straight home after dinner at Chanel\u2019s Place the night before all this went down. Right? I remember, but I was there Rafe, she didn\u2019t, she didn\u2019t come home until hours later. You sure? She would be pretty hard to miss? I mean, we can\u2019t even turn around that place without bumping into each other.\tNo. I mean, how do you know that it was the same night? Because I vividly remember it. It was when it was when you and I admitted that we have feelings for each other.\tHi.\tHey, Chanel, Alex. Hi. Hi. Did I read right? You\u2019re engaged to Johnny Damara? Let me guess, lady Whistleblower. I was an spectator today. Is that not true? What is true is that Johnny and I both had my biscuits, which turned out to be tainted with hallucinogens and I told Leo owe that and not to make anything of it, but we all know to him the truth is just an irrelevant detail.\tRight. So the creep does what he usually does and wrote whatever he thinks is gonna sell papers. Yeah. To the moron to actually read that crap. Oh, sorry, my, that didn\u2019t come out the way I meant it. Nah, I think it did. Look, I know you\u2019re still pissed off at me about everything that happened with Allie. Okay.\tAnother topic I don\u2019t wanna talk about. Regardless, this whole thing, the drugging of the biscuits, it\u2019s ridiculous and I truly feel for you, and I can only imagine what it\u2019s doing to your business. No, it\u2019s killing it. Which is exactly why your little girlfriend Sloan did it. Well, it\u2019s not my girlfriend\u2019s.\t", "I mean, yeah, we hooked up, but that was over a long time ago. Well, maybe it shouldn\u2019t be. What do you mean? Well, if you\u2019re really sorry about what happened with Allie, make it up to me. Get SW back in your bed.\tYou want me to get Sloan back in my bed, boy, because you can sweet talk her like crazy and then screw a confession out of her.\tAre you kidding me? Look, look, the, the cops keep saying that they don\u2019t have any proof to prove that Sloane is the one that\u2019s doing everything to me and my mom, even though it\u2019s beyond obvious that it\u2019s her and that doesn\u2019t tell you anything. What it tells me is that someone outside of the PD needs to talk to her and that someone is you.\tLook, all you gotta do is call her up, tell her how much you miss her, and then show her a good time. Ah, and then you can just steer, you know the pillow. Talk to biscuit though. And psychedelics. Hey. Yeah, look, Chanal, I mean this in the nicest way possible, but are you sure you\u2019re not under the influence of some drug biscuits and psychedelics?\tI feel for you. I really do. But you gotta forget about it because I\u2019m not doing it. Oh, come on, Alex. Why not? It\u2019s not like this is outta character for you. Oh, okay. Well, Aside from my general misgivings about this, I\u2019m sort of hooking up with somebody else now. So when has that ever stopped? You just make it a threesome.\tY\u2019all know you have experience with that. Ha on please, Alex. I would forgive you for everything that happened in the past. If you will, please just do whatever it takes to get me what I need to, to just to stop this nightmare with Sloan.\tConnie. Everything\u2019s gonna be okay. Trust me, you hold it right there. Shady missile toe. Uh, it\u2019s lady whistleblower and I will not hold it right here or anywhere for the likes of you. You are such a bottom feeding hack, you know that. Oh, come on counselor. You can\u2019t still be upset about that one little article I wrote about you ages ago.\tOh, you mean the one where you called me a psycho and, uh, accused me of going after Paulina Price? No. Shrugged it right off. Of course, I\u2019m still mad at you. Well, first off, I\u2019m not a hack. And second, the bottom happens to be where the good stuff is. Oh, I\u2019m well aware. That\u2019s why I stopped you just now, huh?\tMm. I figured you\u2019d want some dirt for your next column. What kind of dirt? The police commissioner and his favorite new detective. Trust me, it practically writes itself. You forgot it was the same night. Hmm. Jose, we opened up to each other about our feelings. Yeah, I, I did. Right. Well, anyway, um, it was really awkward here, so I went straight home.\tYou know, the next day you were drugged from those biscuits. Yeah. Sorry, again about my behavior. It\u2019s, it\u2019s fine. Um, anyway, um, The point is I remember exactly what time it was, and I know for a fact that my sister did not come straight home from Paulina prices that night. Okay. Well, obviously you\u2019re convinced that Talia isn\u2019t telling us the truth, so what do you wanna do about it?\tI don\u2019t know, like getting involved in everything. It\u2019s kind of the last thing I expected moving to New York. Right. But when we met, there was an immediate connection. At least for me anyway, um, I think putting my medical career on hold kind of proves that I felt it too. I\u2019m gonna make this up to you, Talia.\tI swear. Don\u2019t worry, no one\u2019s suspicious.\tWho is it? It\u2019s my sister.\tI don\u2019t know why she would be calling. I literally just left her. Let her go to voicemail. Maybe she\u2019ll leave a message. No, I always answer her phone calls.\tHello? There you are. I was wondering why you weren\u2019t picking up. Oh, sorry, my phone was buried in my bag. What\u2019s up? Remember when we said we might need to clear some things up? After your interview, you wanna clear some things up? It just a small point. Something you said to the commissioner. Something I told the commissioner wasn\u2019t clear.\tIt\u2019s about when you got home the night before, uh, the issue with the biscuits and after you had dinner at Chanel\u2019s. You said you went straight home, but I was home after dinnertime. And you weren\u2019t? Yeah, right. Um, I had a headache and um, I went to the drugstore and I got aspirin, but that couldn\u2019t have taken that long.\tYou\u2019re right. Sorry, I must have forgotten. Um, I was late because I took a walk to the lake. I thought that the night air might help my headache. Well, I guess it did because when you got home, you didn\u2019t mention it. All I wanted to do by then was just to go to sleep. Anything else? I think that\u2019s about it.\tGreat. Talk to you later. Right on. I\u2019m not so sure\tsomething wrong. You could say that\tthe commissioner. Commissioner Hernandez, Mr. Straighten arrow, accent on the strait. Sadly, the very one, forget it. People read my column for dirt on people like you not Captain America. Oh, I mean, You don\u2019t think that they would wanna read on Captain America as you put it? Hi on drugs and macing on his lead.\tDetective, please tell me it is Detective Sean Brady. No, it was Jada Hunter. Ah, boring. Who cares about a little tongue between coworkers. That tongue flies right in face of Mayor Carver\u2019s new fraternization policy. I thought that just meant they couldn\u2019t be in the Elks or Shriners or something. What it means is that you could launch a campaign to get Mayor Carver to have to enforce his own policy against one of his greatest political allies and a close friend.\t", "Talia, do you not know an act when you see one? I don\u2019t think it was just an act. Okay. I, Chanel told me about everything that happened in London unless she told you. If she pushed my mother off a roof, then she did not tell you everything unless she told you that her rich mommy flew to London and paid for everything to be covered up.\tThen she did not tell you everything.\tI\u2019m sorry. I I, I just, I get so worked up. This is obviously so triggering for me. Yeah, this is extremely. Important. Look, I know that. Okay. I do. I promise. I just need to ask you one thing. Yeah. Are you still on my side?\tJada was bothering him. This is vague, but it didn\u2019t feel like I was talking to my sister. Alright, what can you figure out why Talia\u2019s always a stream of consciousness all over the map, but there is these hesitations when she was answering my questions. Maybe she was just trying to remember. No, no.\tTalia\u2019s memory is scary. She remembers what she did for her 12th birthday party, but, but now she forgets that she had a headache and then she forgot that she walked around the lake. Wait, she said that? Yeah. Yeah. And she\u2019s also the one who forgot to set the security systems. All this from someone who never forgets a thing.\tAll right, Jada, if this is too much, I can put you on another case. The department cannot ask, you cannot ask any officer to investigate their own. No, no. Thanks for the golfer, but it\u2019s too late to back off now.\tYou need to have a little bit more faith in Chloe Xander. Yeah, he may be making a play for her, but she more than most knows exactly what he is capable of. You\u2019re right. No, you\u2019re right. After what that jerk put her through, I can\u2019t imagine she would involve herself with him and she knows what he, what he did to Nicole and how much Nicole regretted getting involved with him.\tExactly. And Chloe\u2019s not gonna let. Xander entered her life in any meaningful way. Yeah. No, you\u2019re right. Whatever they, they hang out. They play darts. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re moving in together. Right.\tWell, this place looks pretty promising, doesn\u2019t it? Nice fuse. Plenty of immunities. I mean, it couldn\u2019t do any harm to go look at it, right? I guess not. Let\u2019s do those future room, lets find a place and move in together.\tNo more jokes about it, I promise. And for what it\u2019s worth, I think it\u2019s, you know, uh, brave they are going to therapy. I agree. Although I\u2019m not really sure I wanna know. Who I really am\tenough about me. You\u2019re going through hell right now. Is there, like, how about I float you along? Something to just keep the business going until everything gets, you know, blown over. That is, that is very, very sweet of you. But I, I can get a loan from my mom and besides all the money in the world, can\u2019t buy me back my customers.\tBut you know, as, as much as all this sucks on the bright side. You offer me a loan, which is like, so generous. And then my new employee, I, I told her that I couldn\u2019t afford to pay her. And you know what she said? Hmm? She said that she would work for free. Wow. That\u2019s amazing. She\u2019s amazing. And you know, she\u2019s, she\u2019s only worked here for a short time, but it\u2019s just like, like this whole thing has hit her just as hard as it\u2019s hit me.\tYou can\u2019t let Chanel and her mom get into your head. Okay. And babe, we have nothing to feel guilty about with a good gas here. Yeah, but maybe we should just back off a bit, you know? Give things time to just go away. No, we can\u2019t do that. Have to keep, apply pressure. You just have to be really careful of what you say to your sister.\tYeah, yeah, of course. Bye. I should get going.\tI need you. I can\u2019t do any of this without you now. I love you, right?\tI love you too. Here\u2019s my girl.\tOh, hey, uh, you work at sleeps, right? I met you the other day, Talia. Yeah, that\u2019s, that\u2019s me. Hmm. Sweetness. Are you the one that sold her a tainted biscuit? I did, and I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m really, I\u2019m really sorry. Was that really necessary? I didn\u2019t even eat the biscuit. That poor girl just works there. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s her fault.\tI just keep thinking. My sister gets out of medical school, becomes a baker\u2019s assistant in Salem. And as a doctor, she would have access to the drugs that were put in that dough. Okay, but why? Hm. She didn\u2019t even know Chanel until she got here. They seemed to get along and well, she sure doesn\u2019t seem like a disgruntled employee.\tYeah, she always told me that she loved that job. Okay, so what\u2019s her motive? Hmm? Why would she decide to drug half the town? You know, you\u2019re right. You\u2019re right. It, it makes no sense. It has to be someone else, someone with a real motive. Which brings us back to Sloan Peterson. So the cops are all over you because of the sweet bit\u2019s druggie incident.\t"], "answer": [1, 2, 3, 0, 4]}

That\u2019s the question.\tBrooke: We understand if things are a bit complicated between you and thomas.\tRj: Complicated\u2026 it\u2019s just what he did was messed up. Making that call to cps pretending to be mom. I\u2019m not gonna lie, it hurt when you two got separated, but I can\u2019t get caught up in all the family drama. I just can\u2019T. I\u2019ve watched my brothers and sisters go at it against each other just too many times. The whole forrester-logan rivalry, it isn\u2019t fun, especially when you\u2019re a forrester and a logan. And I\u2019m proud to be both. I have great parents and amazing brothers and sisters. We\u2019re all really, really blessed.\tRidge: Could have used your sound mind a few years ago.\tRj: Well, I think I needed to step away to develop it.\tBrooke: You\u2019ve really grown up, rj.\tRidge: We\u2019re both proud of you.\tRj: Thank you, dad. I hope I\u2019m not coming across like I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s just, I really don\u2019t wanna get caught up in any of the family drama. It\u2019s one of the reasons why I haven\u2019t been back in so long.\tBrooke: Of course. I mean, we understand.

And\u2013 and keeping with the boho design. But you put it in there sort of as a base and then you can add something else on top of it like\u2013 like leather.\tHope: To give it a little edge.\tThomas: Exactly.\tHope: I like it. And we could also play with the colors and use the leather to create kind of a richer, darker tone, but then use the lace to soften it up.\tThomas: Like taking both worlds and bringing them together.\tTaylor: You know what, kind of like the two of you. You know, I\u2019ve\u2013 I\u2019ve\u2013 I\u2019ve never seen you guys so creatively in sync and it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s pretty cool.

And god, he\u2013 he has no reason to be concerned anymore.\tThomas: Yeah. And that may be true, but he has every reason to be skeptical of me.

She told me the whole story. She told me that stark had concocted this whole scheme to try and take down diane, just as we all suspected. And stark coerced her to\u2013 to help him. But he lied to her. He manipulated her. He threatened her. And eventually, she gave in and she did whatever he demanded.\tJack: What about the fight? We\u2013 and we all saw her collapse.\tDaniel: We did. It was all staged, jack. And then after she was dead, she decided, you know, she was having second thoughts. She wanted to come back and tell everyone the truth. But\u2013 but stark, he\u2013 that\u2019s when he attacked her. You know, he had set up the revenge, the money, the disappearance. He had set that all up so perfectly that he wasn\u2019t about to let her ruin his plan.\tJack: Oh, my god.\tDaniel: Everybody already thought she was dead. Nobody was gonna be looking for her. Nobody was gonna be missing her. She would\u2019ve been just another body to dispose of. So, she did what she had to do. She didn\u2019t have any other choice.

Why would you put her freedom in jeopardy?\tTucker: Is that how she framed it? That\u2019s not wholly accurate. I just helped her face facts.\tJack: Oh, and what are the facts according to tucker mccall?\tTucker: Well, the evidence is starting to pile up against her, jack. And she\u2019s got her checkered past to contend with also. So, I merely illustrated her choices, which are, according to tucker mccall, uh, to re-traumatize you and her son by putting you both through a very public trial, which will most likely lead to her conviction, or she can leave.\tJack: Oh, so, did you give her this little pep talk at ashley\u2019s behest?\tTucker: Yeah. No. No, not at all. You know, diane and I have a history of our own, and I care about her.\tJack: She does not need you to tell her what she is up against.\tTucker: I don\u2019t think you\u2019re quite getting what I\u2019m talking about here. She has to convince not only a judge, but half the people in this town, and her daughter-in-law, that she is blameless in this. And if you think that coming back to genoa city has earned diane anything but sneers and whispers, think again. And now she\u2019s charged with murder.

I used to wait to run my dishwasher\tJack: You\u2019ve forgotten one very important thing: Diane is innocent.\tTucker: As if that matters. Well, it matters to you, of course. But, jack, you know as well as I do, the people in this town never let go of anything. And this stain on diane is just gonna trickle down all the way to harrison.\tJack: What are you talking about?\tTucker: Well, do you think that walnut grove is going to sell diane\u2019s brownies at their bake sale? And are you sure your companies are gonna survive her presence in your life? Listen, even if she is found innocent, she\u2019s always going to be labeled genoa city\u2019s murderer. Period. I mean, do you really want to help her?\tJack: Of course, I do.\tTucker: Okay. Then do whatever you can, legally or otherwise, to get her the hell out of this place. Anyway, I\u2019m gonna take my leave of you now, gonna find a nice quiet place to relax and enjoy my life. Everyone\u2019s so tense around here, bro.\t[ Tucker sighs ]\t[ Door slams shut ]\tDevon: I wanna make sure that you know that by me doing this, it doesn\u2019t change what you mean to me or I don\u2019t\u2013\tHarmony: Well\u2013\tDevon: I\u2019m not gonna forget where I come from.\tHarmony: That\u2019s good to know.\tDevon: It\u2019s the truth. It just feels right to go by winters.\tHarmony: A rose by any other name would smell as sweet, right?\tDevon: I\u2019m getting shakespeare.\t[ Harmony laughs ]\tHarmony: You know, I have gone by a few names myself. Doesn\u2019t change what\u2019s on the inside. You can call yourself the crown prince of genoa city. Okay? You will always be my son. Can you imagine living in a world where you weren\u2019t free to be who you wanna be? My grandson, he is the luckiest kid in the world. He\u2019s gonna be able to grow up to be a\u2013 a what? A\u2013 a musician or a business tycoon or even a statesman.\tDevon: Yeah.\tHarmony: All of the above or anything in between.\tDevon: He can do it all. He can be a carpenter.\tHarmony: Right?\tDevon: Be a pilot.\t[ Both laugh ]\tHarmony: A world without limits and you ought make it fun for him, you know? That way, he won\u2019t know that he\u2019s learning. He\u2019ll just learn to love it, whatever it is.\t[ Xylophone toy dings ]\tDevon: That\u2019s true.\t[ Laughs ] That\u2019s very true. It was really nice to see you playing with him today. He was\u2026 he was having a lot of fun.\tHarmony: Wasn\u2019t he?\tDevon: Yeah.\tHarmony: You know, I used to play with you like that.\tDevon: I remember.\tHarmony: Oh, no, you don\u2019T. You\u2013\tDevon: I do.\tHarmony: That\u2019s impossible.\tDevon: No, it\u2019s not. I definitely remember. We used to build forts all the time. We used to build forts with all those blankets that we had and you would make snacks.\tHarmony: Yes. Cheese and crackers.\tDevon: Mm-hmm.\tHarmony: Yep. I did the best with what I had.\tDevon: Yeah. And you always had music playing, too.\tHarmony: Mm. Now, what is life without music?\t[ Clicks tongue ]\tDevon: Those are good memories.\tHarmony: Mm. They weren\u2019t anything special.\tDevon: They were very special to me. It was the times that were good that you never forget.\tHarmony: Yeah.\tDevon: I didn\u2019t mean to say that to make you feel bad or\u2026\tHarmony: It\u2019s all good. I know what you meant. I know there was a lot of not so good times. I\u2019m sorry about that.\tDevon: It\u2019s okay, mom. You\u2019re here. You\u2019re here today.\tHarmony: Mm.\t> Devon: You\u2019re here today. And dominic gets to grow up and have you in his life. And he gets to have the best of you. He gets to have a grandmother that\u2019ll get on the floor with him and play with toys and make sound effects like you used to do with me.\tHarmony: Yeah, those were some fun memories, weren\u2019t they?\tDevon: They were really fun times. And no matter what I\u2019m ever going through in my life, remembering those fun times with you, it always put a smile on my face.\tBilly: Let me tell you a little something about a ham and pineapple pizza. Okay? Don\u2019t make that face. I know. I get it. It sounds like total chaos on a pizza crust, but it\u2019s perfect. The sweetness of the pineapple coming together with the saltiness of the ham, I mean, it\u2019s divine.\tChelsea: Ooh. I\u2019m down. New is good.\tBilly: New is good.\tJohnny: Ooh, okay. Um, how about we get two pizzas? One for the people with the dead taste buds and one for the bros.\tBilly: Mm.\tConnor: Is this the part where we do the pretending?\tChelsea: Sweetheart, what are you talking about?\tConnor: Everything. That\u2019s not the point.\tBilly: Okay. I could use a little bit of fresh air. What do you say? You wanna join me, connor? Yeah. Of course, you do. You don\u2019t mind, do you?\tChelsea: Not at all.\tBilly: Okay. Come on. After you.\t", "Harmony: Okay. You can\u2019t call it work when you love what you do. And the last I checked, you still have blue notes and hi-hats and slick cats in your blood.\tDevon: I always will, but\u2026\tHarmony: Yeah. I just think it\u2019s a shame for it to all go to waste. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying.\tDevon: Okay. I know what you\u2019re saying. I\u2019m just trying to focus right now on this new family dynamic I have going with abby, and being the best father I can be to dominic.\tTucker: As you should.\tDevon: Thank you. And I still have my label. It\u2019s still under chancellor-winters. So, you know, I\u2019m music-adjacent.\tHarmony: [ Laughs ] Yeah. Well, how could that possibly be enough for someone like you? I mean, you\u2019ve got, like, all this\u2013\tDominic: Dada.\tDevon: Oh, look at that. Saved by the dom.\tHarmony: Mm-hmm.\tDevon: I\u2019ll be back.\tTucker: Dada.\tHarmony: Mm-hmm.\tTucker: Do you love it?\tHarmony: [ Laughs ] I do.\tJack: Daniel, I know you\u2019ve been put through a lot, but don\u2019t try to lay the blame at my feet. I had nothing to do with the choices your mother made.\tDaniel: You sure about that? \u2018Cause as far as I can tell, this all started when you wouldn\u2019t listen to her about diane.\tJack: She had other friends. She could have turned to lauren or michael.\tMichael: Has she tried to contact you since you saw her?\tDaniel: As a matter\u2013\tJack: You know what, get\u2013 just get her to come back. We\u2019ll let the police straighten this out.\tDaniel: Really? So, you just want her arrested and locked up after she\u2019s already been traumatized by stark?\tJack: That was good enough for diane.\tDaniel: So is your forgiveness, jack. I hope you\u2019ll remember that when my mom\u2019s return is the only thing standing between a life of freedom and a life behind bars for diane.\tMichael: I\u2019m gonna ask you again. Have you heard from your mother since you saw her in the park?\tDaniel: No. No, I haven\u2019T.\tKyle: We need to call christine. There\u2019s gotta be a way to use daniel\u2019s statement to get the state to drop their murder charges.\tDaniel: And\u2013 and to clear my mother of any wrongdoing, since stark was behind this whole thing. Now that he\u2019s dead, I mean, the case is moot, right?\tMichael: As much as I\u2019d like to make this all go away, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not gonna play out quite the way you\u2019d like.\tBilly: Let\u2019s just give this one more minute and then we\u2019ll head back inside. Okay? Promise.\tConnor: You hated me and my mom when you found out she was your bio mom.\tJohnny: At first, yeah. It sucked. Then it just\u2026 didn\u2019T. And now I love hanging out with you and her. I just needed a second.\tConnor: Because you have someone else to boss around and lecture. I was talking to billy, not you. For copd, ask your doctor about breztri.\tHarmony: [ Sighs ] It\u2019s just that when you have a god-given talent\u2013 and let\u2019s face it, it is in his dna, okay? It is an affront to the universe for him to not put it out there, you know?\tTucker: Yeah.\tHarmony: Put it to good use for the world to enjoy.\tTucker: Uh, no comment\u2026\t[ Laughs ] On this debate or any other debate. I\u2019m still on shaky ground with him. With everyone, it seems.\tHarmony: I hope everything\u2019s okay with you and ashley after I left you two the other night. I mean, given our past\u2026\tTucker: Oh.\tHarmony: Bound to be some ruffled feathers when I come on to the scene.\tTucker: Future is all that matters.\tDevon: Go to sleep\tgo to sleep\t[ Devon humming ]\tHarmony: Mm.\t[ Tucker laughs ]\tHarmony: Well, I guess if he has to put music aside, I can\u2019t think of a better reason.\tTucker: Yep.\tHarmony: Yeah.\tTucker: You know, I realize that our relationship was not all sunshine and roses, but at least we got devon out of it, right?\tHarmony: Mm.\tTucker: And now dom.\tHarmony: Yeah. I feel like we\u2019re the lucky ones.\tTucker: Mm-hmm.\tJohnny: Why are you mad at me? What did I do? I mean, what\u2019s the big deal anyways?\tBilly: Well, he thinks it\u2019s a big deal right now. And he\u2019s not feeling like his best self.\tConnor: Nobody asked you to come out here.\tBilly: Okay. Listen, we\u2019re family, okay? He loves you. You\u2019re just gonna have to get used to that. But you\u2019re right. Families have a way of inserting themselves in situations whenever they want. Sometimes it\u2019s a good thing. Most of the time it\u2019s great. But we will table that conversation \u2019til a more peaceful time.\tJohnny: Yeah, that\u2019s gonna happen.\tBilly: Hey, you\u2019re not helping right now.\t[ Johnny sighing ] Look, connor\u2026 you got a lot going on right now. Okay? And I\u2019m sure it feels like it\u2019s all out of control. But you\u2019re growing up and all those things that are clouding your view of the world, well, sometimes they end up bigger than you ever expect. If you need some time and some space to process all of this, that\u2019s totally fine. But you gotta trust your mother. You need to tell her what\u2019s going on inside of here. Okay? You gotta at least give her a hint.\tConnor: If it\u2019ll get everybody to back off, fine.\t[ Johnny sighs ]\tBilly: I think that went pretty well.\tJohnny: Mm.\tKyle: Everything will work out. Phyllis is alive. The state will have to drop the charges.\tDaniel: Yeah. And I can sign an affidavit or whatever. I\u2019m all you need to prove that diane\u2019s not a killer.\tMichael: I need evidence. What I don\u2019t need is the word of a grieving son who has just seen his mother days after she purportedly died.\t[ Huffs ] Damn it! That\u2019s the legal system talking. That\u2019s not me. I am sorry. There is a mountain of evidence to refute your word, daniel. And if you go in front of a judge and start talking about apparitions from the grave, you are asking for trouble. Aiding and abetting, obstruction of justice charges.\tDaniel: I was only trying to help.\tMichael: And your knowledge of how stark was killed could make you look like a suspect.\tKyle: Phyllis is the only one who can clear her name now.\tDaniel: I mean, she did the things that she did to try and protect the people that she loves. I mean, she could have died at any point during that plan. Stark sure as hell tried to kill her at the end. And if she didn\u2019t defend herself, she\u2019d be the one who we found floating face down in a lake. Michael, come on, there\u2019s gotta be something you could do to help her.\tMichael: You know there\u2019s nothing I wouldn\u2019t do for phyllis. And if she\u2019s really alive, you have no idea how happy I will be. But the cold truth is, I am representing diane and it would be a conflict of interest for me to try to fix things for phyllis. I\u2019m not even sure that I could spin her story that\u2013 so that she doesn\u2019t come off\u2026 not so great. But everything is a long shot without evidence.\tJack: Look, I\u2019m gonna call christine just to test the waters off the record, throw out a few hypotheticals, see what kind of response I get.\tMichael: Jack\u2013\tJack: And I have to tell dianE.\tMichael: Jack! Just please hold off on that. We don\u2019t know where phyllis is or how to find her, or even if she would come back with us once we did. No, there are just\u2013 just too many variables. We can\u2019t tell anyone about this. We have to be very careful and take it a step at a time.\tJack: Oh, god\u2026\tNext week on \u201cthe young and the restless.\u201d\tNate: We\u2019re helping each other, right? We have to trust each other to get exactly what we want. And I know exactly what you want.\tChelsea: What\u2019s going on?\tDaniel: Oh, you know, just waiting for some bombs to explode.\tJack: I don\u2019t even know what we\u2019re looking for, but I guarantee you we will know it when we see it.\t", "Jack: Can we meet? Something you need to hear. Hmm. Sure thing. Drop by. Home all day.\tTucker: Hey, jack. How goes it?\tJack: You know, just when I think you couldn\u2019t stoop any lower, you couldn\u2019t do any worse, you somehow always manage to surprise me. Let\u2019s talk.

Well, flattery will get you everywhere, but actually I\u2019m working on diane\u2019s case at the moment.\tDaniel: We\u2019re going to the abbott house.\tMichael: Is this about diane?\tDaniel: It\u2019s about proving once and for all that she didn\u2019t kill my mother.\tMichael: Oh. What are we waiting for, then?\tBilly: I wonder what\u2019s keeping connor and chelsea?\tJohnny: Maybe he just had his weekly nerd club meeting.\tBilly: Easy. That\u2019s your kid brother.\tJohnny: Exactly. That\u2019s why I get to say stuff like that. Back when he was just my cousin, it was a completely different story.\tBilly: Right, right, right. So, let me get this straight. You can only say things like that if it comes from love?\tJohnny: Yeah.\tBilly: Ah. You two still gaming together?\tJohnny: We haven\u2019t played much lately.\tBilly: Too much homework?\tJohnny: Not for me. Also, when I try to talk to him at school, it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t know, like he\u2019s avoiding me.\tBilly: Really? Why? Why do you think that is?\tJohnny: Don\u2019t know. Maybe there\u2019s something going on that no one\u2019s told me about.\tBilly: [ Sighs ] Yeah. Look, um\u2026 your uncle adam is having another baby. A girl.\tJohnny: With sally?\tBilly: Yes, with sally.

Why don\u2019t you fill him in? Tell\u2013 tell the young man all the great things.\tJohnny: Well, first time she burps the way you taught her to, that\u2019s cool.

You wore him out.\tHarmony: [ Laughs ] That\u2019s the joy of being a grandmother, you know? It\u2019s a different kind of love.\tDevon: Yeah, I guess so.\tHarmony: You know it makes me think of my own mother? God, she used to love you up.\tDevon: Oh, I remember. I was very lucky. I\u2019ve had a lot of incredible people in my life.\tHarmony: Yes. And you\u2019re making every single one of them incredibly proud.\tDevon: Yeah.\tHarmony: Especially as a dad.\tDevon: Well, that means everything to me. So, thank you.\tHarmony: Yeah. And now you\u2019ve got tucker on your side.\tDevon: Mm.\tHarmony: I mean, it\u2019s good of him to be making the effort, I suppose.\tDevon: Yeah. It\u2019s better late than never.\tHarmony: You gotta give the guy some credit, right?\tDevon: Do I?\tHarmony: [ Sighs ] Listen, okay?

Well, if he\u2019s still lurking around here, I doubt he\u2019ll give me any trouble. All right, let\u2019s have a plan. The plan is you stay here and watch her.\tI\u2019m gonna find Caleb and we\u2019ll all go home.\tThink about how wonderful it would be to see all the people who love. Who, who have missed you like I have. Have you heard a damn word I\u2019ve said? Excuse me. I don\u2019t wanna see any of those people. And they sure as hell don\u2019t wanna see me. What you talking about? They moved on with their lives. They\u2019re better off thinking I\u2019m dead.\tThat is not true. True. I\u2019m sick of people gapping at me all the time. I know what I want and I know where I\u2019m going, and that is off of this damn island. And you\u2019re coming with me now. Ah. Leave if you want, but I am staying. I am going to find Marlena.\tYou\u2019re not going anywhere.\tHey, um, listen, I was thinking maybe I should go along, you know, Maybe I can say a few words. Well, I do appreciate that, but I need somebody here to keep an eye in a place while I\u2019m gone. Are you sure? Yeah, I am sure. All right. Well, you travel safe. Give everyone in my love, Frank will do. Hey, I know this is not easy.\tBut I want you to know what you\u2019re doing, I think is really beautiful. Well, we\u2019ll keep it short in this week we\u2019ll scatter cays, and then we\u2019ll go raise a glass. Gotta find a, an Irish pub that, uh, serves a good Maree . You know what, I bet when you get back Megan, she\u2019s gonna be in custody I hope. Because whoever killed Key, I\u2019ve looked them in the eye\tand let them know that they\u2019re very lucky. I don\u2019t tear their lamb from where.\tI love,\twell, if this is about Kate, everybody\u2019s gotta understand that Megan brainwashed you. This isn\u2019t about Megan. This is about me and my future. Oh, so hell with everybody else, you\u2019re just going to take off and not look back. We are taking off. No. No, I am not. I am staying. With Marlena, don\u2019t do this. Don\u2019t do what?\tAbandon my friend. I\u2019m not doing that. I\u2019m not leaving you here. So Megan can use you as her Guinea pig. Oh. So I should just let Marlena be used as a Guinea pig. I\u2019m not doing it. If you have to go, go. But I am staying here. You are as stubborn as ma ever was. Oh, oh, that makes me proud. So what are you gonna do?\tYou\u2019re gonna shoot me like you shot Kate\tBrady. Women are not usually this way, I have to say. I\u2019m pretty impressed you were able to win over Sierra. I just got her to gimme a chance, that\u2019s all. I\u2019m sorry that she gave you such a hard time in the. But you\u2019re her mom. She wants to protect you. Maybe she needs to. What do you mean? I mean, right now it seems like the deprogramming worked, but what if it didn\u2019t?\tI mean, what if, what if? What if I relapse? You won\u2019t. Yeah, we don\u2019t know that.\tAnd until we know for sure, maybe you should just stay away from me. You know? Maybe we shouldn\u2019t. Like hope if I hurt, if I hurt you, Harris. You know, I would\u2019ve thought you would\u2019ve learned by now. I\u2019m more than capable of taking care of myself. Just fine\t", "He\u2019s been completely deed mom.\tYou don\u2019t know that for sure.\tI do know that. I was there. I watched the entire session and I was there and I watched him pretend to be in love with you when he was actually an assassin. Plus, oh my God, home. Please, please wake up.\u00a0 Just because he got zapped a couple times doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s changed. Do you know what Navy sealed training entails? He can withstand anything.\tCiara, I understand that. He told us where he thinks Megan is.\tOkay. Those could just be some random coordinates on a map. For all we know, bottom line, this could all be an act and I do not wanna risk the chance that he will hurt you again.\u00a0 Mom\tCiara. My daughter as this stubborn as her father was, you\u2019re not gonna change your mind.\tThat\u2019s fine, because I agree with everything she said\twe\u2019re well. Before Megan got ahold of him, Michaels was a Navy seal by all counts of real. He. And home beliefs. He\u2019s been Deprogrammed.\tYeah, she was there when it went down. Kimberly wasn\u2019t having any lucks, so he signed up for E C T.\tReally?\tYeah. And a bunch of his memories came back, including the location of the facility where he originally underwent the conditioning.\u00a0 He thinks that\u2019s where Megan could be held up and with any. John and Steve could be closing in on her right now.\tI\u2019m surprised you don\u2019t wanna be a part of that. Don\u2019t you wanna find her, bring her back?\tWell, I have no doubt that John and Steve can get that done. In the meantime, I\u2019ve uh, Got another job to do.\u00a0 Matter of fact, I ought start getting going there and got a plane catch.\tOkay. Oh, whoa, whoa. Where you going to Lake Cape to rest?\tNothing\u2019s happening, doctor. You sure you got the right stuff in that syringe?\tAs Einstein shows that e equals mc square.\tI don\u2019t know about that, but I am sure that you\u2019re a dead man if she doesn\u2019t start waking up.\tJohn, I sweetheart. Am I dreaming? ?\tIf you are, I\u2019m in it cuz I\u2019m right here with you, baby.\tHold me. Hold me.\tI got, I got you. I.\tYou know, before Kate got sick again, we talked about taking a honeymoon. So I, I suggested Paris from reel, but uh, her heart was set on the emerald aisle.\tAnd why was that?\tMight be hard to believe, but Kate admitted to me that she liked being a breed.\tWhat\u2019s not to like ? Well, we don\u2019t live in mansions. We don\u2019t run billion dollar companies, but we do have people in.\tShe wanted to know where they came from. She told me that an historian once described us as ego temper and stubbornness mixed with charm, warmth. That would shine through adversity.\tHmm. Sounds a lot like Kate.\tActually. I told her that. I told her that, but in her case I would\u2019ve to add stunningly. Beautiful. Anyway, Austin and Billiw are gonna meet me over there and we will scatter Kate Ashes. Special place and Lucas wishes he could be there too. But, uh, he does understand. I can\u2019t wait for him to get out. And I\u2019m not about to carry this urn around like Anna did for years.\tI not, the Tony was alive.\tYeah. As much as I wish the hell left we\u2019re possible. I\u2019m afraid that to outcome it won\u2019t be the same for the women we\u2019ve lost.\tDid you hear what I. Kayla is alive\tand you\u2019re lying. You\u2019re just waiting for one of your goons to come by and save you. That\u2019s not gonna happen.\tOh, don\u2019t you want to know where your sweetness is?\tI know where she is. She\u2019s in her grave. I stood there and washed with our children while they lowered her into the ground.\tThat wasn\u2019t Kayla.\tYou better stop talking now.\tLook, I know you have no reason to believe me when I say that your wife is still amongst the lady. But don\u2019t you want to see, don\u2019t you want to see for yourself?\u00a0 Because Kayla\u2019s here, I can prove it. I\u2019ll take you to a right now.\tMegan did the same thing to Stephen John last summer. She brainwashed them and they did terrible things.\tI don\u2019t follow anyone\u2019s orders.\tLook, I can see that you are trying to break free, but, and, and that you\u2019re still working on it, but Megan could still have a hold on you. So we need to go back and get Marlene and she can help you.\u00a0 Shoot back to the man you used to be.\tI don\u2019t want that.\tYou don\u2019t wanna be the man you were.\tNo. That man died years ago. No, no, he did.\tAnd you are standing right in front of me and whatever Megan did to you, we can fix it.\tThere is nothing to fix. I don\u2019t need Marlena. I don\u2019t need anyone.\tOh really? Oh really?\tYou agree with Ciara?\t", "Yeah, well as soon as I hear anything new, I will let you know you take care of yourself. Lucas.\tHey, everything okay?\tYeah, just giving Lucas the latest on the search for Megan Hathaway.\tI\u2019d like an update yourself and I was about to give you. Hope has a lead on Megan\u2019s location thanks to Harris.\tMichaels, do you really mean that?\tI need to trust you? We\u2019d have to take it slow.\tI\u2019m okay with slow.\tWhat the hell is going on here?\tHi honey. What are you? Here. Oh my God. Credible surprise. I am so. I\u2019m so happy to see you. Let me look at my beautiful girl. I thought you were in the Caribbean sailing around with Ben and Little Bow.\tYeah, I was, uh, up until a few hours ago we docked and um, I got a motel and I happened to call Sean and he told me that you were about an hour away.\tWow. What a coincidence, huh? Yeah. Yeah. I\u2019m so thrilled to see you. Yeah. Oh my gosh. But wait a second. I\u2019m a little confused about this because this is a secured facility. How the heck did you get in here?\tWell, uh, I am my mother\u2019s daughter after all.\tMm-hmm. ,\tI convinced Cousin Andrew to give me clearance.\tYeah, that turns out I did it just in time. Cuz I\u2019m here to stop you from making the biggest mistake of your life.\tThanks for the memories. But I\u2019m gonna go into my future on my own.\tOh my God.\tGood to see you too. You\u2019re alive. My, my brother\u2019s alive.\tWhat the.\tIs this real? Is it.\tLike sand through the hourglass. So are the days of our lives.\tCiara, listen to me.\tNo mom, you listen to me. You told me that you were out searching for Megan Hathaway. You told me that you were hunting her down to make her pay for what she did to us,\twhich I am.\tReally?\tYes,\tbecause I just walked in on you kissing the man that she hired to kill you.\tIf I can just,\tit\u2019s okay.\tNo, it\u2019s not. It is absolutely not.\tOkay.\tAnd I just know that daddy would be rolling over in his grave if he could see you right now.\tWe weren\u2019t expecting this.\tRolf told me that Megan was trying to bring back a lost love, but honestly, I never, I never thought it was possible. Miracle, miracle.\tWhat happened?\tOh. Tried to inject me with his sedative and gave her a taste of her own medicine.\tOh, they just love needles around here, don\u2019t they? Rolf just tried to do his latest test on me and his serum, and I just, I, I, I thought \u2019em off and I ran, and I\tSo you\u2019re done with this insane experiment too, huh?\tSo Meins had you here all this.\tYeah, I told her I was leaving. She put up a fight and lost it. Looks like she\u2019s coming to.\tYeah. We better get the hell outta here.\tNo, no. Wait, wait, wait. We can\u2019t.\tWhy not?\tBecause Marlena is here too, and we are not going without her.\tHarris Michaels, wasn\u2019t he working for Megan?\tApparently she brainwashed him into doing her dirty work, but, uh, according to Hope, the ISA has got him. Back in his right mind and now he is doing everything he can to help track down his old boss and, uh, bring it to justice.\tHmm. But I don\u2019t know, I mean, after all the damage this Harris guy did last summer, I do you really believe there\u2019s anything he says that we can trust?\tMom, you have to get away from this man.\tYou don\u2019t understand.\tUnderstand what, why I just walked in on you kissing the man who tried to kill all of us in Montreal. I mean, just can please explain this to me. Please. Just tell me that you are using him to get information.\tI, he\u2019s already filled as a possible location.\u00a0 In fact, John and your uncle Steve are checking it out right now as we speak.\tOkay. All right. So you got him to give up his boss. That\u2019s very nice work, mom. But did you have to do it by literally kissing him on,\tstop it just. Stop for one minute and listen to me. Harris is not the same man.\tHarris is a monster who we both know is very skilled at deception.\u00a0 He might still be on your side, but he also might be loyal to Megan mom. He sometimes three women to their deaths already. Do you really wanna be one of them?\tCan you hear me?\u00a0 Oh, if this really is, shoot, come on. Please open those beautiful eyes.\u00a0 It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m right here. It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m gonna get her some help. I\u2019m gonna get her some help, baby.\tWhy am I not surprised to find you here?\tI apologize for interrupting her. I see you and Dr. Evans in the midst of a joyous reunion.\t", "I, I get where she\u2019s coming from. I mean, I understand why she\u2019s worried. Why, why shouldn\u2019t she be? I terrorized her family.\u00a0 Look, I, I take responsibility for my actions and really, I\u2019m, I\u2019m grateful that I get a chance to, to apologize to you in.\u00a0 Ciara, I am. Um, I am truly sorry for what I did to you and your family, and I do not blame you one bit for not wanting me near your.\tHoney, remember how, um, how people reacted when you first got together with Ben? Everyone thought, well, especially. Beth, there was absolutely no way he could ever change. But you believe he deserved to cycle? I believe Harris does too.\tI\u2019m just, um, I\u2019m really worried about you. I mean, ever since Daddy died, Exactly. Have the best luck in the love department.\tI agree with you on that. It\u2019s true. \u2018Mm-hmm. Harris and I have decided, um, we\u2019re gonna take one step at a time. We\u2019re gonna take it slow. I promise you, Ciara, you have to recognize he put his life on the line B and d programmed to help me find.\tIt nearly killed him.\tThat was very brave of you. Yes. Thank you. Mm-hmm. . So, um, you gave Steve and John Megan\u2019s location that, uh, that map that you found, that\u2019s where you think she is. Yeah. It\u2019s impossible location. Yeah. Okay. Why do we need to hear what they.\tSo, um, tell me everything. Fill me in. Tell me about Little Bow. How is the Caribbean? No, how big is he? Oh, okay. All right. Okay. Is he sitting first? His mama, mama mom? Yes. What. As you have some news and it is good kind of news. I love a good kind. Mm-hmm. , please tell me right now. All right, so, uh, baby bow is going to be a big brother.\tThe baby. Yeah. , no pregnant. Oh my gosh. That is not the good kind of news that. What\u2019s the great kind news? My daughter, congratulations.\tSeems I a third wheel, so\tyou should know by. That\u2019s impossible.\tAre you sure that you\u2019re okay? I am. Now that you\u2019re here, let get you out this thing. Okay?\tYou love company.\tMegan has been keeping others captive as well. Listen, listen, I, I, I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t even imagine what you went through here, but you survived and, and I\u2019m sure that a lot of what drove you was your feelings for hope. Come on. Had nothing to do with her. Megan saved me. She put me on ice, cured my tumor. The downside from all that is she has this crazy ass fantasy that we belong together.\tOh, that, that\u2019s impossible because you belong with Hope. Ancient history. No. No. Oh, listen, you might have been gone, but the love was still there. It\u2019s, it\u2019s still there. Lord. You stop. What? You\u2019re there just not thinking straight. You want what I want? Has nothing to do with hope or my past. That\u2019s over. No it\u2019s not.\tIt can never be over Bo. Not when you have a love like that. And I know that because I have the same exact love with Steve. And you know what? When you are lucky enough to be a person on this earth who finds somebody with that kind of connection is, it\u2019s just so powerful. That you, you\u2019ll fight your way back and you will find it again no matter what the obstacles are.\tKayla\u2019s alive too. Yes. And so was Kate. What do you mean was\tMegan killed her at, at least that\u2019s what she told us. Think she might have been lying. I don\u2019t know, maybe, but she took Kate out and, and then Kayla and I heard a gunshot. Guns sound good? Mm. Where is Kayla? Hello? She\u2019s probably with Steve right now. Steve is here too. Yeah. He and I split up to look for Megan.\tI found her.\tHer job, my pleasure.\tYou\u2019re alive.\tSo is Kayla\ttold you? Oh my God. Oh my God.\tSo, where the hell is she? Huh? Where\u2019s Kayla?\tAll right. We need to go find Marlena because I know that she could help you. I don\u2019t need Marlena or Hope or my old life that I know for sure that mechanism in your head because the bow that I know would move heaven and earth to get back to hope and his kids. You\u2019re wasting your breath. Nothing. Oh, really?\tOh really? Are you telling me that you don\u2019t care at all about Sierra or Sean Douglas? We need Chuck Co. What about Claire, your granddaughter? What about your grandson?\tI have a grandson. Yes, Sierra had a little baby boy and she named him Little Bo. He\u2019s almost a year. I mean, don\u2019t you wanna meet him? Don\u2019t you wanna hold him?

Uh, what sort of business was it that elena caught you and nate doing?\tVictoria: You know what, are you finished? Because I\u2019m really sick and tired of your self-righteous garbage. Neither one of us is a saint, okay? And this doesn\u2019t involve you, at all.\tNick: I saw elena last night. She\u2019s heartbroken. She\u2019s already packed up and moved out. It\u2019s wrong, vic.

I feel like I don\u2019t even know you right now and I don\u2019t know what to do about it.\tNikki: You\u2019re in quite the mood this morning.\tVictoria: Yes, I am because of all of the good news you\u2019ve brought me. Nikki: Hm. Why do I get the feeling it has nothing to do with work and everything to do with nate?\t[ Nate sighing ]\tAudra: Two creams, one sugar.\tNate: Audra, let\u2019s get one thing straight.\tAudra: What\u2019s that?\tNate: What the hell were you thinking? Setting up elena that way?\tAudra: Uh, excuse me?\tNate: Don\u2019t play coy with me. You sent her to L.A. Knowing she could get her heart broken. What is wrong with you? Lactaid is 100% real milk,\tAnnouncer: Additional sponsorship provided by\u2026\tDiane: You might want to rethink that nasty attitude since we\u2019re about to become family.\tAshley: You don\u2019t know the meaning of the word, diane. So, I understand why you\u2019re confused, but we will never be family.\tDiane: Uh, jack was ready to marry me in jail. This marriage is definitely going to happen.\tAshley: There\u2019s no explaining stupidity, diane. You\u2019re going back to jail, so don\u2019t think that we\u2019re gonna be having any family time together, okay?\tDiane: It won\u2019t ever come to that.\tAshley: Well, you\u2019re delusional as usual.\tDiane: We\u2019ll see.\tAshley: What are you talking about? There\u2019s so much evidence against you.\tDiane: Then I guess we have to agree to disagree.\tAshley: Why are you so certain?\tDiane: Oh, do I seem confident that I\u2019m not going to prison?\tAshley: You do? So, what are you up to?\tDiane: I\u2019m not up to anything. I have innocence on my side along with michael, kyle, and jack.\tSummer: Kyle, I love you so much. It\u2019s never been my intention to shut you out. It\u2019s just\u2013 I don\u2019t know. My mind has been so jumbled. So, if you could just give me a little bit more time.\tKyle: This is hard for me too, summer. Watching you and my mom suffer, feeling powerless to help. I mean, until today I thought you were punishing me for what my mom did, but now we know it was all a set up, so she didn\u2019t actually do anything to phyllis.\tSummer: Sorry, do we actually know that? Look I know that my mom is supposedly alive, but there hasn\u2019t been some joyful, miraculous reunion. I don\u2019t\u2013 I don\u2019t get to see her or touch her or talk to her. Look, if this is true, then things are gonna get better, right? They have to, but it\u2019s not gonna happen overnight, and right now, I\u2019m sorry, I have to go.\tKyle: Well, let me grab my stuff, we can drive in together.\tSummer: No, I have to do something before I go to work. Um, I\u2019ll meet you there.\tVictoria: I am well aware of your thoughts on nate. So, why don\u2019t we just fast forward through that? Oh, I have an idea, new topic. How about how dad\u2019s just handed adam an entire kingdom?\tNikki: [ Sighing ] Why do you even care about that?\tVictoria: Because it\u2019s going to end in a disaster.\tNikki: Well, so what if it does? It\u2019s no skin off your nose?\tVictoria: Mm, I see. So, now you\u2019re rooting for adam.\tNikki: Not at all, but this is important to your father, so why don\u2019t you just let him have it without all the bitter comments?\tVictoria: Mccall unlimited would have dovetailed nicely into all of our divisions. I\u2013 I just gave up on it too easily. Just let it fall right into adam\u2019s clutches.\tNikki: Oh, my god. You sound more like your father every day. Like it\u2019s not enough to want the world, but you want to conquer everything. And your opponent must lose, as if their losing makes your victory even sweeter.\tVictoria: Are we still talking about mccall unlimited? Because if this is about nate, I think maybe I should be offended.\tAudra: It was elena\u2019s idea to fly out and confront you. I didn\u2019t send her to los angeles.\t", "Summer: I\u2013 I can\u2019t even wrap my head around it and trust me, I\u2019m not immediately accepting it as fact. I mean, we were all here. We saw my mom unconscious on the floor, the ambulance crash, the fire, all of that was very real, but I just can\u2019t help but wonder\u2026 if it is true and my mom came back, I mean, what would happen to her going forward?\tAge-related\tmacular degeneration\tAudra: I won\u2019t deny, I\u2013 I would have liked to see where things might have gone with us, but I\u2019m not gonna try to compete with the pull between you and victoria. That could get messy and it\u2019s okay. You know, you can\u2019t always get what you want in this life. At least not all of it.\tNate: I suppose not.\tAudra: My ultimate goal is for you to see me as an ally, not an enemy. I want you to have everything your heart desires and I\u2019ll help however I can.\tNate: And you want something in return? I know you\u2019re not being altruistic here. So, we\u2019re helping each other, right? We have to trust each other to get exactly what we want and I know exactly what you want.\tAudra: Oh. Success is about give and take. As you move up the ladder and get closer to victoria, there\u2019s gonna be an empty spot at the top of the organization chart at newman media.\tNate: And you\u2019d like to fill it.\tChance: So you want to know what kind of trouble your mom would be in if she was alive?\tSummer: Legally, yeah.\tChance: Well, I mean, anything I say would be speculation. You know, I don\u2019t want to mess with your emotions that way.\tSummer: I appreciate that chance, but I can handle it. Really, I can. What kind of charges would she be facing? Is there any way that she could come back and not serve time in prison?\tChance: It depends on what evidence she presents.\tSummer: Is there anything that you could do to protect her? I mean, if she is out there agonizing over what to do next. She could be on the run or in hiding. She would be afraid to come back, afraid of what would happen to her. And I just, I hate to think about her like that.\tChance: Summer, I understand your urge to play out every possible outcome, I do, but I wish you wouldn\u2019T. I mean, don\u2019t do that to yourself.\tAshley: I don\u2019t care if jack and kyle and the president of the united states are on your side, a jury\u2019s gonna see right through you.\tDiane: No jury, no courtroom, no judge.\tAshley: Oh, there will be a trial.\tDiane: Mm, don\u2019t think so.\tAshley: What are you basing this on? Your hallucinations?\tDiane: No, I\u2019m basing it on\u2026 oh, good morning, tucker.\tTucker: Good morning.\tAshley: Thank god, you\u2019re up. Hey, I got an idea, let\u2019s go somewhere.\tTucker: Yeah, it\u2019s a nice day, you want to take a walk?\tAshley: I\u2019d love to.\tTucker: Would you care to join us, diane? Oh, that\u2019s right, your little ankle accessory there. That\u2019s a shame.\tDiane: Ah, ha ha ha ha ha. Hey, are you a stand-up comedian now? I mean, don\u2019t tell me that you sold off your life\u2019s work to victor newman just for that new career.\tTucker: What\u2019s with her?\tAshley: I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s very optimistic about her circumstances. Practically dancing on poor phyllis\u2019s grave.\tDiane: Poor phyllis. Oh, you have no idea what\u2026\tTucker: No, please finish your thought. I\u2019m fascinated.\tAshley: Yeah. I\u2019m fascinated too.\tDiane: Oh, never mind, I\u2019ll keep it to myself. And in the meantime, I\u2019ll look forward to watching you eat some delicious humble pie. Enjoy your walk.\tDaniel: Summer.\tSummer: Now, I know why you didn\u2019t return any of my phone calls. You were too busy stabbing mom in the back.\t[ Daniel sighing ]\tDaniel: I should have known kyle couldn\u2019t keep his mouth shut.\tSummer: Thankfully, he has a little bit more respect for me than you do.\tDaniel: I respect you too, summer, and I didn\u2019t stab anyone in the back. I took the necessary steps to end this and to protect us all. You\u2019ll notice I found a way to out mom without letting anyone know that you lied. I kept your name out of it, so you\u2019re welcome.\tSummer: Daniel, do you have any idea how I\u2019ve had to scramble to make sure that my story matched yours? I told you that we needed to wait until we had a plan that wouldn\u2019t ruin our mom\u2019s life. What did you do? You went straight to jack, the last person that should have known any of this. What the hell were you thinking?\tDaniel: That I don\u2019t take orders from you. I get that you\u2019re upset about mom and I know this is making you a wreck because I\u2019m a wreck too, but secrecy isn\u2019t the way to handle this. We need to find her, we need to sort this out and we need to get her legal help or our mother is screwed.\tVictoria: Oh, hey.\tNate: Hey, I hope you don\u2019t mind me waiting in here.\tVictoria: No, not at all. How are you doing? I know that, um, you\u2019re feeling conflicted about certain things. Is there anything I can do to help?\tNate: You\u2019ve asked me where I\u2019d like things to go between us.\tVictoria: Yes, that\u2019s right. Have you had any thoughts about it? (Vo) no matter what type of severe asthma you have\u2026\tAnnouncer: The young and the restless will continue.\tVictoria: I really wasn\u2019t expecting that.\tNate: I don\u2019t want to be so forward here in your office, but I felt that was necessary.\tVictoria: Necessary, how so?\tNate: Last time we saw each other, I kind of hit the brakes, but I\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking since then.\tVictoria: About?\tNate: You. Us.\tVictoria: Any conclusions?\t", "Nate: I broke elena\u2019s heart and I wish I hadn\u2019T. She\u2019s a wonderful woman who didn\u2019t deserve that. But what you and I have, it can\u2019t be denied. It isn\u2019t going anywhere. I\u2019m trying to ignore it. It\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s just impossible.\tVictoria: It\u2019s not even remotely possible.\t[ Knock on door ]\tNick: Vic, it\u2019s me.\tMichael: I understand you want answers, but first, we have to find phyllis and then bring her home. And given what she\u2019s done and what she\u2019d be facing if she turned herself in, I\u2019m guessing she doesn\u2019t want to be found. Easier just to stay dead.\tLauren: But she hasn\u2019T. If daniel has seen her, she has blown her cover.\tMichael: And what if there\u2019s never another sighting or any hard evidence that she\u2019s still amongst the living?\tLauren: Well, then daniel looks unstable and becomes the man who sees his dead mother, which my gosh. As if he hasn\u2019t suffered enough.\tMichael: No, no, no, it\u2019s also possible that phyllis is laying low, keeping her options open, trying to think her way out of this. That\u2019s what I\u2019d do.\tLauren: You would never be in this mess.\tMichael: Oh, there was a time.\tLauren: That was a long time ago. And you, unlike our dear un-departed friend, you\u2019ve learned from your mistakes.\tMichael: Still a work in progress, but I appreciate your faith in me.\tLauren: You know, phyllis has really pulled a lot of outrageous stunts in her life, but this? If and when she ever resurfaces, people are gonna want her head on a platter.\tMichael: They\u2019ll get past this. And so will you\u2026 eventually.\tLauren: Of course, I will. I want her home. I want her safe and I want her sound. Okay, um, what\u2019s your next move?\tMichael: I am mulling over a few options.\tLauren: Well, it better be ingenious because it\u2019s gonna be very hard to find someone as cagey as phyllis.\tVictoria: Hi.\tNick: Hi. Is this a bad time?\tVictoria: No, come in.\tNate: Thanks for those figures. I will touch base later. Nick.\tNick: Nate. I mean, come on. What is it? Is this office like an aphrodisiac?\tVictoria: Come on. The last thing that I need is another lecture from you.\tNick: You just can\u2019t see it, can you?\tVictoria: See what?\tNick: He\u2019s playing you, vic. He has taken advantage of your interest in him.\tVictoria: Oh, please.\tNick: He uses people and then has no scruples. He\u2019s hurt elena and lily, his entire family. I can smell his ambition from a mile away.\tVictoria: I happen to like that he\u2019s ambitious.\tNick: I don\u2019T. It concerns me.\tVictoria: Yeah, of course, it concerns you. To you, ambition is like a dirty word. However, for me and nate, it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s nothing to be embarrassed about. It\u2019s good, we want more. We want to be the best. You know, newman enterprises is lucky to have people who think that way working for us.\tNick: What are you implying? That I don\u2019t pull my weight around here just because I\u2019m not power-hungry.\tSummer: You betrayed me, daniel. What\u2019s worse is that you betrayed our mom.\tDaniel: I did no such thing.\tSummer: You decided that you knew best and you went to jack and it\u2019s exactly what mom predicted. You didn\u2019t handle anything. You just made it infinitely more complicated. Now, chance and christine know, michael, kyle. Even diane knows.\tDaniel: Well, that\u2019s great because I asked jack to keep that to himself.\tSummer: Oh, and did you really think that he would listen to you? Why would he? And do you think that mom would even consider coming back with the whole town turning their back on her? Not to mention the position that you\u2019ve put me in having to act all stunned about all this.\tDaniel: Whoa, whoa, I protected you. I covered up the fact that you had knowledge that could save kyle\u2019s mom and you hid it.\tSummer: I really hope that you don\u2019t expect any gratitude from me because what you did was wrong and it was completely unfair.\tKyle: Whoa, whoa guys, calm down. What the hell is going on here? Ultomiris is for adults with generalized myasthenia gravis\tTucker: What was that comment diane made about you eating humble pie?\tAshley: Who knows what goes on in that sick brain of hers? You know, I don\u2019t even care anymore. She thinks she knows something that we don\u2019t and it makes her feel very special and the more I think about it, then I\u2019m just playing into her hand, so let\u2019s not talk about her, please.\tTucker: Deal.\tAshley: Thank you.\tTucker: You want to get a bite after this?\tAshley: Uh, I really kind of have to go to work.\tTucker: No, no, no, no, you really have to do nothing. You have to savor this moment with me because I have an important plan later and we might not get to see each other \u2019til this evening.\tAshley: Wait, what? You have a plan.\tTucker: Yes, I\u2019m hoping to get permission to watch dom and his music group.\tAshley: That\u2019s your plan?\tTucker: Yes. That\u2019s my one and only calendar item for the day. Got all this free time now, it\u2019s wild.\tAshley: Yeah, sounds pretty wild.\t[ Tucker sighing ]\tTucker: I spent so many years working. Working on my company seven days a week.\tAshley: Yeah.\tTucker: Sitting on a mountain top, racing cars. It\u2019s too much work. If I want to know my grandson, it\u2019s got to be now. It\u2019s now or never. Same with devon. Same with you. Proving to you that I\u2019m the man of your dreams, right?\tAshley: Uh-oh, that\u2019s a lot of work.\t", "Nate: But you made damn sure she knew I wasn\u2019t out there alone. That I was with victoria, even though it was a business trip.\tAudra: How was I supposed to know you kept that detail from her? And why did you? Once elena made the decision, who was I to talk her out of it? She was hell bent on finding you.\tNate: Stop trying to justify your actions, audra. You lit the match knowing it would upset her.\tAudra: Elena was already suspicious. You\u2019d fallen out of love with her. Oh, don\u2019t deny it. I could read the signs and so could elena. Look, as devastating as this breakup is for her, isn\u2019t it really what\u2019s best for everyone?\tNate: It shouldn\u2019t have gone down like that. She didn\u2019t deserve to be treated this way.\tAudra: I suggest you let it go, let her go. Like trust me, elena is gonna be fine without you. You two just weren\u2019t a\u2013 a match, that\u2019s all. And even if this thing didn\u2019t happen with victoria, you know, I doubt your girlfriend would have been able to get behind your new vision for the future.\tNate: Which is what exactly?\tAudra: You don\u2019t think I figured it out? I know what you\u2019re up to. Newman media isn\u2019t enough, you want his and her thrones running the kingdom alongside victoria.\tAre you tired\tof washing dishes?\tAudra: You\u2019ve done an impressive job so far, making the transition from medicine to business. Still, you know, who would have thought you\u2019d rise this far this fast? And yet, you have. And now, you\u2019re completely in with victoria, personally, as well as professionally, while making it seem like it was the boss lady driving it all along. Hm. Well done, you.\tNate: Are you finished?\tAudra: Uh, is there more to the story?\tNate: From my vantage point, yes. You seem to have some facts wrong.\tAudra: Enlighten me.\tNate: The way things evolved with victoria was not calculated. We had a connection that just exploded. It took us both by surprise, but it\u2019s strong, audra, and it\u2019s real.\tAudra: That sounds lovely.\tNate: Last night, I told her she was the most amazing woman I have ever met and that is the truth.\tAudra: Uh, I believe you. Yeah, I\u2019ve seen it, felt it in the room when you were both there. I won\u2019t lie, um, I was a little disappointed at first because I felt an attraction to you from the beginning.\tNate: What? Is that the reason you pushed elena to go to L.A. To come after victoria and me? Did you think if you blew up our relationship, it\u2019d somehow clear a path for you? Nikki: Well, your conscience must be bothering you because I wasn\u2019t thinking of nate at all.\tVictoria: Some people say I don\u2019t have a conscience.\tNikki: Well, I know that that\u2019s not true, even though that is the image you like to project. In reality, you are much more considerate than you want people to realize.\tVictoria: Just have take your word for that, mom.\tNikki: Okay, I know you don\u2019t want to hear this, but I\u2019m going to say it anyway.\tVictoria: I\u2019m sure you are. Go ahead.\tNikki: Have you given any thought at all to elena?\tVictoria: You know, I have to get to the office. There\u2019s some things that I need to take care of, but please stay. No rush. Finish your coffee.\tNikki: Victoria\u2013\tVictoria no, I insist, mom.\tNikki: Oh, honey, come on.\t[ Nikki sighing ]\tLauren: I just keep going back and forth and back and forth with how I feel about all this.\tMichael: Which part?\tLauren: Everything. I mean, I\u2019m so thrilled that my best friend could possibly be alive, but how could she do this to us? Why would she do this to us? The way we\u2019ve been grieving, I\u2013 I mean, phyllis would never.\tMichael: Mm\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t be too sure about that. You saw how she was spinning out. She was mad at the world and fighting with everybody and where diane was concerned, please.\tLauren: She was unhinged. And I\u2019m no fan of diane\u2019s, but phyllis could have taken it down a notch or two.\tMichael: Ergo, perhaps it\u2019s plausible that phyllis went all out to turn the tables, subject diane to the exact same type of hell she went through.\t> Lauren: The perfect revenge.\tMichael: It is brilliant, if horrible.\tLauren: I really hope that phyllis is still alive\u2026 but to knowingly break our hearts? I mean, how do we come back from this? How does she?\t[ Summer sighing ]\tSummer: Hey. Thank you for meeting me here. I\u2013 I had to see you.\tChance: Yeah, it sounded urgent. What\u2019s going on?\tSummer: First of all, I\u2013 I know that this sounds crazy. I\u2013 I don\u2019t even know what to think about it, but I\u2019m just, I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve heard the same rumor that I have? Do I need to be more specific?\tChance: No, christine told me. Daniel saw phyllis alive.\tSummer: I mean\u2026\tChance: Look summer, given that this came from jack, someone who has a vested interest and someone who I no longer trust, my initial reaction was that this was just some ploy to get diane off the hook, which pisses me off on your behalf.\tSummer: Why for me?\tChance: It\u2019s cruel to give you false hope like that.\tSummer: So, you don\u2019t think it\u2019s true?\tChance: You want to know what I think? I think diane didn\u2019t mean to kill your mom. I think something went sideways. A\u2013 a mistake was made and here we are. I also think there\u2019s more to this story than what I know and I think it involves jeremy stark somehow.\tSummer: It\u2019s definitely complicated.\tChance: Right. But look, this notion about your mother faking her death and trying to frame diane, I think it\u2019s a stretch. I think it\u2019s a scheme cooked up by michael baldwin and your father-in-law and it\u2019s gonna backfire on him. Also, christine is not having any of this and her instincts are usually right.\t"], "answer": [1, 4, 2, 3, 0]}
