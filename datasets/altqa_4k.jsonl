( later known as Rankin / Bass Productions ) and currently distributed by Universal Television . It first aired Sunday , December 6 , 1964 , on the NBC television network in the United States , and was sponsored by General Electric under the umbrella title of The General Electric Fantasy Hour . The special was based on the Johnny Marks song `` Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer '' which was itself based on the poem of the same name written in 1939 by Marks ' brother - in - law , Robert L. May . Since 1972 , the special has aired on CBS , with the network unveiling a high - definition , digitally remastered version of the program in 2005 . As with A Charlie Brown Christmas and How the Grinch Stole Christmas , Rudolph no longer airs just once annually , but several times during the Christmas and holiday season on CBS . Unlike other holiday specials that also air on several cable channels ( including Freeform ) , Rudolph only airs on CBS . It has been telecast every year since 1964 , making it the longest continuously running Christmas TV special in history . 2014 marked the 50th anniversary of the television special and a series of postage stamps featuring Rudolph was issued by the United States Postal Service on November 6 , 2014 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Cast </Li> <Li> 3 Production <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Aftermath </Li> <Li> 3.2 Production credits </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Different versions <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Original 1964 NBC broadcast edit </Li> <Li> 4.2 1965 -- 1997 telecasts </Li> <Li> 4.3 1998 -- CBS telecasts </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Home media </Li> <Li> 6 Soundtrack </Li> <Li> 7 Merchandise </Li> <Li> 8 Sequels </Li> <Li> 9 In popular culture <Ul> <Li> 9.1 Films by Corky Quakenbush </Li> <Li> 9.2 Uses in advertising </Li> <Li> 9.3 Other References </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 10 Copyright issues </Li> <Li> 11 See also </Li> <Li> 12 References </Li> <Li> 13 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> Sam the Snowman welcomes the viewers to Christmastown at the North Pole and introduces Santa and Mrs. Claus who live in a castle located north of the Christmas Tree Forest . Mrs. Claus fusses over Santa as she wants him to fatten up by Christmas Eve . Sam then recalls the year Christmas was almost cancelled due to a snowstorm and tells the story of how a very special reindeer saved the day . </P> <P> Donner , Santa 's lead reindeer , and his wife have given birth to their new baby fawn , Rudolph . Upon admiring him , they are surprised to see that Rudolph has been born with a glowing red nose . When Santa arrives , he warns Donner that Rudolph will not make the sleigh team because of his nose . Donner then decides to hide the nose by covering it with mud to allow Rudolph to fit in with all the other reindeer . </P> <P> Over Rudolph 's first year of life , Donner trains him in the basics of being a reindeer , including hiding from the Abominable Snow Monster of the North . Rudolph enters the reindeer games , competing against his fellow fawns . During flight practice , Rudolph meets a doe named Clarice who tells him he is cute , and kisses him , which causes an elated Rudolph to fly higher and faster than everyone else . However , while celebrating with the other bucks , Rudolph 's nose cover pops off , and the others react with fear , then scorn and finally rejection as Rudolph is kicked out of the Reindeer Games . Walking away , Rudolph walks with Clarice , who supports him , until her father firmly tells her to never have any more contacts with a red - nosed reindeer . Then , Rudolph meets up with Hermey , an elf who ran away from Santa 's workshop because he wanted to be a dentist instead of making toys , and they decide to run away together . The pair then meet a prospector named Yukon Cornelius , who has fruitlessly searched his whole life for silver and gold . After escaping the snow monster on an ice floe , the trio crash land on the Island of Misfit Toys where unloved or unwanted toys live with their ruler , a winged lion named King Moonracer . The king allows the group to stay one night on the island in exchange for returning to Christmastown to ask Santa to find homes for the unwanted toys . However , Rudolph leaves the island in the middle of the night on his own , fearing that his nose , which attracts the snow monster , will endanger his friends . </P> <P> Time goes by and Rudolph grows into adulthood ; he tries and fails to find a place to settle where he will be accepted despite his nose . Returning home , he finds that his parents and Clarice have been looking for him for months . He sets out once again to find them , only to discover that the snow monster has captured them . Rudolph tries to save Clarice from being eaten , but the monster hits him in the head with a stalactite , dazing him . Hermey and Yukon return to Christmastown and go to save Rudolph . Hermey , posing as a pig , lures the monster out of his cave and Yukon drops rocks on his head to knock him out . Hermey then pulls out all the monster 's teeth . Realizing Yukon drives the toothless ( and now terrified ) monster back , only to follow it over the cliff with all his pack dogs . Mourning Yukon 's presumed death , Rudolph , Hermey , Clarice , and the Donners return home where everyone apologizes to them . After hearing their story , Santa welcomes the group back to Christmastown , promises that he will find homes for the Misfit Toys , Hermey opens his own dentist 's office , and Clarice 's father apologizes for being so hard on Rudolph . Yukon then returns with a reformed snow monster ( Yukon notes that they bounce ) and demonstrates the beast 's ability to trim a Christmas tree . While everybody 's celebrating , Santa interrupts , grimly informing everyone that because of the storm , he is forced to cancel the Christmas trip . Santa is soon distracted by Rudolph 's red nose and realizes that its light could cut through the storm . He asks Rudolph to lead the sleigh and Rudolph agrees . The team then flies off to the island and pick up the toys . The special ends with Santa wishing the viewers a merry Christmas as he and Rudolph fly off into the night . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> Hermey and Rudolph <Ul> <Li> Billie Mae Richards voices Rudolph , a reindeer with strong mental ( he learns to speak shortly after birth ) and physical strength who is shunned for his nonconforming red nose , but later saves Christmas . </Li> <Li> Stan Francis voices : <Ul> <Li> Santa Claus , portrayed in the special as a moody , nervous and `` skinny Santa '' whose fears are only allayed when he conjures the idea of using Rudolph 's nose to lead the sleigh . </Li> <Li> King Moonracer , a winged lion who rules the entire Island of Misfit Toys . King Moonracer 's voice uses a reverb effect to distinguish it from Santa Claus . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Paul Kligman voices : <Ul> <Li> Donner , Rudolph 's father and Santa 's most prized reindeer . While he loves and accepts Rudolph , he shows great concern that society will reject him for his nose and tries to protect him by creating a nose cover . </Li> <Li> Comet , head coach of the Reindeer Games . </Li> <Li> Clarice 's unnamed father , who forbids Clarice from shaming the family by associating with a red - nosed reindeer . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Burl Ives voices Sam the Snowman , the narrator . </Li> <Li> Paul Soles voices Hermey , an elf who dreams of pursuing a career in dentistry and `` feels different '' from the other elves . He eventually is forced out and runs off with Rudolph . </Li> <Li> Janis Orenstein voices Clarice , a female reindeer who is the only one of Rudolph 's age to not reject him . She later joins Rudolph 's parents in the search party . </Li> <Li> Larry D. Mann voices Yukon Cornelius , the `` greatest prospector of the North '' who joins Rudolph and Hermey on their journey but never finds the silver and gold he seeks . </Li> <Li> Peg Dixon voices : <Ul> <Li> Mrs. Claus , a pushy wife who mocks her husband 's lack of appetite . </Li> <Li> Mrs. Donner , a loving and mostly submissive wife . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Carl Banas voices : <Ul> <Li> The Head Elf . For the Head Elf 's voice , Banas uses a meek Bill Thompson - like voice when speaking in front of Santa Claus , but turns into a ruthless boss with a voice similar to Mel Blanc 's Yosemite Sam or Cosmo Spacely when Santa is not around . </Li> <Li> Various Misfit Toys , including a Spotted Elephant , King Moonracer 's footman ; a bird that swims , a cowboy who rides an ostrich , a train with square wheels on his caboose , two teddy bears ( one on a bicycle and one with wings ) , a boat that does n't float , a set of clown nesting dolls with a wind - up mouse as the last one , a water pistol that shoots jelly , a plane that ca n't fly , a toy car that only drives in reverse , and a scooter with two wheels in front and one in back . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Alfie Scopp voices : <Ul> <Li> Fireball , who introduces Rudolph to the opposite sex , but later snubs Rudolph when his red nose is revealed . </Li> <Li> Charlie - In - The - Box , the island 's sentry . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Corinne Conley voices Dolly , a seemingly normal girl rag doll on the Island of Misfit Toys . Her misfit problem is never explained on the special ; many decades later , on NPR 's Wait Wait ... Do n't Tell Me ! news quiz show ( broadcast December 8 , 2007 ) , Rudolph 's producer , Arthur Rankin Jr. , noted that Dolly 's problem was psychological , caused by being abandoned by her owner ( named as Sue in the special ) and suffering depression from feeling uncared - for . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <P> The TV special , with the teleplay by Romeo Muller , introduced several new characters inspired by the song 's lyrics . Muller told an interviewer shortly before his death that he would have preferred to base the teleplay on May 's original book , but could not find a copy . Other than Burl Ives , all characters were portrayed by Canadian actors recorded at RCA studios in Toronto under the supervision of Bernard Cowan . </P> <P> After the script , concept designs and storyboards for Rudolph were done by Arthur Rankin , Jr. and his staff of artists at Rankin / Bass in New York City . The company 's trademark stop motion animation process , known as `` Animagic '' , was filmed at MOM Productions in Tokyo with supervision by Tadahito Mochinaga and associate direction by Kizo Nagashima . Besides Rudolph , Mochinaga and the rest of the Japanese puppet animation staff are also known for their partnership with Rankin / Bass on their other Animagic productions almost throughout the 1960s , from The New Adventures of Pinocchio , to Willy McBean a\n\nQuestion:\nwhen was rudolf the rednosed reindeer movie made\n", "answer": "1964"}

Education for the deaf was made available in the District of Columbia through the Columbia Institution for the Deaf established by the Act of February 16 , 1857 . The name was changed to Gallaudet College in 1954 . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> The Vocational Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1943 expanded functions relating to vocational rehabilitation and assigned them to the Federal Security Administrator , who established the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation on September 4 , 1943 , to carry out these functions . Since the original Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1920 , certain vocational rehabilitation and vocational education activities had been a responsibility of the Office of Education , first when it was part of the Department of Interior , then after it became part of FSA in 1939 . </Li> <Li> Impact of World War II <Ul> <Li> World War II had a broad impact on the social programs of FSA . Between 1941 and 1947 , the Government recognized the need to maintain essential health and welfare services . The Federal Security Administrator also served as coordinator of the Office of Health , Welfare , and related Defense Activities , renamed the Office of Defense , Health , and Welfare Services in September 1941 , which provided health care , education , and related services necessitated by the war effort . It was responsible for adjusting the distribution of remaining professional personnel to meet the requirements of the population . In 1943 , the Office 's title was again changed to the Office of Community War Services , which was abolished on June 30 , 1947 . </Li> <Li> The FDA during the war was charged with maintaining food standards to insure delivery of properly tested foods and drugs to the military establishment . </Li> <Li> The Public Health Service was in charge of protecting both the general population and military personnel against epidemics and carrying out medical research . DHHS history </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> Post-wwii ( edit ) <P> Organizational Changes </P> <P> When the war ended , President Truman moved to `` strengthen the arm of the federal government for better integration of services in the fields of health , education , and welfare . '' </P> <Ul> <Li> 1946 <Ul> <Li> Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1946 , effective July 16 , 1946 , abolished the three - member Social Security Board , creating in its place , the Social Security Administration , headed by a Commissioner of Social Security . The plan transferred the Children 's Bureau ( created in 1912 ) , exclusive of its Industrial Division , from the Department of Labor to FSA , where it became part of the Social Security Administration ( SSA ) ; the US Employees Compensation Commission , formerly an independent organization , to the Office of the Administrator of FSA ; functions of the Department of Commerce regarding vital statistics to the FSA Administrator , who delegated them to the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service . </Li> <Li> Legislation of major importance to the Agency also was passed in 1946 : the National Mental Health Act ; the Vocational Education Act ; the Federal Employees Health Act ; the 1946 Amendments to the Social Security Act ; and the Hospital Survey and Construction Act . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 1947 . In 1947 , the Administrator directed the establishment of a central library , consolidating the resources of three independent libraries at the SSA , the Office of Education , and the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation . This library eventually became the central library of the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare . </Li> <Li> 1948 <Ul> <Li> By 1948 , the retail price of food had risen 114 percent over the 1935 - 39 base , yet the monthly benefits under Social Security had not changed since the 1939 amendments had established a base level . On October 1 , 1948 , increases in Social Security benefits were authorized . </Li> <Li> Other key pieces of legislation passed in 1948 included bills creating the National Heart Institute and the National Institute of Dental Research . On June 16 , 1948 , the name of the National Institute of Health was changed to the National Institutes of Health . </Li> <Li> On June 30 , 1948 , the President signed the Water Pollution Bill , delegating national water pollution responsibilities to the Public Health Service . </Li> <Li> Also in 1948 , legislation authorized the transfer of the Federal Credit Union program from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the SSA . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 1949 <Ul> <Li> The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 gave the Federal Security Administrator authority to dispose of surplus federal propel property to tax - supported or nonprofit educational institutions for health or educational purposes . </Li> <Li> During 1949 , the Federal Security Agency began the establishment of 10 FSA regional offices to replace the 11 previously operated by the SSA and consolidated those being operated by other FSA constituents into one common regional office structure . Previous to the consolidation , constituent agencies were maintaining five and , in some cases , six independent regional offices in a single city . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 1950 <Ul> <Li> On May 24 , 1950 , Reorganization Plan No. 19 of 1950 transferred from FSA to the Department of Labor the Bureau of Employees Compensation and the Employees Compensation Appeals Board . Then , the FSA abolished the Office of Special Services that had administered the two transferred units plus the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation ( OVR ) and the Food and Drug Administration . The effect of this action was to elevate OVR and FDA to agency status . </Li> <Li> In 1950 , two important national conferences required months of staff work by FSA personnel . The Mid-century White House Conference on Children and Youth was held in Washington , D.C. in December 1950 . Nearly 6,000 representatives of 100,000 local and community groups throughout the country met to discuss the `` spiritual values , democractic practice , and the dignity and worth of the individual . '' In August of that year , a Conference on Aging was called by the FSA Administrator to study the needs and problems of the older segment of the population . </Li> <Li> In September 1950 , Congress authorized the impacted aid program - to relieve the impact on local school facilities of a heavy influx of federal civilian and military personnel - and in FY 1951 appropriated $96.5 million for school construction under P.L. 81 - 815 , September 23 , 1950 , and $23 million for school operating expenses under P.L. 81 - 874 , September 30 , 1950 . </Li> <Li> The Social Security Act Amendments of 1950 added to the social security rolls about 10 million persons who previously had been ineligible . These persons included agricultural workers and selfemployed small shop owners . Others who benefitted from the changes were the elderly and those who had job - related disabilities . This expansion of beneficiaries was made possible by revisions to the oldage and survivors insurance and long - term disability insurance sections of the original Act . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 1951 . In May 1951 , a citizens committee , the National Mid-century Committee for Children and Youth , was established to provide national follow - up to the problems discussed at the White House Conference . Staff of the Children 's Bureau worked closely with the Committee until it was dissolved in 1953 . </Li> <Li> 1952 . The year 1952 was a period of transition for FSA . Despite the contributions made by the Agency during and before the Korean War , most of the defense - related activities in FSA were being phased out . The FDA continued to study chemical and bacteriological warfare agents but other FSA components were mobilized to provide disaster relief and health care assistance to a number of foreign countries . Technical assistance , under the federal `` Point IV '' and Mutual Security Agency programs , provided needed help to many underdeveloped countries . The Agency also furnished guidance for foreign representatives sent to this country to study American programs and methods in the fields of health and education . Later in the year , FSA accelerated its response to the Nation 's social needs . </Li> <Li> 1953 . FSA Becomes DHEW <Ul> <Li> By 1953 , the Federal Security Agency 's programs in health , education , and social security had grown to such importance that its annual budget exceeded the combined budgets of the Departments of Commerce , Justice , Labor and Interior and affected the lives of millions of people . </Li> <Li> Consequently , in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949 , President Eisenhower submitted to the Congress on March 12 , 1953 , Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953 , which called for the dissolution of the Federal Security Agency and elevation of the agency to Cabinet status as the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare . All of the responsibilities of the Federal Security Administrator would be transferred to the Secretary of Health , Education , end Welfare and the components of FSA would be transferred to the Department . A major objective of the reorganization was to improve administration of the functions of the Federal Security Agency . The plan was approved April 1 , 1953 , and became effective on April 11 , 1953 . </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <P> Unlike statutes authorizing the creation of other executive departments , the contents of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953 were never properly codified within the United States Code , although Congress did codify a later statute ratifying the Plan . Today , the Plan is included as an appendix to Title 5 of the United States Code . The result is that HHS is the only executive department whose statutory foundation today rests on a confusing combination of several codified and uncodified statutes . </P> List of Federal Security Agency Administrators ( edit ) <Table> <Tr> <Th> Name </Th> <Th> Dates of service </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Paul V.

HEW thus became the first new Cabinet - level department since the Department of Labor was created in 1913 . The Reorganization Plan abolished the FSA and transferred all of its functions to the Secretary of HEW and all components of the Agency to the Department . The first Secretary of HEW was Oveta Culp Hobby , a native of Texas , who had served as Commander of the Women 's Army Corps in World War II and was editor and publisher of the Houston Post .

This phrase was first used on paper money in 1957 , when it appeared on the one - dollar silver certificate . The first paper currency bearing the phrase entered circulation on October 1 , 1957 .

Chase , Treasury Secretary , scribes `` In God is our Trust , '' scratches out `` is our '' and overwrites `` We '' to arrive at `` In God We Trust '' in a December 9 , 1863 , letter to James Pollock , Director of the Philadelphia Mint . `` IN GOD WE TRUST '' first appeared on the obverse side of the Two - cent piece in 1864 <P> In 1860 , the phrase was used in the Coat of arms of New Westminster , Canada . The phrase has been incorporated in many hymns and religio - patriotic songs . During the American Civil War , the 125th Pennsylvania Infantry for the Union Army assumed the motto `` In God we trust '' in early August 1862 . William W. Wallace , coiner , circa August 1862 , of the motto `` In God We Trust '' was Captain of Company C of the 125th Pennsylvania Infantry . </P> <P> The Reverend Mark R. Watkinson of ' Ridleyville ' , Pennsylvania , ( pastor of Prospect Hill Baptist Church in present - day Prospect Park , Pennsylvania ) in a letter dated November 13 , 1861 , petitioned the Treasury Department to add a statement recognizing `` Almighty God in some form on our coins '' in order to `` relieve us from the ignominy of heathenism '' . At least part of the motivation was to declare that God was on the Union side of the Civil War . Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase acted on this proposal and directed the then - Philadelphia Director of the Mint , James Pollock , to begin drawing up possible designs that would include the religious phrase . Chase chose his favorite designs and presented a proposal to Congress for the new designs in late 1863 . </P> <P> In December 1863 , Abraham Lincoln 's Secretary of the Treasury decided on a new motto , `` In God We Trust , '' to engrave on U.S. coins . Lincoln 's involvement in this decision is unclear . </P> <P> A version of the motto made an early appearance on obverse side of the twenty dollar interest bearing note issued in 1864 along with the motto `` God and our Right '' . </P> <P> As Chase was preparing his recommendation to Congress , it was found that the Act of Congress dated January 18 , 1837 prescribed the mottoes and devices that should be placed upon the coins of the United States . This meant that the mint could make no changes without the enactment of additional legislation by the Congress . Such legislation was introduced and passed as the Coinage Act of 1864 on April 22 , 1864 , allowing the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize the inclusion of the phrase on one - cent and two - cent coins . </P> <P> An Act of Congress passed on March 3 , 1865 , allowed the Mint Director , with the Secretary 's approval , to place the motto on all gold and silver coins that `` shall admit the inscription thereon '' . In 1873 , Congress passed the Coinage Act , granting that the Secretary of the Treasury `` may cause the motto IN GOD WE TRUST to be inscribed on such coins as shall admit of such motto '' . </P> <P> The similar phrase ' In God is our Trust ' appears in `` The Star - Spangled Banner '' , adopted as the national anthem of the United States in 1931 . Written by Francis Scott Key during the War of 1812 , the fourth stanza includes the phrase , `` And this be our motto : ' In God is our Trust ' '' , which was adapted as the national motto . </P> <P> The use of `` In God We Trust '' has been interrupted . The motto disappeared from the five - cent coin in 1883 , and did not reappear until production of the Jefferson nickel began in 1938 . However , at least two other coins minted in every year in the interim still bore the motto , including the Morgan dollar and the Seated Liberty half dollar . The omission of the motto `` In God We Trust '' on the Indian Head eagle coin caused public outrage , and prompted Congress to pass a bill mandating its inclusion . Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber added the words and made minor modifications to the design . In 1908 , Congress made it mandatory that the phrase be printed on all coins upon which it had previously appeared . This decision was motivated after a public outcry following the release of a $20 coin which did not bear the motto . The motto has been in continuous use on the one - cent coin since 1909 , and on the ten - cent coin since 1916 . It also has appeared on all gold coins and silver dollar coins , half - dollar coins , and quarter - dollar coins struck since July 1 , 1908 . Since 1938 , all US coins have borne the motto . </P> A quarter dollar with the United States ' official motto `` IN GOD WE TRUST '' on the obverse side <P> During the Cold War era , the government of the United States sought to distinguish itself from the Soviet Union , which promoted state atheism and thus implemented antireligious legislation . The 84th Congress passed a joint resolution `` declaring IN GOD WE TRUST the national motto of the United States '' . The resolution passed both the House and the Senate unanimously and without debate . The law was signed by President Eisenhower on July 30 , 1956 . The United States Code at 36 U.S.C. \u00a7 302 , now states : `` ' In God we trust ' is the national motto . '' </P> <P> The same day , the President signed into law a requirement that `` In God We Trust '' be printed on all U.S. currency and coins . On paper currency , it first appeared on the silver certificate in 1957 , followed by other certificates . Federal Reserve Notes and United States Notes were circulated with the motto starting from 1964 to 1966 , depending on the denomination . ( Of these , only Federal Reserve Notes are still circulated . ) </P> <P> Representative Charles Edward Bennett of Florida cited the Cold War when he introduced the bill in the House , saying `` In these days when imperialistic and materialistic communism seeks to attack and destroy freedom , we should continually look for ways to strengthen the foundations of our freedom '' . </P> <P> Aronow v. United States was the first case to challenge the inclusion of `` In God We Trust '' on U.S. currency . The law it challenged was `` 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 324a `` the inscription ' In God we Trust ' ... shall appear on all United States currency and coins '' . O'Hair v. Blumenthal ( 1978 ) challenged the inclusion of the phrase `` In God We Trust '' on U.S. currency . A similar decision was reached by the Fifth Circuit in Madalyn Murray O'Hair vs W. Michael Blumenthal in 1979 , which affirmed that the `` primary purpose of the slogan was secular . '' </P> <P> In March 2001 , Ronnie Musgrove Governor of Mississippi signed legislation requiring the motto `` In God We Trust '' to be displayed in every public school classroom , as well as the school auditoriums and cafeterias , throughout the state . </P> A framed poster displaying the national motto of the United States in a New Philadelphia High School classroom <P> After the September 11 attacks in 2001 , many public schools across the United States posted `` In God We Trust '' framed posters in their `` libraries , cafeterias and classrooms '' . The American Family Association supplied several 11 - by - 14 - inch posters to school systems and vowed to defend any legal challenges to the displaying of the posters . </P> <P> According to a 2003 joint poll by USA Today , CNN , and Gallup , 90 % of Americans support the inscription `` In God We Trust '' on U.S. coins . </P> <P> In 2006 , on the 50th anniversary of its adoption , the Senate reaffirmed `` In God We Trust '' as the official national motto of the United States of America . In Florida House Bill no . 1145 , Florida adopted ' In God We Trust ' as the official state motto , effective July 1 , 2006 . </P> <P> In 2011 the House of Representatives passed an additional resolution reaffirming `` In God We Trust '' as the official motto of the United States , in a 396 -- 9 vote . </P> <P> In 2013 , a federal court rejected a challenge , brought by Michael Newdow and the Freedom From Religion Foundation , to remove `` In God We Trust '' from American currency . </P> `` IN GOD WE TRUST '' on the Seal of Mississippi <P> On January 31 , 2014 , purporting to defend religious freedom , the Mississippi senate voted to add the words , `` In God We Trust '' to the state seal and the change was made effective on July 1 , 2014 . </P> <P> In 2015 the county police department of Jefferson County , Illinois announced that the words `` In God We Trust '' will be on police squad cars . In 2015 , the Freedom from Religion Foundation demanded that local authorities remove decals of the motto from Childress , Texas Police Department patrol vehicles . In response , Police Chief Adrian Garcia told the organization , in a written letter , to `` go fly a kite . '' </P> <P> In early 2018 , Kimberly Daniels , a pastor who currently serves as the representative for Florida House of Representatives District 14 as a member of the Democratic Party , introduced HB 839 , a bill that requires public schools to display the motto `` In God We Trust '' in a conspicuous place . On Tuesday , January 23 , 2018 , the bill received unanimous approval from the House PreK - 12 Innovation Subcommittee . Later , in a vote on February 21 , 2018 , the bill passed 97 to 10 in the House . As part of Florida 's March 2018 K - 12 education law , Gov. Rick Scott mandated that all public schools post the state motto ( `` In God We Trust '' ) in a prominent location . </P> <P> In March 2018 , Act 911 , sponsored by State Rep. Jim Dotson , made it a requirement of Arkansas state law for schools to display posters with the national motto ( `` In God We Trust '' ) . </P> <P> In March 2018 , a bill requiring Tennessee schools to prominently display the national motto ( `` In God We Trust '' ) sponsored by Rep. Susan Lynn passed the state House with 81 of the 99 members voting in favor of it . </P> <H2> Society and culture ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Religion ( edit ) </H3> <P> In Judaism and Christianity , the official motto `` In God We Trust '' resounds with several verses from the Bible , including Psalm 118 : 8 , Psalm 40 : 3 , Psalm 73 : 28 , and Proverbs 29 : 25 . In Islam the word for the concept of reliance on God is called Tawakkul ; the phrase `` In God We Trust '' is found in two places of the Koran , in Surah 10 Yunus , as well as Surah 7 Al - A'raf , although several other verses reinforce this concept . Melkote Ramaswamy , a Hindu American scholar , writes that the presence of the phrase `` In God We Trust '' on American currency is a reminder that `` there is God everywhere , whether we are conscious or not . '' </P> <H3> Pop culture ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> In Miracle on 34th Street ( 1994 film ) , just as Henry is about to make his decision , Susan walks up to him with a Christmas card containing a $1 bill .

Seven years earlier , Cunanan meets Versace at a gay nightclub in San Francisco and tells his roommates about the encounter the following morning , albeit with most of the details fabricated . Cunanan later attends a performance of Capriccio as Versace 's guest and exchanges origin stories with him after the performance . In the present , Cunanan flees the scene , evading Versace 's partner Antonio D'Amico . Versace , meanwhile , is rushed to the hospital and pronounced dead .

He juggles working as a prostitute , giving his earnings to his homosexual neighbor Ronnie , and feeding his obsession with Versace . Versace , meanwhile , juggles dealing with creative block and reeling from Antonio 's proposal of a wedding .

Cunanan proceeds to brutally torture and kill Miglin before stealing his Lexus . In the present , detectives assigned to the case discover gay pornographic magazines surrounding Miglin 's dead body . Marilyn insists that the killer owns the magazines and that her husband 's murder was nothing more than a random killing . The authorities later use the car 's phone in an attempt to track Cunanan , who learns about their plan after it is leaked to the media . He then abandons Miglin 's Lexus in Pennsville , New Jersey before gunning down caretaker William Reese and stealing his red pick - up truck .

The Minneapolis Police Department , meanwhile , discovers Trail 's corpse and suspect Madson to be the killer .

Following an unsuccessful suicide attempt , Trail goes to a gay bar and meets Cunanan .

The answer should be a number\n\nQuestion:\nwhen did michael jackson make the song hold my hand\n\nDocument:\n have been Michael Jackson 's next album . While there Jackson heard the song and loved it , and decided he wanted to contribute to it . When Kelly was asked what he thought it was about the song that struck a chord with both Akon and Jackson , he said that it was the song 's theme of friendship and togetherness . `` Hold My Hand '' was recorded by Jackson and Akon in 2008 . Akon finished the rest of his vocals for the song in 2010 , a few days before the release . A handwritten note from Jackson belonging to his Estate indicated his desire that `` Hold My Hand '' be the first single on his next project . However , in its unfinished state , the song leaked out in 2008 . This would be the last new song leaked during Jackson 's lifetime . Due to the leak , the song was subsequently pulled from Akon 's track listing for his 2008 album , Freedom . </P> <P> Akon commented , `` The world was not ready to hear ' Hold My Hand ' when it leaked a couple years ago . We were devastated about it . But its time has definitely come ; now in its final state , it has become an incredible , beautiful , anthemic song . I 'm so proud to have had the chance to work with Michael , one of my all time idols . '' Before the official release of the song , Akon stated on Twitter that the final version would have more of Jackson 's vocals . The song was released globally on Monday , November 15 , 2010 , at 12 : 01am EST . It was available to stream from Jackson 's official website . Jackson 's nephew , Taj Jackson , posted a message saying that his uncle was proud of the song . `` I 'll never forget that smile he had on his face as the song played through the speakers ( in his room ) at the Palms Hotel in Vegas . '' The song is the second collaboration between the two artists and the second consecutive duet single release for Jackson , following `` Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' 2008 '' . That song proved a commercial success and charted within the top 20 in several countries . </P> <H2> Music video ( edit ) </H2> <P> On Monday , November 22 , 2010 , the filming for the official video began in Tustin , California , a main filming location being the airship hangars at Marine Corps Air Station Tustin . There was a casting call posted up on Jackson 's official website , saying that they were `` looking for his fans of all ages who want to be a part of this iconic event . '' On December 4 , 2010 , a 30 - second teaser of the video was released on Michael Jackson 's official YouTube channel and the official website . It featured clips from Jackson 's Live in Bucharest : The Dangerous Tour DVD and clips of fans dancing . The video debuted at midnight December 9 , 2010 on worldwide websites , including MichaelJackson.com . The video showed Jackson in concert ( from Dangerous World Tour in Bucharest and HIStory World Tour in Munich ) , Akon singing and children dancing in the dress of Jackson , as well as sentimental scenes of children , families , and elderly people holding hands and a woman weeping . The video was directed by Mark Pellington . </P> <H2> Critical reception ( edit ) </H2> <P> The song received mostly positive reviews in contrast to the negative reviews of the previous promotional single `` Breaking News . '' Ashante Infantry , entertainment reporter for the Toronto Star , called it a `` catchy , well - meaning addition to Jackson 's catalog . '' She also wrote , `` Buoyed by strings and a backing chorus , the singer applies his angelic tenor to soaring phrasing that models the uplifting purport of the tune 's love and unity lyrics in the spirit of 1995 's `` You Are Not Alone '' , Jackson 's last No. 1 hit . '' Huffington Post commentator Joe Vogel praised it as `` a simple , but powerful song that embodies so much of what fans loved about Michael Jackson ... making the personal something more profound and universal '' , and Vogel stated as well that `` With its catchy chorus and majestic crescendo it has all the makings of a big hit . '' Vogel also noted the first line of the song , `` This life do n't last forever , '' was a `` poignant reminder of the transience of life . '' MTV 's Gil Kaufman stated that `` the uplifting ' Hold My Hand ' is one of Jackson 's classic love ballads , a heart - stirring call to unity , '' and that it ended with `` a majestic feel . '' Newsday music critic Glenn Gamboa said that the tune `` finds Jackson in fine voice . '' He also remarked , `` Now this is more like it . '' Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times music blog wrote that the `` mid-tempo uplifting track is classic M.J. '' </P> <P> Negative reviews however came from Yahoo ! Music , where commentator Chris Willman argued that the single stole elements from the Hootie & the Blowfish song of the same name , and Minneapolis City Pages where commentator Ray Cummings said `` there 's no way to reasonably avoid being disappointed and dispirited by its thinness . '' Boston Herald critic Jed Gottlieb described the song as `` an average , Auto - Tuned Akon croon '' without `` the snap , crackle and pop of a finished King of Pop product . '' Gottlieb also wrote , `` Jackson is grumbling from his grave . '' Jason Lipshutz from Billboard said , it `` is n't a classic Jackson single , '' but Michael Jackson 's `` diehards should delight in hearing a stylish pop production that does n't dwell on the singer 's troubled life . '' </P> <H2> Commercial performance ( edit ) </H2> <P> The song debuted at number 53 on the Hot R&B / Hip - Hop Songs chart the week of November 27 , 2010 . It also became Michael Jackson 's 48th hit on Billboard Hot 100 , and debuted at number 84 . It debuted on the Adult R&B chart at number 16 as the chart 's highest start in 2010 the same week . The song is Jackson 's first top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100 since 2002 's `` Butterflies '' . The song debuted at number 24 on the Billboard Jazz Songs Chart on the week of January 15 , 2011 , as Jackson 's first single on this chart , it peaked at number 16 .

{"content": "Answer the question based on the information provided in the document given below. The answer should be a number\n\nDocument:\ntadium , where the Browns played until 1995 . <P> The Cleveland Browns relocation controversy , sometimes referred to by fans as `` The Move '' , was the decision by then - Browns owner Art Modell to relocate the National Football League ( NFL ) 's Cleveland Browns from its long - time home of Cleveland to Baltimore during the 1995 NFL season . Subsequent legal actions by the city of Cleveland and Browns season ticket holders led the NFL to broker a compromise that saw the Browns history , records , and intellectual property remain in Cleveland . In return , Modell was permitted to move his football organization to Baltimore where he established the Baltimore Ravens . The Ravens are officially regarded by the NFL as an expansion team that began play in 1996 . The city of Cleveland agreed to demolish Cleveland Stadium and build a new stadium on the same site , and the NFL agreed to reactivate the Browns by the 1999 season through either an expansion draft or a relocated franchise . The Browns were officially reactivated in 1998 through the expansion process and resumed play in 1999 . </P> <P> The compromise between Cleveland , the NFL , and Modell was a first in North American professional sports . The compromise has been cited in franchise moves and agreements in other leagues , including those in Major League Baseball , Major League Soccer , the National Basketball Association , and the National Hockey League . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Dissatisfaction with Cleveland Stadium </Li> <Li> 2 Announcing the move </Li> <Li> 3 Initial reaction </Li> <Li> 4 Settlement </Li> <Li> 5 Aftermath and Legacy </Li> <Li> 6 Effect on teams in other sports leagues <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Major League Baseball </Li> <Li> 6.2 Major League Soccer </Li> <Li> 6.3 National Hockey League </Li> <Li> 6.4 National Basketball Association </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 Further reading </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Dissatisfaction with Cleveland Stadium ( edit ) </H2> Art Modell . <P> In 1975 , knowing that Municipal Stadium was costing the city over $300,000 annually to operate , then - Browns owner Art Modell signed a 25 - year lease whereby he agreed to incur these expenses in exchange for quasi ownership of the stadium . Under the terms of the lease he agreed to give back the City a portion of the profits he would realize each year , and also agreed to make capital improvements to the stadium at his expense . Modell 's newly formed company , Stadium Corporation , paid an annual rent of $150,000 for the first five years and $200,000 afterwards to the city . </P> <P> Modell had originally promised never to move the Browns . He had publicly criticized the Baltimore Colts ' move to Indianapolis , and had testified in favor of the NFL in court cases where the league unsuccessfully tried to stop Al Davis from moving the Oakland Raiders to Los Angeles . </P> <P> However , Modell refused to share the suite revenue with the Cleveland Indians , who also played at Cleveland Stadium , even though much of the revenues were generated during baseball games as well as football games . </P> <P> In 1990 , the Indians prevailed upon the local governments and voters and convinced them to build them their own facility where they controlled the suite revenue . Modell , mistakenly believing that his revenues were not endangered , agreed to participate in the Gateway Project that built Jacobs Field ( now Progressive Field ) for the Indians and Gund Arena ( now Quicken Loans Arena ) for the Cleveland Cavaliers . Modell 's assumptions proved incorrect , and Stadium Corp 's suite revenues declined sharply when the Indians moved from the stadium to Jacobs Field in 1994 . Soaring player salaries and deficits put additional financial pressure on the Browns ' owner . Modell claimed to have lost $21 million between 1993 and 1994 . </P> <H2> Announcing the move ( edit ) </H2> <P> After Modell realized how much revenue he lost from the Indians moving out of Cleveland Stadium , he requested an issue be placed on the ballot to provide $175 million in tax dollars to refurbish the outmoded and declining Cleveland Stadium . </P> <P> On the field , the Browns , coached by Bill Belichick , were coming off a playoff season in which the team finished 11 -- 5 and advanced to the second round of the playoffs entering the 1995 season . Sports Illustrated even predicted the Browns would represent the AFC in Super Bowl XXX at the end of the season . However , the team disappointed many fans by losing three straight games after starting the season 3 -- 1 . </P> <P> On November 6 , 1995 , with the team sitting at 4 -- 5 , Modell announced in a press conference at Camden Yards that he had signed a deal to relocate the Browns to Baltimore in 1996 -- a move which would return the NFL to that city since the Colts relocated to Indianapolis after the 1983 season . The reason Modell chose to relocate to Baltimore was because he felt the city of Cleveland did not have the funding nor political will to build a first - class stadium . The very next day , on November 7 , Cleveland voters overwhelmingly approved the aforementioned tax issue to remodel Cleveland Stadium . </P> <H2> Initial reaction ( edit ) </H2> <P> The City of Cleveland sued Modell , the Browns , Stadium Corp , the Maryland Stadium Authority , and the authority 's director , John A. Moag Jr. , in City of Cleveland v. Cleveland Browns , et al. , Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas Case No . CV - 95 - 297833 , for breaching the Browns ' lease , which required the team to play its home games at Cleveland Stadium for several years beyond 1995 , filing an injunction to keep the Browns in the city until at least 1998 . Several other lawsuits were filed by fans and ticket holders . The United States Congress even held hearings on the matter . </P> <P> Actor / comedian Drew Carey returned to his hometown of Cleveland on November 26 , 1995 , to host `` Fan Jam '' in protest of the proposed move . A protest was held in Pittsburgh during the Browns ' game there against the Pittsburgh Steelers , but ABC , the network broadcasting the game ( and also the home of Carey 's new sitcom that had just premiered ) , declined to cover or mention the protest . That game was one of the few instances that Steelers fans and Browns fans were supportive of each other , as fans in Pittsburgh felt that Modell was robbing their team of their long - standing rivalry with the Browns . Browns fans reacted with anger to the news , wearing hats and T - shirts that read `` Muck Fodell '' . </P> <P> On the field , the Browns stumbled to finish 5 -- 11 after the announcement , ahead of only the expansion Jacksonville Jaguars , to whom they lost twice , in the AFC Central , becoming the first team in the NFL 's modern era to lose twice to a first - year expansion team . Virtually all of the team 's sponsors pulled their support , leaving Cleveland Stadium devoid of advertising during the team 's final weeks . The final game the team played at Cleveland Municipal Stadium was a 26 -- 10 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals , the first and only win since the announcement of the relocation . The game itself was blacked out on television locally , but NBC did broadcast extensive pregame coverage from Cleveland . </P> <H2> Settlement ( edit ) </H2> <P> After extensive talks between the NFL , the Browns , and officials of the two cities , Cleveland accepted a legal settlement that would keep the Browns ' legacy in Cleveland . On February 9 , 1996 , the NFL announced that the Browns would be ' deactivated ' for three years , and that a new stadium would be built for a new Browns team , as either an expansion team or a team moved from another city , that would begin play in 1999 . Modell would in turn then be granted a new franchise ( the 31st NFL franchise ) , for Baltimore , retaining the current contracts of players and personnel . There would be a reactivated team for Cleveland , where the Browns ' name , colors , history , records , awards , and archives would remain in Cleveland . The only other current NFL team to suspend operations without merging with another was Cleveland 's previous NFL team , the Rams , during the 1943 season at the height of World War II . </P> <P> An additional stipulation was that in any future realignment plan , the Browns would automatically be placed in a division with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cincinnati Bengals , because of longstanding rivalries with those two teams . Upon their reactivation in 1999 , the Browns were placed back in the AFC Central with the Steelers and Bengals , as well as the Ravens , Titans , and Jaguars . This arrangement had the effect of creating -- for the first time in NFL history -- an alignment with teams from Baltimore , Cleveland and Pittsburgh all playing in the same division . When the NFL realigned into divisions of four teams for the 2002 season , Cleveland , Pittsburgh , Cincinnati and Baltimore remained together , but in the newly created AFC North . </P> <H2> Aftermath and legacy ( edit ) </H2> <P> The return of the NFL to Baltimore compelled the departure of the professional football team already in Baltimore at the time , the Grey Cup champion Baltimore Stallions of the Canadian Football League ( CFL ) . Although they had generated respectable fan support during their two seasons in Baltimore , Stallions owner Jim Speros knew his team could not compete with an NFL team and opted to establish a new franchise in Montreal . They subsequently adopted the name of the team that previously played in the city , the Alouettes . </P> <P> Focus groups , a telephone survey , and a fan contest were all held to help select a new name for Modell 's team . Starting with a list of over 100 possible names , the team 's management reduced it to 17 . From there , focus groups of a total of 200 Baltimore area residents reduced the list of names to six , and then a phone survey of 1000 people trimmed it down to three , Marauders , Americans , and Ravens . Finally , a fan contest drawing 33,288 voters picked `` Ravens '' , a name that alludes to the famous poem , `` The Raven '' , by Edgar Allan Poe , who spent the latter part of his life in Baltimore , and is also buried there . The team also adopted purple and black as their team colors , a stark contrast to the brown and orange colors of the Browns . Ex-Baltimore Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas disowned the Colts after their move to Indianapolis . The former Colts Marching Band , which remained in Baltimore after the Colts moved , was subsequently renamed the Baltimore 's Marching Ravens . Along with the San Francisco 49ers , Buffalo Bills , and Washington Redskins , the Ravens are one of only four NFL teams with an official marching band . </P> <P> Modell 's move to Baltimore came at the height of NFL teams relocating . The move also fueled a proliferation of 12 new stadiums throughout the NFL . Several NFL franchises used the threat of relocation to coerce their respective cities to build new stadiums with public funds . Such franchises include the Seahawks , Buccaneers , Bengals , Lions , Cardinals , and Bears . In the three - year period from 1995 -- 1997 , four NFL teams moved . In addition to Modell 's move , Los Angeles lost both of its teams for the 1995 season , as the Raiders moved back to Oakland and the Rams moved east to St. Louis .

First passed in 1876 and still in force with amendments , it is the primary document which defines how the Government of Canada interacts with the 614 First Nation bands in Canada and their members . Throughout its long history the Act has been an ongoing subject of controversy and has been interpreted in different ways by both Aboriginal Canadians and non-Aboriginal Canadians . The legislation has been amended many times , including `` over twenty major changes '' made by 2002 . </P> <P> The Act is very wide - ranging in scope , covering governance , land use , healthcare , education , and more on Indian reserves . Notably , the original Indian Act does two things affecting all indigenous peoples in Canada : </P> <Ul> <Li> It says how reserves and bands can operate . The Act sets out rules for governing Indian reserves , defines how bands can be created and spells out the powers of `` band councils '' . Bands do not have to have reserve lands to operate under the act . </Li> <Li> It defines who is , and who is not recognized as an `` Indian '' . The Act defines a number of types of Indian people who are not recognized as `` registered '' or `` status '' Indians and who are therefore denied membership in bands . </Li> </Ul> <P> The Act 's existence is necessitated by the fact that First Nations ( historically called `` Indians '' ) relate differently to the state because of inherited legal arrangements such as the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and various treaties , and because Canada 's constitution specifically assigns Native issues to the federal , rather than provincial governments , by the terms of Section 91 ( 24 ) of the Constitution Act , 1867 . The Indian Act replaces any laws on the topic passed by a local legislature before a province joined Canadian Confederation , creating a definitive national policy on the subject . The Act is not a treaty ; it is Canada 's legal response to the treaties . Nevertheless , its unilateral nature , imposed on indigenous peoples by the Canadian government in contrast to the treaties , is itself a source of discontent among Native peoples in Canada . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Original rationale and purpose </Li> <Li> 2 Definitions <Ul> <Li> 2.1 `` Reserve '' </Li> <Li> 2.2 `` Band '' </Li> <Li> 2.3 `` Indian '' <Ul> <Li> 2.3. 1 Loss of status prior to 1985 amendments <Ul> <Li> 2.3. 1.1 Discriminatory definition issues </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Policies enacted via the Indian Act <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Gender discrimination </Li> <Li> 3.2 Residential schools </Li> <Li> 3.3 Bans on religious ceremonies ( `` Potlatch Law '' ) </Li> <Li> 3.4 Restriction on access to the courts </Li> <Li> 3.5 Tax exemption </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Relation to the Constitution <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Section 88 </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 History of proposed and actual changes <Ul> <Li> 5.1 List of precursors and amendments <Ul> <Li> 5.1. 1 Pre-Confederation </Li> <Li> 5.1. 2 Post-Confederation </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5.2 Attempts to repeal or replace <Ul> <Li> 5.2. 1 Failed major changes </Li> <Li> 5.2. 2 Opt - outs </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Case law </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 Further reading </Li> <Li> 9 References <Ul> <Li> 9.1 Citations </Li> <Li> 9.2 Bibliography </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Original rationale and purpose ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Indian enfranchisement in Canada `` The great aim of our legislation has been to do away with the tribal system and assimilate the Indian people in all respects with the other inhabitants of the Dominion as speedily as they are fit to change . '' <P> John A Macdonald , 1887 </P> <P> The Indian Act was first passed in 1876 as a consolidation of various laws concerning indigenous peoples enacted by the separate colonies of British North America prior to Canadian Confederation , most notably the Gradual Civilization Act passed by the Parliament of the Province of Canada in 1857 and the Gradual Enfranchisement Act of 1869 . The Indian Act was passed by the Parliament of Canada under the provisions of Section 91 ( 24 ) of the Constitution Act , 1867 , which provides Canada 's federal government exclusive authority to govern in relation to `` Indians and Lands Reserved for Indians '' . It was an attempt to codify rights promised to Native peoples by British King George III in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 , while at the same time enforcing Euro - Canadian standards of `` civilization '' . The purpose of the act , as stated by its drafters , was to administer Indian affairs in such a way that Indian people would feel compelled to renounce their Indian status and join Canadian civilization as full members : a process called enfranchisement . </P> <P> The idea of enfranchisement predated the 1876 version of Indian Act and survived in some form until 1985 . Upon the introduction in 1857 by the Tach\u00e9 - Macdonald administration of the Gradual Civilization Act and until 1961 , the enfranchisement process was compulsory for men of age 21 able to read and write English . </P> <P> Reserves , under this legislation , were islands within Canada to which were attached a different set of rights . `` Enfranchisement '' derives from the idea of `` franchise '' , which has gradually been degraded as `` vote '' . Indigenous people with the franchise were allowed to vote for representatives , were expected to pay taxes and lived `` off - reserve '' . By contrast , groups of people who lived on a reserve were subject to a different set of rights and obligations . One needed to descend from an Indian to be allowed to live on a reserve . </P> <P> The tenure of land in a reserve was limited to the collective , or tribe , by virtue of a Crown protectorate . Interactions between enfranchised citizens and Indians were subject to strict controls ; for example , the enfranchised were forbidden by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 to traffic in alcohol or land with Indians . It was hoped through means of fiduciary duty voluntarily taken up by the Crown to preserve the Indian identity , but this was later vitiated by the compulsory enfranchisement scheme of the Gradual Civilization Act . The 1985 amendment to the Indian Act extinguished the idea of enfranchisement . </P> <H2> Definitions ( edit ) </H2> <H3> `` Reserve '' ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Indian reserve <P> Under the section entitled `` Reserves '' in the Indian Act , it is stated that reserves are `` to be held for use and benefit of Indians . </P> <P> 18 . ( 1 ) `` Subject to this Act , reserves are held by Her Majesty for the use and benefit of the respective bands for which they were set apart , and subject to this Act and to the terms of any treaty or surrender , the Governor in Council may determine whether any purpose for which lands in a reserve are used or are to be used is for the use and benefit of the band . Marginal note : Use of reserves for schools , etc . '' </P> -- R.S. , c . I - 6 , s . 18 . Indian Act <P> 18 . ( 2 ) `` The Minister may authorize the use of lands in a reserve for the purpose of Indian schools , the administration of Indian affairs , Indian burial grounds , Indian health projects or , with the consent of the council of the band , for any other purpose for the general welfare of the band , and may take any lands in a reserve required for those purposes , but where an individual Indian , immediately prior to the taking , was entitled to the possession of those lands , compensation for that use shall be paid to the Indian , in such amount as may be agreed between the Indian and the Minister , or , failing agreement , as may be determined in such manner as the Minister may direct . '' </P> -- DIANA , R.S. , c . I - 6 , s . 18 . Indian Act <H3> `` Band '' ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Band government <P> In the Indian Act , updated to April 2013 , the term `` band '' , </P> <P> `` means a body of Indians ( a ) for whose use and benefit in common , lands , the legal title to which is vested in Her Majesty , have been set apart before , on or after September 4 , 1951 , ( b ) for whose use and benefit in common , moneys are held by Her Majesty , or ( c ) declared by the Governor in Council to be a band for the purposes of this Act . '' </P> -- Indian Act <H3> `` Indian '' ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Indian Register <P> Fundamental to Canada 's ability to interact with First Nations peoples is the question of defining who they are ( e.g. who are the `` Indians '' of the Indian Act ? ) , and this aspect of the legislation has been an ongoing source of controversy throughout its history . Not all people who self - identify as `` Aboriginal '' are considered `` Indians '' under the terms of the act . Only those on the official Indian Register maintained by the federal government ( or a local `` band list '' in some cases ) are Status Indians , subject to the full legal benefits and restrictions of the Indian Act . Notably this excludes M\u00e9tis people , Inuit people , and so - called Non-Status Indians . Various amendments and court decisions have repeatedly altered the rules regarding who is eligible for Indian Status . Many bands now maintain their own band lists . </P> Loss of status prior to 1985 amendments ( edit ) <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section may contain too much repetition or redundant language . Please help improve it by merging similar text or removing repeated statements . ( August 2014 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Though people accepted into band membership under band rules may not be status Indians , Bill C - 31 clarified that various sections of the Indian Act would apply to such members . The sections in question are those relating to community life ( e.g. , land holdings ) . Sections relating to Indians ( Aboriginal people ) as individuals ( in this case , wills and taxation of personal property ) were not included . Prior to 1985 , Indians could lose status in a variety of ways including the following : </P> <Ul> <Li> marrying a man who was not a status Indian </Li> <Li> enfranchisement ( until 1960 , an Indian could vote in federal elections only by renouncing Indian status ) </Li> <Li> having at the age of 21 a mother and paternal grandmother who did not have status before marriage </Li> <Li> being born out of wedlock to a mother with status and a father without . </Li> </Ul> <P> These provisions interfered with the matrilineal cultures of many First Nations , whereby children were born to the mother 's clan and people , and gained their status in the tribe from her family . Often property and hereditary leadership passed through the maternal line . </P> <P> In Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell ( 1974 ) , these laws were upheld despite arguments made under the Canadian Bill of Rights .

In 1992 , Goodhart sold his share of the company to his partner , Tod Gordon , who in return renamed the promotion Eastern Championship Wrestling . When Eastern Championship Wrestling was founded , it was a member of the National Wrestling Alliance ( NWA ) . At the time , `` Hot Stuff '' Eddie Gilbert was the lead booker of Eastern Championship Wrestling . Gilbert , after a falling out with Tod Gordon , was replaced in September 1993 by Paul Heyman .

Crockett went to Tod Gordon and asked him to hold a tournament for the NWA 's top prize , the NWA World Heavyweight Championship , in ECW 's home area of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania on August 27 , 1994 . NWA President Dennis Coralluzzo alleged that Crockett and Gordon were going to try to monopolize the title ( akin to Crockett 's actions in the 1980s ) and stated Crockett did not have the NWA board 's approval , which resulted in Coralluzzo personally overseeing the tournament . Gordon took offense at Coralluzzo for his power plays and began contemplating a plan to secede ECW from the NWA through a controversial and public manner that would attract attention to ECW and insult the NWA organization . Gordon planned to have Shane Douglas , who was scheduled to face 2 Cold Scorpio in the tournament finals , throw down the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt upon winning as an act of defiance . </P> <P> Tod Gordon and Paul Heyman originally planned the idea of throwing down the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt . Heyman persuaded Douglas by noting that the negative would only be that NWA traditionalists would just see them as traitors to tradition . Adding to Douglas ' decision was the animosity between Douglas and NWA President Dennis Coralluzzo , who at the time publicly criticized Douglas and told NWA affiliated bookers not to book Douglas for shows . Coralluzzo believed that Douglas was a `` bad risk '' and had the tendency to no - show events . Douglas ultimately decided to go through with Gordon and Heyman 's plan , inspired by his father 's motto of `` doing right by the people that do right by you . '' After looking up and saying , `` This is it tonight , Dad , '' Douglas threw down the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt , stating that he did not want to be champion of a `` dead promotion '' that `` died seven years ago . '' He then raised the Eastern Championship Wrestling title belt and declared it to be a World Heavyweight Championship -- calling it the only real world title left in professional wrestling . When recalling this event years later , Paul Heyman stated the following in a 1998 chat : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` </Td> <Td> The National Wrestling Alliance was old - school when old - school was n't hip anymore . We wanted to set our mark , we wanted to breakaway from the pack , we wanted to let the world know that we were n't just some independent promotion . </Td> <Td> '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Coralluzzo was interviewed after the event and declared that Douglas would be the world champion of the NWA `` whether he likes it or not '' , calling Douglas ' actions a `` disgrace '' and said he would move to have Douglas stripped of both the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and the Eastern Championship Wrestling Heavyweight Championship , calling him `` undeserving '' of both titles . Gordon made the following announcement on the next edition of NWA - ECW programming : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` </Td> <Td> I listened with great interest as the representative of the NWA board of directors took it upon himself to inform you that they have the power to force NWA - Eastern Championship Wrestling not to recognize The Franchise , Shane Douglas , as a world heavyweight champion . Well , as of noon today , I have folded NWA - Eastern Championship Wrestling . In its place will be ECW - Extreme Championship Wrestling - and we recognize The Franchise , Shane Douglas , as our World Heavyweight Champion . And we encourage any wrestler in the world today to come to the ECW to challenge for that belt . This is the ECW , Extreme Championship Wrestling , changing the face of professional wrestling . </Td> <Td> '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The promotion showcased many different styles of professional wrestling , including hardcore wrestling matches as well as lucha libre and Japanese wrestling styles . </P> <H3> ECW Arena and television syndication ( edit ) </H3> See also : ECW Hardcore TV <P> The bulk of ECW 's shows remained at the ECW Arena , a former warehouse secluded under a section of Interstate 95 . Seating comprised simple folding chairs and four sets of portable bleachers , and the whole sort of unconventional set up reflected the gritty style of the wrestling itself . Shows were actually broadcast on a Philadelphia local cable sports station ( SportsChannel America 's local affiliate , SportsChannel Philadelphia ) on Tuesday evenings . After Sports Channel Philadelphia went off the air in 1997 , the show moved to WPPX - TV 61 . It later moved to a former independent broadcast station ( WGTW 48 ) in Philadelphia on either Friday or Saturday night at 1 or 2 a.m. Shows were also aired on the MSG Network in NYC on Friday nights ( Early Saturday morning ) at 2 a.m. Due to the obscurity of the stations and ECW itself , as well as the lack of FCC oversight at that late hour , many times expletives and violence were not edited out of these showings , along with extensive use of copyrighted music and music videos . </P> <H3> Paul Heyman and cross promotion ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1995 , Tod Gordon sold ECW to his head booker , Paul Heyman . Afterward , Gordon remained in ECW as a figurehead commissioner . Years after being the ECW `` Commissioner '' , Gordon left ECW , his absence was explained on - air that he retired from wrestling due to family . Rumors circulate , however , that Gordon was fired by Heyman after he was suspected as a `` locker room mole '' for a rival wrestling promotion , helping to lure talent to World Championship Wrestling . Many years later , in an interview , Gordon claims that the `` WCW mole '' situation was nothing more than a work . </P> <P> Storyline-wise , Vince McMahon first became `` aware '' of ECW while at the 1995 King of the Ring event in ECW 's home base of Philadelphia . During the match between Mabel and Savio Vega , the crowd suddenly started to angrily chant , `` ECW ECW ECW ! '' . On September 22 , 1996 , at the In Your House : Mind Games event in Philadelphia , ECW stars The Sandman , Tommy Dreamer , Paul Heyman , and Tazz were in the front row with Sandman even interfering in one match ( when he threw beer on Savio Vega during his strap match with Bradshaw ) . McMahon acknowledged ECW 's status as a local , up and coming promotion on the air . The following night on WWF Monday Night RAW , broadcast on September 23 , 1996 , at the onset of a match between The Bodydonnas vs. The British Bulldog and Owen Hart , Bill Alfonso , and Tazz could be seen invading the program . Both Tazz and Alfonso were able to successfully jump the security rails , and Tazz was able to prominently display a bright orange sign with black lettering that read `` Sabu Fears Tazz - ECW '' . On February 24 , 1997 , ECW `` invaded '' Raw from the Manhattan Center . They advanced a storyline , plugged their first ever pay - per - view and worked three matches in front of the WWF audience while McMahon called the action with both Jerry `` The King '' Lawler and Paul Heyman . The Manhattan Center in New York was peppered with a large number of ECW fans , who gave the WWF wrestlers `` Boring ! '' chants when they felt it was warranted . Likewise , when the ECW performers arrived , they popped and introduced the WWF Monday night audience to some trademark ECW group chants . This invasion sparked an inter-promotional feud between ECW and Lawler 's United States Wrestling Association . Lawler disparaged ECW on - camera and convinced wrestlers such as Rob Van Dam and Sabu to join him in an anti-ECW crusade . Throughout 1997 , ECW wrestlers appeared on USWA television programs , and vice versa . As part of the working relationship between ECW and the WWF , a number of WWF - contracted wrestlers were sent to ECW for seasoning in 1997 , including Droz and Brakkus . </P> <P> On April 13 , 1997 ECW broadcast their first pay - per - view ( PPV ) wrestling card Barely Legal , highlighted by Terry Funk defeating Raven to win the ECW World Heavyweight Championship . In June 1997 , the company 's Wrestlepalooza ' 97 event featured Raven 's final ECW match before leaving for WCW . In this match , Tommy Dreamer finally beat Raven , his longtime nemesis . Dreamer 's celebration was short - lived , though , as Jerry Lawler , along with Sabu and Rob Van Dam showed up to attack Dreamer . This set up a match between Dreamer and Lawler at the pay - per - view , 1997 Hardcore Heaven , on August 17 , which was won by Dreamer . ECW continued through 1998 and early 1999 with a string of successful pay - per - views . </P> <H3> Mike Awesome controversy and promotional rivalry ( edit ) </H3> <P> In April 2000 , Mike Awesome made a surprise appearance on WCW Monday Nitro -- making his debut by attacking Kevin Nash -- while still reigning as ECW World Heavyweight Champion . Awesome 's friend Lance Storm has said that Awesome refused to sign a new contract with ECW until Paul Heyman paid him overdue wages . There were rumors that WCW Executive Vice-President Eric Bischoff wanted Awesome to drop the ECW World Championship belt in the trash can on television , as had been done previously with the WWF Women 's title by Madusa when she jumped from the WWF to WCW . After Paul Heyman filed an injunction , WCW refrained from having Awesome appear on Nitro with the belt , but did acknowledge him as the champion . Eventually , a compromise was reached . Awesome ( a WCW employee and the reigning ECW World Heavyweight champion ) appeared at an April 13 , 2000 ECW event in Indianapolis , Indiana , where he lost the title to Tazz ( who was working for the World Wrestling Federation ) . </P> <P> In 2000 , ECW made its West Coast debut , holding its annual summer pay - per - view ECW Heat Wave in Los Angeles . At the time Los Angeles was home to Xtreme Pro Wrestling ( XPW ) , and its owner Rob Black purchased six front row tickets for the show . The tickets were given to a cadre of XPW talent , and their mission was to make it clear that ECW was on enemy turf . This was not a storyline . At the beginning of the main event , the XPW contingent donned shirts emblazoned with the XPW logo , gaining the attention of security and ECW wrestler Tommy Dreamer . Security ejected the XPW group from the building and later , a brawl broke out in the parking lot between members of the XPW ring crew and the ECW locker room . The XPW wrestlers were not involved in the fracas , during which the ECW wrestlers brutalized the XPW ring crew with several of the ring crew members left in pools of their own blood . Initial reports claimed that XPW valet Kristi Myst had somehow touched ECW valet Francine Fournier and that this is what prompted the incident , but Fournier herself has since gone on record as saying that she was never grabbed or in any other way touched by any of the XPW crew , and other eyewitnesses support the story that Fournier never had a hand laid on her . XPW was not acknowledged by ECW announcer Joey Styles during the pay - per - view telecast , however at the November to Remember pay - per - view a few months later , color - commentator Don Callis made a subtle reference to the incident , describing a wild brawl as `` looking like a Los Angeles parking lot '' . The XPW contingent at ringside consisted \n\nQuestion:\nwhen did ecw change to extreme championship wrestling\n", "answer": "1992"}

It sums up , in book form , the beliefs of the Catholic faithful . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Publication history </Li> <Li> 2 Doctrinal value </Li> <Li> 3 Contents </Li> <Li> 4 Comments </Li> <Li> 5 Derived works </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 Notes </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 Further reading </Li> <Li> 10 External links <Ul> <Li> 10.1 Text of the Catechism </Li> <Li> 10.2 Comments on the Catechism </Li> <Li> 10.3 Text of the Compendium </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Publication history ( edit ) </H2> <P> The decision to publish a catechism was taken at the Second Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops that was convened by Pope John Paul II on 25 January 1985 for the 20th anniversary of the close of the Second Vatican Council , and in 1986 , put a commission composed of 12 bishops and cardinals in charge of the project . The commission was assisted by a committee consisting seven diocesan bishops , experts in theology and catechesis . </P> <P> The text was approved by John Paul II on 25 June 1992 , and promulgated by him on 11 October 1992 , the 30th anniversary of the opening of the Second Vatican Council , with his apostolic constitution , Fidei depositum . Cardinal Georges Cottier , Theologian emeritus of the Pontifical Household and now Cardinal - Deacon of Santi Domenico e Sisto the University Church of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas , Angelicum was influential in drafting the encyclical . </P> <P> It was published in the French language in 1992 . Later it was then translated into many other languages . In the United States , the English translation was published in 1994 and had been pre-ordered more than 250,000 copies before its release , with a note that it was `` subject to revision according to the Latin typical edition ( editio typica ) when it is published . '' </P> <P> On August 15 , 1997 -- the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary -- John Paul II promulgated the Latin typical edition , with his apostolic letter , Laetamur Magnopere . The Latin text , which became the official text of reference ( editio typica ) , amended the contents of the provisional French text at a few points . One of the changes consisted in the inclusion of the position on death penalty that is defended in John Paul II 's encyclical Evangelium Vitae of 1995 . </P> <P> As a result , the earlier translations from the French into other languages ( including English ) had to be amended and re-published as `` second editions '' . </P> <H2> Doctrinal value ( edit ) </H2> <P> In the apostolic constitution Fidei depositum , John Paul II declared that the Catechism of the Catholic Church is `` a valid and legitimate instrument for ecclesial communion and a sure norm for teaching the faith '' , and stressed that it `` is not intended to replace the local catechisms duly approved by the ecclesiastical authorities , the diocesan Bishops and the Episcopal Conferences '' . </P> <H2> Contents ( edit ) </H2> <P> A catechism has been defined as `` a book that explains the beliefs of the Christian religion by using a list of questions and answers '' . Documents of religious instruction have been written since the beginning of Christianity and a catechism is typically an assemblage of these smaller documents into one large compilation of Church doctrine and teachings . </P> <P> The Catechism itself is not in question - and - answer format . Rather , it is instead a source on which to base such catechisms ( e.g. Youcat and the United States Catholic Catechism for Adults ) and other expositions of Catholic doctrine , called a `` major catechism . '' As stated in the apostolic constitution Fidei depositum , with which its publication was ordered , it was given so `` that it may be a sure and authentic reference text for teaching Catholic doctrine and particularly for preparing local catechisms . '' </P> <P> The Catechism is arranged in four principal parts : </P> <Ul> <Li> The Profession of Faith ( the Apostle 's Creed ) </Li> <Li> The Celebration of the Christian Mystery ( the Sacred Liturgy , and especially the sacraments ) </Li> <Li> Life in Christ ( including the Ten Commandments ) </Li> <Li> Christian Prayer ( including the Lord 's Prayer ) </Li> </Ul> <P> This scheme is often referred to as the `` Four Pillars '' of the Faith . The contents are abundantly footnoted with references to sources of the teaching , in particular the Scriptures , the Church Fathers , and the Ecumenical Councils and other authoritative Catholic statements , principally those issued by recent popes . </P> <P> The section on Scripture in the Catechism recovers the Patristic tradition of `` spiritual exegesis '' as further developed through the scholastic doctrine of the `` four senses . '' This return to spiritual exegesis is based on the Second Vatican Council 's 1965 dogmatic constitution Dei verbum , which taught that Scripture should be `` read and interpreted in light of the same Spirit by whom it was written '' . The Catechism amplifies Dei verbum by specifying that the necessary spiritual interpretation should be sought through the four senses of Scripture , which encompass the literal sense and the three spiritual senses ( allegorical , moral , and anagogical ) . </P> <P> The literal sense pertains to the meaning of the words themselves , including any figurative meanings . The spiritual senses pertain to the significance of the things ( persons , places , objects or events ) denoted by the words . Of the three spiritual senses , the allegorical sense is foundational . It relates persons , events , and institutions of earlier covenants to those of later covenants , and especially to the New Covenant . Building on the allegorical sense , the moral sense instructs in regard to action , and the anagogical sense points to man 's final destiny . The teaching of the Catechism on Scripture has encouraged the pursuit of covenantal theology , an approach that employs the four senses to structure salvation history via the biblical covenants . </P> <H2> Comments ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 1992 , Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger ( later Pope Benedict XVI ) noted : </P> <P> It clearly show ( s ) that the problem of what we must do as human beings , of how we should live our lives so that we and the world may become just , is the essential problem of our day , and basically of all ages . After the fall of ideologies , the problem of man -- the moral problem -- is presented to today 's context in a totally new way : What should we do ? How does life become just ? What can give us and the whole world a future which is worth living ? Since the catechism treats these questions , it is a book which interests many people , far beyond purely theological or ecclesial circles . </P> <P> Ulf Ekman , former Charismatic pastor and the founder of Livets Ord , says that the Catechism is `` the best book he has ever read '' . </P> <H2> Derived works ( edit ) </H2> <P> It was expected that the universal Catechism would serve as a source and template for inculturated national catechisms . In the United States , for example , the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops published the United States Catholic Catechism for Adults , officially replacing their previous version , the Baltimore Catechism , though it had already been out of use for nearly forty years . </P> <P> The Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church was published in 2005 , and the first edition in English in 2006 . It is a more concise and dialogic version of the Catechism . The text of the Compendium is available in fourteen languages on the Vatican website , which also gives the text of the Catechism itself in nine languages . </P> <P> Youcat , a catechism for youth , based on the Catechism and its Compendium , was published in 2011 . The Vatican has acknowledged that some translations of Youcat contain errors regarding Church teaching on the status of other religions , contraception and euthanasia , whether due to simple error or poor translations . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Catholicism portal </Li> <Li> Christianity portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Catholic Catechist </Li> <Li> Catholic Directory </Li> <Li> Catholic spirituality </Li> <Li> Glossary of the Catholic Church </Li> <Li> History of the Catholic Church since 1962 </Li> <Li> Index of Catholic Church articles </Li> <Li> Outline of Catholicism </Li> <Li> Pastoral care </Li> <Li> Catholic theology </Li> <Li> Second Vatican Council </Li> <Li> The Common Catechism </Li> <Li> Timeline of the Catholic Church </Li> <Li> Universal call to holiness </Li> <Li> Vocational Discernment in the Catholic Church </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ In an interview in 30Days , 3 - 2004 Cottier remarked : `` Going back to the early years , the first ' big ' text I worked on was the social encyclical Centesimus annus .

This was to coincide with increasing deregulation of the private sector rental market as it was felt at the time that local authorities would have a better understanding of local rental market conditions than the DSS . Its full transfer took place in 1989 as part of a major reform of social security legislation which also saw the introduction of Income Support . </P> <H2> Concepts and terminology ( edit ) </H2> <P> Housing Benefit will only meet the pure rent costs of any liability . Central to benefit decisions is an assessment of eligible rent and ineligible services . Eligible rent is that part of the rent paid by a person which can legally be covered by housing benefit . Ineligible services are the parts of the claimant 's rent liability that he must meet himself . Ineligible services include such things as the cost of heating , lighting , water rates , meals and any general counselling and support that may be included in the rent charged but will not be met by Housing Benefit . </P> <P> The payment of the benefit is centred on the concept of a benefit week , which is a seven - day period running from a Monday to a Sunday . Housing Benefit may be paid on a weekly , fortnightly , lunar monthly or calendar monthly basis . Housing Benefit paid to landlords is usually paid four weeks in arrears . Regulations require local authorities to take into account the needs of the claimant when deciding on the frequency of benefit payments , however due to the complexity of calculating a calendar monthly payment and especially any overpayments that arise , most local authorities pay benefit fortnightly to claimants and four weekly to landlords . </P> <P> For claimants not on a `` passported benefit '' , the concept of a benefit week is particularly important as benefit will only be paid from the start of a tenancy if the form is requested on the same benefit week as moving in . In all other cases for tenants not on a passported benefit , Housing Benefit will start only from the Monday after the form was requested . If the form is returned within a month of request , otherwise benefit is payable from the Monday after the council receives it . </P> <P> Applicants who successfully apply for a passported benefit along with their Housing Benefit have a calendar month to return the Housing Benefit form , from the date of application to the passported benefit . If the form is returned within one month of that date benefit starts from the Monday after the start date of the passported benefit - even if that benefit is backdated . </P> <P> Originally using paper application forms , in recent years local authorities have begun to use a telephone - based application process . Under these latter application schemes , claimants would often contact the responsible central government department , who would then forward the details to the local authority . This has turned out to be a somewhat prescient decision ; the gateway for claimants to the new Universal Credit system , which replaces Housing Benefit , is the central government department , not local authorities . </P> <P> The date of claim will be the date the claimant you first contacted the Department for Works and Pensions , for claimants applying to the Department for Work and Pensions , and otherwise the date of claim will be treated as the date he contacted the Local Authority . </P> <H2> Benefit cap ( edit ) </H2> Main article : benefit cap <P> Due to a benefit cap many claimants have had their housing benefit reduced to 50p a week and are at risk of losing their homes if they can not pay their rent . New building providing supported housing for vulnerable people is being cut due to uncertainty whether prospective tenants will be able to pay the rent . Schemes affected include homes for war veterans , for people with learning disabilities helping them live independently . Safe housing for domestic violence victims could also be at risk . New schemes are postponed or cancelled and existing schemes are being closed . David Orr of the National Housing Federation said , `` With social care in crisis , the role supported housing plays in alleviating pressures on the NHS is ever more important . These changes have not even come in yet and they have taken 7,000 homes for vulnerable people out of the pipeline . The proposed changes in funding bear no relation to the real cost of providing this type of housing . It is time government put supported housing on a secure and sustainable footing . '' The most vulnerable people , elderly people , severely disabled people and people with mental health problems need a great deal of support and the benefit cap disproportionately pprevents them from getting what they need . </P> <P> Polly Neate of Shelter said , `` The money put forward ( by the government for social housing ) is only a fraction of what 's needed , given just how bad this crisis has become . Building new homes also takes time , and time is not on the side of the million private renters who could risk being tipped into homelessness by the freeze on housing benefit . Whether a struggling family or a young person in low - paid work , the freeze is stripping away the help people desperately need to pay their rent . ( ... ) We are urging the government to abandon the freeze on housing benefit in the autumn budget or risk making more people homeless . '' </P> <H2> Local Housing Allowance ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Local Housing Allowance <P> The Government has introduced a new rent restriction policy for the calculation of Housing Benefit for private tenants called Local Housing Allowance . The scheme replaces two previous methods of controlling high rents for most new tenancies. Old scheme cases where the local authority decided the level of restriction based on the cost of suitable alternative accommodation ( in operation from 15 January 1989 to 1 January 1996 ) , Reference Rent cases , where the level of eligible rent was decided by the Rent Service based on the lower of what a landlord would have been able to obtain had a landlord not been renting to a tenant on Housing Benefit ( the claim related rent ) and the average cost of similar properties in that area ( the local reference rent ) . </P> <P> For LHA cases the eligible rent is decided in part by the size of property a claimant needs . This figure is published monthly by the council and the Rent Service . If the tenant rents more expensive accommodation , the rent is restricted to the LHA rate for that area . By publicising how much Housing Benefit a tenant can get for the need for Pre-Tenancy Determinations is removed . </P> <P> The Local Housing Allowance is set at the 30th percentile level for rents in the Broad Market Rental Area . The Broad Market Rental areas are similar in geographic size to Counties . This has led to a number of counties such as Cambridgeshire criticising the scheme because market rents in the city area of the county are considerably higher than those in the shire areas of the county . The House of Lords ruled against the concept of very large Broad Market Rental areas in the Heffernan case ( R ( Heffernan ) v The Rent Service ( 2008 ) UKHL 58 ) . The DWP re-introduced legislation to overturn this decision , restoring its intention to use very large broad market rental areas to draw down the cost of the scheme . </P> <P> Local Housing Allowance was introduced across all Local Authority areas on 7 April 2008 . The legislation to enable the scheme is contained in the Welfare Reform Act which received Royal Assent in May 2007 . The local authorities that trialled the new system were known as Pathfinder Authorities . They were Argyll and Bute , Blackpool , Brighton and Hove , Conwy county borough , Coventry , East Riding of Yorkshire , City of Edinburgh , Guildford , City of Leeds , London Borough of Lewisham , North East Lincolnshire , Norwich , Pembrokeshire , City of Salford , South Norfolk , Metropolitan Borough of St Helens , Teignbridge , London Borough of Wandsworth </P> <P> The final scheme was different in that the maximum difference between the rent payable and the eligible local housing allowance was restricted to \u00a3 15 . In addition in some pilot authorities , all tenants whose rent had been assessed according to reference rent rules were transferred to LHA , when the national scheme came in only those who made a new claim or moved went on to LHA . </P> <P> From April 2011 the \u00a3 15 paid to those whose rent was below LHA levels was scrapped . Now the maximum payable will be the rent or the LHA rate , whichever is the lower . </P> <P> From April 2009 , the maximum LHA that can be awarded will be restricted to the rate payable for four rooms . </P> <H2> Reference rent cases ( edit ) </H2> <P> This scheme will remain in operation for existing claimants who do not have a break in their Housing Benefit claim or do not move property . It was introduced with effect from 2 January 1996 . The level of eligible rent is decided by the Rent Service . Either on application by the Local Authority on an annual basis or if the tenant had taken out a Pre Tenancy Determination . </P> <H2> Northern Ireland ( edit ) </H2> <P> In Northern Ireland , tenants must apply to the Northern Ireland Housing Executive regardless of whether they rent from a private landlord , from the NIHE itself , or from a housing association . </P> <H2> Non-lha Housing benefit claims ( edit ) </H2> <P> For Housing Benefit claims made before ( or still existing at ) the roll - out of Local Housing Allowance scheme on 7 April 2008 , different rent restriction rules apply . </P> <P> The earlier system for calculation of eligible rent is specific to the individual property . </P> <P> The maximum Housing Benefit will be based on : - </P> <Ul> <Li> the tenant 's actual rent less services if the rent is `` reasonable '' ; </Li> <Li> the rent that would be `` reasonable '' in the area for the size of premises the tenant occupies in comparison to what would have been obtained by the landlord had the property not been rented to someone on Housing Benefit ( the claim - related rent ) or </Li> <Li> the average level of rent that would have been `` reasonable '' for that type of accommodation in the area ( the Local Reference Rent ) </Li> </Ul> <P> or where the tenant has a home too large for the needs </P> <Ul> <Li> the average level of rent that would be payable for the type of accommodation reasonable in the area for the actual size of accommodation that the tenant needs for his / her household . ( Exceptionally large determination ) </Li> </Ul> <P> Further restrictions can be imposed if the tenant is occupying accommodation in the luxury end of the market . </P> <P> These restrictions are decided either by the council , if the property is exempt from the Reference Rent rules and the LHA , or the Rent Service if the benefit being paid is subject to Reference Rent rules . </P> <P> The Rent Officer may visit the property ( or may have done so already ) although this is not a requirement . If a property is visited and the Rent Officer is not given access , the Council may terminate the claim , unless access is granted . If there are services included in the rent ( such as fuel bills , water charges , laundry or room cleaning ) , the rent officer will deduct the value of these as Housing Benefit can not pay for them . </P> <P> The Rent Officer decision is the maximum that the Council can pay for Reference Rent cases , for cases that are treated under the Pre 1996 rules , the figure is used to decide how much the DWP awards the Local Authority in subsidy and is purely indicative . This decision is made annually , although the Local Council may be late in making the application . If the decision is higher the effective date of the increase will be the Monday of the week of the referral ; if the decision is lower , the effective date is the Monday after the new decision is received by the Local Council . This is to avoid overpayments arising as a result of the Rent Service decision . If the decision is lower , any overpayment is LA Error and may only be recovered if it is reasonable to expect that the claimant knew that the decision was going to be lower . </P> <P> The rent officer makes the following valuations . </P> <H3> Claim - related rent ( edit ) </H3> <P> This has three parts . The lowest of these three figures is called the claim - related rent and is shown on the pre-tenancy determination decision . </P> Significantly high rent ( edit ) <P> The rent officer will have decided if the rent your landlord has asked for is reasonable compared with other properties in the vicinity . If it is too high , the rent officer will set a reasonable figure . The `` vicinity '' means the immediate area around the property . If the property is in a town or city , this could mean just the street the property is in or a few adjoining streets . If the property is in the country , the `` vicinity '' could be a small village . </P> <P> The `` vicinity '' is much smaller than the Broad Market Rental Area used to decide LHA Rates . </P> Number of rooms ( size criteria ) ( edit ) <P> The rent officer will consider whether the property has more rooms than the Housing Benefit rules say are needed . If the property has too many rooms , the rent officer will decide what the eligible rent used would be for a similar property with the right number of rooms . </P> <P> The rules are strict and the rent officer is not able to alter them . If an extra room is needed ( for example if the claimant has special disability needs ) , the claimant should apply to the Council for a DHP . </P> Underoccupancy charge ( bedroom Tax ) ( edit ) <P> From April 2013 if a claimant is considered to be under - occupying their property , their payment of Housing Benefit will be reduced by 14 % for one bedroom and 25 % for two or more bedrooms considered to be additional to the claimant 's needs . DHP 's will be made available to cover the shortfall for those affected by the change . Priority will be given to claimants with disabilities . </P> Exceptionally high rent ( edit ) <P> After having made these decisions , the rent officer decides if the lowest figure is still much higher than most rents for properties in the neighbourhood with the right number of rooms . This might be because of the property is in the luxury end of the market , or because of the servic\n", "answer": "1982"}

Originally a basement - run role - playing game publisher , the company popularized the collectible card game genre with Magic : The Gathering in the mid-1990s , acquired the popular Dungeons & Dragons role - playing game by purchasing the failing company TSR , and experienced tremendous success by publishing the licensed Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game .

Originally the company only published role - playing games such as the third edition of Talislanta and its own The Primal Order . The 1992 release of The Primal Order , a supplement designed for use with any game system , brought legal trouble with Palladium Books suing for references to Palladium 's game and system . The suit was settled in 1993 . </P> <P> In 1991 , Richard Garfield approached Wizards of the Coast with the idea for a new board game called RoboRally , but was turned down because the game would have been too expensive for Wizards of the Coast to produce . Instead , Adkison asked Garfield if he could invent a game that was both portable and quick - playing , to which Garfield agreed . </P> <P> Adkison set up a new corporation , Garfield Games , to develop Richard Garfield 's collectible card game concept , originally called Manaclash , into Magic : The Gathering . This kept the game sheltered from the legal battle with Palladium , and Garfield Games then licensed the production and sale rights to Wizards until the court case was settled , at which point the shell company was shut down . Wizards debuted Magic in July 1993 at the Origins Game Fair in Dallas . The game proved extremely popular at Gen Con in August 1993 , selling out of its supply of 2.5 million cards , which had been scheduled to last until the end of the year . The success of Magic generated revenue that carried the company out from the handful of employees in 1993 working out of Peter 's original basement headquarters into 250 employees in its own offices in 1995 . In 1994 , Magic won both the Mensa Top Five mind games award and the Origins Awards for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Board Game of 1993 and Best Graphic Presentation of a Board Game of 1993 . </P> <P> In 1994 , Wizards began an association with The Beanstalk Group , a brand licensing agency and consultancy , to license the Magic brand . After the success of Magic , Wizards published RoboRally in 1994 , and it soon won the 1994 Origins Awards for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Board Game and Best Graphic Presentation of a Board Game . Wizards also expanded its role - playing game line by buying SLA Industries from Nightfall Games and Ars Magica from White Wolf , Inc. in 1994 . In 1995 , Wizards published another card game by Richard Garfield , The Great Dalmuti , which won the 1995 Best New Mind Game award from Mensa . In August 1995 , Wizards released Everway and then four months later closed its roleplaying game product line . Peter Adkison explained that the company was doing a disservice to the games with lack of support and had lost money on all of Wizards ' roleplaying game products . Also in 1995 , Wizards ' annual sales passed US $65 million . </P> <H3> Acquisition of TSR and Pok\u00e9mon ( edit ) </H3> Peter Adkison , founder of Wizards of the Coast , at Gen Con Indy 2007 <P> Wizards announced the purchase of TSR , the cash - strapped makers of Dungeons & Dragons on April 10 , 1997 . Wizards acquired TSR and Five Rings Publishing Group for $25 million . Many of the creative and professional staff of TSR relocated from Wisconsin to the Renton area . Wizards used TSR as a brand name for a while , then retired it , allowing the TSR trademarks to expire . Between 1997 and 1999 , the company spun off several well - loved but poorly selling campaign settings ( including Planescape , Dark Sun and Spelljammer ) to fan groups , focusing business primarily on the more profitable Greyhawk and Forgotten Realms lines . </P> <P> In Summer 1997 , Wizards revisited the concept of a 3rd edition of Dungeons & Dragons , having first discussed it soon after the purchase of TSR . Looking back on the decision in 2004 , Adkison stated : `` Obviously , ( Wizards ) had a strong economic incentive for publishing a new edition ; sales for any product line tend to spike when a new edition comes out , assuming the new edition is an improvement over the first . And given the change in ownership we thought this would be an excellent opportunity for WotC to ' put its stamp on D&D ' . '' He later `` Set ( the ) overall design direction '' for the new edition of D&D . Wizards released the third edition of Dungeons & Dragons in 2000 , as well as the d20 System . With these releases came the Open Game License , which allowed other companies to make use of those systems . The new edition of the D&D game won the 2000 Origins Award for Best Roleplaying Game . In 2002 , Wizards sponsored a design contest which allowed designers to submit their campaign worlds to Wizards , to produce an entirely original campaign world ; Wizards selected `` Eberron '' , submitted by Keith Baker , and its first hardcover book was released in June 2004 . In 2003 Wizards released version 3.5 of Dungeons & Dragons and the d20 system . Wizards helped to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the D&D game at Gen Con Indy 2004 . </P> <P> On August 2 , 1997 , Wizards of the Coast was granted U.S. Patent 5,662,332 on collectible card games . In January 1999 , Wizards of the Coast began publishing the highly successful Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game . The game proved to be very popular , selling nearly 400,000 copies in less than six weeks , and selling 10 times better than Wizards ' initial projections . There was such a high demand for Pok\u00e9mon cards that some sports card series were discontinued in 1999 because so many printers were producing Pok\u00e9mon cards . The game won the 1999 National Parenting Center 's Seal of Approval . </P> <P> Within a year , Wizards had sold millions of copies of the Pok\u00e9mon game , and the company released a new set that included an instructional CD - ROM . Wizards continued to publish the game until 2003 . One of Nintendo 's affiliates , Pok\u00e9mon USA , had begun producing a new edition for the game before the last of its agreements with Wizards expired September 30 , and Wizards filed suit against Nintendo the following day , October 1 , 2003 . The two companies resolved their differences in December 2003 without going to court . </P> <H3> Acquisition by Hasbro ( edit ) </H3> <P> Seeing the continued success of Pok\u00e9mon and Magic : The Gathering , the game and toy giant Hasbro bought Wizards of the Coast in September 1999 , for about US $325 million . Hasbro had expressed interest in purchasing Wizards of the Coast as early as 1994 , and had been further impressed after the success of its Pok\u00e9mon game . Avalon Hill was made a division of Wizards of the Coast , in late 1999 ; the company had been purchased by Hasbro in the summer of 1998 . </P> <P> Vince Caluori became President of Wizards of the Coast in November 1999 . As of January 1 , 2001 , Peter Adkison resigned from Wizards . Chuck Huebner became President and CEO of Wizards of the Coast in June 2002 , and Loren Greenwood succeeded Huebner in these positions in April 2004 . Greg Leeds succeeded Loren Greenwood as President and CEO of Wizards of the Coast in March 2008 . </P> <P> In November 1999 , Wizards announced that Gen Con would leave Milwaukee after the 2002 convention . Hasbro sold Origins to GAMA , and in May 2002 sold Gen Con to Peter Adkison . Wizards also outsourced its magazines by licensing Dungeon , Dragon , Polyhedron , and Amazing Stories to Paizo Publishing . Wizards released the Dungeons & Dragons miniatures collectible pre-painted plastic miniatures games in 2003 , and added a licensed Star Wars line in 2004 , and through its Avalon Hill brand an Axis & Allies World War II miniatures game in 2005 .

( later known as Rankin / Bass Productions ) and currently distributed by Universal Television . It first aired Sunday , December 6 , 1964 , on the NBC television network in the United States , and was sponsored by General Electric under the umbrella title of The General Electric Fantasy Hour . The special was based on the Johnny Marks song `` Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer '' which was itself based on the poem of the same name written in 1939 by Marks ' brother - in - law , Robert L. May . Since 1972 , the special has aired on CBS , with the network unveiling a high - definition , digitally remastered version of the program in 2005 . As with A Charlie Brown Christmas and How the Grinch Stole Christmas , Rudolph no longer airs just once annually , but several times during the Christmas and holiday season on CBS . Unlike other holiday specials that also air on several cable channels ( including Freeform ) , Rudolph only airs on CBS . It has been telecast every year since 1964 , making it the longest continuously running Christmas TV special in history . 2014 marked the 50th anniversary of the television special and a series of postage stamps featuring Rudolph was issued by the United States Postal Service on November 6 , 2014 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Cast </Li> <Li> 3 Production <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Aftermath </Li> <Li> 3.2 Production credits </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Different versions <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Original 1964 NBC broadcast edit </Li> <Li> 4.2 1965 -- 1997 telecasts </Li> <Li> 4.3 1998 -- CBS telecasts </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Home media </Li> <Li> 6 Soundtrack </Li> <Li> 7 Merchandise </Li> <Li> 8 Reception </Li> <Li> 9 Sequels </Li> <Li> 10 In popular culture <Ul> <Li> 10.1 Films by Corky Quakenbush </Li> <Li> 10.2 Uses in advertising </Li> <Li> 10.3 Other References </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 11 Copyright issues </Li> <Li> 12 See also </Li> <Li> 13 References </Li> <Li> 14 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> Sam the Snowman welcomes the viewers to Christmastown at the North Pole and introduces Santa and Mrs. Claus who live in a castle located north of the Christmas Tree Forest . Mrs. Claus fusses over Santa as she wants him to fatten up by Christmas Eve . Sam then recalls the year Christmas was almost cancelled due to a snowstorm and tells the story of how a very special reindeer saved the day . </P> <P> Donner , Santa 's lead reindeer , and his wife have given birth to their new baby fawn , Rudolph . Upon admiring him , they are surprised to see that Rudolph has been born with a glowing red nose . When Santa arrives , he warns Donner that Rudolph will not make the sleigh team because of his nose . Donner then decides to hide the nose by covering it with mud to allow Rudolph to fit in with all the other reindeer . </P> <P> Over Rudolph 's first year of life , Donner trains him in the basics of being a reindeer , including hiding from the Abominable Snow Monster of the North . Rudolph enters the reindeer games , competing against his fellow fawns . During flight practice , Rudolph meets a doe named Clarice who tells him he is cute , and kisses him , which causes an elated Rudolph to fly higher and faster than everyone else . However , while celebrating with the other bucks , Rudolph 's nose cover pops off , and the others react with fear , then scorn and finally rejection as Rudolph is kicked out of the Reindeer Games . Walking away , Rudolph walks with Clarice , who supports him , until her father firmly tells her to never have any more contacts with a red - nosed reindeer . Then , Rudolph meets up with Hermey , an elf who ran away from Santa 's workshop because he wanted to be a dentist instead of making toys , and they decide to run away together . The pair then meet a prospector named Yukon Cornelius , who has fruitlessly searched his whole life for silver and gold . After escaping the snow monster on an ice floe , the trio crash land on the Island of Misfit Toys where unloved or unwanted toys live with their ruler , a winged lion named King Moonracer . The king allows the group to stay one night on the island in exchange for returning to Christmastown to ask Santa to find homes for the unwanted toys . However , Rudolph leaves the island in the middle of the night on his own , fearing that his nose , which attracts the snow monster , will endanger his friends . </P> <P> Time goes by and Rudolph grows into adulthood ; he tries and fails to find a place to settle where he will be accepted despite his nose and decides to return home . There , he finds that his parents and Clarice have been looking for him for months ; he sets out once again to find them , only to discover that the snow monster has captured them . Rudolph tries to save Clarice from being eaten , but the monster hits him in the head with a stalactite , dazing him . Hermey and Yukon return to Christmastown and go to save Rudolph . Hermey , posing as a pig , lures the monster out of his cave and Yukon drops rocks on his head to knock him out . Hermey then pulls out all the monster 's teeth . Realizing Yukon drives the toothless ( and now terrified ) monster back , only to follow it over the cliff with all his pack dogs . Mourning Yukon 's presumed death , Rudolph , Hermey , Clarice , and the Donners return home where everyone apologizes to them . After hearing their story , Santa welcomes the group back to Christmastown , promises that he will find homes for the Misfit Toys , Hermey opens his own dentist 's office , and Clarice 's father apologizes for being so hard on Rudolph . Yukon then returns with a reformed snow monster ( Yukon notes that they bounce ) and demonstrates the beast 's ability to trim a Christmas tree . While everybody 's celebrating , Santa interrupts , grimly informing everyone that because of the storm , he is forced to cancel the Christmas trip . Santa is soon distracted by Rudolph 's red nose and realizes that its light could cut through the storm . He asks Rudolph to lead the sleigh and Rudolph agrees . The team then flies off to the island and pick up the toys . The special ends with Santa wishing the viewers a merry Christmas as he and Rudolph fly off into the night . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> Hermey and Rudolph <Ul> <Li> Billie Mae Richards voices Rudolph , a reindeer with strong mental ( he learns to speak shortly after birth ) and physical strength who is shunned for his nonconforming red nose , but later saves Christmas . </Li> <Li> Stan Francis voices : <Ul> <Li> Santa Claus , portrayed in the special as a moody , nervous and `` skinny Santa '' whose fears are only allayed when he conjures the idea of using Rudolph 's nose to lead the sleigh . </Li> <Li> King Moonracer , a winged lion who rules the entire Island of Misfit Toys . King Moonracer 's voice uses a reverb effect to distinguish it from Santa Claus . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Paul Kligman voices : <Ul> <Li> Donner , Rudolph 's father and Santa 's most prized reindeer .

Her misfit problem is never explained on the special ; many decades later , on NPR 's Wait Wait ... Do n't Tell Me ! news quiz show ( broadcast December 8 , 2007 ) , Rudolph 's producer , Arthur Rankin Jr. , noted that Dolly 's problem was psychological , caused by being abandoned by her owner ( named as Sue in the special ) and suffering depression from feeling uncared - for . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <P> The TV special , with the teleplay by Romeo Muller , introduced several new characters inspired by the song 's lyrics .

Other than Burl Ives , all characters were portrayed by Canadian actors recorded at RCA studios in Toronto under the supervision of Bernard Cowan . </P> <P> After the script , concept designs and storyboards for Rudolph were done by Arthur Rankin , Jr. and his staff of artists at Rankin / Bass in New York City .

The Sunday night game is broadcast by NBC , while the Monday night game is broadcast by ESPN . </P> <P> The NFL uses a strict scheduling algorithm to determine which teams play each other from year to year , based on the current division alignments and the final division standings from the previous season . The current formula has been in place since 2002 , the last year that the NFL expanded its membership . Generally , each team plays the other three teams in its own division twice , all four teams from a single division in the AFC once , all four teams from a single division in the NFC once , and two additional intraconference games based on the standings from the previous season . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Game times </Li> <Li> 2 History </Li> <Li> 3 Scheduling formula <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Current formula </Li> <Li> 3.2 Past formulas <Ul> <Li> 3.2. 1 1995 -- 1998 NFL scheduling formula </Li> <Li> 3.2. 2 1978 -- 1994 NFL scheduling formula </Li> <Li> 3.2. 3 Regular season expansion proposals </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Scheduled division matchups </Li> <Li> 5 Regular season games played outside the U.S. </Li> <Li> 6 Disruptions of the schedule <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Conflicts with other sports leagues and organizations </Li> <Li> 6.2 Labor disputes </Li> <Li> 6.3 Natural disasters </Li> <Li> 6.4 Other major news events </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Game times ( edit ) </H2> Main article : NFL on television <P> Since 1990 , the majority of NFL regular - season games are played on Sundays at 1 pm , or around 4 : 00 to 4 : 25pm ET ( see below ) , with the late afternoon ( ET ) games usually reserved either for matches hosted in the Pacific Time Zone or Mountain Time Zone , or for one or more marquee contests . The current NFL television contract awards the American broadcast of these games to Fox or CBS , with Fox showing games where the visiting team is from the NFC and CBS showing games where the visiting team is from the AFC . Each of these Sunday afternoon games is televised on a regional basis to a few or several areas around the country . </P> <P> On each Sunday of the regular season , either CBS or Fox air two games in a doubleheader package , while the other network may show only one game . Late games scheduled to air on the network showing only one game are scheduled to start at 4 : 00pm EST , while the second game of a doubleheader will kick off later at 4 : 25pm ; this is to avoid conflicts with 1 : 00pm games that have run late . </P> <P> The schedule allows for 4 other regular time slots , in which these games are broadcast nationally across the country : </P> <Ol> <Li> One Sunday night game , which has been regularly scheduled since 1987 , and has aired on NBC since 2006 . </Li> <Li> One Monday Night Football game , which has been regularly scheduled since 1970 , and has been appearing on ESPN since 2006 . Also since 2006 , two games have been on the first Monday of the season . The practice of holding a Monday night game during the last week of the season ended after the 2002 season due to , among other reasons , low ratings , and a competitive imbalance involved for potential playoff teams who would have one less day of rest before the postseason . </Li> <Li> On Thursday nights since 2006 , one game has been played and aired on the NFL Network on the weeks including and after Thanksgiving Day . In addition , during the day on Thanksgiving , the NFL has played Thanksgiving Day games since 1920 ; by tradition the Dallas Cowboys and the Detroit Lions always host these afternoon games , and in recent years there has been a night game as well on Thanksgiving . Beginning with the 2012 season , the NFL has played games on Thursday nights for the whole season . </Li> <Li> Should there be a need for it , an occasional Saturday afternoon or night game , only in mid to late December , due to the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961 . December Saturday games have been a part of the schedule every season since 1970 , except for 2013 . </Li> </Ol> <P> Since the 2006 season , the NFL has used a `` flexible scheduling '' system for the last seven weeks of the regular season when there is a Sunday night game . In 2014 , that was expanded to include weeks 5 -- 17 . Flex scheduling ensures quality matchups on Sunday nights and it allows for surprise teams to play in primetime . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Number of regular season games per team </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1935 -- 1936 </Td> <Td> 12 games </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1937 -- 1942 , 1946 </Td> <Td> 11 games ( 12 weeks ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1943 -- 1945 </Td> <Td> 10 games ( 12 weeks ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1947 -- 1960 </Td> <Td> 12 games ( variable weeks ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1961 -- 1965 , 1967 - 1977 </Td> <Td> 14 games ( 14 weeks ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1966 </Td> <Td> 14 games ( 15 weeks , odd number of teams ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1978 -- 1981 , 1983 -- 1986 , 1988 -- 1989 </Td> <Td> 16 games ( 16 weeks ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1982 </Td> <Td> 9 games ( 17 weeks , strike ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> 15 games ( 16 weeks , strike ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1990 -- 1992 , 1994 -- 2000 , 2002 -- present </Td> <Td> 16 games ( 17 weeks ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1993 </Td> <Td> 16 games ( 18 weeks , additional bye week ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2001 </Td> <Td> 16 games ( 18 weeks , September 11 attacks ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> In its early years after 1920 , the NFL did not have a set schedule , and teams played as few as eight and as many as sixteen games , many against independent professional , college , or amateur teams . From 1926 through 1946 , they played from eleven to fourteen games per season , depending on the number of teams in the league . From 1947 through 1960 , each NFL team played 12 games per season . The American Football League began play in 1960 and introduced a balanced schedule of 14 games per team over a fifteen - week season , in which each of the eight teams played each of the other teams twice , with one bye week . Competition from the new league caused the NFL to expand and follow suit with a fourteen - game schedule in 1961 . </P> <P> Also in 1961 , the U.S. Congress passed the Sports Broadcasting Act in response to a court decision which ruled that the NFL 's method of negotiating television broadcasting rights violated antitrust laws . The law allows the league to sell the rights to all regular season and postseason games to the networks , but prohibits the league from directly competing with high school and college football games . Since high school and college teams typically play games on Friday and Saturday , respectively , the NFL can not hold games on those days until those seasons generally end in mid-December . </P> <P> From 1961 through 1977 , the NFL schedule consisted of fourteen regular season games played over fourteen weeks , except in 1966 . Opening weekend typically was the weekend after Labor Day , or rarely two weekends after Labor Day . Teams played six or seven exhibition games . In 1966 ( and 1960 ) , the NFL had an odd number of franchises , so one team was idle each week . In 1978 , the league changed the schedule to include sixteen regular season games and four exhibition games . From 1978 through 1989 , the sixteen games were played over sixteen weeks . </P> <P> In 1990 , the NFL re-introduced a bye week to the schedule , which it had not had since 1966 . Each team played sixteen regular season games over seventeen weeks . During the season , on a rotating basis , each team would have the weekend off . As a result , opening weekend was moved up to Labor Day weekend . The league had an odd number of teams ( 31 ) from 1999 to 2001 . During that period , at least one team had to be given a bye on any given week . For the 1993 season , the league experimented with the schedule by adding a second bye week for each team , resulting in an 18 - week regular season . In 2001 , the September 11th attacks resulted in the league postponing its week 2 games , leading to another 18 - week season . </P> <P> Since the 2002 season , the league has scheduled a nationally televised regular season kickoff game on the Thursday night after Labor Day , prior to the first Sunday of NFL games to kick off the season . The first one , featuring the San Francisco 49ers and the New York Giants , was held on September 5 , 2002 largely to celebrate New York City 's resilience in the wake of the September 11 , 2001 attacks . Since 2004 , the NFL has indicated that the opening game will normally be hosted by the defending Super Bowl champions as the official start of their title defense . Under this scheduling system , the earliest the regular season could begin is September 4 , as it was in the 2008 and 2014 seasons , due to September 1 falling on a Monday , while the latest possible is September 10 , as it was in the 2009 and 2015 seasons , due to September 1 falling on a Tuesday . </P> <H2> Scheduling formula ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Current formula ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> POS </Th> <Th> NFC East </Th> <Th> NFC North </Th> <Th> NFC South </Th> <Th> NFC West </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1st </Td> <Td> Eagles </Td> <Td> Vikings </Td> <Td> Saints </Td> <Td> Seahawks </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2nd </Td> <Td> Cowboys </Td> <Td> Lions </Td> <Td> Panthers </Td> <Td> Rams </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3rd </Td> <Td> Redskins </Td> <Td> Packers </Td> <Td> Falcons </Td> <Td> Cardinals </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 4th </Td> <Td> Giants </Td> <Td> Bears </Td> <Td> Buccaneers </Td> <Td> 49ers </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"5\"> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> POS </Th> <Th> AFC East </Th> <Th> AFC North </Th> <Th> AFC South </Th> <Th> AFC West </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1st </Td> <Td> Patriots </Td> <Td> Steelers </Td> <Td> Jaguars </Td> <Td> Chiefs </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2nd </Td> <Td> Bills </Td> <Td> Ravens </Td> <Td> Titans </Td> <Td> Chargers </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3rd </Td> <Td> Dolphins </Td> <Td> Bengals </Td> <Td> Colts </Td> <Td> Raiders </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 4th </Td> <Td> Jets </Td> <Td> Browns </Td> <Td> Texans </Td> <Td> Broncos </Td> </Tr> </Table> This chart of the 2017 season standings displays an application of the NFL scheduling formula . The Philadelphia Eagles in 2017 ( highlighted in green ) finished in first place in the NFC East . Thus , in 2018 , the Eagles will play two games against each of its division rivals ( highlighted in light blue ) , one game against each team in the NFC South and AFC South ( highlighted in yellow ) , and one game each against the first - place finishers in the NFC North and NFC West ( highlighted in orange ) . <P> Currently , the thirteen different opponents each team faces over the 16 - game regular season schedule are set using a pre-determined formula : </P> <Ul> <Li> Each team plays twice against each of the other three teams in its division : once at home , and once on the road ( six games ) . </Li> <Li> Each team plays once against each of the four teams from another division within its own conference , with the assigned division based on a three - year rotation : two at home , and two on the road ( four games ) . </Li> <Li> Each team plays once against one team from each of the remaining two divisions within its conference , based on the final division standings from the prior season : one at home , one on the road ( two games ) . </Li> <Li> Each team plays once against each of the four teams from a division in the other conference , with the assigned division based on a four - year rotation : two at home , and two on the road ( four games ) . </Li> </Ul> <P> Under this formula , all teams are guaranteed to play every other team in their own conference at least once every three years , and to play every team in the other conference exactly once every four years .

Then , the FSA abolished the Office of Special Services that had administered the two transferred units plus the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation ( OVR ) and the Food and Drug Administration . The effect of this action was to elevate OVR and FDA to agency status . </Li> <Li> In 1950 , two important national conferences required months of staff work by FSA personnel . The Mid-century White House Conference on Children and Youth was held in Washington , D.C. in December 1950 . Nearly 6,000 representatives of 100,000 local and community groups throughout the country met to discuss the `` spiritual values , democractic practice , and the dignity and worth of the individual . '' In August of that year , a Conference on Aging was called by the FSA Administrator to study the needs and problems of the older segment of the population . </Li> <Li> In September 1950 , Congress authorized the impacted aid program - to relieve the impact on local school facilities of a heavy influx of federal civilian and military personnel - and in FY 1951 appropriated $96.5 million for school construction under P.L. 81 - 815 , September 23 , 1950 , and $23 million for school operating expenses under P.L. 81 - 874 , September 30 , 1950 . </Li> <Li> The Social Security Act Amendments of 1950 added to the social security rolls about 10 million persons who previously had been ineligible . These persons included agricultural workers and selfemployed small shop owners . Others who benefitted from the changes were the elderly and those who had job - related disabilities . This expansion of beneficiaries was made possible by revisions to the oldage and survivors insurance and long - term disability insurance sections of the original Act . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 1951 . In May 1951 , a citizens committee , the National Mid-century Committee for Children and Youth , was established to provide national follow - up to the problems discussed at the White House Conference . Staff of the Children 's Bureau worked closely with the Committee until it was dissolved in 1953 . </Li> <Li> 1952 . The year 1952 was a period of transition for FSA . Despite the contributions made by the Agency during and before the Korean War , most of the defense - related activities in FSA were being phased out . The FDA continued to study chemical and bacteriological warfare agents but other FSA components were mobilized to provide disaster relief and health care assistance to a number of foreign countries . Technical assistance , under the federal `` Point IV '' and Mutual Security Agency programs , provided needed help to many underdeveloped countries . The Agency also furnished guidance for foreign representatives sent to this country to study American programs and methods in the fields of health and education . Later in the year , FSA accelerated its response to the Nation 's social needs . </Li> <Li> 1953 . FSA Becomes DHEW <Ul> <Li> By 1953 , the Federal Security Agency 's programs in health , education , and social security had grown to such importance that its annual budget exceeded the combined budgets of the Departments of Commerce , Justice , Labor and Interior and affected the lives of millions of people . </Li> <Li> Consequently , in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949 , President Eisenhower submitted to the Congress on March 12 , 1953 , Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953 , which called for the dissolution of the Federal Security Agency and elevation of the agency to Cabinet status as the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare . All of the responsibilities of the Federal Security Administrator would be transferred to the Secretary of Health , Education , end Welfare and the components of FSA would be transferred to the Department . A major objective of the reorganization was to improve administration of the functions of the Federal Security Agency . The plan was approved April 1 , 1953 , and became effective on April 11 , 1953 . </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <P> Unlike statutes authorizing the creation of other executive departments , the contents of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953 were never properly codified within the United States Code , although Congress did codify a later statute ratifying the Plan . Today , the Plan is included as an appendix to Title 5 of the United States Code . The result is that HHS is the only executive department whose statutory foundation today rests on a confusing combination of several codified and uncodified statutes . </P> List of Federal Security Agency Administrators ( edit ) <Table> <Tr> <Th> Name </Th> <Th> Dates of service </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Paul V.

In relation with state and local government , the federal government provides states with funding to ensure that states are able to retain current programs and are able to implement new programs . The coordination between all three health departments is critical to ensure the programs being implemented are well structured and suited to the corresponding level of health department . The health department at state level needs to safeguard good relations with legislators as well as governors in order to acquire legal and financial aid to guarantee the development and enhancements of the programs .

The answer should be a number\n\nDocument:\nConvicts in Australia - Wikipedia <H1> Convicts in Australia </H1> Jump to : navigation , search This article is about convicts transported to Australian penal colonies . For the Australian rules football team , see Australian Convicts . Drawing of convicts in New Holland , 1793 <P> Between 1788 and 1868 , about 162,000 convicts were transported by the British government to various penal colonies in Australia . </P> <P> The British government began transporting convicts overseas to American colonies in the early 17th century . When transportation ended with the start of the American Revolution , an alternative site was needed to relieve further overcrowding of British prisons and hulks . Earlier in 1770 , James Cook charted and claimed possession of the east coast of Australia for Britain . Seeking to pre-empt the French colonial empire from expanding into the region , Britain chose Australia as the site of a penal colony , and in 1787 , the First Fleet of eleven convict ships set sail for Botany Bay , arriving on 20 January 1788 to found Sydney , New South Wales , the first European settlement on the continent . Other penal colonies were later established in Van Diemen 's Land ( Tasmania ) in 1803 and Queensland in 1824 , while Western Australia , founded in 1829 as a free colony , received convicts from 1850 . Victoria and South Australia remained free colonies . Penal transportation to Australia peaked in the 1830s and dropped off significantly the following decade . The last convict ship arrived in Western Australia on 10 January 1868 . </P> <P> Many convicts were transported for petty crimes , while a significant number were political prisoners . More serious crimes , such as rape and murder , were punishable by death , and therefore not transportable offences . Once emancipated , most ex-convicts stayed in Australia and joined the free settlers , with some rising to prominent positions in Australian society . However , convictism carried a social stigma , and for some later Australians , convict origins would be a source of shame . Attitudes became more accepting in the 20th century and it is now considered by many Australians to be a cause for celebration to have a convict in one 's lineage . Around 20 % of modern Australians are descended from transported convicts . The convict era has inspired famous novels , films , and other cultural works , and the extent to which it has shaped Australia 's national character has been studied by many writers and historians . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Reasons for transportation </Li> <Li> 2 Penal settlements <Ul> <Li> 2.1 New South Wales </Li> <Li> 2.2 Norfolk Island </Li> <Li> 2.3 Tasmania </Li> <Li> 2.4 Victoria </Li> <Li> 2.5 Queensland </Li> <Li> 2.6 Western Australia </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Women </Li> <Li> 4 Political prisoners </Li> <Li> 5 Cessation of transportation </Li> <Li> 6 Legacy <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Cultural depictions </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Notable convicts transported to Australia </Li> <Li> 8 See also </Li> <Li> 9 Sources </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Reasons for transportation ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Penal transportation William Hogarth 's Gin Lane , 1751 <P> According to Robert Hughes in The Fatal Shore , the population of England and Wales , which had remained steady at 6 million from 1700 to 1740 , began rising considerably after 1740 . By the time of the American Revolution , London was overcrowded , filled with the unemployed , and flooded with cheap gin . Poverty , social injustice , child labor , harsh and dirty living conditions and long working hours were prevalent in 19th - century Britain . Dickens ' novels perhaps best illustrate this ; even some government officials were horrified by what they saw . Only in 1833 and 1844 were the first general laws against child labour ( the Factory Acts ) passed in the United Kingdom . Crime had become a major problem and in 1784 a French observer noted that `` from sunset to dawn the environs of London became the patrimony of brigands for twenty miles around . '' </P> Prison hulks in the River Thames <P> Each parish had a watchman , but British cities did not have police forces in the modern sense . Jeremy Bentham avidly promoted the idea of a circular prison , but the penitentiary was seen by many government officials as a peculiar American concept . Virtually all malefactors were caught by informers or denounced to the local court by their victims . Pursuant to the so - called `` Bloody Code '' , by the 1770s there were 222 crimes in Britain which carried the death penalty , almost all of which were crimes against property . These included such offences as the stealing of goods worth over 5 shillings , the cutting down of a tree , the theft of an animal , even the theft of a rabbit from a warren . </P> <P> The Industrial Revolution led to an increase in petty crime due to the economic displacement of much of the population , building pressure on the government to find an alternative to confinement in overcrowded gaols . The situation was so dire that hulks left over from the Seven Years ' War were used as makeshift floating prisons . Eight of every 10 prisoners were in jail for theft . The Bloody Code was gradually rescinded in the 1800s because judges and juries considered its punishments too harsh . Since lawmakers still wanted punishments to deter potential criminals , they increasingly applied transportation as a more humane alternative to execution . Transportation had been employed as a punishment for both major and petty crimes since the seventeenth century . Around 60,000 convicts were transported to the British colonies in North America in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . Transportation to the Americas ceased following Britain 's defeat in the American Revolutionary War . The number of convicts transported to North America is not verified although it has been estimated to be 50,000 by John Dunmore Lang and 120,000 by Thomas Keneally . The British American colony of Maryland received a larger felon quota than any other province . </P> <H2> Penal settlements ( edit ) </H2> <H3> New South Wales ( edit ) </H3> Main article : History of New South Wales The First Fleet arrives in Botany Bay , 21 January 1788 The Costumes of the Australasians : watercolour by Edward Charles Close shows the co-existence of convicts , their military gaolers , and free settlers . <P> Alternatives to the American colonies were investigated and the newly discovered and mapped East Coast of New Holland was proposed . The details provided by James Cook during his expedition to the South Pacific in 1770 made it the most suitable . </P> <P> On 18 August 1786 the decision was made to send a colonisation party of convicts , military , and civilian personnel to Botany Bay under the command of Admiral Arthur Phillip who was to be the Governor of the new colony . There were 775 convicts on board six transport ships . They were accompanied by officials , members of the crew , marines , the families thereof and their own children who together totaled 645 . In all , eleven ships were sent in what became known as the First Fleet . Other than the convict transports , there were two naval escorts and three storeships . The fleet assembled in Portsmouth and set sail on 13 May 1787 . </P> <P> The fleet arrived at Botany Bay on 20 January 1788 . It soon became clear that it would not be suitable for the establishment of a colony due to `` the openness of this bay , and the dampness of the soil , by which the people would probably be rendered unhealthy '' and Philip decided to examine Port Jackson , a bay mentioned by Captain Cook , about three leagues to the north . On 22 January a small expedition led by Phillips sailed to Port Jackson , arriving in the early afternoon : </P> <P> Here all regret arising from the former disappointments was at once obliterated ; and Governor Phillip had the satisfaction to find one of the finest harbours in the world , in which a thousand sail of the line might ride in perfect security . The different coves of this harbour were examined with all possible expedition , and the preference was given to one which had the finest spring of water , and in which ships can anchor so close to the shore , that at a very small expence quays may be constructed at which the largest vessels may unload . This cove is about half a mile in length , and a quarter of a mile across at the entrance . In honour of Lord Sydney , the Governor distinguished it by the name of Sydney Cove . </P> <P> There they established the first permanent European colony on the Australian continent , New South Wales , on 26 January . The area has since developed into the city of Sydney . This date is still celebrated as Australia Day . </P> <P> There was initially a high mortality rate amongst the members of the first fleet due mainly to shortages of food . The ships carried only enough food to provide for the settlers until they could establish agriculture in the region . Unfortunately , there were an insufficient number of skilled farmers and domesticated livestock to do this , and the colony waited for the arrival of the Second Fleet . The second fleet was an unprecedented disaster that provided little in the way of help and upon its delivery in June 1790 of still more sick and dying convicts , which actually worsened the situation in Port Jackson . </P> <P> Lieutenant - General Sir Richard Bourke was the ninth Governor of the Colony of New South Wales between 1831 and 1837 . Appalled by the excessive punishments doled out to convicts , Bourke passed ' The Magistrates Act ' , which limited the sentence a magistrate could pass to fifty lashes ( previously there was no such limit ) . Bourke 's administration was controversial , and furious magistrates and employers petitioned the crown against this interference with their legal rights , fearing that a reduction in punishments would cease to provide enough deterrence to the convicts . </P> <P> Bourke , however , was not dissuaded from his reforms and continued to create controversy within the colony by combating the inhumane treatment handed out to convicts , including limiting the number of convicts each employer was allowed to seventy , as well as granting rights to freed convicts , such as allowing the acquisition of property and service on juries . It has been argued that the suspension of convict transportation to New South Wales in 1840 can be attributed to the actions of Bourke and other men like Australian - born lawyer William Charles Wentworth . It took another 10 years , but transportation to the colony of New South Wales was finally officially abolished on 1 October 1850 . </P> <P> If a convict was well behaved , the convict could be given a ticket of leave , granting some freedom . At the end of the convict 's sentence , seven years in most cases , the convict was issued with a Certificate of Freedom . He was then free to become a settler or to return to England . Convicts who misbehaved , however , were often sent to a place of secondary punishment like Port Arthur , Tasmania or Norfolk Island , where they would suffer additional punishment and solitary confinement . </P> <H3> Norfolk Island ( edit ) </H3> Main article : History of Norfolk Island <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( August 2015 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> Norfolk Island military barracks <P> Within a month of the arrival of the First Fleet at Sydney Cove , a group of convicts and free settlers were sent to take control of Norfolk Island , a small island 1,412 kilometres ( 877 mi ) east of the coast of New South Wales . More convicts were sent , and many of them proved to be unruly ; early 1789 saw a failed attempt to overthrow Lieutenant Philip Gidley King , the island 's commandant . This was followed by the wreck of the HMS Sirius on one of the island 's reefs while attempting to land stores . </P> <H3> Tasmania ( edit ) </H3> Main article : History of Tasmania Penitentiary at the Port Arthur convict settlement , Tasmania <P> In 1803 , a British expedition was sent from Sydney to Tasmania ( then known as Van Diemen 's Land ) to establish a new penal colony there . The small party , led by Lt. John Bowen , established a settlement at Risdon Cove , on the eastern side of the Derwent River . Originally sent to Port Philip , but abandoned within weeks , another expedition led by Lieutenant - Colonel David Collins arrived soon after . Collins considered the Risdon Cove site inadequate , and in 1804 he established an alternative settlement on the western side of the river at Sullivan 's Cove , Tasmania . This later became known as Hobart , and the original settlement at Risdon Cove was deserted . Collins became the first Lieutenant - Governor of Van Diemen 's Land . </P> <P> When the convict station on Norfolk Island was abandoned in 1807 - 1808 , the remaining convicts and free settlers were transported to Hobart and allocated land for re-settlement . However , as the existing small population was already experiencing difficulties producing enough food , the sudden doubling of the population was almost catastrophic . </P> <P> Starting in 1816 , more free settlers began arriving from Great Britain . On 3 December 1825 Tasmania was declared a colony separate from New South Wales , with a separate administration . </P> Macquarie\n\nQuestion:\nwhen did the first convicts go to australia\n", "answer": "1788"}

The answer should be a number\n\nQuestion:\nwhen did they start screening for cystic fibrosis\n\nDocument:\n ) </H3> <P> Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) was first added to newborn screening programs in New Zealand and regions of Australia in 1981 , by measuring immunoreactive trypsinogen ( IRT ) in dried blood spots . After the CFTR gene was identified , Australia introduced a two tier testing program to reduce the number of false positives . Samples with an elevated IRT value were then analyzed with molecular methods to identify the presence of disease causing mutations before being reported back to parents and health care providers . CF is included in the core panel of conditions recommended for inclusion in all 50 states , Texas was the last state to implement their screening program for CF in 2010 . Alberta was the first Canadian province to implement CF screening in 2007 . Quebec , New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island do not include CF in their screening programs . The United Kingdom as well as many European Union countries screen for CF as well . Switzerland is one of the latest countries to add CF to their newborn screening menu , doing so in January 2011 . </P> <H3> Urea cycle disorders ( edit ) </H3> <P> Disorders of the distal urea cycle , such as citrullinemia , argininosuccinic aciduria and argininemia are included in newborn screening programs in many jurisdictions that using tandem mass spectrometry to identify key amino acids . Proximal urea cycle defects , such as ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiency are not included in newborn screening panels because they are not reliably detected using current technology , and also because severely affected infants will present with clinical symptoms before newborn screening results are available . Some regions claim to screen for HHH syndrome ( hyperammonemia , hyperornithinemia , homocitrullinuria ) based on the detection of elevated ornithine levels in the newborn screening dried blood spot , but other sources have shown that affected individuals do not have elevated ornithine at birth . </P> <H3> Lysosomal storage disorders ( edit ) </H3> <P> Lysosomal storage disorders are not included in newborn screening programs with high frequency . As a group , they are heterogenous , with screening only being feasible for a small fraction of the approximately 40 identified disorders . The arguments for their inclusion in newborn screening programs center around the advantage of early treatment ( when treatment is available ) , avoiding a diagnostic odyssey for families and providing information for family planning to couples who have an affected child . The arguments against including these disorders , as a group or individually center around the difficulties with reliably identifying individuals who will be affected with a severe form of the disorder , the relatively unproven nature of the treatment methods , and the high cost / high risk associated with some treatment options . </P> <P> New York State started a pilot study to screen for Krabbe disease in 2006 , largely due to the efforts of Jim Kelly , whose son , Hunter , was affected with the disease . A pilot screening program for four lysosomal storage diseases ( Gaucher disease , Pompe disease , Fabry disease and Niemann - Pick disease was undertaken using anonymised dried blood spots was completed in Austria in 2010 . Their data showed an increased incidence from what was expected in the population , and also a number of late onset forms of disease , which are not typically the target for newborn screening programs . </P> <H3> Hearing loss ( edit ) </H3> <P> Undiagnosed hearing loss in a child can have serious effects on many developmental areas , including language , social interactions , emotions , cognitive ability , academic performance and vocational skills , any combination of which can have negative impacts on the quality of life . The serious impacts of a late diagnosis , combined with the high incidence ( estimated at 1 - 3 per 1000 live births , and as high as 4 % for neonatal intensive care unit patients ) have been the driving forces behind screening programs designed to identify infants with hearing loss as early as possible . Early identification allows these patients and their families to access needed resources to help them develop . </P> <P> Newborn hearing testing is done at the bedside using transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions , automated auditory brainstem responses or a combination of both techniques . Hearing screening programs have found the initial testing to cost between $10.20 and $23.37 per baby , depending on the technology used . As these are screening tests only , false positive results will occur . A review of hearing screening programs found varied initial referral rates ( screen positive results ) from 0.6 % to 16.7 % . The highest overall incidence of hearing loss detection was 0.517 % . A significant proportion of screen positive infants were lost to follow - up , before a diagnosis could be confirmed or ruled out in all screening programs . </P> <H3> Congenital heart defects ( edit ) </H3> <P> Pulse oximetry has been recently added as a bedside screening test for critical congenital heart defects . </P> <H3> Severe combined immunodeficiency ( edit ) </H3> <P> Severe combined immunodeficiency ( SCID ) caused by T - cell deficiency is a disorder that was recently added to newborn screening programs in some regions of the United States . Wisconsin was the first state to add SCID to their mandatory screening panel in 2008 , and it was recommended for inclusion in all states ' panels in 2010 . Identification of infants with SCID is done by detecting T - cell receptor excision circles ( TRECs ) using real - time polymerase chain reaction ( qPCR ) . TRECs are decreased in infants affected with SCID . </P> <P> SCID has not been added to newborn screening in a wide scale for several reasons . It requires technology that is not currently used in most newborn screening labs , as PCR is not used for any other assays included in screening programs . Follow - up and treatment of affected infants also requires skilled immunologists , which may not be available in all regions . Treatment for SCID is a stem cell transplant , which can not be done in all centers . </P> <H3> Other conditions ( edit ) </H3> <P> Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) is an X-linked disorder caused by defective production of dystrophin . Many jurisdictions around the world have screened for , or attempted to screen for DMD using elevated levels of creatine kinase measured in dried blood spots . Because universal newborn screening for DMD has not been undertaken , affected individuals often have a significant delay in diagnosis . As treatment options for DMD become more and more effective , interest in adding a newborn screening test increases . At various times since 1978 , DMD has been included ( often as a pilot study on a small subset of the population ) in newborn screening programs in Edinburgh , Germany , Canada , France , Wales , Cyprus , Belgium and the United States . In 2012 , Belgium was the only country that continued to screen for DMD using creatine kinase levels . </P> <P> As treatments improve , newborn screening becomes a possibility for disorders that could benefit from early intervention , but none was previously available . Adrenoleukodystrophy ( ALD ) , a peroxisomal disease that has a variable clinical presentation is one of the disorders that has become a target for those seeking to identify patients early . ALD can present in several different forms , some of which do not present until adulthood , making it a difficult choice for countries to add to screening programs . The most successful treatment option is a stem cell transplant , a procedure that carries a significant risk . </P> <P> Eye and vision screening that can be performed within the few months of life include : strabismus screening using the Hirschberg test ( or more recently using binocular retinal birefringence screening for higher precision ) , and retinoblastoma screening using the red reflex . Further eye examination may be called for in some cases . </P> <H2> Disease qualification ( edit ) </H2> <P> Newborn screening programs initially used screening criteria based largely on criteria established by JMG Wilson and F. Jungner in 1968 . Although not specifically about newborn population screening programs , their publication , Principles and practice of screening for disease proposed ten criteria that screening programs should meet before being used as a public health measure . Newborn screening programs are administered in each jurisdiction , with additions and removals from the panel typically reviewed by a panel of experts . The four criteria from the publication that were relied upon when making decisions for early newborn screening programs were : </P> <Ol> <Li> having an acceptable treatment protocol in place that changes the outcome for patients diagnosed early with the disease </Li> <Li> an understanding of the condition 's natural history </Li> <Li> an understanding about who will be treated as a patient </Li> <Li> a NBS screening test that is reliable for both affected and unaffected patients and is acceptable to the public </Li> </Ol> <P> As diagnostic techniques have progressed , debates have arisen as to how screening programs should adapt . Tandem mass spectrometry has greatly expanded the potential number of diseases that can be detected , even without satisfying all of the other criteria used for making screening decisions . Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a disease that has been added to screening programs in several jurisdictions around the world , despite the lack of evidence as to whether early detection improves the clinical outcome for a patient . </P> <H2> Techniques ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Sample collection ( edit ) </H3> <P> Newborn screening tests are most commonly done from whole blood samples collected on specially designed filter paper . The filter paper is often attached to a form containing required information about the infant and parents . This includes date and time of birth , date and time of sample collection , the infant 's weight and gestational age . The form will also have information about whether the baby has had a blood transfusion and any additional nutrition the baby may have received ( total parenteral nutrition ) . Most newborn screening cards also include contact information for the infant 's physician in cases where follow up screening or treatment is needed . The Canadian province of Quebec performs newborn screening on whole blood samples collected as in most other jurisdictions , and also runs a voluntary urine screening program where parents collect a sample at 21 days of age and submit it to a provincial laboratory for an additional panel of conditions . </P> <P> Newborn screening samples are collected from the infant between 24 hours and 7 days after birth , with the requirement that the baby has fed at least once . Samples can be collected at the hospital , or by midwives . If a sample is collected from an infant who is less than 24 hours old , the laboratory will often request a repeat specimen be taken after 24 hours . Samples are mailed daily to the laboratory responsible for testing . In the United States and Canada , newborn screening is mandatory , with an option for parents to opt out of the screening in writing if they desire . In most of Europe , newborn screening is done with the consent of the parents . Proponents of mandatory screening claim that the test is for the benefit of the child , and that parents should not be able to opt out on their behalf . In regions that favour informed consent for the procedure , they report no increase in costs , no decrease in the number of children screened and no cases of included diseases in children who did not undergo screening . </P> <H3> Laboratory testing ( edit ) </H3> <P> Because newborn screening programs test for a number of different conditions , a number of different laboratorial methodologies are used , as well as bedside testing for hearing loss using evoked auditory potentials and congenital heart defects using pulse oximetry . Newborn screening started out using simple bacterial inhibition assays to screen for a single disorder , starting with phenylketonuria in the early 1960s . With this testing methodology , newborn screening required one test to detect one condition . As mass spectrometry became more widely available , the technology allowed rapid determination of a number of acylcarnitines and amino acids from a single dried blood spot . This increased the number of conditions that could be detected by newborn screening . Enzyme assays are used to screen for galactosemia and biotinidase deficiency . Immunoassays measure thyroid hormones for the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism and 17\u03b1 - hydroxyprogesterone for the diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia . Molecular techniques are used for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and severe combined immunodeficiency . </P> <H3> Reporting results ( edit ) </H3> <P> The goal is to report the results within a short period of time . If screens are normal , a paper report is sent to the submitting hospital and parents rarely hear about it . If an abnormality is detected , employees of the agency , usually nurses , begin to try to reach the physician , hospital , and / or nursery by telephone . They are persistent until they can arrange an evaluation of the infant by an appropriate specialist physician ( depending on the disease ) . The specialist will attempt to confirm the diagnosis by r\n", "answer": "1981"}

Other penal colonies were later established in Van Diemen 's Land ( Tasmania ) in 1803 and Queensland in 1824 , while Western Australia , founded in 1829 as a free colony , received convicts from 1850 . Victoria and South Australia remained free colonies . Penal transportation to Australia peaked in the 1830s and dropped off significantly the following decade . The last convict ship arrived in Western Australia on 10 January 1868 . </P> <P> Many convicts were transported for petty crimes , while a significant number were political prisoners . More serious crimes , such as rape and murder , were punishable by death , and therefore not transportable offences . Once emancipated , most ex-convicts stayed in Australia and joined the free settlers , with some rising to prominent positions in Australian society . However , convictism carried a social stigma , and for some later Australians , convict origins would be a source of shame . Attitudes became more accepting in the 20th century and it is now considered by many Australians to be a cause for celebration to have a convict in one 's lineage . Around 20 % of modern Australians are descended from transported convicts . The convict era has inspired famous novels , films , and other cultural works , and the extent to which it has shaped Australia 's national character has been studied by many writers and historians . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Reasons for transportation </Li> <Li> 2 Penal settlements <Ul> <Li> 2.1 New South Wales </Li> <Li> 2.2 Norfolk Island </Li> <Li> 2.3 Tasmania </Li> <Li> 2.4 Victoria </Li> <Li> 2.5 Queensland </Li> <Li> 2.6 Western Australia </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Women </Li> <Li> 4 Political prisoners </Li> <Li> 5 Cessation of transportation </Li> <Li> 6 Legacy <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Cultural depictions </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Notable convicts transported to Australia </Li> <Li> 8 See also </Li> <Li> 9 Sources </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Reasons for transportation ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Penal transportation William Hogarth 's Gin Lane , 1751 <P> According to Robert Hughes in The Fatal Shore , the population of England and Wales , which had remained steady at 6 million from 1700 to 1740 , began rising considerably after 1740 . By the time of the American Revolution , London was overcrowded , filled with the unemployed , and flooded with cheap gin . Poverty , social injustice , child labor , harsh and dirty living conditions and long working hours were prevalent in 19th - century Britain . Dickens ' novels perhaps best illustrate this ; even some government officials were horrified by what they saw . Only in 1833 and 1844 were the first general laws against child labour ( the Factory Acts ) passed in the United Kingdom . Crime had become a major problem and in 1784 a French observer noted that `` from sunset to dawn the environs of London became the patrimony of brigands for twenty miles around . '' </P> Prison hulks in the River Thames <P> Each parish had a watchman , but British cities did not have police forces in the modern sense . Jeremy Bentham avidly promoted the idea of a circular prison , but the penitentiary was seen by many government officials as a peculiar American concept . Virtually all malefactors were caught by informers or denounced to the local court by their victims . Pursuant to the so - called `` Bloody Code '' , by the 1770s there were 222 crimes in Britain which carried the death penalty , almost all of which were crimes against property . These included such offences as the stealing of goods worth over 5 shillings , the cutting down of a tree , the theft of an animal , even the theft of a rabbit from a warren . </P> <P> The Industrial Revolution led to an increase in petty crime due to the economic displacement of much of the population , building pressure on the government to find an alternative to confinement in overcrowded gaols . The situation was so dire that hulks left over from the Seven Years ' War were used as makeshift floating prisons . Eight of every 10 prisoners were in jail for theft . The Bloody Code was gradually rescinded in the 1800s because judges and juries considered its punishments too harsh . Since lawmakers still wanted punishments to deter potential criminals , they increasingly applied transportation as a more humane alternative to execution . Transportation had been employed as a punishment for both major and petty crimes since the seventeenth century . Around 60,000 convicts were transported to the British colonies in North America in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . Transportation to the Americas ceased following Britain 's defeat in the American Revolutionary War . The number of convicts transported to North America is not verified although it has been estimated to be 50,000 by John Dunmore Lang and 120,000 by Thomas Keneally . The British American colony of Maryland received a larger felon quota than any other province . </P> <H2> Penal settlements ( edit ) </H2> <H3> New South Wales ( edit ) </H3> Main article : History of New South Wales The First Fleet arrives in Botany Bay , 21 January 1788 The Costumes of the Australasians : watercolour by Edward Charles Close shows the co-existence of convicts , their military gaolers , and free settlers . <P> Alternatives to the American colonies were investigated and the newly discovered and mapped East Coast of New Holland was proposed . The details provided by James Cook during his expedition to the South Pacific in 1770 made it the most suitable . </P> <P> On 18 August 1786 the decision was made to send a colonisation party of convicts , military , and civilian personnel to Botany Bay under the command of Admiral Arthur Phillip who was to be the Governor of the new colony . There were 775 convicts on board six transport ships . They were accompanied by officials , members of the crew , marines , the families thereof and their own children who together totaled 645 . In all , eleven ships were sent in what became known as the First Fleet . Other than the convict transports , there were two naval escorts and three storeships . The fleet assembled in Portsmouth and set sail on 13 May 1787 . </P> <P> The fleet arrived at Botany Bay on 20 January 1788 . It soon became clear that it would not be suitable for the establishment of a colony due to `` the openness of this bay , and the dampness of the soil , by which the people would probably be rendered unhealthy '' and Philip decided to examine Port Jackson , a bay mentioned by Captain Cook , about three leagues to the north . On 22 January a small expedition led by Phillips sailed to Port Jackson , arriving in the early afternoon : </P> <P> Here all regret arising from the former disappointments was at once obliterated ; and Governor Phillip had the satisfaction to find one of the finest harbours in the world , in which a thousand sail of the line might ride in perfect security . The different coves of this harbour were examined with all possible expedition , and the preference was given to one which had the finest spring of water , and in which ships can anchor so close to the shore , that at a very small expence quays may be constructed at which the largest vessels may unload . This cove is about half a mile in length , and a quarter of a mile across at the entrance . In honour of Lord Sydney , the Governor distinguished it by the name of Sydney Cove . </P> <P> There they established the first permanent European colony on the Australian continent , New South Wales , on 26 January . The area has since developed into the city of Sydney . This date is still celebrated as Australia Day . </P> <P> There was initially a high mortality rate amongst the members of the first fleet due mainly to shortages of food . The ships carried only enough food to provide for the settlers until they could establish agriculture in the region . Unfortunately , there were an insufficient number of skilled farmers and domesticated livestock to do this , and the colony waited for the arrival of the Second Fleet . The second fleet was an unprecedented disaster that provided little in the way of help and upon its delivery in June 1790 of still more sick and dying convicts , which actually worsened the situation in Port Jackson . </P> <P> Lieutenant - General Sir Richard Bourke was the ninth Governor of the Colony of New South Wales between 1831 and 1837 . Appalled by the excessive punishments doled out to convicts , Bourke passed ' The Magistrates Act ' , which limited the sentence a magistrate could pass to fifty lashes ( previously there was no such limit ) . Bourke 's administration was controversial , and furious magistrates and employers petitioned the crown against this interference with their legal rights , fearing that a reduction in punishments would cease to provide enough deterrence to the convicts . </P> <P> Bourke , however , was not dissuaded from his reforms and continued to create controversy within the colony by combating the inhumane treatment handed out to convicts , including limiting the number of convicts each employer was allowed to seventy , as well as granting rights to freed convicts , such as allowing the acquisition of property and service on juries . It has been argued that the suspension of convict transportation to New South Wales in 1840 can be attributed to the actions of Bourke and other men like Australian - born lawyer William Charles Wentworth . It took another 10 years , but transportation to the colony of New South Wales was finally officially abolished on 1 October 1850 . </P> <P> If a convict was well behaved , the convict could be given a ticket of leave , granting some freedom . At the end of the convict 's sentence , seven years in most cases , the convict was issued with a Certificate of Freedom . He was then free to become a settler or to return to England . Convicts who misbehaved , however , were often sent to a place of secondary punishment like Port Arthur , Tasmania or Norfolk Island , where they would suffer additional punishment and solitary confinement . </P> <H3> Norfolk Island ( edit ) </H3> Main article : History of Norfolk Island <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs expansion .

( August 2015 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> Norfolk Island military barracks <P> Within a month of the arrival of the First Fleet at Sydney Cove , a group of convicts and free settlers were sent to take control of Norfolk Island , a small island 1,412 kilometres ( 877 mi ) east of the coast of New South Wales . More convicts were sent , and many of them proved to be unruly ; early 1789 saw a failed attempt to overthrow Lieutenant Philip Gidley King , the island 's commandant . This was followed by the wreck of the HMS Sirius on one of the island 's reefs while attempting to land stores . </P> <H3> Tasmania ( edit ) </H3> Main article : History of Tasmania Penitentiary at the Port Arthur convict settlement , Tasmania <P> In 1803 , a British expedition was sent from Sydney to Tasmania ( then known as Van Diemen 's Land ) to establish a new penal colony there . The small party , led by Lt. John Bowen , established a settlement at Risdon Cove , on the eastern side of the Derwent River . Originally sent to Port Philip , but abandoned within weeks , another expedition led by Lieutenant - Colonel David Collins arrived soon after . Collins considered the Risdon Cove site inadequate , and in 1804 he established an alternative settlement on the western side of the river at Sullivan 's Cove , Tasmania . This later became known as Hobart , and the original settlement at Risdon Cove was deserted . Collins became the first Lieutenant - Governor of Van Diemen 's Land . </P> <P> When the convict station on Norfolk Island was abandoned in 1807 - 1808 , the remaining convicts and free settlers were transported to Hobart and allocated land for re-settlement . However , as the existing small population was already experiencing difficulties producing enough food , the sudden doubling of the population was almost catastrophic . </P> <P> Starting in 1816 , more free settlers began arriving from Great Britain . On 3 December 1825 Tasmania was declared a colony separate from New South Wales , with a separate administration . </P> Macquarie Harbour Penal Station , depicted by convict artist William Buelow Gould , 1833 <P> The Macquarie Harbour penal colony on the West Coast of Tasmania was established in 1820 to exploit the valuable timber Huon Pine growing there for furniture making and shipbuilding . Macquarie Harbour had the added advantage of being almost impossible to escape from , most attempts ending with the convicts either drowning , dying of starvation in the bush , or ( on at least two occasions ) turning cannibal . Convicts sent to this settlement had usually re-offended during their sentence of transportation , and were treated very harshly , labouring in cold and wet weather , and subjected to severe corporal punishment for minor infractions . </P> <P> In 1830 , the Port Arthur penal settlement was established to replace Macquarie Harbour , as it was easi\n\nQuestion:\nwhen did the first convicts go to australia\n", "answer": "1788"}

( later known as Rankin / Bass Productions ) and currently distributed by Universal Television . It first aired Sunday , December 6 , 1964 , on the NBC television network in the United States , and was sponsored by General Electric under the umbrella title of The General Electric Fantasy Hour . The special was based on the Johnny Marks song `` Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer '' which was itself based on the poem of the same name written in 1939 by Marks ' brother - in - law , Robert L. May . Since 1972 , the special has aired on CBS , with the network unveiling a high - definition , digitally remastered version of the program in 2005 . As with A Charlie Brown Christmas and How the Grinch Stole Christmas , Rudolph no longer airs just once annually , but several times during the Christmas and holiday season on CBS . Unlike other holiday specials that also air on several cable channels ( including Freeform ) , Rudolph only airs on CBS . It has been telecast every year since 1964 , making it the longest continuously running Christmas TV special in history . 2014 marked the 50th anniversary of the television special and a series of postage stamps featuring Rudolph was issued by the United States Postal Service on November 6 , 2014 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Cast </Li> <Li> 3 Production <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Aftermath </Li> <Li> 3.2 Production credits </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Different versions <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Original 1964 NBC broadcast edit </Li> <Li> 4.2 1965 -- 1997 telecasts </Li> <Li> 4.3 1998 -- CBS telecasts </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Home media </Li> <Li> 6 Soundtrack </Li> <Li> 7 Merchandise </Li> <Li> 8 Reception </Li> <Li> 9 Sequels </Li> <Li> 10 In popular culture <Ul> <Li> 10.1 Films by Corky Quakenbush </Li> <Li> 10.2 Uses in advertising </Li> <Li> 10.3 Other References </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 11 Copyright issues </Li> <Li> 12 See also </Li> <Li> 13 References </Li> <Li> 14 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> Sam the Snowman welcomes the viewers to Christmastown at the North Pole and introduces Santa and Mrs. Claus who live in a castle located north of the Christmas Tree Forest . Mrs. Claus fusses over Santa as she wants him to fatten up by Christmas Eve . Sam then recalls the year Christmas was almost cancelled due to a snowstorm and tells the story of how a very special reindeer saved the day . </P> <P> Donner , Santa 's lead reindeer , and his wife have given birth to their new baby fawn , Rudolph . Upon admiring him , they are surprised to see that Rudolph has been born with a glowing red nose . When Santa arrives , he warns Donner that Rudolph will not make the sleigh team because of his nose . Donner then decides to hide the nose by covering it with mud to allow Rudolph to fit in with all the other reindeer . </P> <P> Over Rudolph 's first year of life , Donner trains him in the basics of being a reindeer , including hiding from the Abominable Snow Monster of the North . Rudolph enters the reindeer games , competing against his fellow fawns . During flight practice , Rudolph meets a doe named Clarice who tells him he is cute , and kisses him , which causes an elated Rudolph to fly higher and faster than everyone else . However , while celebrating with the other bucks , Rudolph 's nose cover pops off , and the others react with fear , then scorn and finally rejection as Rudolph is kicked out of the Reindeer Games . Walking away , Rudolph walks with Clarice , who supports him , until her father firmly tells her to never have any more contacts with a red - nosed reindeer . Then , Rudolph meets up with Hermey , an elf who ran away from Santa 's workshop because he wanted to be a dentist instead of making toys , and they decide to run away together . The pair then meet a prospector named Yukon Cornelius , who has fruitlessly searched his whole life for silver and gold . After escaping the snow monster on an ice floe , the trio crash land on the Island of Misfit Toys where unloved or unwanted toys live with their ruler , a winged lion named King Moonracer . The king allows the group to stay one night on the island in exchange for returning to Christmastown to ask Santa to find homes for the unwanted toys . However , Rudolph leaves the island in the middle of the night on his own , fearing that his nose , which attracts the snow monster , will endanger his friends . </P> <P> Time goes by and Rudolph grows into adulthood ; he tries and fails to find a place to settle where he will be accepted despite his nose and decides to return home . There , he finds that his parents and Clarice have been looking for him for months ; he sets out once again to find them , only to discover that the snow monster has captured them . Rudolph tries to save Clarice from being eaten , but the monster hits him in the head with a stalactite , dazing him . Hermey and Yukon return to Christmastown and go to save Rudolph . Hermey , posing as a pig , lures the monster out of his cave and Yukon drops rocks on his head to knock him out . Hermey then pulls out all the monster 's teeth . Realizing Yukon drives the toothless ( and now terrified ) monster back , only to follow it over the cliff with all his pack dogs . Mourning Yukon 's presumed death , Rudolph , Hermey , Clarice , and the Donners return home where everyone apologizes to them . After hearing their story , Santa welcomes the group back to Christmastown , promises that he will find homes for the Misfit Toys , Hermey opens his own dentist 's office , and Clarice 's father apologizes for being so hard on Rudolph . Yukon then returns with a reformed snow monster ( Yukon notes that they bounce ) and demonstrates the beast 's ability to trim a Christmas tree . While everybody 's celebrating , Santa interrupts , grimly informing everyone that because of the storm , he is forced to cancel the Christmas trip . Santa is soon distracted by Rudolph 's red nose and realizes that its light could cut through the storm . He asks Rudolph to lead the sleigh and Rudolph agrees . The team then flies off to the island and pick up the toys . The special ends with Santa wishing the viewers a merry Christmas as he and Rudolph fly off into the night . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> Hermey and Rudolph <Ul> <Li> Billie Mae Richards voices Rudolph , a reindeer with strong mental ( he learns to speak shortly after birth ) and physical strength who is shunned for his nonconforming red nose , but later saves Christmas . </Li> <Li> Stan Francis voices : <Ul> <Li> Santa Claus , portrayed in the special as a moody , nervous and `` skinny Santa '' whose fears are only allayed when he conjures the idea of using Rudolph 's nose to lead the sleigh . </Li> <Li> King Moonracer , a winged lion who rules the entire Island of Misfit Toys .

This is known as the Glorious Revolution , also called the Revolution of 1688 . Locke claims in the `` Preface '' to the Two Treatises that its purpose is to justify William III 's ascension to the throne , though Peter Laslett suggests that the bulk of the writing was instead completed between 1679 -- 1680 ( and subsequently revised until Locke was driven into exile in 1683 ) . According to Laslett , Locke was writing his Two Treatises during the Exclusion Crisis , which attempted to prevent James II from ever taking the throne in the first place . Anthony Ashley - Cooper , 1st Earl of Shaftesbury , Locke 's mentor , patron and friend , introduced the bill , but it was ultimately unsuccessful . Richard Ashcraft , following in Laslett 's suggestion that the Two Treatises were written before the Revolution , objected that Shaftesbury 's party did not advocate revolution during the Exclusion Crisis . He suggests that they are instead better associated with the revolutionary conspiracies that swirled around what would come to be known as the Rye House Plot . Locke , Shaftesbury and many others were forced into exile ; some , such as Sidney , were even executed for treason . Locke knew his work was dangerous -- he never acknowledged his authorship within his lifetime . </P> <H2> Publication history ( edit ) </H2> The only edition of the Treatises published in America during the 18th century ( 1773 ) <P> Two Treatises was first published , anonymously , in December 1689 ( following printing conventions of the time , its title page was marked 1690 ) . Locke was unhappy with this edition , complaining to the publisher about its many errors . For the rest of his life , he was intent on republishing the Two Treatises in a form that better reflected his meaning . Peter Laslett , one of the foremost Locke scholars , has suggested that Locke held the printers to a higher `` standard of perfection '' than the technology of the time would permit . Be that as it may , the first edition was indeed replete with errors . The second edition was even worse , and finally printed on cheap paper and sold to the poor . The third edition was much improved , but Locke was still not satisfied . He made corrections to the third edition by hand and entrusted the publication of the fourth to his friends , as he died before it could be brought out . </P> <P> The Two Treatises begin with a Preface announcing what Locke hopes to achieve , but he also mentions that more than half of his original draft , occupying a space between the First and Second Treatises , has been irretrievably lost . Peter Laslett maintains that , while Locke may have added or altered some portions in 1689 , he did not make any revisions to accommodate for the missing section ; he argues , for example , that the end of the First Treatise breaks off in mid-sentence . </P> <P> In 1691 Two Treatises was translated into French by David Mazzel , a French Huguenot living in the Netherlands . This translation left out Locke 's `` Preface , '' all of the First Treatise , and the first chapter of the Second Treatise ( which summarised Locke 's conclusions in the First Treatise ) . It was in this form that Locke 's work was reprinted during the 18th century in France and in this form that Montesquieu , Voltaire and Rousseau were exposed to it . The only American edition from the 18th century was printed in 1773 in Boston ; it , too , left out all of these sections . There were no other American editions until the 20th century . </P> <H2> Main ideas ( edit ) </H2> <P> Two Treatises is divided into the First Treatise and the Second Treatise . The original title of the Second Treatise appears to have been simply `` Book II , '' corresponding to the title of the First Treatise , `` Book I . '' Before publication , however , Locke gave it greater prominence by ( hastily ) inserting a separate title page : `` An Essay Concerning the True Original , Extent and End of Civil Government . '' The First Treatise is focused on the refutation of Sir Robert Filmer , in particular his Patriarcha , which argued that civil society was founded on a divinely sanctioned patriarchalism . Locke proceeds through Filmer 's arguments , contesting his proofs from Scripture and ridiculing them as senseless , until concluding that no government can be justified by an appeal to the divine right of kings . </P> <P> The Second Treatise outlines a theory of civil society . Locke begins by describing the state of nature , a picture much more stable than Thomas Hobbes ' state of `` war of every man against every man , '' and argues that all men are created equal in the state of nature by God . From this , he goes on to explain the hypothetical rise of property and civilization , in the process explaining that the only legitimate governments are those that have the consent of the people . Therefore , any government that rules without the consent of the people can , in theory , be overthrown . </P> <H2> First Treatise ( edit ) </H2> Title page from Filmer 's Patriarcha ( 1680 ) <P> The First Treatise is an extended attack on Sir Robert Filmer 's Patriarcha . Locke 's argument proceeds along two lines : first , he undercuts the Scriptural support that Filmer had offered for his thesis , and second he argues that the acceptance of Filmer 's thesis can lead only to slavery ( and absurdity ) . Locke chose Filmer as his target , he says , because of his reputation and because he `` carried this Argument ( jure divino ) farthest , and is supposed to have brought it to perfection '' ( 1st Tr. , \u00a7 5 ) . </P> <P> Filmer 's text presented an argument for a divinely ordained , hereditary , absolute monarchy . According to Filmer , the Biblical Adam in his role as father possessed unlimited power over his children and this authority passed down through the generations . Locke attacks this on several grounds . Accepting that fatherhood grants authority , he argues , it would do so only by the act of begetting , and so can not be transmitted to one 's children because only God can create life . Nor is the power of a father over his children absolute , as Filmer would have it ; Locke points to the joint power parents share over their children outlined in the Bible . In the Second Treatise Locke returns to a discussion of parental power . ( Both of these discussions have drawn the interest of modern feminists such as Carole Pateman . ) </P> <P> Filmer also suggested that Adam 's absolute authority came from his ownership over all the world . To this , Locke rebuts that the world was originally held in common ( a theme that will return in the Second Treatise ) . But , even if it were not , he argues , God 's grant to Adam covered only the land and brute animals , not human beings . Nor could Adam , or his heir , leverage this grant to enslave mankind , for the law of nature forbids reducing one 's fellows to a state of desperation , if one possesses a sufficient surplus to maintain oneself securely . And even if this charity were not commanded by reason , Locke continues , such a strategy for gaining dominion would prove only that the foundation of government lies in consent . </P> <P> Locke intimates in the First Treatise that the doctrine of divine right of kings ( jure divino ) will eventually be the downfall of all governments . In his final chapter Locke asks , `` Who heir ? '' If Filmer is correct , there should be only one rightful king in all the world -- the heir of Adam . But since it is impossible to discover the true heir of Adam , no government , under Filmer 's principles , can require that its members obey its rulers . Filmer must therefore say that men are duty - bound to obey their present rulers . Locke writes : </P> <P> I think he is the first Politician , who , pretending to settle Government upon its true Basis , and to establish the Thrones of lawful Princes , ever told the World , That he was properly a King , whose Manner of Government was by Supreme Power , by what Means soever he obtained it ; which in plain English is to say , that Regal and Supreme Power is properly and truly his , who can by any Means seize upon it ; and if this be , to be properly a King , I wonder how he came to think of , or where he will find , an Usurper . ( 1st Tr. , \u00a7 79 ) </P> <P> Locke ends the First Treatise by examining the history told in the Bible and the history of the world since then ; he concludes that there is no evidence to support Filmer 's hypothesis . According to Locke , no king has ever claimed that his authority rested upon his being the heir of Adam . It is Filmer , Locke alleges , that is the innovator in politics , not those who assert the natural equality and freedom of man . </P> <H2> Second Treatise ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

( March 2008 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> In the Second Treatise Locke develops a number of notable themes . It begins with a depiction of the state of nature , wherein individuals are under no obligation to obey one another but are each themselves judge of what the law of nature requires . It also covers conquest and slavery , property , representative government , and the right of revolution . </P> <H3> State of nature ( edit ) </H3> <P> Locke defines the state of nature thus : </P> <P> To properly understand political power and trace its origins , we must consider the state that all people are in naturally . That is a state of perfect freedom of acting and disposing of their own possessions and persons as they think fit within the bounds of the law of nature . People in this state do not have to ask permission to act or depend on the will of others to arrange matters on their behalf . The natural state is also one of equality in which all power and jurisdiction is reciprocal and no one has more than another . It is evident that all human beings -- as creatures belonging to the same species and rank and born indiscriminately with all the same natural advantages and faculties -- are equal amongst themselves . They have no relationship of subordination or subjection unless God ( the lord and master of them all ) had clearly set one person above another and conferred on him an undoubted right to dominion and sovereignty . </P> <P> The work of Thomas Hobbes made theories based upon a state of nature popular in 17th - century England , even as most of those who employed such arguments were deeply troubled by his absolutist conclusions . Locke 's state of nature can be seen in light of this tradition . There is not and never has been any divinely ordained monarch over the entire world , Locke argues . However , the fact that the natural state of humanity is without an institutionalized government does not mean it is lawless . Human beings are still subject to the laws of God and nature . In contrast to Hobbes , who posited the state of nature as a hypothetical possibility , Locke takes great pains to show that such a state did indeed exist . Actually , it still exists in the area of international relations where there is not and is never likely to be any legitimate overarching government ( i.e. , one directly chosen by all the people subject to it ) . Whereas Hobbes stresses the disadvantages of the state of nature , Locke points to its good points . It is free , if full of continual dangers ( 2nd Tr. , \u00a7 123 ) . Finally , the proper alternative to the natural state is not political dictatorship / tyranny but democratically elected government and the effective protection of basic human rights to life , liberty , and property under the rule of law . </P> <P> Nobody in the natural state has the political power to tell others what to do . However , everybody has the right to authoritatively pronounce justice and administer punishment for breaches of the natural law . Thus , men are no\n", "answer": "1689"}

This is known as the Glorious Revolution , also called the Revolution of 1688 . Locke claims in the `` Preface '' to the Two Treatises that its purpose is to justify William III 's ascension to the throne , though Peter Laslett suggests that the bulk of the writing was instead completed between 1679 -- 1680 ( and subsequently revised until Locke was driven into exile in 1683 ) . According to Laslett , Locke was writing his Two Treatises during the Exclusion Crisis , which attempted to prevent James II from ever taking the throne in the first place . Anthony Ashley - Cooper , 1st Earl of Shaftesbury , Locke 's mentor , patron and friend , introduced the bill , but it was ultimately unsuccessful . Richard Ashcraft , following in Laslett 's suggestion that the Two Treatises were written before the Revolution , objected that Shaftesbury 's party did not advocate revolution during the Exclusion Crisis . He suggests that they are instead better associated with the revolutionary conspiracies that swirled around what would come to be known as the Rye House Plot . Locke , Shaftesbury and many others were forced into exile ; some , such as Sidney , were even executed for treason . Locke knew his work was dangerous -- he never acknowledged his authorship within his lifetime . </P> <H2> Publication history ( edit ) </H2> The only edition of the Treatises published in America during the 18th century ( 1773 ) <P> Two Treatises was first published , anonymously , in December 1689 ( following printing conventions of the time , its title page was marked 1690 ) . Locke was unhappy with this edition , complaining to the publisher about its many errors . For the rest of his life , he was intent on republishing the Two Treatises in a form that better reflected his meaning . Peter Laslett , one of the foremost Locke scholars , has suggested that Locke held the printers to a higher `` standard of perfection '' than the technology of the time would permit . Be that as it may , the first edition was indeed replete with errors . The second edition was even worse , and finally printed on cheap paper and sold to the poor . The third edition was much improved , but Locke was still not satisfied . He made corrections to the third edition by hand and entrusted the publication of the fourth to his friends , as he died before it could be brought out . </P> <P> The Two Treatises begin with a Preface announcing what Locke hopes to achieve , but he also mentions that more than half of his original draft , occupying a space between the First and Second Treatises , has been irretrievably lost . Peter Laslett maintains that , while Locke may have added or altered some portions in 1689 , he did not make any revisions to accommodate for the missing section ; he argues , for example , that the end of the First Treatise breaks off in mid-sentence . </P> <P> In 1691 Two Treatises was translated into French by David Mazzel , a French Huguenot living in the Netherlands . This translation left out Locke 's `` Preface , '' all of the First Treatise , and the first chapter of the Second Treatise ( which summarised Locke 's conclusions in the First Treatise ) . It was in this form that Locke 's work was reprinted during the 18th century in France and in this form that Montesquieu , Voltaire and Rousseau were exposed to it . The only American edition from the 18th century was printed in 1773 in Boston ; it , too , left out all of these sections . There were no other American editions until the 20th century . </P> <H2> Main ideas ( edit ) </H2> <P> Two Treatises is divided into the First Treatise and the Second Treatise . The original title of the Second Treatise appears to have been simply `` Book II , '' corresponding to the title of the First Treatise , `` Book I . '' Before publication , however , Locke gave it greater prominence by ( hastily ) inserting a separate title page : `` An Essay Concerning the True Original , Extent and End of Civil Government . '' The First Treatise is focused on the refutation of Sir Robert Filmer , in particular his Patriarcha , which argued that civil society was founded on a divinely sanctioned patriarchalism . Locke proceeds through Filmer 's arguments , contesting his proofs from Scripture and ridiculing them as senseless , until concluding that no government can be justified by an appeal to the divine right of kings . </P> <P> The Second Treatise outlines a theory of civil society . Locke begins by describing the state of nature , a picture much more stable than Thomas Hobbes ' state of `` war of every man against every man , '' and argues that all men are created equal in the state of nature by God . From this , he goes on to explain the hypothetical rise of property and civilization , in the process explaining that the only legitimate governments are those that have the consent of the people . Therefore , any government that rules without the consent of the people can , in theory , be overthrown . </P> <H2> First Treatise ( edit ) </H2> Title page from Filmer 's Patriarcha ( 1680 ) <P> The First Treatise is an extended attack on Sir Robert Filmer 's Patriarcha . Locke 's argument proceeds along two lines : first , he undercuts the Scriptural support that Filmer had offered for his thesis , and second he argues that the acceptance of Filmer 's thesis can lead only to slavery ( and absurdity ) . Locke chose Filmer as his target , he says , because of his reputation and because he `` carried this Argument ( jure divino ) farthest , and is supposed to have brought it to perfection '' ( 1st Tr. , \u00a7 5 ) . </P> <P> Filmer 's text presented an argument for a divinely ordained , hereditary , absolute monarchy . According to Filmer , the Biblical Adam in his role as father possessed unlimited power over his children and this authority passed down through the generations . Locke attacks this on several grounds . Accepting that fatherhood grants authority , he argues , it would do so only by the act of begetting , and so can not be transmitted to one 's children because only God can create life . Nor is the power of a father over his children absolute , as Filmer would have it ; Locke points to the joint power parents share over their children outlined in the Bible . In the Second Treatise Locke returns to a discussion of parental power . ( Both of these discussions have drawn the interest of modern feminists such as Carole Pateman . ) </P> <P> Filmer also suggested that Adam 's absolute authority came from his ownership over all the world . To this , Locke rebuts that the world was originally held in common ( a theme that will return in the Second Treatise ) . But , even if it were not , he argues , God 's grant to Adam covered only the land and brute animals , not human beings . Nor could Adam , or his heir , leverage this grant to enslave mankind , for the law of nature forbids reducing one 's fellows to a state of desperation , if one possesses a sufficient surplus to maintain oneself securely . And even if this charity were not commanded by reason , Locke continues , such a strategy for gaining dominion would prove only that the foundation of government lies in consent . </P> <P> Locke intimates in the First Treatise that the doctrine of divine right of kings ( jure divino ) will eventually be the downfall of all governments . In his final chapter Locke asks , `` Who heir ? '' If Filmer is correct , there should be only one rightful king in all the world -- the heir of Adam . But since it is impossible to discover the true heir of Adam , no government , under Filmer 's principles , can require that its members obey its rulers . Filmer must therefore say that men are duty - bound to obey their present rulers . Locke writes : </P> <P> I think he is the first Politician , who , pretending to settle Government upon its true Basis , and to establish the Thrones of lawful Princes , ever told the World , That he was properly a King , whose Manner of Government was by Supreme Power , by what Means soever he obtained it ; which in plain English is to say , that Regal and Supreme Power is properly and truly his , who can by any Means seize upon it ; and if this be , to be properly a King , I wonder how he came to think of , or where he will find , an Usurper . ( 1st Tr. , \u00a7 79 ) </P> <P> Locke ends the First Treatise by examining the history told in the Bible and the history of the world since then ; he concludes that there is no evidence to support Filmer 's hypothesis . According to Locke , no king has ever claimed that his authority rested upon his being the heir of Adam . It is Filmer , Locke alleges , that is the innovator in politics , not those who assert the natural equality and freedom of man . </P> <H2> Second Treatise ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( March 2008 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> In the Second Treatise Locke develops a number of notable themes . It begins with a depiction of the state of nature , wherein individuals are under no obligation to obey one another but are each themselves judge of what the law of nature requires . It also covers conquest and slavery , property , representative government , and the right of revolution . </P> <H3> State of nature ( edit ) </H3> <P> Locke defines the state of nature thus : </P> <P> To properly understand political power and trace its origins , we must consider the state that all people are in naturally . That is a state of perfect freedom of acting and disposing of their own possessions and persons as they think fit within the bounds of the law of nature . People in this state do not have to ask permission to act or depend on the will of others to arrange matters on their behalf . The natural state is also one of equality in which all power and jurisdiction is reciprocal and no one has more than another . It is evident that all human beings -- as creatures belonging to the same species and rank and born indiscriminately with all the same natural advantages and faculties -- are equal amongst themselves . They have no relationship of subordination or subjection unless God ( the lord and master of them all ) had clearly set one person above another and conferred on him an undoubted right to dominion and sovereignty . </P> <P> The work of Thomas Hobbes made theories based upon a state of nature popular in 17th - century England , even as most of those who employed such arguments were deeply troubled by his absolutist conclusions . Locke 's state of nature can be seen in light of this tradition . There is not and never has been any divinely ordained monarch over the entire world , Locke argues . However , the fact that the natural state of humanity is without an institutionalized government does not mean it is lawless . Human beings are still subject to the laws of God and nature . In contrast to Hobbes , who posited the state of nature as a hypothetical possibility , Locke takes great pains to show that such a state did indeed exist . Actually , it still exists in the area of international relations where there is not and is never likely to be any legitimate overarching government ( i.e. , one directly chosen by all the people subject to it ) . Whereas Hobbes stresses the disadvantages of the state of nature , Locke points to its good points . It is free , if full of continual dangers ( 2nd Tr. , \u00a7 123 ) . Finally , the proper alternative to the natural state is not political dictatorship / tyranny but democratically elected government and the effective protection of basic human rights to life , liberty , and property under the rule of law . </P> <P> Nobody in the natural state has the political power to tell others what to do . However , everybody has the right to authoritatively pronounce justice and administer punishment for breaches of the natural law .

ECW closed when then - owner Paul Heyman declared bankruptcy in April 2001 . The promotion showcased various international styles of professional wrestling , ranging from lucha libre to puroresu and hardcore wrestling , and became known for having an intelligent , often rowdy and vocal fanbase that rejected the more cartoonish programming of ECW 's competitors . </P> <P> After purchasing the assets of ECW in 2003 , World Wrestling Entertainment relaunched the Extreme Championship Wrestling franchise as a third brand with their existing Raw and SmackDown brands .

ECW would , in fact , continue to use the former Tri-State Heavyweight championship belt to represent its own Championship , although the ECW title was not considered a continuation of that title . In 1992 , Goodhart sold his share of the company to his partner , Tod Gordon , who in return renamed the promotion Eastern Championship Wrestling . When Eastern Championship Wrestling was founded , it was a member of the National Wrestling Alliance ( NWA ) . At the time , `` Hot Stuff '' Eddie Gilbert was the lead booker of Eastern Championship Wrestling . Gilbert , after a falling out with Tod Gordon , was replaced in September 1993 by Paul Heyman . Heyman , known on television as Paul E. Dangerously , had just left World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) and was looking for a new challenge . </P> Eastern Championship Wrestling logo . <H3> Secession from the NWA ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1994 , Jim Crockett 's non-compete agreement with Ted Turner , who purchased World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) from Crockett in November 1988 , was up and he decided to start promoting with the NWA again . Crockett went to Tod Gordon and asked him to hold a tournament for the NWA 's top prize , the NWA World Heavyweight Championship , in ECW 's home area of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania on August 27 , 1994 . NWA President Dennis Coralluzzo alleged that Crockett and Gordon were going to try to monopolize the title ( akin to Crockett 's actions in the 1980s ) and stated Crockett did not have the NWA board 's approval , which resulted in Coralluzzo personally overseeing the tournament . Gordon took offense at Coralluzzo for his power plays and began contemplating a plan to secede ECW from the NWA through a controversial and public manner that would attract attention to ECW and insult the NWA organization . Gordon planned to have Shane Douglas , who was scheduled to face 2 Cold Scorpio in the tournament finals , throw down the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt upon winning as an act of defiance . </P> <P> Tod Gordon and Paul Heyman originally planned the idea of throwing down the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt . Heyman persuaded Douglas by noting that the negative would only be that NWA traditionalists would just see them as traitors to tradition . Adding to Douglas ' decision was the animosity between Douglas and NWA President Dennis Coralluzzo , who at the time publicly criticized Douglas and told NWA affiliated bookers not to book Douglas for shows . Coralluzzo believed that Douglas was a `` bad risk '' and had the tendency to no - show events . Douglas ultimately decided to go through with Gordon and Heyman 's plan , inspired by his father 's motto of `` doing right by the people that do right by you . '' After looking up and saying , `` This is it tonight , Dad , '' Douglas threw down the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt , stating that he did not want to be champion of a `` dead promotion '' that `` died seven years ago . '' He then raised the Eastern Championship Wrestling title belt and declared it to be a World Heavyweight Championship -- calling it the only real world title left in professional wrestling . When recalling this event years later , Paul Heyman stated the following in a 1998 chat : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` </Td> <Td> The National Wrestling Alliance was old - school when old - school was n't hip anymore . We wanted to set our mark , we wanted to breakaway from the pack , we wanted to let the world know that we were n't just some independent promotion . </Td> <Td> '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Coralluzzo was interviewed after the event and declared that Douglas would be the world champion of the NWA `` whether he likes it or not '' , calling Douglas ' actions a `` disgrace '' and said he would move to have Douglas stripped of both the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and the Eastern Championship Wrestling Heavyweight Championship , calling him `` undeserving '' of both titles . Gordon made the following announcement on the next edition of NWA - ECW programming : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` </Td> <Td> I listened with great interest as the representative of the NWA board of directors took it upon himself to inform you that they have the power to force NWA - Eastern Championship Wrestling not to recognize The Franchise , Shane Douglas , as a world heavyweight champion . Well , as of noon today , I have folded NWA - Eastern Championship Wrestling . In its place will be ECW - Extreme Championship Wrestling - and we recognize The Franchise , Shane Douglas , as our World Heavyweight Champion . And we encourage any wrestler in the world today to come to the ECW to challenge for that belt . This is the ECW , Extreme Championship Wrestling , changing the face of professional wrestling . </Td> <Td> '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The promotion showcased many different styles of professional wrestling , including hardcore wrestling matches as well as lucha libre and Japanese wrestling styles . </P> <H3> ECW Arena and television syndication ( edit ) </H3> See also : ECW Hardcore TV <P> The bulk of ECW 's shows remained at the ECW Arena , a former warehouse secluded under a section of Interstate 95 . Seating comprised simple folding chairs and four sets of portable bleachers , and the whole sort of unconventional set up reflected the gritty style of the wrestling itself . Shows were actually broadcast on a Philadelphia local cable sports station ( SportsChannel America 's local affiliate , SportsChannel Philadelphia ) on Tuesday evenings . After Sports Channel Philadelphia went off the air in 1997 , the show moved to WPPX - TV 61 . It later moved to a former independent broadcast station ( WGTW 48 ) in Philadelphia on either Friday or Saturday night at 1 or 2 a.m. Shows were also aired on the MSG Network in NYC on Friday nights ( Early Saturday morning ) at 2 a.m. Due to the obscurity of the stations and ECW itself , as well as the lack of FCC oversight at that late hour , many times expletives and violence were not edited out of these showings , along with extensive use of copyrighted music and music videos . </P> <H3> Paul Heyman and cross promotion ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1995 , Tod Gordon sold ECW to his head booker , Paul Heyman . Afterward , Gordon remained in ECW as a figurehead commissioner . Years after being the ECW `` Commissioner '' , Gordon left ECW , his absence was explained on - air that he retired from wrestling due to family . Rumors circulate , however , that Gordon was fired by Heyman after he was suspected as a `` locker room mole '' for a rival wrestling promotion , helping to lure talent to World Championship Wrestling . Many years later , in an interview , Gordon claims that the `` WCW mole '' situation was nothing more than a work . </P> <P> Storyline-wise , Vince McMahon first became `` aware '' of ECW while at the 1995 King of the Ring event in ECW 's home base of Philadelphia . During the match between Mabel and Savio Vega , the crowd suddenly started to angrily chant , `` ECW ECW ECW ! '' . On September 22 , 1996 , at the In Your House : Mind Games event in Philadelphia , ECW stars The Sandman , Tommy Dreamer , Paul Heyman , and Tazz were in the front row with Sandman even interfering in one match ( when he threw beer on Savio Vega during his strap match with Bradshaw ) . McMahon acknowledged ECW 's status as a local , up and coming promotion on the air . The following night on WWF Monday Night RAW , broadcast on September 23 , 1996 , at the onset of a match between The Bodydonnas vs. The British Bulldog and Owen Hart , Bill Alfonso , and Tazz could be seen invading the program . Both Tazz and Alfonso were able to successfully jump the security rails , and Tazz was able to prominently display a bright orange sign with black lettering that read `` Sabu Fears Tazz - ECW '' . On February 24 , 1997 , ECW `` invaded '' Raw from the Manhattan Center . They advanced a storyline , plugged their first ever pay - per - view and worked three matches in front of the WWF audience while McMahon called the action with both Jerry `` The King '' Lawler and Paul Heyman . The Manhattan Center in New York was peppered with a large number of ECW fans , who gave the WWF wrestlers `` Boring ! '' chants when they felt it was warranted . Likewise , when the ECW performers arrived , they popped and introduced the WWF Monday night audience to some trademark ECW group chants . This invasion sparked an inter-promotional feud between ECW and Lawler 's United States Wrestling Association . Lawler disparaged ECW on - camera and convinced wrestlers such as Rob Van Dam and Sabu to join him in an anti-ECW crusade . Throughout 1997 , ECW wrestlers appeared on USWA television programs , and vice versa . As part of the working relationship between ECW and the WWF , a number of WWF - contracted wrestlers were sent to ECW for seasoning in 1997 , including Droz and Brakkus . </P> <P> On April 13 , 1997 ECW broadcast their first pay - per - view ( PPV ) wrestling card Barely Legal , highlighted by Terry Funk defeating Raven to win the ECW World Heavyweight Championship . In June 1997 , the company 's Wrestlepalooza ' 97 event featured Raven 's final ECW match before leaving for WCW . In this match , Tommy Dreamer finally beat Raven , his longtime nemesis . Dreamer 's celebration was short - lived , though , as Jerry Lawler , along with Sabu and Rob Van Dam showed up to attack Dreamer . This set up a match between Dreamer and Lawler at the pay - per - view , 1997 Hardcore Heaven , on August 1\n\nQuestion:\nwhen did ecw change to extreme championship wrestling\n", "answer": "1992"}

Early directors included Willem Verhulst and Peter Minuit . Willem Kieft became director in 1638 but five years later was embroiled in Kieft 's War against the Native Americans . The Pavonia Massacre , across the Hudson River in present - day Jersey City , resulted in the death of 80 natives in February 1643 . Following the massacre , Algonquian tribes joined forces and nearly defeated the Dutch . Holland sent additional forces to the aid of Kieft , leading to the overwhelming defeat of the Native Americans and a peace treaty on August 29 , 1645 . </P> <P> On May 27 , 1647 , Peter Stuyvesant was inaugurated as director general upon his arrival and ruled as a member of the Dutch Reformed Church . The colony was granted self - government in 1652 , and New Amsterdam was incorporated as a city on February 2 , 1653 . The first mayors ( burgemeesters ) of New Amsterdam , Arent van Hattem and Martin Cregier , were appointed in that year . </P> <H3> British rule and Revolution : 1664 -- 1783 ( edit ) </H3> New Amsterdam in 1664 <P> In 1664 , the English conquered the area and renamed it `` New York '' after the Duke of York , ending the brief 40 - year period of Dutch rule for 120 years of English and British administration as a colony of the Kingdom of England and later of Great Britain . At that time , people of African descent made up 20 % of the population of the city , with European settlers a large proportion of remaining Dutch citizens among the English , Scots , Welsh , and Irish numbering in total approximately 1,500 and people of African descent numbering 375 ( with 300 enslaved and 75 free ) . ( Although it has been claimed that African slaves comprised 40 % of the small population of the city at that time , this claim has not been substantiated . ) During the mid 17th century , farms of free blacks covered 130 acres ( 53 ha ) where Washington Square Park later developed . The Dutch briefly regained the city in 1673 , renaming the city `` New Orange '' , before permanently ceding the colony of New Netherland to the English for what is now Suriname in November 1674 . Some place names originated in the Dutch period and were named after places in the Netherlands , most notably Flushing ( Dutch town of Vlissingen ) , Harlem ( Dutch town of Haarlem ) , and Brooklyn ( Dutch town of Breukelen ) . Few buildings , however , remain from the 17th century . The oldest recorded house still in existence in New York City , the Pieter Claesen Wyckoff House in Brooklyn , dates from 1652 . </P> <P> The new British rulers of the formerly Dutch New Amsterdam and New Netherland renamed the settlement New York . The colony benefited enormously within the burgeoning global British Empire and its population grew exponentially and prospered . The Bolting Act of 1678 , whereby no mill outside the city was permitted to grind wheat or corn , boosted growth until its repeal in 1694 , increasing the number of houses over the period from 384 to 983 . </P> <P> In the context of the Glorious Revolution in England , Jacob Leisler led Leisler 's Rebellion and effectively controlled the city and surrounding areas from 1689 -- 1691 , before being arrested and executed . </P> View of New York Harbor , c. 1770 <P> By 1700 , the Lenape population of New York had diminished to 200 . The Dutch West Indies Company transported African slaves to the post as trading laborers used to build the fort and stockade , and some gained freedom under the Dutch . After the British took over the colony and city in 1664 , they continued to import slaves from Africa and the Caribbean . In 1703 , 42 % of the New York households had slaves ; they served as domestic servants and laborers but also became involved in skilled trades , shipping and other fields . Yet following reform in ethics according to British Enlightenment thought this had diminished to less than 25 % by the 1770s slaves made up less than 25 % of the population </P> <P> By the 1740s , 20 % of the residents of New York were slaves , totaling about 2,500 people . </P> <P> After a series of fires in 1741 , the city became panicked that blacks planned to burn the city in conspiracy with some poor whites . Historians believe their alarm was mostly fabrication and fear , but officials rounded up 31 blacks and 4 whites , who over a period of months were convicted of arson . Of these , the city executed 13 blacks by burning them alive and hanged 4 whites and 18 blacks . </P> <P> In 1754 , Columbia University was founded under charter by George II of Great Britain as King 's College in Lower Manhattan . </P> <H3> American Revolution ( edit ) </H3> George Washington enters New York in triumph following the British evacuation of America . <P> The Stamp Act and other British measures fomented dissent , particularly among Sons of Liberty who maintained a long - running skirmish with locally stationed British troops over Liberty Poles from 1766 to 1776 . The Stamp Act Congress met in New York City in 1765 in the first organized resistance to British authority across the colonies . After the major defeat of the Continental Army in the Battle of Long Island in late 1776 , General George Washington withdrew to Manhattan Island , but with the subsequent defeat at the Battle of Fort Washington the island was effectively left to the British . The city became a haven for loyalist refugees , becoming a British stronghold for the entire war . Consequently , the area also became the focal point for Washington 's espionage and intelligence - gathering throughout the war . </P> <P> New York City was greatly damaged twice by fires of suspicious origin during British military rule . The city became the political and military center of operations for the British in North America for the remainder of the war and a haven for Loyalist refugees . Continental Army officer Nathan Hale was hanged in Manhattan for espionage . In addition , the British began to hold the majority of captured American prisoners of war aboard prison ships in Wallabout Bay , across the East River in Brooklyn . More Americans lost their lives from neglect aboard these ships than died in all the battles of the war . British occupation lasted until November 25 , 1783 . George Washington triumphantly returned to the city that day , as the last British forces left the city . </P> <H3> Federal and early America : 1784 -- 1854 ( edit ) </H3> Main article : History of New York City ( 1784 -- 1854 ) Norman Friend .

In 1789 , New York City became the first national capital of the United States under the new United States Constitution . The Constitution also created the current Congress of the United States , and its first sitting was at Federal Hall on Wall Street . The first United States Supreme Court sat there . The United States Bill of Rights was drafted and ratified there . George Washington was inaugurated at Federal Hall . New York City remained the capital of the U.S. until 1790 , when the role was transferred to Philadelphia . </P> <P> During the 19th century , the city was transformed by immigration , a visionary development proposal called the Commissioners ' Plan of 1811 which expanded the city street grid to encompass all of Manhattan , and the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 , which connected the Atlantic port to the vast agricultural markets of the Midwestern United States and Canada . By 1835 , New York City had surpassed Philadelphia as the largest city in the United States .

Together with its growing immigrant population , which was angry about conscription , sympathies among residents were divided for both the Union and Confederacy at the outbreak of war . Tensions related to the war culminated in the Draft Riots of 1863 by ethnic white immigrants , who attacked black neighborhood and abolitionist homes . Many blacks left the city and moved to Brooklyn . After the Civil War , the rate of immigration from Europe grew steeply , and New York became the first stop for millions seeking a new and better life in the United States , a role acknowledged by the dedication of the Statue of Liberty in 1886 . </P> <H3> Early 20th century : 1898 -- 1945 ( edit ) </H3> Main article : History of New York City ( 1898 -- 1945 ) See also : List of former municipalities in New York City New York 's Singer Building was the world 's tallest building when completed in 1908 .

The skyscrapers and tourist attractions were widely publicized . Suburbs existed , but they were largely bedroom communities for commuters to the central city . San Francisco dominated the West , Atlanta dominated the South , Boston dominated New England ; Chicago , the nation 's railroad hub , dominated the Midwest United States ; however , New York City dominated the entire nation in terms of communications , trade , finance , popular culture , and high culture . More than a fourth of the 300 largest corporations in 1920 were headquartered in New York City . </P> <P> In 1898 , the modern City of New York was formed with the consolidation of Brooklyn ( until then an independent city ) , Manhattan , and outlying areas . Manhattan and the Bronx were established as two separate boroughs and joined together with three other boroughs created from parts of adjacent counties to form the new municipal government originally called `` Greater New York '' . The Borough of Brooklyn incorporated the independent City of Brooklyn , recently joined to Manhattan by the Brooklyn Bridge ; the Borough of Queens was created from western Queens County ( with the remnant established as Nassau County in 1899 ) ; and the Borough of Richmond contained all of Richmond County . Municipal governments contained within the boroughs were abolished , and the county governmental functions were absorbed by the city or each borough . In 1914 , the New York State Legislature created Bronx County , making five counties coterminous with the five boroughs . </P> <P> The Bronx had a steady boom period during 1898 -- 1929 , with a population growth by a factor of six from 200,000 in 1900 to 1.3 million in 1930 . The Great Depression created a surge of unemployment , especially among the working class , and a slow - down of growth . </P> <P> On June 15 , 1904 , over 1,000 people , mostly German immigrant women and children , were killed when the excursion steamship General Slocum caught fire and sank . It is the city 's worst maritime disaster . On March 25 , 1911 , the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire in Greenwich Village took the lives of 146 garment workers . In response , the city made great advancements in the fire department , building codes , and workplace regulations . </P> <P> Throughout the first half of the 20th century , the city became a world center for industry , commerce , and communication , marking its rising influence with such events as the Hudson - Fulton Celebration of 1909 .

In 2011 , Statistics Canada reported approximately 2 million people identifying as adherents . The United Church was founded in 1925 as a merger of four Protestant denominations with a total combined membership of about 600,000 members : the Methodist Church , Canada , the Congregational Union of Ontario and Quebec , two - thirds of the congregations of the Presbyterian Church in Canada , and the Association of Local Union Churches , a movement predominantly of the Canadian Prairie provinces . The Canadian Conference of the Evangelical United Brethren Church joined the United Church of Canada on January 1 , 1968 . </P> <P> Membership peaked in 1964 at 1.1 million , and has declined since that time . From 1991 to 2001 , the number of people claiming an affiliation with the United Church decreased by 8 % , the third largest decrease in mainstream Christian denominations in Canada . Church statistics for the end of 2014 showed 413,717 members in 327,847 households under pastoral care . As of December 31 , 2016 , 132,459 people attend services in 2,141 communities of faith representing 2,834 congregations on a regular basis . </P> <P> The United Church has a `` council - based '' structure , where each council ( congregational , regional , or denominational ) have specific responsibilities . In some areas , each of these councils have sole authority , while in others , approval of other councils is required before action is taken . ( For example , a congregation requires regional council approval before a minister can be called or appointed to the congregation . ) The policies of the church are inclusive and liberal : there are no restrictions of gender , sexual orientation or marital status for a person considering entering the ministry ; interfaith marriages are recognized ; communion is offered to all Christian adults and children , regardless of denomination or age . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Governance and structure <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Moderator </Li> <Li> 1.2 Governance structure </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Ministry </Li> <Li> 3 Beliefs and practices <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Bible </Li> <Li> 3.2 Sacraments <Ul> <Li> 3.2. 1 Communion </Li> <Li> 3.2. 2 Baptism </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3.3 Inclusiveness </Li> <Li> 3.4 Marriage </Li> <Li> 3.5 Interfaith relations </Li> <Li> 3.6 Abortion </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Membership <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Benefits of membership </Li> <Li> 4.2 Transfer of membership and removal from rolls </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 History <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Inauguration </Li> <Li> 5.2 Crest </Li> <Li> 5.3 1930s </Li> <Li> 5.4 1940s </Li> <Li> 5.5 1950s </Li> <Li> 5.6 1960s </Li> <Li> 5.7 1970s </Li> <Li> 5.8 1980s </Li> <Li> 5.9 1990s </Li> <Li> 5.10 2000s </Li> <Li> 5.11 2010s </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Music </Li> <Li> 7 Public positions and policies <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Indigenous people </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 Criticism from outside the church </Li> <Li> 9 References </Li> <Li> 10 Further reading </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Governance and structure ( edit ) </H2> <P> The rules for governance are set out in The Manual , first written in 1925 , and updated on a regular basis . </P> <H3> Moderator ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Moderator of the United Church of Canada <P> The voice and face of the church is the Moderator , who is elected to a three - year term at each General Council .

There are two `` streams '' , ordered ministry and lay ministry . Ordered ministry includes ordained ministers and diaconal ministers . Lay ministry refers to licensed lay ministers , designated lay ministers ( DLM ) and congregational designated ministers ( CDM ) . There are no restrictions on gender , sexual orientation , age , or marital status for any branches of ministry . </P> <H2> Beliefs and practices ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Bible ( edit ) </H3> <P> The United Church believes that the Bible is central to the Christian faith and was written by people who were inspired by God . The church also believes that the circumstances under which the books of the Bible were written were of a particular place and time , and some things can not be reconciled with our lives today , such as slavery . The United Church of Canada uses the historical - critical method of interpreting the bible . </P> <H3> Sacraments ( edit ) </H3> <P> The two sacraments of the United Church are Communion and Baptism . </P> Communion ( edit ) <P> Communion is the ritual sharing of the elements of bread and wine ( or , more commonly , grape juice ) as a remembrance of the Last Supper that Jesus shared with his followers . It is usually celebrated at a table at the front of the sanctuary , where the minister blesses the elements before they are distributed to the congregation . There is no restriction regarding age or United Church membership -- Communion is open to young children as well as Christians from other denominations . The actual distribution can take several forms , including passing a tray of bread cubes and another tray of small juice glasses from person to person , and then eating the bread and drinking the juice in unison ; and `` intinction '' , where each person takes a piece of bread , dips it into a cup of juice and then eats the juice - soaked bread . </P> <P> There is no guideline for frequency . Some congregations celebrate communion once a month , others on a quarterly basis . </P> Baptism ( edit ) <P> The belief of the United Church is that baptism is not a requirement for God 's love ; it is not considered a passport to heaven , nor does the church believe that those who die unbaptised are condemned or damned for eternity . Rather , the church believes that baptism is the first step in church membership , where the parents make a profession of faith on behalf of the infant in the hope that their child will later confirm that profession at or around the age of 13 . </P> <P> The United Church practices infant baptism , but in cases where a person was not baptised as an infant , baptism can be performed at any age . In the case of infant baptism , the parents of the infant , before the congregation , agree to a series of statements about the beliefs of the United Church on behalf of their child . They also promise to encourage the child to seek full membership at an appropriate time . The members of the congregation also promise the parents that they will help to raise the child in a Christian community . The minister then places water on the candidate 's head three times ( expressing the Trinity of Father , Son and Holy Spirit ) and traces a cross on the person 's forehead with water . Baptism by immersion is also an option for adults who request it . </P> <P> In the 1970s , the United Church reached an ecumenical agreement with the Presbyterian , Lutheran , Catholic , and Anglican churches in Canada that baptisms within these churches are mutually recognized as valid . Further to that , the United Church recognizes the validity of any baptism by another denomination that was performed with water and in the name of the Father , Son and Holy Spirit . </P> <H3> Inclusiveness ( edit ) </H3> <P> Remembering that Jesus was reported to have welcomed tax collectors , prostitutes and other `` undesirables '' to his table , the church attempts to welcome everyone , regardless of age , race , class , gender , sexual orientation , or physical ability . In the same manner , there is also no restriction on those interested in entering ministry . </P> <H3> Marriage ( edit ) </H3> <P> Believing that marriage is a celebration of God 's love , the church recognizes and celebrates all legal marriages , including same - sex couples , previously divorced people , and couples of different religions . The actual policy of whom to marry is left up to the church council of each community of faith . For instance , one congregation might not allow same - sex marriages to be performed in their building , while another allows all marriages regardless of sexual orientation . </P> <H3> Interfaith relations ( edit ) </H3> <P> The church believes that there are many paths to God . The United Church 's path is through Jesus Christ , but the church also recognizes that Christians ' understanding of this is limited by an incomplete comprehension of God ; their belief is that the Holy Spirit of God is also at work through other non-Christian faiths . </P> <H3> Abortion ( edit ) </H3> <P> The church supports the right of women to have access to safe abortions that are covered by provincial health care , but also supports better access to contraception , sexual education , and counselling that might eventually make abortion unnecessary . </P> <H2> Membership ( edit ) </H2> <P> A full member is one who has been baptised , either as infant , child , youth or adult , and has made a public profession of faith before the congregation . Membership is not required in order to worship at a United Church , and many who regularly attend worship are adherents rather than members . </P> <P> In order to become a full member , a person goes through a process called `` confirmation '' . This is offered to adults ( starting at around age 13 ) and usually involves a series of classes about the beliefs of the United Church . Following this , the candidate makes a public profession of faith before the congregation , thereby `` confirming '' the statements made by his or her parents during baptism . If the person is unbaptised , the minister baptises the person before the profession of faith . The new member 's name is then entered on the official Roll of Members for that congregation . </P> <H3> Benefits of membership ( edit ) </H3> <P> Only members can be a part of a congregation 's board or council , and only members can vote on spiritual matters at congregational meetings -- usually whether to issue a `` call '' to a new minister to join the congregation . ( On temporal matters -- those that deal with finances , property , etc. -- a motion is usually made at the start of a congregational meeting to allow all who are present , rather than just members , the right to vote . ) </P> <H3> Transfer of membership and removal from rolls ( edit ) </H3> <P> Although confirmation takes place at the congregational level , the person is a member of the entire United Church of Canada , not just one congregation ; therefore membership can be transferred freely from congregation to congregation . </P> <P> A congregation may remove members from i\n", "answer": "1925"}

Il Duomo di Firenze , as it is ordinarily called , was begun in 1296 in the Gothic style with the design of Arnolfo di Cambio and completed structurally in 1436 with the dome engineered by Filippo Brunelleschi . The exterior of the basilica is faced with polychrome marble panels in various shades of green and pink bordered by white and has an elaborate 19th - century Gothic Revival fa\u00e7ade by Emilio De Fabris . </P> <P> The cathedral complex , located in Piazza del Duomo , includes the Baptistery and Giotto 's Campanile . These three buildings are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site covering the historic centre of Florence and are a major attraction to tourists visiting Tuscany .

The ancient structure , founded in the early 5th century and having undergone many repairs , was crumbling with age , according to the 14th - century Nuova Cronica of Giovanni Villani , and was no longer large enough to serve the growing population of the city . Other major Tuscan cities had undertaken ambitious reconstructions of their cathedrals during the Late Medieval period , such as Pisa and particularly Siena where the enormous proposed extensions were never completed . </P> Giotto 's bell tower ( campanile ) <P> The new church was designed by Arnolfo di Cambio and approved by city council in 1294 . Di Cambio was also architect of the church of Santa Croce and the Palazzo Vecchio . He designed three wide naves ending under the octagonal dome , with the middle nave covering the area of Santa Reparata . The first stone was laid on September 9 , 1296 , by Cardinal Valeriana , the first papal legate ever sent to Florence . The building of this vast project was to last 140 years ; Arnolfo 's plan for the eastern end , although maintained in concept , was greatly expanded in size . </P> The Duomo , as if completed , in a fresco by Andrea di Bonaiuto , painted in the 1360s , before the commencement of the dome <P> After Arnolfo died in 1310 , work on the cathedral slowed for thirty years . When the relics of Saint Zenobius were discovered in 1330 in Santa Reparata , the project gained a new impetus . In 1331 , the Arte della Lana , the guild of wool merchants , took over patronage for the construction of the cathedral and in 1334 appointed Giotto to oversee the work . Assisted by Andrea Pisano , Giotto continued di Cambio 's design . His major accomplishment was the building of the campanile . When Giotto died the January 8th of 1337 , Andrea Pisano continued the building until work was halted due to the Black Death in 1348 . </P> <P> In 1349 , work resumed on the cathedral under a series of architects , starting with Francesco Talenti , who finished the campanile and enlarged the overall project to include the apse and the side chapels . In 1359 , Talenti was succeeded by Giovanni di Lapo Ghini ( 1360 -- 1369 ) who divided the center nave in four square bays . Other architects were Alberto Arnoldi , Giovanni d'Ambrogio , Neri di Fioravante and Andrea Orcagna . By 1375 , the old church Santa Reparata was pulled down . The nave was finished by 1380 , and by 1418 , only the dome remained incomplete . </P> Procession outside the cathedral during the 18th century <P> On 18 August 1418 , the Arte della Lana announced an architectural design competition for erecting Neri 's dome . The two main competitors were two master goldsmiths , Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi , the latter of whom was supported by Cosimo de Medici . Ghiberti had been the winner of a competition for a pair of bronze doors for the Baptistery in 1401 and lifelong competition between the two remained sharp . Brunelleschi won and received the commission . </P> <P> Ghiberti , appointed coadjutator , drew a salary equal to Brunelleschi 's and , though neither was awarded the announced prize of 200 florins , was promised equal credit , although he spent most of his time on other projects . When Brunelleschi became ill , or feigned illness , the project was briefly in the hands of Ghiberti . But Ghiberti soon had to admit that the whole project was beyond him . In 1423 , Brunelleschi was back in charge and took over sole responsibility . </P> <P> Work started on the dome in 1420 and was completed in 1436 . The cathedral was consecrated by Pope Eugene IV on March 25 , 1436 , ( the first day of the year according to the Florentine calendar ) . It was the first ' octagonal ' dome in history to be built without a temporary wooden supporting frame . It was one of the most impressive projects of the Renaissance . During the consecration in 1436 , Guillaume Dufay 's motet Nuper rosarum flores was performed . The structure of this motet was strongly influenced by the structure of the dome . </P> The Duomo and Baptistery of St. John from Piazza del Duomo <P> The decoration of the exterior of the cathedral , begun in the 14th century , was not completed until 1887 , when the polychrome marble fa\u00e7ade was completed with the design of Emilio De Fabris . The floor of the church was relaid in marble tiles in the 16th century . </P> <P> The exterior walls are faced in alternate vertical and horizontal bands of polychrome marble from Carrara ( white ) , Prato ( green ) , Siena ( red ) , Lavenza and a few other places . These marble bands had to repeat the already existing bands on the walls of the earlier adjacent baptistery the Battistero di San Giovanni and Giotto 's Bell Tower . There are two side doors : the Doors of the Canonici ( south side ) and the Door of the Mandorla ( north side ) with sculptures by Nanni di Banco , Donatello , and Jacopo della Quercia . The six side windows , notable for their delicate tracery and ornaments , are separated by pilasters . Only the four windows closest to the transept admit light ; the other two are merely ornamental . The clerestory windows are round , a common feature in Italian Gothic . </P> <P> During its long history , this cathedral has been the seat of the Council of Florence ( 1439 ) , heard the preachings of Girolamo Savonarola and witnessed the murder of Giuliano di Piero de ' Medici on Sunday , 26 April 1478 ( with Lorenzo Il Magnifico barely escaping death ) , in the Pazzi conspiracy . </P> <H2> Exterior ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Plan and structure ( edit ) </H3> Plan of the church with various extension phases <P> The cathedral of Florence is built as a basilica , having a wide central nave of four square bays , with an aisle on either side . The chancel and transepts are of identical polygonal plan , separated by two smaller polygonal chapels . The whole plan forms a Latin cross . The nave and aisles are separated by wide pointed Gothic arches resting on composite piers . </P> <P> The dimensions of the building are enormous : building area 8,300 square metres ( 89,340 square feet ) , length 153 metres ( 502 feet ) , width 38 metres ( 125 feet ) , width at the crossing 90 metres ( 300 feet ) . The height of the arches in the aisles is 23 metres ( 75 feet ) . The height of the dome is 114.5 metres ( 375.7 feet ) . </P> <H3> Dome ( edit ) </H3> <P> By the beginning of the 15th century , after a hundred years of construction , the structure was still missing its dome . The basic features of the dome had been designed by Arnolfo di Cambio in 1296 . His brick model , 4.6 metres ( 15.1 ft ) high , 9.2 metres ( 30.2 feet ) long , was standing in a side aisle of the unfinished building , and had long been sacrosanct . It called for an octagonal dome higher and wider than any that had ever been built , with no external buttresses to keep it from spreading and falling under its own weight . </P> <Table> External video <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> Smarthistory - Brunelleschi 's Dome </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The commitment to reject traditional Gothic buttresses had been made when Neri di Fioravanti 's model was chosen over a competing one by Giovanni di Lapo Ghini . That architectural choice , in 1367 , was one of the first events of the Italian Renaissance , marking a break with the Medieval Gothic style and a return to the classic Mediterranean dome .

Greece has hosted the Games twice , both in Athens . As the home of the Ancient Olympic Games it was a natural choice as host nation for the revival of the modern Olympic Games in 1896 , while Greece has also hosted the 2004 Summer Olympics . During the parade of nations at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games , Greece always enters the stadium first and leads the parade to honor its status as the birthplace of the Olympics except 2004 when Greece enters last as the host nation . Before the Games the Olympic Flame is lit in Olympia , the site of the Ancient Olympic Games , in a ceremony that reflects ancient Greek rituals and initiates the Olympic torch relay . The flag of Greece is always hoisted in the closing ceremony , along with the flags of the current and the next host country . </P> <P> Greek athletes have won a total of 116 medals in 15 different sports and the country currently ranks 33rd in the all - time Summer Olympics medal count . Athletics and weightlifting have been the top medal - producing sports for the nation and in the latter Greece is placed among the top 10 countries overall . Gymnastics , shooting and wrestling are the other sports that have produced ten or more medals for Greece . In the inaugural 1896 Olympics , Greece finished second in the medal counts , but won the most medals in total , in their best Olympic performance . The Greeks finished third in the 1906 Intercalated Games with 8 gold , 14 silver and 13 bronze medals ( 35 in total ) , which were considered Olympic at the time but are not officially recognized by the IOC today . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Hosted Games </Li> <Li> 2 Medal tables <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Medals by Summer Games </Li> <Li> 2.2 Medals by Winter Games </Li> <Li> 2.3 Medals by summer sport </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Medal tables by athlete <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Athletes with most medals </Li> <Li> 3.2 Top medalists </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Hosted Games ( edit ) </H2> <P> Greece has hosted the Summer Olympic Games on two occasions , the inaugural modern Olympics in 1896 and again in 2004 .

Without bridges , the Pittsburgh region would be a series of fragmented valleys , hillsides , river plains , and isolated communities . </P> <P> A 2006 study determined that Pittsburgh has 446 bridges , and with its proximity to three major rivers and countless hills and ravines , Pittsburgh is known as `` The City of Bridges '' . The city of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County are the largest owners of great bridges in the country , in proper proportion to their size , with the possible exception of the City of New York , which is built on an island and surrounded by large bodies of water . </P> <P> According to a 2011 study by Transportation for America , 1,194 bridges in the Pittsburgh area -- or 30.4 % -- were deficient , the highest proportion in the nation . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Major bridges </Li> <Li> 3 Notable bridges </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> Pittsburgh 's first river bridges , made of wood and long since replaced , opened in 1818 at Smithfield Street and 1819 at Sixth Street ( then St. Clair Street ) . The city 's oldest in - service bridge is the current Smithfield Street Bridge , which opened in 1883 ; it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976 . Pittsburgh waged a massive road and bridge building campaign from 1924 to 1940 ; most of Pittsburgh 's oldest major bridges date from this period . The coming of the Interstate Highway System triggered more construction in the second half of the twentieth century , as vehicular speed and throughput requirements increased . The result of more than 100 years of bridge building is a collection of most of the major types of bridge ( suspension , cantilever , arch , etc . ) , mostly built from locally produced steel , including about forty river spans . </P> <P> Many of the bridges in the Downtown area are colored Aztec Gold , either constructed as such or painted afterward , to match the city 's official colors of black and gold . A few old and out - of - service bridges , such as the Hot Metal Bridge ( which stood dormant until reopening as a passenger bridge in the year 2000 ) , are exceptions to this rule . </P> <H2> Major bridges ( edit ) </H2> <P> This table lists all bridges crossing the Allegheny , Monongahela and Ohio rivers in the City of Pittsburgh limits . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Crossing </Th> <Th> Carries </Th> <Th> River </Th> <Th> Image </Th> <Th> </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Fort Pitt Bridge </Td> <Td> I - 376 / US 19 Truck / US 22 / US 30 </Td> <Td> Monongahela </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 40 \u00b0 26 \u2032 20 '' N 80 \u00b0 00 \u2032 40 '' W \ufeff / \ufeff 40.4388 \u00b0 N 80.0111 \u00b0 W \ufeff / 40.4388 ;

The answer should be a number\n\nDocument:\nHousing benefit - wikipedia <H1> Housing benefit </H1> Jump to : navigation , search <P> Housing Benefit is a means tested social security benefit in the United Kingdom that is intended to help meet housing costs for rented accommodation . It is the second biggest item in the Department for Work and Pensions ' budget after the state pension , totalling \u00a3 23.8 billion in 2013 -- 14 . </P> <P> The primary legislation governing Housing Benefit is the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 . Operationally , the governing regulations are statutory instruments arising from that Act . It is governed by one of two sets of regulations . </P> <P> For working age claimants it is governed by the `` Housing Benefit Regulations 2006 '' , but for those who have reached the qualifying age for Pension Credit ( regardless of whether it has been claimed ) it is governed by the `` Housing Benefit ( Persons who have attained the qualifying age for state pension credit ) Regulations 2006 '' . </P> <P> It is normally administered by the local authority in whose area the property being rented lies . In some circumstances , normally council tenants in `` out of borough properties '' , some claimants may be required to obtain Housing Benefit from the borough that placed them . For those areas where there are two or more tier local government structure , Housing Benefit is administered by the district or borough council layer of local government . This is the council responsible for the billing of Council Tax . Additionally , local authorities in Great Britain , but not Northern Ireland , may contract out the administration of housing benefit to other local authorities , or to private companies . </P> <P> Council tenants ' housing benefit is awarded as a rebate ; reducing the level of rent payable by the tenant . Private tenants ' benefit is normally paid to the claimant , who has the right to decide to whom payments are made , and in some cases to the landlord . Local authorities reclaim the housing benefit that they have paid from the Department for Work and Pensions ( DWP ) by means of submitting heavily audited subsidy claims . Three subsidy claims must be completed each year , an initial estimate , a mid year estimate and a final claim . The final claim must be submitted to the DWP by 30 April . The final audited claim must be submitted by 30 November . The Department for Work and Pensions pays local councils an administration grant based on the numbers of new claims and overall case - load ; as well as various other cost factor adjustments to take into account the relative staff and accommodation costs . The level of Administration Grant awarded is announced annually by the Department for Work and Pensions . Some elements of the subsidy claim are subject to penalty , to encourage local authorities to control that element of expenditure . This includes high rents for care and support homes and the raising of overpayments . Overpayments of benefit are not fully funded in order to ensure that the local authority takes recovery action where appropriate . </P> <P> Regulation 9 of the Housing Benefit Regulations mean that Housing Benefit is normally only available to those who are liable to pay rent . In some cases , a member of the household who is not the claimant or tenant may be treated as liable ( such as where the person is unable to look after their own affairs ) . Some tenants who are liable may also be treated as not liable for the purposes of housing benefit ( e.g. most full - time Higher Education Students and those who live with a closely relative landlord ) . </P> <P> A person 's immigration status may affect their right to claim Housing Benefit . If a person who does not have recourse to public funds submits a claim , the Home Office may be informed . This could affect any future immigration applications . </P> <P> New or re-entrants into the country ( including British Citizens ) may also be excluded from Housing Benefit . </P> <P> Since April 2008 , new private sector benefit claimants receive housing benefit under revised rent restriction rules called Local Housing Allowance . From April 2017 people between the ages of 18 and 21 will not ordinarily be entitled to housing benefit . There are fears this will increase homelessness . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Concepts and terminology </Li> <Li> 3 Benefit cap </Li> <Li> 4 Local Housing Allowance </Li> <Li> 5 Reference Rent Cases </Li> <Li> 6 Northern Ireland </Li> <Li> 7 Non-LHA Housing Benefit claims <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Claim - related rent <Ul> <Li> 7.1. 1 Significantly high rent </Li> <Li> 7.1. 2 Number of rooms ( size criteria ) <Ul> <Li> 7.1. 2.1 Underoccupancy charge ( Bedroom Tax ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7.1. 3 Exceptionally high rent </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7.2 Local reference rent <Ul> <Li> 7.2. 1 Single room rent </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7.3 Exemptions from Rent Restrictions </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 Housing Benefit payments for private tenants </Li> <Li> 9 Rent restrictions for council and housing association tenants </Li> <Li> 10 Housing Benefit taper </Li> <Li> 11 Non-dependant deductions </Li> <Li> 12 Pre-tenancy determinations <Ul> <Li> 12.1 Delays in processing leading to `` No - DSS '' </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 13 Changes in circumstances </Li> <Li> 14 Treatment of overpayments </Li> <Li> 15 Appeals <Ul> <Li> 15.1 Relevant decision </Li> <Li> 15.2 `` Person affected '' </Li> <Li> 15.3 What someone who disagrees with the decision of the council should do </Li> <Li> 15.4 If the council notifies the person of the outcome of a request for a revision </Li> <Li> 15.5 Statement of reasons </Li> <Li> 15.6 Asking the first - tier tribunal to look at the council 's decision </Li> <Li> 15.7 Attending the tribunal </Li> <Li> 15.8 If not happy with the tribunal 's decision </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 16 Discretionary housing payments <Ul> <Li> 16.1 When a discretionary housing payment may be made </Li> <Li> 16.2 Who can get a discretionary housing payment </Li> <Li> 16.3 How to claim a DHP </Li> <Li> 16.4 Information to be sent with the claim </Li> <Li> 16.5 Appealing a DHP decision </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 17 Changes to housing benefit in 2011 </Li> <Li> 18 See also </Li> <Li> 19 Notes </Li> <Li> 20 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> Housing benefit was transferred from the Department of Social Security to local authorities in 1982 . This was to coincide with increasing deregulation of the private sector rental market as it was felt at the time that local authorities would have a better understanding of local rental market conditions than the DSS . Its full transfer took place in 1989 as part of a major reform of social security legislation which also saw the introduction of Income Support . </P> <H2> Concepts and terminology ( edit ) </H2> <P> Housing Benefit will only meet the pure rent costs of any liability . Central to benefit decisions is an assessment of eligible rent and ineligible services . Eligible rent is that part of the rent paid by a person which can legally be covered by housing benefit . Ineligible services are the parts of the claimant 's rent liability that he must meet himself . Ineligible services include such things as the cost of heating , lighting , water rates , meals and any general counselling and support that may be included in the rent charged but will not be met by Housing Benefit . </P> <P> The payment of the benefit is centred on the concept of a benefit week , which is a seven - day period running from a Monday to a Sunday . Housing Benefit may be paid on a weekly , fortnightly , lunar monthly or calendar monthly basis . Housing Benefit paid to landlords is usually paid four weeks in arrears . Regulations require local authorities to take into account the needs of the claimant when deciding on the frequency of benefit payments , however due to the complexity of calculating a calendar monthly payment and especially any overpayments that arise , most local authorities pay benefit fortnightly to claimants and four weekly to landlords . </P> <P> For claimants not on a `` passported benefit '' , the concept of a benefit week is particularly important as benefit will only be paid from the start of a tenancy if the form is requested on the same benefit week as moving in . In all other cases for tenants not on a passported benefit , Housing Benefit will start only from the Monday after the form was requested . If the form is returned within a month of request , otherwise benefit is payable from the Monday after the council receives it . </P> <P> Applicants who successfully apply for a passported benefit along with their Housing Benefit have a calendar month to return the Housing Benefit form , from the date of application to the passported benefit . If the form is returned within one month of that date benefit starts from the Monday after the start date of the passported benefit - even if that benefit is backdated . </P> <P> Originally using paper application forms , in recent years local authorities have begun to use a telephone - based application process . Under these latter application schemes , claimants would often contact the responsible central government department , who would then forward the details to the local authority . This has turned out to be a somewhat prescient decision ; the gateway for claimants to the new Universal Credit system , which replaces Housing Benefit , is the central government department , not local authorities . </P> <P> The date of claim will be the date the claimant you first contacted the Department for Works and Pensions , for claimants applying to the Department for Work and Pensions , and otherwise the date of claim will be treated as the date he contacted the Local Authority . </P> <H2> Benefit cap ( edit ) </H2> Main article : benefit cap <P> Due to a benefit cap many claimants have had their housing benefit reduced to 50p a week and are at risk of losing their homes if they can not pay their rent . New building providing supported housing for vulnerable people is being cut due to uncertainty whether prospective tenants will be able to pay the rent . Schemes affected include homes for war veterans , for people with learning disabilities helping them live independently . Safe housing for domestic violence victims could also be at risk . New schemes are postponed or cancelled and existing schemes are being closed . David Orr of the National Housing Federation said , `` With social care in crisis , the role supported housing plays in alleviating pressures on the NHS is ever more important . These changes have not even come in yet and they have taken 7,000 homes for vulnerable people out of the pipeline . The proposed changes in funding bear no relation to the real cost of providing this type of housing . It is time government put supported housing on a secure and sustainable footing . '' The most vulnerable people , elderly people , severely disabled people and people with mental health problems need a great deal of support and the benefit cap disproportionately pprevents them from getting what they need . </P> <P> Polly Neate of Shelter said , `` The money put forward ( by the government for social housing ) is only a fraction of what 's needed , given just how bad this crisis has become . Building new homes also takes time , and time is not on the side of the million private renters who could risk being tipped into homelessness by the freeze on housing benefit . Whether a struggling family or a young person in low - paid work , the freeze is stripping away the help people desperately need to pay their rent . ( ... ) We are urging the government to abandon the freeze on housing benefit in the autumn budget or risk making more people homeless . '' </P> <H2> Local Housing Allowance ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Local Housing Allowance <P> The Government has introduced a new rent restriction policy for the calculation of Housing Benefit for private tenants called Local Housing Allowance . The scheme replaces two previous methods of controlling high rents for most new tenancies. Old scheme cases where the local authority decided the level of restriction based on the cost of suitable alternative accommodation ( in operation from 15 January 1989 to 1 January 1996 ) , Reference Rent cases , where the level of eligible rent was decided by the Rent Service based on the lower of what a landlord would have been able to obtain had a landlord not been renting to a tenant on Housing Benefit ( the claim related rent ) and the average cost of similar properties in that area ( the local reference rent ) . </P> <P> For LHA cases the eligible rent is decided in part by the size of property a claimant needs . This figure is published monthly by the council and the Rent Service . If the tenant rents more expensive accommodation , the rent is restricted to the LHA rate for that area . By publicising how much Housing Benefit a tenant can get for the need for Pre-Tenancy Determinations is removed . </P> <P> The Local Housing Allowance is set at the 30th percentile level for rents in the Broad Market Rental Area . The Broad Market Rental areas are similar in geographic size to Counties . This has led to a number of counties such as Cambridgeshire criticising the scheme because market rents in the city area of the county are considerably higher than those in the shire areas of the county . The House of Lords ruled against the concept of very large Broad Market Rental areas in the Heffernan case ( R ( Heffernan ) v The Rent Service ( 2008 ) UKHL 58 ) . The DWP re-introduced legislation to overturn this decision , restoring its intention to use very large broad market rental areas to draw down the cost of the scheme . </P> <P> Local Housing Allowance was introduced across all Local Authority areas on 7 April 2008 . The legislation to enable the scheme is contained in the Welfare Reform Act which received Royal Assent in May 2007 . The local authorities that trialled the new system were known as Pathfinder Authorities . They were Argyll and Bute , Blackpool , Brighton and Hove , Conwy county borough , Coventry , East Riding of Yorkshire , City of Edinburgh , Guildford , City of Leeds , London Borough of Lewisham , North East Lincolnshire , Norwich , Pembrokeshire , City of Salford , South Norfolk , Metropolitan Borough of St Helens , Teignbridge , London Borough of Wandsworth </P> <P> The final scheme was different in that the maximum difference between the rent payable and the eligible local housing allowance was restricted to \u00a3 15 . In addition in some pilot authorities , all tenants whose rent had been assessed according to reference rent rules were transferred to LHA , when the national scheme came in only those who made a new claim or moved went on to LHA . </P> <P> From April 2011 the \u00a3 15 paid to those whose rent was below LHA levels was scrapped . Now the maximum payable will be the rent or the LHA rate , whichever is the lower . </P> <P> From April 2009 , the maximum LHA that can be awarded will be restricted to the rate payable for four rooms . </P> <H2> Reference rent cases ( edit ) </H2> <P> This scheme will remain in operation for existing claimants who do not have a break in their Housing Benefit claim or do not move property . It was introduced with effect from 2 January 1996 . The level of eligible rent is decided by the Rent Service .

In the small town of Bon Temps , Louisiana , 25 - year - old waitress Sookie Stackhouse struggles with being telepathic and not being able to control hearing the thoughts of everyone she sees . That is until 173 - year - old vampire Bill Compton walks into Merlotte 's bar where Sookie works . She is immediately drawn to him , and so are Mack and Denise Rattray , a couple of local thugs who later attack Bill with silver and try to drain his blood so that they can sell it on the black market . But Sookie rescues him and drives the Rattrays away , after which she learns that not only is Bill equally interested in her , but that she can not read his thoughts as his brain is technically dead . Meanwhile , Sookie 's hard - talking best friend Tara Thornton is fired from her job when she mouths off to her boss and a customer and Sam Merlotte hires her as the new bartender . Meanwhile , Sookie 's brother Jason Stackhouse has a sexual interlude with a young woman named Maudette Pickens , who enjoys rough sex with vampires . She shows Jason a videotape of her with a bald - headed , tattooed vampire and later she videotapes them having rough sex . The next day , Jason is arrested by Sheriff Bud Dearborne and Detective Andy Bellefleur for murder of Maudette , who was killed the night before . Sookie 's grandmother Adele asks if Sookie thinks she can get the vampire Bill to speak at her Descendants of the Glorious Dead meeting . And at Merlotte 's that night , Bill agrees to meet her in the parking lot after work to discuss the favor . Sookie gets into a heated argument with Sam and Tara , who believe that getting involved with a vampire could be very dangerous and Sookie tells them both to stay out of her life . After work Sookie and Sam make amends with one another and alone in the parking lot , Sookie is suddenly and savagely attacked by the Rattrays , out for revenge . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> `` The First Taste '' </Td> <Td> Scott Winant </Td> <Td> Alan Ball </Td> <Td> September 14 , 2008 ( 2008 - 09 - 14 ) </Td> <Td> 1.79 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"7\"> The Rattrays are brutally beating Sookie as she bleeds on the ground . They are about to kill her when Bill suddenly intervenes . He kills both Rattrays and takes Sookie to the edge of a lake , where he offers her some of his vampire blood , which has special properties that allow her to completely heal instantly . Sookie asks him about being a guest speaker at her grandmother 's next meeting and he agrees to that and to call in on her at her house the next evening to meet her family . Meanwhile , Jason is shown a videotape of him with Maudette and it turns out that Jason thought he had choked her to death during sex , but that she was only fooling around with him . Sheriff Dearborne and Detective Bellefleur are n't entirely convinced Jason did n't kill Maudette , but he is eventually released . Tara returns home from work to find her alcoholic mother passed out on the couch and she asks her flamboyant cousin Lafayette , who is also the Merlotte 's cook , to take her to a party . He agrees . Jason meets up with an old flame and another Merlotte 's waitress , Dawn and the two spend the night together . The next morning , he discovers vampire bite marks on her neck . Sookie learns that the police found the Rattrays ' bodies in the wreckage of their trailer and have ruled that they were killed by a freak tornado .

At Merlotte 's , Sookie learns that Reverend Theodore Newlin , founder of the anti-vampire church the Fellowship of the Sun , along with his wife and daughter were killed in an accident .

Bill is about to feed , but Sookie looks into Jerry 's mind and sees that he has Hepatitis D , an infection that infects only vampires . Now robbed of his chance at revenge for the loss of his boyfriend to vampire blood addiction , Jerry attacks Sookie , but Bill stops him and knocks him out . Diane wants to know how Sookie knew about Jerry 's intentions , but Bill manages to get the group out the door before they can ask any more questions . The incident leaves Sookie shaken and with doubts about her relationship with Bill . At Merlotte 's , Sam and Tara close up for the night and share a few drinks . They talk about being lonely and come to an arrangement , whereby they will have sex just once . Dawn returns home and her little game with Jason quickly turns into more rough sex . However , knowing that Dawn has been with vampires causes Jason to lose his erection and the two have an argument about sex with vampires , which results in Dawn threatening Jason with a gun and throwing him out of her house , all of which is witnessed by Dawn 's neighbor .

It sums up , in book form , the beliefs of the Catholic faithful . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Publication history </Li> <Li> 2 Doctrinal value </Li> <Li> 3 Contents </Li> <Li> 4 Comments </Li> <Li> 5 Derived works </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 Notes </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 Further reading </Li> <Li> 10 External links <Ul> <Li> 10.1 Text of the Catechism </Li> <Li> 10.2 Comments on the Catechism </Li> <Li> 10.3 Text of the Compendium </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Publication history ( edit ) </H2> <P> The decision to publish a catechism was taken at the Second Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops that was convened by Pope John Paul II on 25 January 1985 for the 20th anniversary of the close of the Second Vatican Council , and in 1986 , put a commission composed of 12 bishops and cardinals in charge of the project . The commission was assisted by a committee consisting seven diocesan bishops , experts in theology and catechesis . </P> <P> The text was approved by John Paul II on 25 June 1992 , and promulgated by him on 11 October 1992 , the 30th anniversary of the opening of the Second Vatican Council , with his apostolic constitution , Fidei depositum . Cardinal Georges Cottier , Theologian emeritus of the Pontifical Household and now Cardinal - Deacon of Santi Domenico e Sisto the University Church of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas , Angelicum was influential in drafting the encyclical . </P> <P> It was published in the French language in 1992 . Later it was then translated into many other languages . In the United States , the English translation was published in 1994 and had been pre-ordered more than 250,000 copies before its release , with a note that it was `` subject to revision according to the Latin typical edition ( editio typica ) when it is published . '' </P> <P> On August 15 , 1997 -- the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary -- John Paul II promulgated the Latin typical edition , with his apostolic letter , Laetamur Magnopere . The Latin text , which became the official text of reference ( editio typica ) , amended the contents of the provisional French text at a few points . One of the changes consisted in the inclusion of the position on death penalty that is defended in John Paul II 's encyclical Evangelium Vitae of 1995 . </P> <P> As a result , the earlier translations from the French into other languages ( including English ) had to be amended and re-published as `` second editions '' . </P> <H2> Doctrinal value ( edit ) </H2> <P> In the apostolic constitution Fidei depositum , John Paul II declared that the Catechism of the Catholic Church is `` a valid and legitimate instrument for ecclesial communion and a sure norm for teaching the faith '' , and stressed that it `` is not intended to replace the local catechisms duly approved by the ecclesiastical authorities , the diocesan Bishops and the Episcopal Conferences '' . </P> <H2> Contents ( edit ) </H2> <P> A catechism has been defined as `` a book that explains the beliefs of the Christian religion by using a list of questions and answers '' . Documents of religious instruction have been written since the beginning of Christianity and a catechism is typically an assemblage of these smaller documents into one large compilation of Church doctrine and teachings . </P> <P> The Catechism itself is not in question - and - answer format . Rather , it is instead a source on which to base such catechisms ( e.g. Youcat and the United States Catholic Catechism for Adults ) and other expositions of Catholic doctrine , called a `` major catechism . '' As stated in the apostolic constitution Fidei depositum , with which its publication was ordered , it was given so `` that it may be a sure and authentic reference text for teaching Catholic doctrine and particularly for preparing local catechisms . '' </P> <P> The Catechism is arranged in four principal parts : </P> <Ul> <Li> The Profession of Faith ( the Apostle 's Creed ) </Li> <Li> The Celebration of the Christian Mystery ( the Sacred Liturgy , and especially the sacraments ) </Li> <Li> Life in Christ ( including the Ten Commandments ) </Li> <Li> Christian Prayer ( including the Lord 's Prayer ) </Li> </Ul> <P> This scheme is often referred to as the `` Four Pillars '' of the Faith . The contents are abundantly footnoted with references to sources of the teaching , in particular the Scriptures , the Church Fathers , and the Ecumenical Councils and other authoritative Catholic statements , principally those issued by recent popes . </P> <P> The section on Scripture in the Catechism recovers the Patristic tradition of `` spiritual exegesis '' as further developed through the scholastic doctrine of the `` four senses . '' This return to spiritual exegesis is based on the Second Vatican Council 's 1965 dogmatic constitution Dei verbum , which taught that Scripture should be `` read and interpreted in light of the same Spirit by whom it was written '' . The Catechism amplifies Dei verbum by specifying that the necessary spiritual interpretation should be sought through the four senses of Scripture , which encompass the literal sense and the three spiritual senses ( allegorical , moral , and anagogical ) . </P> <P> The literal sense pertains to the meaning of the words themselves , including any figurative meanings . The spiritual senses pertain to the significance of the things ( persons , places , objects or events ) denoted by the words . Of the three spiritual senses , the allegorical sense is foundational . It relates persons , events , and institutions of earlier covenants to those of later covenants , and especially to the New Covenant . Building on the allegorical sense , the moral sense instructs in regard to action , and the anagogical sense points to man 's final destiny . The teaching of the Catechism on Scripture has encouraged the pursuit of covenantal theology , an approach that employs the four senses to structure salvation history via the biblical covenants . </P> <H2> Comments ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 1992 , Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger ( later Pope Benedict XVI ) noted : </P> <P> It clearly show ( s ) that the problem of what we must do as human beings , of how we should live our lives so that we and the world may become just , is the essential problem of our day , and basically of all ages . After the fall of ideologies , the problem of man -- the moral problem -- is presented to today 's context in a totally new way : What should we do ? How does life become just ? What can give us and the whole world a future which is worth living ? Since the catechism treats these questions , it is a book which interests many people , far beyond purely theological or ecclesial circles . </P> <P> Ulf Ekman , former Charismatic pastor and the founder of Livets Ord , says that the Catechism is `` the best book he has ever read '' . </P> <H2> Derived works ( edit ) </H2> <P> It was expected that the universal Catechism would serve as a source and template for inculturated national catechisms . In the United States , for example , the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops published the United States Catholic Catechism for Adults , officially replacing their previous version , the Baltimore Catechism , though it had already been out of use for nearly forty years . </P> <P> The Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church was published in 2005 , and the first edition in English in 2006 . It is a more concise and dialogic version of the Catechism . The text of the Compendium is available in fourteen languages on the Vatican website , which also gives the text of the Catechism itself in nine languages . </P> <P> Youcat , a catechism for youth , based on the Catechism and its Compendium , was published in 2011 . The Vatican has acknowledged that some translations of Youcat contain errors regarding Church teaching on the status of other religions , contraception and euthanasia , whether due to simple error or poor translations . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Catholicism portal </Li> <Li> Christianity portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Catholic Catechist </Li> <Li> Catholic Directory </Li> <Li> Catholic spirituality </Li> <Li> Glossary of the Catholic Church </Li> <Li> History of the Catholic Church since 1962 </Li> <Li> Index of Catholic Church articles </Li> <Li> Outline of Catholicism </Li> <Li> Pastoral care </Li> <Li> Catholic theology </Li> <Li> Second Vatican Council </Li> <Li> The Common Catechism </Li> <Li> Timeline of the Catholic Church </Li> <Li> Universal call to holiness </Li> <Li> Vocational Discernment in the Catholic Church </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ In an interview in 30Days , 3 - 2004 Cottier remarked : `` Going back to the early years , the first ' big ' text I worked on was the social encyclical Centesimus annus .

It was designed by James Barton Longacre , the Chief Engraver at the Philadelphia Mint . </P> <P> From 1793 to 1857 , the cent was a copper coin about the size of a half dollar . As rising copper prices made it impractical to keep striking them , in 1857 the Mint reduced the size of the cent , issuing a new design , the Flying Eagle cent . The new pieces were identical in diameter to modern cents , though somewhat thicker and made of copper - nickel . The design caused production difficulties , and the Mint soon looked to replace the coin . Mint Director James Ross Snowden selected the Indian Head design , and chose a laurel wreath for the reverse that was replaced in 1860 by an oak wreath with a shield . Cents were hoarded during the economic chaos of the American Civil War , when the metal nickel was in short supply . As Mint officials saw that privately issued bronze tokens were circulating , they induced Congress to pass the Coinage Act of 1864 , authorizing a slimmer cent of bronze alloy . </P> <P> In the postwar period , the cent became very popular and was struck in large numbers in most years . An exception was 1877 , when a poor economy and little demand for cents created one of the rarest dates in the series . With the advent of coin - operated machines in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , even more cents were produced , reaching 100 million for the first time in 1907 . In 1909 , the Indian Head cent was replaced by the Lincoln cent , designed by Victor D. Brenner . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Inception </Li> <Li> 2 Design </Li> <Li> 3 Production <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Redesign and surplus ( 1859 -- 1861 ) </Li> <Li> 3.2 Shortage and redesign ( 1862 -- 1864 ) </Li> <Li> 3.3 Later years ( 1865 -- 1909 ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Replacement </Li> <Li> 5 Collecting </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Inception ( edit ) </H2> Main articles : Large cent ( United States coin ) and Flying Eagle cent <P> The half - dollar - sized large cent was struck from 1793 to 1857 . That coin was intended to contain close to a cent 's worth of copper , as people then expected that coins contain close to their face values in metal . Nevertheless , because of the constitutional clause making only gold and silver legal tender , the government would not accept copper cents for taxes or other payments . By the early 1850s , fluctuations in the price of copper led the Mint of the United States ( hereafter Mint ) to seek alternatives , including reducing the size of the cent and experimenting with compositions other than pure copper . The result was the Flying Eagle cent , the same diameter as the later Lincoln cent but somewhat thicker and heavier , composed of 88 % copper and 12 % nickel . The Flying Eagle cent was struck in limited numbers as a pattern coin in 1856 , then for circulation in 1857 and 1858 . </P> <P> The Flying Eagle cent was issued in exchange for worn Spanish colonial silver coins , which until then had circulated widely in the United States . These `` small cents '' were also issued in exchange for the copper coins they had replaced . By 1858 , Mint authorities found the piece unsatisfactory in production . The high points on both sides of the coin ( the eagle 's head and the wreath ) opposed each other , and it was difficult to get the design to be brought out fully in the tough copper - nickel alloy . Mint Engraver James B. Longacre , designer of the Flying Eagle cent , was instructed to develop alternative designs . He produced one , showing a slimmer eagle , which would not clash as much with the reverse wreath . Although this would have cured the production problem , the design was not liked . Mint Director James Ross Snowden suggested a head of Columbus as an obverse design , but Longacre felt the public would not approve of a historic figure on an American coin . </P> A Spanish colonial two - reales piece ( `` two bits '' ) from the Potos\u00ed Mint ( today in Bolivia ) <P> In 1858 , the Mint tested new designs for the cent . Between 60 and 100 sets of twelve pattern coins were struck , consisting of the standard Flying Eagle obverse , a `` scrawny eagle '' pattern , and the Indian Head design , mated with four different wreaths for the reverse . Snowden would make his choice of what design would be struck in 1859 from these patterns ; the sets were also sold to collectors . The Indian Head design was apparently prepared by April , as on the twelfth of that month , a Mr. Howard wrote to Snowden that `` I have learned that a new pattern piece for the cent has been struck off at the Mint ( with ) a head resembling that of the three dollar piece and on the reverse a shield at the top of the olive and oak wreath '' , and asking to purchase a specimen . Other numismatists also sought pieces : R. Coulton Davis , a Philadelphia druggist with ties to the Mint , wrote to Snowden in June informing him of a favorable story in a Boston newspaper , and Augustus B. Sage wrote to the Mint Director the same month , asking for a specimen for himself , and one for the newly founded American Numismatic Society . </P> <P> According to Walter Breen , Snowden most likely chose the combination of the Indian Head and the laurel wreath as it was the lowest relief of any of the options , and could be expected to strike well . On November 4 , 1858 , Snowden wrote to Treasury Secretary Howell Cobb about the Indian Head design , and two days later wrote to Longacre , informing him that it was approved . Longacre was to prepare the necessary dies for production , which was to begin on January 1 , 1859 . </P> <H2> Design ( edit ) </H2> <P> Longacre advocated his Indian Head design in an August 21 , 1858 , letter to Snowden : </P> <P> From the copper shores of Lake Superior , to the silver mountains of Potosi from the Ojibwa to the Aramanian , the feathered tiara is as characteristic of the primitive races of our hemisphere , as the turban is of the Asiatic . Nor is there anything in its decorative character , repulsive to the association of Liberty ... It is more appropriate than the Phrygian cap , the emblem rather of the emancipated slave , than of the independent freeman , of those who are able to say `` we were never in bondage to any man '' . I regard then this emblem of America as a proper and well defined portion of our national inheritance ; and having now the opportunity of consecrating it as a memorial of Liberty , ' our Liberty ' , American Liberty ; why not use it ? One more graceful can scarcely be devised . We have only to determine that it shall be appropriate , and all the world outside of us can not wrest it from us . </P> <P> By numismatic legend , the facial features of the goddess Liberty on the obverse of the Indian Head cent were based on the features of Longacre 's daughter Sarah ; the tale runs that she was at the mint one day when she tried on the headdress of one of a number of Native Americans who were visiting , and her father sketched her . However , Sarah Longacre was 30 years old and married in 1858 , not 12 as in the tale , and Longacre himself stated that the face was based on a statue of Venus in Philadelphia on loan from the Vatican . He did often sketch his elder daughter , and there are resemblances between the depictions of Sarah and the various representations of Liberty on his coins of the 1850s . These tales were apparently extant at the time , as Snowden , writing to Treasury Secretary Howell Cobb in November 1858 , denied that the coin was based `` on any human features in the Longacre family '' . Lee F. McKenzie , in his 1991 article on Longacre , notes that any artist can be influenced by many things , but calls the story `` essentially false '' . </P> <P> Regardless of who posed for Longacre , the facial features of the `` Indian '' are essentially Caucasian , meaning that a White woman wears the headdress of a Native American man . Longacre had , in 1854 , designed the three - dollar piece with a female with similar features ( also supposedly based on the museum sculpture ) but a more fanciful headdress , and adapted that design for the gold dollar . Officials were aware of this artistic license at the time of issue ; Snowden , in his November 1858 letter to Cobb , characterizes the two earlier coins as `` the artists at the Mint evidently not realizing the absurd incongruity of placing this most masculine attribute of the warrior brave on the head of a woman '' . Longacre would not be the last to juxtapose the features of a White woman with an Indian headdress reserved for men ; Augustus Saint Gaudens , for the Indian Head eagle ( 1907 ) , produced a similar design . Later issues depict more accurate Indians , including Bela Lyon Pratt 's Indian Head gold pieces ( 1908 ) , the Buffalo nickel ( 1913 ) by James Earle Fraser , who worked from Native American models , and the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar ( 1926 ) , designed by Fraser and his wife Laura . </P> Cornelius Vermeule thought the Indian Head cent was better than Longacre 's 1859 pattern half dollar . <P> Art historian Cornelius Vermeule had mixed emotions about the Indian Head cent : `` Longacre enriched the mythology of American coinage in a pleasant if unpretentious fashion . Given his pattern half - dollar designs of 1859 as a yardstick , he could have done worse . '' In another comparison , Vermeule suggested , `` far from a major creation aesthetically or iconographically , and far less attractive to the eye than the ( flying eagle ) , the Indian head cent was at least to achieve the blessing of popular appeal . The coin became perhaps the most beloved and typically American of any piece great or small in the American series . Great art the coin was not , but it was one of the first products of the United States mints to achieve the common touch . '' </P> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Redesign and surplus ( 1859 -- 1861 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> Production of the Indian Head cent for commerce began at the start of 1859 . As issued for circulation , the pieces differ in some particulars from the pattern 1858 cent of similar design ; Longacre sharpened some details . The pattern coin had the laurel leaves in the reverse wreath in bunches of five leaves ; the issued 1859 cent has them in bunches of six . Cents dated 1858 with the adopted reverse ( with six - leaf bunches ) are known , were most likely struck in 1859 , and are extremely rare . </P> <P> In 1860 , the reverse of the cent was changed to feature an oak wreath and a narrow shield ; such reverses are also known on 1859 - dated pieces struck as patterns . According to Richard Snow in his guide book to Flying Eagle and Indian Head cents , this was not due to problems with the `` Laurel Wreath '' reverse design used in 1859 , as full details survive on many extant pieces . Walter Breen , however , suggested that the feathers and curls on the obverse did not strike as well as they would later , and that `` this may account for Snowden 's decision to change the design again '' . David Lange , in his history of the Mint , states that it was to give the coin , quoting Snowden , `` more National character '' . All 1859 cents and some from 1860 have the cutoff of Liberty 's bust on the obverse end with a point ; most 1860 cents and all later issues have it rounded . </P> <P> Tens of millions of Flyin\n", "answer": "1859"}

In 2011 , Statistics Canada reported approximately 2 million people identifying as adherents . The United Church was founded in 1925 as a merger of four Protestant denominations with a total combined membership of about 600,000 members : the Methodist Church , Canada , the Congregational Union of Ontario and Quebec , two - thirds of the congregations of the Presbyterian Church in Canada , and the Association of Local Union Churches , a movement predominantly of the Canadian Prairie provinces . The Canadian Conference of the Evangelical United Brethren Church joined the United Church of Canada on January 1 , 1968 . </P> <P> Membership peaked in 1964 at 1.1 million , and has declined since that time . From 1991 to 2001 , the number of people claiming an affiliation with the United Church decreased by 8 % , the third largest decrease in mainstream Christian denominations in Canada . Church statistics for the end of 2014 showed 413,717 members in 327,847 households under pastoral care . As of December 31 , 2016 , 132,459 people attend services in 2,141 communities of faith representing 2,834 congregations on a regular basis . </P> <P> The United Church has a `` council - based '' structure , where each council ( congregational , regional , or denominational ) have specific responsibilities . In some areas , each of these councils have sole authority , while in others , approval of other councils is required before action is taken .

The United Church of Canada uses the historical - critical method of interpreting the bible . </P> <H3> Sacraments ( edit ) </H3> <P> The two sacraments of the United Church are Communion and Baptism . </P> Communion ( edit ) <P> Communion is the ritual sharing of the elements of bread and wine ( or , more commonly , grape juice ) as a remembrance of the Last Supper that Jesus shared with his followers . It is usually celebrated at a table at the front of the sanctuary , where the minister blesses the elements before they are distributed to the congregation . There is no restriction regarding age or United Church membership -- Communion is open to young children as well as Christians from other denominations . The actual distribution can take several forms , including passing a tray of bread cubes and another tray of small juice glasses from person to person , and then eating the bread and drinking the juice in unison ; and `` intinction '' , where each person takes a piece of bread , dips it into a cup of juice and then eats the juice - soaked bread . </P> <P> There is no guideline for frequency . Some congregations celebrate communion once a month , others on a quarterly basis . </P> Baptism ( edit ) <P> The belief of the United Church is that baptism is not a requirement for God 's love ; it is not considered a passport to heaven , nor does the church believe that those who die unbaptised are condemned or damned for eternity . Rather , the church believes that baptism is the first step in church membership , where the parents make a profession of faith on behalf of the infant in the hope that their child will later confirm that profession at or around the age of 13 . </P> <P> The United Church practices infant baptism , but in cases where a person was not baptised as an infant , baptism can be performed at any age . In the case of infant baptism , the parents of the infant , before the congregation , agree to a series of statements about the beliefs of the United Church on behalf of their child . They also promise to encourage the child to seek full membership at an appropriate time . The members of the congregation also promise the parents that they will help to raise the child in a Christian community . The minister then places water on the candidate 's head three times ( expressing the Trinity of Father , Son and Holy Spirit ) and traces a cross on the person 's forehead with water . Baptism by immersion is also an option for adults who request it . </P> <P> In the 1970s , the United Church reached an ecumenical agreement with the Presbyterian , Lutheran , Catholic , and Anglican churches in Canada that baptisms within these churches are mutually recognized as valid . Further to that , the United Church recognizes the validity of any baptism by another denomination that was performed with water and in the name of the Father , Son and Holy Spirit . </P> <H3> Inclusiveness ( edit ) </H3> <P> Remembering that Jesus was reported to have welcomed tax collectors , prostitutes and other `` undesirables '' to his table , the church attempts to welcome everyone , regardless of age , race , class , gender , sexual orientation , or physical ability . In the same manner , there is also no restriction on those interested in entering ministry . </P> <H3> Marriage ( edit ) </H3> <P> Believing that marriage is a celebration of God 's love , the church recognizes and celebrates all legal marriages , including same - sex couples , previously divorced people , and couples of different religions . The actual policy of whom to marry is left up to the church council of each community of faith . For instance , one congregation might not allow same - sex marriages to be performed in their building , while another allows all marriages regardless of sexual orientation . </P> <H3> Interfaith relations ( edit ) </H3> <P> The church believes that there are many paths to God . The United Church 's path is through Jesus Christ , but the church also recognizes that Christians ' understanding of this is limited by an incomplete comprehension of God ; their belief is that the Holy Spirit of God is also at work through other non-Christian faiths . </P> <H3> Abortion ( edit ) </H3> <P> The church supports the right of women to have access to safe abortions that are covered by provincial health care , but also supports better access to contraception , sexual education , and counselling that might eventually make abortion unnecessary . </P> <H2> Membership ( edit ) </H2> <P> A full member is one who has been baptised , either as infant , child , youth or adult , and has made a public profession of faith before the congregation . Membership is not required in order to worship at a United Church , and many who regularly attend worship are adherents rather than members . </P> <P> In order to become a full member , a person goes through a process called `` confirmation '' . This is offered to adults ( starting at around age 13 ) and usually involves a series of classes about the beliefs of the United Church . Following this , the candidate makes a public profession of faith before the congregation , thereby `` confirming '' the statements made by his or her parents during baptism . If the person is unbaptised , the minister baptises the person before the profession of faith . The new member 's name is then entered on the official Roll of Members for that congregation . </P> <H3> Benefits of membership ( edit ) </H3> <P> Only members can be a part of a congregation 's board or council , and only members can vote on spiritual matters at congregational meetings -- usually whether to issue a `` call '' to a new minister to join the congregation . ( On temporal matters -- those that deal with finances , property , etc. -- a motion is usually made at the start of a congregational meeting to allow all who are present , rather than just members , the right to vote . ) </P> <H3> Transfer of membership and removal from rolls ( edit ) </H3> <P> Although confirmation takes place at the congregational level , the person is a member of the entire United Church of Canada , not just one congregation ; therefore membership can be transferred freely from congregation to congregation . </P> <P> A congregation may remove members from its roll for non-attendance . ( The Manual suggests an absence of three years , but the congregation is free to set its own period of time ) </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> In the early 20th century , the main Evangelical Protestant denominations in Canada were the Presbyterian , Methodist and Congregational churches . Many small towns and villages across Canada had all three , with the town 's population divided among them . Especially on the prairies , it was difficult to find clergy to serve all these charges , and there were several instances where one minister would serve his congregation , but would also perform pastoral care for the other congregations that lacked a minister . On the prairies , a movement to unite all three major Protestant denominations began , resulting in the Association of Local Union Churches . </P> <P> Facing a de facto union in the western provinces , the three denominations began a slow process of union talks that eventually produced a Basis for Union . </P> <P> However , not all elements of the churches involved were happy with the idea of uniting under one roof ; a substantial minority of Presbyterians remained unconvinced of the virtues of church union . Their threat to the entire project was resolved by giving individual Presbyterian congregations the right to vote on whether to enter or remain outside the United Church .

{"content": "Answer the question based on the information provided in the document given below. The answer should be a number\n\nQuestion:\nwhen did the two party system start in the united states\n\nDocument:\ntem , the Republicans dominated a one - party system ( primarily under the Presidency of James Monroe ) . Under the Second Party System , the Democratic - Republican Party split during the election of 1824 into Adams ' Men and Jackson 's Men . In 1828 , the modern Democratic Party formed in support of Andrew Jackson . The National Republicans were formed in support of John Quincy Adams . After the National Republicans collapsed , the Whig Party and the Free Soil Party quickly formed and collapsed . In 1854 , the modern Republican Party formed from a loose coalition of former Whigs , Free Soilers and other anti-slavery activists . Abraham Lincoln became the first Republican president in 1860 . </P> <P> During the Third Party System , the Republican Party was the dominant political faction , but the Democrats held a strong , loyal coalition in the Solid South . During the Fourth Party System , the Republicans remained the dominant Presidential party , although Democrats Grover Cleveland and Woodrow Wilson were both elected to two terms . In 1932 , at the onset of the Fifth Party System , Democrats took firm control of national politics with the landslide victories of Franklin D. Roosevelt in four consecutive elections . Other than the two terms of Republican Dwight Eisenhower from 1953 to 1961 , Democrats retained firm control of the Presidency until the mid-1960s . Since the mid-1960s , despite a number of landslides ( such as Richard Nixon carrying 49 states and 61 % of the popular vote over George McGovern in 1972 ; Ronald Reagan carrying 49 states and 58 % of the popular vote over Walter Mondale in 1984 ) , Presidential elections have been competitive between the predominant Republican and Democratic parties and no one party has been able to hold the Presidency for more than three consecutive terms , except for the elections from 1932 through 1948 when FDR won 4 elections and Truman one , both as Democrats . In the election of 2012 , only 4 % separated the popular vote between Barack Obama ( 51 % ) and Mitt Romney ( 47 % ) , although Obama won the electoral vote by a landslide ( 332 -- 206 ) . </P> <P> Throughout every American party system , no third party has won a Presidential election or majorities in either house of Congress . Despite that , third parties and third party candidates have gained traction and support . In the election of 1912 , Theodore Roosevelt won 27 % of the popular vote and 88 electoral votes running as a Progressive . In the 1992 Presidential election , Ross Perot won 19 % of the popular vote but no electoral votes running as an Independent . </P> <H3> Commonwealth countries ( edit ) </H3> <P> In countries such as Britain , two major parties emerge which have strong influence and tend to elect most of the candidates , but a multitude of lesser parties exist with varying degrees of influence , and sometimes these lesser parties are able to elect officials who participate in the legislature . In political systems based on the Westminster system , which is a particular style of parliamentary democracy based on the British model and found in many commonwealth countries , a majority party will form the government and the minority party will form the opposition , and coalitions of lesser parties are possible ; in the rare circumstance in which neither party is the majority , a hung parliament arises . Sometimes these systems are described as two - party systems but they are usually referred to as multi-party systems . There is not always a sharp boundary between a two - party system and a multi-party system . </P> <P> Generally , a two - party system becomes a dichotomous division of the political spectrum with an ostensibly right - wing and left - wing party : the Nationalist Party vs. the Labour Party in Malta , Labor vs. Liberal / National Coalition in Australia , Republicans vs. Democrats in the United States and the Conservative Party vs. the Labour Party in the United Kingdom . </P> <P> Other parties in these countries may have seen candidates elected to local or subnational office , however . Historian John Hicks claims that the United States has never possessed for any considerable period of time the two party system in its pure and undefiled form . </P> <P> In some governments , certain chambers may resemble a two - party system and others a multi-party system . For example , the politics of Australia are largely two - party ( the Liberal / National Coalition is often considered a single party at a national level due to their long - standing alliance in forming government and additionally rarely compete for the same seat ) for the Australian House of Representatives , which is elected by instant - runoff voting , known within Australia as preferential voting . However , third parties are more common in the Australian Senate , which uses a proportional voting system more amenable to minor parties . </P> <P> In the politics of Canada , while having a multiparty system federally and in the largest provinces of Ontario , Quebec and Alberta , many of the provinces have effectively become two - party systems in which only two parties regularly get members elected . Examples include British Columbia ( where the battles are between the New Democratic Party and the BC Liberals ) , Saskatchewan ( between the Saskatchewan Party and New Democratic Party ) , New Brunswick ( between the Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives ) and Prince Edward Island ( between Liberals and Progressive Conservatives ) . </P> <H3> India ( edit ) </H3> <P> India also shows characteristics of a two party system with the United Progressive Alliance ( UPA ) and National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ) as the two main players . It is to be noted that both UPA and NDA are not two political parties but alliances of several smaller parties . Other smaller parties not aligned with either NDA or UPA exist , and overall command about 20 % of the 2009 seats in the Lok Sabha and had further increased to 28 % in 2014 general elections </P> <H3> Malta ( edit ) </H3> <P> Malta is somewhat unusual in that while the electoral system is single transferable vote ( STV ) , traditionally associated with proportional representation , minor parties have not earned much success . Politics is dominated between the centre - left Labour Party and the centre - right Nationalist Party , with no third parties winning seats in Parliament between 1962 and 2017 . </P> <H3> Other examples ( edit ) </H3> <P> The English speaking countries of the Caribbean while inheriting their basic political system from Great Britain have become two party systems . The politics of Jamaica are between the People 's National Party and the Jamaica Labour Party . The politics of Guyana are between the People 's Progressive Party and APNU which is actually a coalition of smaller parties . The politics of Trinidad and Tobago are between the People 's National Movement and the People 's Partnership which is also a coalition . The Politics of Belize are between the United Democratic Party and the People 's United Party . The Politics of the Bahamas are between the Progressive Liberal Party and the Free National Movement . The politics of Barbados are between the Democratic Labour Party and the Barbados Labour Party . </P> <P> The politics of Zimbabwe are effectively a two party system between the Robert Mugabe led Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front and the opposition coalition Movement for Democratic Change . </P> <P> South Korea has a multi-party system that has sometimes been described as having characteristics of a two - party system . </P> <P> Furthermore , the Lebanese Parliament is mainly made up of two bipartisan alliances . Although both alliances are made up of several political parties on both ends of the political spectrum the two way political situation has mainly arisen due to strong ideological differences in the electorate . Once again this can mainly be attributed to the winner takes all thesis . </P> <P> Historically , Brazil had a two - party system for most of its military dictatorship ( 1964 -- 1985 ) : the military junta banned all existing parties when it took power and created a pro-government party , the National Renewal Alliance and an official opposition party , the Brazilian Democratic Movement . The two parties were dissolved in 1979 , when the regime allowed other parties to form . </P> <P> A report in The Christian Science Monitor in 2008 suggested that Spain was moving towards a `` greater two - party system '' while acknowledging that Spain has `` many small parties '' . However a 2015 article published by WashingtonPost.com written by academic Fernando Casal B\u00e9rtoa noted the decline in support for the two main parties , the People 's Party ( PP ) and the Spanish Socialist Workers ' Party ( PSOE ) in recent years , with these two parties winning only 52 percent of the votes in that year 's regional and local elections . He explained this as being due to the Spanish economic crisis , a series of political corruption scandals and broken campaign promises . He argued that the emergence of the new Citizens and Podemos parties would mean the political system would evolve into a two - bloc system , with an alliance of the PP and Citizens on the right facing a leftist coalition of PSOE , Podemos and the United Left . </P> <H2> Comparisons with other party systems ( edit ) </H2> <P> Two - party systems can be contrasted with : </P> <Ul> <Li> Multi-party systems . In these , the effective number of parties is greater than two but usually fewer than five ; in a two - party system , the effective number of parties is two ( according to one analysis , the actual average number of parties varies between 1.7 and 2.1 . ) The parties in a multi-party system can control government separately or as a coalition ; in a two - party system , however , coalition governments rarely form . Examples of nations with multi-party systems include Brazil , Canada , Denmark , Finland , France , Germany , India , Pakistan , Indonesia , Ireland , Israel , Italy , Mexico , Nepal , the Netherlands , New Zealand , Norway , Portugal , Russia , Spain , Sweden and Taiwan . </Li> <Li> One - party systems or dominant - party systems happen in nations where no more than one party is codified in law and / or officially recognized , or where alternate parties are restricted by the dominant party which wields power . Examples include rule by the Communist Party of China and the People 's Action Party of Singapore . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Causes ( edit ) </H2> <P> There are several reasons why , in some systems , two major parties dominate the political landscape . There has been speculation that a two - party system arose in the United States from early political battling between the federalists and anti-federalists in the first few decades after the ratification of the Constitution , according to several views . In addition , there has been more speculation that the winner - takes - all electoral system as well as particular state and federal laws regarding voting procedures helped to cause a two - party system . </P> In a two - party system , voters have mostly two options ; in this sample ballot for an election in Summit , New Jersey , voters can choose between a Republican or Democrat , but there are no third party candidates . Economist Jeffrey D. Sachs . <P> Political scientists such as Maurice Duverger and William H. Riker claim that there are strong correlations between voting rules and type of party system . Jeffrey D. Sachs agreed that there was a link between voting arrangements and the effective number of parties . Sachs explained how the first - past - the - post voting arrangement tended to promote a two - party system : </P> <P> The main reason for America 's majoritarian character is the electoral system for Congress . Members of Congress are elected in single - member districts according to the `` first - past - the - post '' ( FPTP ) principle , meaning that the candidate with the plurality of votes is the winner of the congressional seat . The losing party or parties win no representation at all . The first - past - the - post election tends to produce a small number of major parties , perhaps just two , a principle known in political science as Duverger 's Law . Smaller parties are trampled in first - past - the - post elections . </P> -- Sachs , The Price of Civilization , 2011 <P> Consider a system in which voters can vote for any candidate from any one of many parties . Suppose further that if a party gets 15 % of votes , then that party will win 15 % of the seats in the legislature . This is termed proportional representation or more accurately as party - proportional representation . Political scientists speculate that proportional representation leads logically to multi-party systems , since it allows new parties to build a niche in the legislature : </P> <P> Because even a minor party may still obtain at least a few seats in the legislature , smaller parties have a greater incentive to organize under such electoral systems than they do in the United States . </P> -- Schmidt , Shelley , Bardes ( 2008 ) <P> In contrast , a voting system that allows only a single winner for each possible legislative seat is sometimes termed a plurality voting system or single - winner voting system and is usually described under the heading of a winner - takes - all arrangement . Each voter can cast a single vote for any candidate within any given legislative district , but the candidate with the most votes wins the seat , although variants , such as requiring a majority , are sometimes used . What happens is that in a general election , a party that consistently comes in third in every district is unlikely to win any legislative seats even if there is a significant proportion of the electorate favoring its positions . This arrangement strongly favors large and well -- organized political parties that are able to appeal to voters in many districts and hence win many seats , and discourages smaller or regional parties . Politically oriented people consider their only realistic way to capture political power is to run under the auspices of the two dominant parties . </P> <P> In the U.S. , forty - eight states have a standard winner - takes - all electoral system for amassing presidential votes in the Electoral College system . The winner - takes - all principle applies in presidential elections , since if a presidential candidate gets the most votes in any particular state , all of the electoral votes from that state are awarded .

It was used on a range of mass - produced general - purpose tractors manufactured by Henry Ford & Son Inc from 1917 to 1920 , by Ford Motor Company ( U.S. ) and Ford Motor Company Ltd ( U.K. ) from 1920 to 1928 , and by Ford Motor Company Ltd ( U.K. ) from 1929 to 1964 . The latter ( Ford of Britain ) also later built trucks under the Fordson brand . </P> <P> American engineer , inventor , and businessman Henry Ford built experimental tractors from automobile components during the early 20th century , and launched a prototype known as the Model B in August 1915 . Further prototypes , with a dedicated tractor design , followed in 1916 . With World War I raging in Europe , the first regular - production Henry Ford & Son tractors were exported to the U.K. in 1917 to expand British agriculture . In 1918 , exports continued , the tractors began to be labeled as Fordsons , and U.S. domestic sales began . Sales boomed in 1918 and 1919 . </P> <P> Between 1917 and 1922 , the Fordson was for tractors somewhat like the Ford Model T was for automobiles -- it captured the public 's imagination and widely popularized the machine , with a reliable design , a low price affordable for workers and farmers , a widespread dealership network , and a production capacity for large numbers . Just as the Model T helped the public to appreciate how soon cars and trucks might replace most horses in transport , the Fordson helped people to appreciate how soon tractors might replace most horses in farming ( advancing the mechanisation of agriculture ) . As with cars , Ford never had the market to itself , but it dominated the market for a time ( for cars , roughly 1910 - 1925 ; for tractors , roughly 1917 - 1925 ) . Ford was the only automotive firm to sell cars , trucks and tractors simultaneously from 1917 to 1928 . </P> <P> For a decade between 1928 and 1939 , Ford of the U.S. left the tractor business . During that decade , Ford of Britain continued to build Fordsons and to develop new variants , which it exported widely . In 1939 Ford of the U.S. reentered the tractor market with an all - new model , this time with the Ford brand . Ford of Britain continued to use the Fordson brand until 1964 . </P> <P> Fordson production occurred in the U.S. ( 1917 -- 1928 ) ; Cork , Ireland ( 1919 -- 1923 and 1928 -- 1933 ) ; and at Dagenham , Essex , England ( 1933 -- 1964 ) . Tens of thousands of Fordsons , most from the U.S. and some from Ireland , were exported to the Soviet Union from 1920 to 1927 .

At the time , farm work was extremely arduous , because on the typical farm virtually nothing could get done without manual labour or animal labour as the motive power . As his interest in automobiles grew , he also expressed a desire to `` lift the burden of farming from flesh and blood and place it on steel and motors . '' In the early 20th century , he began to build experimental tractors from automobile components . Four years after founding the Ford Motor Company in 1903 , Ford finished his first experimental tractor in 1907 on Woodward Avenue in Detroit , referring to it as the `` Automobile Plow '' . Approximately 600 gasoline - powered tractors were in use on American farms in 1908 . Fordson tractor design was headed by Eugene Farkas and J\u00f3zsef Galamb , both involved in the design of the successful Ford Model T automobile . </P> <P> Traction engines had been around for a while , but they were large , heavy , expensive machines suited to prairie grain farming more than to small family farms in other regions . In the early 1910s , North America and Europe were hungry for small , inexpensive tractors , and many people seized on the Model T as a platform with which to create them . Clearly the idea of an auto - like tractor , made using auto - like parts and methods or by conversion from autos , was ripe . </P> <P> Henry Ford experimented with both auto - plows and heavier tractors . In August 1915 , at a plowing demonstration in Fremont , Nebraska , he introduced a newly designed tractor known as the Model B. It used a 16 horsepower , two - cylinder , horizontally opposed engine , a spur gear transmission and three wheels - two front drivers and one rear steerer . The Model B was never produced , but did gain enough publicity to let the world know Ford was interested in developing a tractor . </P> <P> Knowing there was demand for a Ford - built tractor , a group of entrepreneurs in Minneapolis organized The Ford Tractor Company , paying a company clerk surnamed Ford for the use of his name , with the intention of getting sales and attention from the confusion of this Ford with Ford Motor Company . The company built and sold some tractors , but anticipated a settlement with Henry Ford for permission to use their already - trademarked name . However , Ford thwarted them by using another name . </P> <H3> Fordson origins , Model F , and Model N ( edit ) </H3> Overview of the original Fordson tractor A cutaway view of the original Fordson tractor Disassembly of the original Fordson tractor , showing the unit - frame construction and how the tractor can be taken apart for service , with blocks of wood inserted to support the separated parts A cutaway view of the engine of the original Fordson tractor A cutaway view of the intake of the original Fordson tractor ( including the intake manifold , vaporizer , carburetor , and fuel lines ) A cutaway view of the clutch , transmission , and rear of the original Fordson tractor , including the worm drive An early Fordson discing a field in Princess Anne County , Virginia , USA , in 1925 <P> The first prototypes of the new Henry Ford & Son tractor , which would later be called the Fordson , were completed in 1916 . World War I was raging in Europe , and the United Kingdom , a net importer of food , was desperate for tractors in its attempt to expand its agriculture enough to feed Britain despite the great shipping disruption of the war . In 1917 , the British Ministry of Munitions selected the Fordson for both importation from the U.S. and domestic U.K. production . It was thought that domestic U.K. production was preferable because so much Atlantic shipping was being sunk that exporting tractors from the U.S. would be counterproductive , as many would be lost at sea . This was soon modified to exclude the London area because of concerns about its vulnerability to German attacks . Henry Ford decided to build the tractor at Cork , Ireland ( which at the time was still part of the U.K. ) , partly because he wanted to bring jobs to , and foster industriousness in , southern Ireland . But the Cork plant did not begin production until 1919 , after the war had ended . As events turned out , thousands of tractors were exported from the U.S. in 1917 and 1918 . </P> <P> The tractor used a 20 hp ( 15 kW ) , inline four - cylinder engine . The engine was similar to the Ford Model T engine in many respects . Like many engines of its day , it was multifuel - capable ; it was usually tuned for gasoline or kerosene , but alcohol could also be burned . ( Tractor vaporising oil ( TVO ) existed in 1920 but was not yet widely used . It entered broader use in the 1930s and 1940s . ) Like many other multifuel machines , the Fordson started on gasoline from a small auxiliary tank ( just a few quarts ) and then switched over to the main fuel tank once warmed up sufficiently ( no more than 5 minutes ) . To handle the kerosene ( or , rarely , TVO ) , the intake system had a vaporizer downstream of the carburetor . The mixture coming from the carburetor was intentionally rich , and the vaporizer heated it and mixed it with more air to lean it out to the final ratio before entering the intake manifold . The intake system also had a water - bath air cleaner to filter the dust out of the air inhaled by the engine ( an invention that did not originate at Ford but that was still rather novel in 1917 ) . Air cleaning is critical to engine lifespan , even for road vehicles and most especially for farming and construction vehicles ( which work in environments where dirt is frequently stirred up into the air ) . The Fordson carburetor and air cleaner were designed by Holley . In later decades , the water bath would be replaced with an oil bath for better filtering performance . </P> <P> The ignition system was similar to that of the Model T , with a flywheel - mounted low - tension magneto and trembler coils . The ignition timing was manually advanced or retarded with the spark advance lever mounted near the steering column , which rotated the timer . The cooling was by thermosiphon . ( In later decades , a high - tension magneto and a water pump would be added . ) The transmission was a three - speed spur gear ( the three forward speeds ranged from approximately 2 \u200b \u2044 to 6 \u200b \u2044 mph ) . A worm drive reduction set and a differential made up the rear . The design of the rear was patented for its ease of manufacture and service . Brakes were not provided on early Fordsons , as high - ratio worm sets generally transmitted rotation in one direction only , from the worm element to the gear element , because of the high power loss through friction . To stop the tractor , the driver depressed the clutch . </P> <P> Ford engineer Eugene Farkas successfully made the engine block , oil pan , transmission , and rear axle stressed members constituting the frame . By eliminating the need for a heavy separate frame , costs were reduced and manufacturing was simplified . Ford held a patent on a unit - frame tractor . The rear wheels were fabricated steel , spoked and cleated . The earliest ones were 12 - spoke ; a 14 - spoke version followed . Several models of front wheel were used , including 10 - spoked fabricated steel and 5 - spoke cast iron . Industrial models also used other wheels designed for specific tasks , including aftermarket wheels . </P> <P> In 1916 and 1917 , the name `` Fordson '' was not yet used as the tractor 's make or model name , nor was `` Model F '' . During this period , terms such as `` the ( real / genuine ) Ford tractor '' or `` the Henry Ford tractor '' , as well as `` the MOM tractor '' ( because almost all output was going to the British Ministry of Munitions ) , were used . In early 1918 , the name `` Fordson '' was trademarked , and within a few months it was being marked on the tractors . Published sources vary somewhat on the origin of the name . All agree that the name reflects the contemporary name of the tractor company , `` Henry Ford & Son '' , and its obvious eponyms : Henry and Edsel . Some claim that the company had been using the cable address `` Fordson '' for several years , which would mean even before the company was officially incorporated in July 1917 . Another implies that February 1918 marked the first use of `` Fordson '' in a cablegram . Regardless , by April 1918 the name `` Fordson '' was established as the brand , and its eponyms were obvious . In that month , U.S. sales began under County War Board distribution rules . The Model F designation ( for essentially the same model , with improvements ) began in 1919 . Sales boomed in 1918 and 1919 . </P> <P> There was nothing about the Fordson 's design or farming capabilities that was a `` first ever '' among tractors ( Ford 's version of a unit f\n", "answer": "1964"}

Colt is frequently the butt of jokes from his father and brother , particularly when it comes to his ranching skills ( or lack thereof ) and his disappointing pro football career . He is a heavy drinker and has a penchant for not using common sense , but he seems to have a heart of gold and tries to do right by others . Based on his various T - shirts and dialogue throughout the first season , it 's implied that Colt has played for the Barcelona Dragons , San Jose SaberCats , Spokane Shock , Orlando Predators , Nebraska Danger , Minnesota Axemen and Philadelphia Soul . Dialogue also states that he was a member of teams in Canada , notably the fictional Saskatoon Cold ( `` Like the Miami Heat ... only cold '' ) and Alaska . He also states in the first episode he was the back up of the back up of the back up for Florida State and won the championship in 1999 . </Li> <Li> Danny Masterson as Jameson `` Rooster '' Bennett , Colt 's older brother . He has lived and worked on the ranch since Colt left to follow his football career . Despite living in Colt 's shadow he is far more competent on the ranch as well as a more level headed thinker . He has however been just as irresponsible as Colt , drinking too much and sleeping around . </Li> <Li> Debra Winger as Margaret `` Maggie '' Bennett , owner of Maggie 's , and Colt and Rooster 's mother . Maggie is divorced from Beau and lives in a trailer behind the bar she owns . Much more lighthearted and caring than Beau , her company and advice is often sought out by the boys on how to deal with problems , especially those concerning their father . Maggie is something of a hippie and is an avid marijuana smoker . </Li> <Li> Elisha Cuthbert as Abigail `` Abby '' Phillips , a Garrison High School history teacher and Colt 's high school and current girlfriend . Abby was in a five - year relationship with Kenny and was briefly engaged to him , but ultimately she broke it off and hooked back up with Colt .

A Vietnam War veteran , he has worked the ranch since returning from the war and taking it over after his father died . Beau is difficult to get along with , perpetually annoyed with everyone and everything . He detests many modern amenities and is easily angered by his sons ' antics .

Burton reprised the role in 2017 . Jason was born offscreen in September 1981 and the character made his onscreen debut in November 1981 as the son of Dr. Alan Quartermaine ( Stuart Damon ) and his mistress , Susan Moore ( Gail Ramsey ) , later adopted by Alan 's wife Dr. Monica Quartermaine ( Leslie Charleson ) .

Child actor Bryan Beck stepped into the role on September 8 , 1982 to 1986 . </P> <P> On December 19 , 1991 , Burton stepped into the role on a contractual basis as a SORASed Jason Quartermaine . In November 1999 , ABC confirmed that Burton had decided not to renew his contract which expired in December to pursue other opportunities . Burton last appeared on contract on January 27 , 2000 . In June 2000 , ABC confirmed that Burton would reprise his role for a six - week stint starting on August 25 , 2000 until he last appeared on October 10 , 2000 . In December 2000 , it was announced that Burton would return to the series once again and began airing on January 29 , 2001 . In January 2001 , Burton announced that his return was only temporary due to his commitment to film a pilot for his DreamWorks Television development deal . Whether he returned to the role full - time would depend on whether the series was picked up . The pilot was not picked up , Burton landed a role in a major motion picture leading to his departure on April 29 , 2001 . Burton returned to the series on contract in 2002 during May Sweeps . </P> <P> In late 2008 , Burton 's contract expired and forcing to make a decision on re-signing with the show . After months of speculation , he announced in a public appearance that he re-signed with the show . Burton stated that he would be willing to take a pay cut because he understands that money is a lot tighter now than it has been in recent years and stated that he is blessed to have a job right now . In 2011 , rumors began circulating that Burton could depart from the series due to contract negotiations . However , in May 2011 Burton announced via Twitter that he had re-signed with the series again . On August 23 , 2012 , Jamey Giddens of the website Daytime Confidential reported that contract negotiations were not going well and Burton was close to walking away from the series . On August 28 , 2012 , Burton confirmed in an interview with TV Guide 's Michael Logan that he would exit the series and agreed to stay long enough for the producers to write his character out properly . Following the announcement that Sean Kanan ( A.J. Quartermaine ) was returning to the series in an undisclosed role , rumors began circulating that Kanan might be a recast of Jason . Kanan 's resemblance to Burton fed into the rumors . </P> <P> On September 2 , 2014 , executive producer Frank Valentini announced on Twitter that former All My Children and The Young and the Restless actor Billy Miller would join the cast as Jason . On September 30 , 2014 , Miller 's air date as Jason was revealed to be on October 1 . </P> <P> In June 2017 , it was announced that Burton would return to the series in an undisclosed role , later referred to as `` Patient 6 . '' In November 2017 , it was announced that Burton had reprised the role of Jason , while Miller 's casting was retconned to the character of Andrew Cain . </P> <H3> Characterization ( edit ) </H3> `` I guess the writers started seeing something that was happening and they had the idea of making me a new character and basically starting from scratch . It has been a great journey for me as an actor and for me , personally . '' -- Burton on Jason Morgan <P> Steve Burton 's early years on the soap as the `` rich , wholesome preppy '' Jason Quartermaine would come to a shocking , and dramatic end in 1995 after a car accident caused by his brother , A.J. leaves the character as a brain damaged amnesiac . Following Jason 's split from the Quartermaines , except for his sister Emily and grandmother Lila Morgan Quartermaine ( Anna Lee ) , and a change of his surname to Morgan , he would become the right - hand man for mob boss , Sonny Corinthos ( Maurice Benard ) . At the time , Burton was considering leaving the show and joked that a producer noted that he played every scene , the same way , as if someone was about to die . Burton 's decision to stay stemmed from a conversation with Benard who gave him advice on how to improve . While still portraying Jason Quartermaine , the writers saw the chemistry between him and Benard and decided to create Jason Morgan . </P> `` Am I a villain ? I guess . If I kill people , then I guess I 'm a villain . The audience knows that it 's been done . But they do n't care . '' -- Burton on his character 's change in direction <P> With a new personality shift , Burton 's Jason went from `` preppy and wholesome '' to `` angry , stoic and emotionless . '' In the early stages of his transformation into Jason Morgan , he would experience fits of rage and was even given the nickname `` anger boy . '' Post accident , as Jason matured the fits of rage subsided , Jason was very light and fun during his relationship with Robin Scorpio . It was n't until after he was hurt multiple times that Jason grew darker and more intense . Jason was seen as `` stone cold , '' and he did n't show much personality , unless it was with his closest loved ones . Despite the drastic change , Burton described his character as `` vulnerable , caring , honest , and honorable '' around those that he loves . Burton welcomed the change in story for his character , noting that it can sometimes become annoying playing `` just plain nice '' all the time . Within the mob and despite constant conflicts with law enforcement , Jason operated as a vigilante often taking down criminals who targeted the Corinthos family and tried to bring illegal substances and weapons into Port Charles , New York . Jason was known to show loyalty and compassion to those he held closest to him . His acts of extreme loyalty and compassion could be seen through his friendships with Sonny and Carly , his romantic relationships and his relationship with his nephew Michael , who he raised for the first year of Michael 's life . The passing years also saw a thaw in Jason 's relationship with the Quartermaines . The death of his father Alan and a shooting that left Michael in a year - long coma opened his eyes to what the Quartermaines suffered after his own accident . For that point on , Jason was shown to be more open to a relationship with his mother Monica , and eventually his grandfather Edward Quartermaine ( John Ingle ) . The extent of the thaw with his family could also be seen through Jason 's decision to name his son , Daniel Edward , after his grandfather . </P> <H2> Storylines ( edit ) </H2> <H3> 1980s ( edit ) </H3> <P> Jason was conceived out of his father , Alan Quartermaine 's ( Stuart Damon ) , affair with Susan Moore ( Gail Ramsey ) . Jason was born on September 14 , 1981 at Our Lady of Mercy Hospital in New York City . When Jason was born , Alan supported him financially , but was fighting for custody of his other son , A.J. . Jason lived with his mother and Scott Baldwin ( Kin Shriner ) up until her death , upon which he lived with Susan 's aunt , Alice Grant ( Lieux Dressler ) . Then he moved into the Quartermaine mansion with Alan . Alan 's wife , Monica ( Leslie Charleson ) , initially rejected Jason , but eventually grew to love him and later adopted him . Jason and A.J. were sent off to boarding school as children . In December 1991 , Jason was aged several years , re-establishing his birth year as 1974 then to 1976 in 2016 . </P> <H3> 1990s ( edit ) </H3> <P> When a newly SORASed Jason and older brother A.J. return to town , Jason , who is a successful student and athlete , is treated as the family favorite while A.J. is failing and dealing with alcoholism .

Jason supports Monica through her health crisis with breast cancer and adores his adoptive sister , Emily Quartermaine ( then Amber Tamblyn ) . In December 1995 , an intoxicated A.J. runs his car into a tree . Jason , who was attempting to stop A.J. from driving , is in the passenger seat and hits his head on a large boulder after being ejected from the car . Jason suffers brain injuries that result in total memory loss . Upon waking up from his coma , Jason had no recollection of his past and resented all of the Quartermaines except his grandmother Lila Quartermaine ( Anna Lee ) and sister Emily . His personality drastically changes . Jason eventually turns his back on his family , and changes his surname to Morgan , Lila 's maiden name . Jason meets Robin again on a bridge and they begin a friendship which turns into a romantic relationship . Robin encouraged Jason to develop relationships with Lila , Emily , and Monica , and he stood by Robin at the Nurses Ball , where she shares with Port Charles for the first time that she is HIV positive . Robin leaves for college at Yale University and Jason asks her friend Sonny Corinthos ( Maurice Benard ) for a job . His loyalty and hard work impress Sonny . Jason becomes Sonny 's personal enforcer in his mob business . Robin returns in 1997 and was with Jason when he was shot for the first time by the Tin Man . Jason was operated on and saved .

For the Australian rules football team , see Australian Convicts . Drawing of convicts in New Holland , 1793 <P> Between 1788 and 1868 , about 162,000 convicts were transported by the British government to various penal colonies in Australia . </P> <P> The British government began transporting convicts overseas to American colonies in the early 17th century . When transportation ended with the start of the American Revolution , an alternative site was needed to relieve further overcrowding of British prisons and hulks . Earlier in 1770 , James Cook charted and claimed possession of the east coast of Australia for Britain . Seeking to pre-empt the French colonial empire from expanding into the region , Britain chose Australia as the site of a penal colony , and in 1787 , the First Fleet of eleven convict ships set sail for Botany Bay , arriving on 20 January 1788 to found Sydney , New South Wales , the first European settlement on the continent . Other penal colonies were later established in Van Diemen 's Land ( Tasmania ) in 1803 and Queensland in 1824 , while Western Australia , founded in 1829 as a free colony , received convicts from 1850 . Victoria and South Australia remained free colonies . Penal transportation to Australia peaked in the 1830s and dropped off significantly the following decade . The last convict ship arrived in Western Australia on 10 January 1868 . </P> <P> Many convicts were transported for petty crimes , while a significant number were political prisoners . More serious crimes , such as rape and murder , were punishable by death , and therefore not transportable offences . Once emancipated , most ex-convicts stayed in Australia and joined the free settlers , with some rising to prominent positions in Australian society . However , convictism carried a social stigma , and for some later Australians , convict origins would be a source of shame . Attitudes became more accepting in the 20th century and it is now considered by many Australians to be a cause for celebration to have a convict in one 's lineage . Around 20 % of modern Australians are descended from transported convicts . The convict era has inspired famous novels , films , and other cultural works , and the extent to which it has shaped Australia 's national character has been studied by many writers and historians . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Reasons for transportation </Li> <Li> 2 Penal settlements <Ul> <Li> 2.1 New South Wales </Li> <Li> 2.2 Norfolk Island </Li> <Li> 2.3 Tasmania </Li> <Li> 2.4 Victoria </Li> <Li> 2.5 Queensland </Li> <Li> 2.6 Western Australia </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Women </Li> <Li> 4 Political prisoners </Li> <Li> 5 Cessation of transportation </Li> <Li> 6 Legacy <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Cultural depictions </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Notable convicts transported to Australia </Li> <Li> 8 See also </Li> <Li> 9 Sources </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Reasons for transportation ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Penal transportation William Hogarth 's Gin Lane , 1751 <P> According to Robert Hughes in The Fatal Shore , the population of England and Wales , which had remained steady at 6 million from 1700 to 1740 , began rising considerably after 1740 . By the time of the American Revolution , London was overcrowded , filled with the unemployed , and flooded with cheap gin . Poverty , social injustice , child labor , harsh and dirty living conditions and long working hours were prevalent in 19th - century Britain . Dickens ' novels perhaps best illustrate this ; even some government officials were horrified by what they saw . Only in 1833 and 1844 were the first general laws against child labour ( the Factory Acts ) passed in the United Kingdom . Crime had become a major problem and in 1784 a French observer noted that `` from sunset to dawn the environs of London became the patrimony of brigands for twenty miles around . '' </P> Prison hulks in the River Thames <P> Each parish had a watchman , but British cities did not have police forces in the modern sense . Jeremy Bentham avidly promoted the idea of a circular prison , but the penitentiary was seen by many government officials as a peculiar American concept . Virtually all malefactors were caught by informers or denounced to the local court by their victims . Pursuant to the so - called `` Bloody Code '' , by the 1770s there were 222 crimes in Britain which carried the death penalty , almost all of which were crimes against property . These included such offences as the stealing of goods worth over 5 shillings , the cutting down of a tree , the theft of an animal , even the theft of a rabbit from a warren . </P> <P> The Industrial Revolution led to an increase in petty crime due to the economic displacement of much of the population , building pressure on the government to find an alternative to confinement in overcrowded gaols . The situation was so dire that hulks left over from the Seven Years ' War were used as makeshift floating prisons . Eight of every 10 prisoners were in jail for theft . The Bloody Code was gradually rescinded in the 1800s because judges and juries considered its punishments too harsh . Since lawmakers still wanted punishments to deter potential criminals , they increasingly applied transportation as a more humane alternative to execution . Transportation had been employed as a punishment for both major and petty crimes since the seventeenth century . Around 60,000 convicts were transported to the British colonies in North America in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . Transportation to the Americas ceased following Britain 's defeat in the American Revolutionary War . The number of convicts transported to North America is not verified although it has been estimated to be 50,000 by John Dunmore Lang and 120,000 by Thomas Keneally . The British American colony of Maryland received a larger felon quota than any other province . </P> <H2> Penal settlements ( edit ) </H2> <H3> New South Wales ( edit ) </H3> Main article : History of New South Wales The First Fleet arrives in Botany Bay , 21 January 1788 The Costumes of the Australasians : watercolour by Edward Charles Close shows the co-existence of convicts , their military gaolers , and free settlers . <P> Alternatives to the American colonies were investigated and the newly discovered and mapped East Coast of New Holland was proposed . The details provided by James Cook during his expedition to the South Pacific in 1770 made it the most suitable . </P> <P> On 18 August 1786 the decision was made to send a colonisation party of convicts , military , and civilian personnel to Botany Bay under the command of Admiral Arthur Phillip who was to be the Governor of the new colony . There were 775 convicts on board six transport ships . They were accompanied by officials , members of the crew , marines , the families thereof and their own children who together totaled 645 . In all , eleven ships were sent in what became known as the First Fleet . Other than the convict transports , there were two naval escorts and three storeships . The fleet assembled in Portsmouth and set sail on 13 May 1787 . </P> <P> The fleet arrived at Botany Bay on 20 January 1788 . It soon became clear that it would not be suitable for the establishment of a colony due to `` the openness of this bay , and the dampness of the soil , by which the people would probably be rendered unhealthy '' and Philip decided to examine Port Jackson , a bay mentioned by Captain Cook , about three leagues to the north . On 22 January a small expedition led by Phillips sailed to Port Jackson , arriving in the early afternoon : </P> <P> Here all regret arising from the former disappointments was at once obliterated ; and Governor Phillip had the satisfaction to find one of the finest harbours in the world , in which a thousand sail of the line might ride in perfect security . The different coves of this harbour were examined with all possible expedition , and the preference was given to one which had the finest spring of water , and in which ships can anchor so close to the shore , that at a very small expence quays may be constructed at which the largest vessels may unload . This cove is about half a mile in length , and a quarter of a mile across at the entrance . In honour of Lord Sydney , the Governor distinguished it by the name of Sydney Cove . </P> <P> There they established the first permanent European colony on the Australian continent , New South Wales , on 26 January . The area has since developed into the city of Sydney . This date is still celebrated as Australia Day . </P> <P> There was initially a high mortality rate amongst the members of the first fleet due mainly to shortages of food . The ships carried only enough food to provide for the settlers until they could establish agriculture in the region . Unfortunately , there were an insufficient number of skilled farmers and domesticated livestock to do this , and the colony waited for the arrival of the Second Fleet . The second fleet was an unprecedented disaster that provided little in the way of help and upon its delivery in June 1790 of still more sick and dying convicts , which actually worsened the situation in Port Jackson . </P> <P> Lieutenant - General Sir Richard Bourke was the ninth Governor of the Colony of New South Wales between 1831 and 1837 . Appalled by the excessive punishments doled out to convicts , Bourke passed ' The Magistrates Act ' , which limited the sentence a magistrate could pass to fifty lashes ( previously there was no such limit ) . Bourke 's administration was controversial , and furious magistrates and employers petitioned the crown against this interference with their legal rights , fearing that a reduction in punishments would cease to provide enough deterrence to the convicts . </P> <P> Bourke , however , was not dissuaded from his reforms and continued to create controversy within the colony by combating the inhumane treatment handed out to convicts , including limiting the number of convicts each employer was allowed to seventy , as well as granting rights to freed convicts , such as allowing the acquisition of property and service on juries . It has been argued that the suspension of convict transportation to New South Wales in 1840 can be attributed to the actions of Bourke and other men like Australian - born lawyer William Charles Wentworth . It took another 10 years , but transportation to the colony of New South Wales was finally officially abolished on 1 October 1850 . </P> <P> If a convict was well behaved , the convict could be given a ticket of leave , granting some freedom . At the end of the convict 's sentence , seven years in most cases , the convict was issued with a Certificate of Freedom . He was then free to become a settler or to return to England . Convicts who misbehaved , however , were often sent to a place of secondary punishment like Port Arthur , Tasmania or Norfolk Island , where they would suffer additional punishment and solitary confinement . </P> <H3> Norfolk Island ( edit ) </H3> Main article : History of Norfolk Island <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs expansion . You can help by adding to it . ( August 2015 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> Norfolk Island military barracks <P> Within a month of the arrival of the First Fleet at Sydney Cove , a group of convicts and free settlers were sent to take control of Norfolk Island , a small island 1,412 kilometres ( 877 mi ) east of the coast of New South Wales . More convicts were sent , and many of them proved to be unruly ; early 1789 saw a failed attempt to overthrow Lieutenant Philip Gidley King , the island 's commandant . This was followed by the wreck of the HMS Sirius on one of the island 's reefs while attempting to land stores . </P> <H3> Tasmania ( edit ) </H3> Main article : History of Tasmania Penitentiary at the Port Arthur convict settlement , Tasmania <P> In 1803 , a British expedition was sent from Sydney to Tasmania ( then known as Van Diemen 's Land ) to establish a new penal colony there . The small party , led by Lt. John Bowen , established a settlement at Risdon Cove , on the eastern side of the Derwent River . Originally sent to Port Philip , but abandoned within weeks , another expedition led by Lieutenant - Colonel David Collins arrived soon after . Collins considered the Risdon Cove site inadequate , and in 1804 he established an alternative settlement on the western side of the river at Sullivan 's Cove , Tasmania . This later became known as Hobart , and the original settlement at Risdon Cove was deserted . Collins became the first Lieutenant - Governor of Van Diemen 's Land . </P> <P> When the convict station on Norfolk Island was abandoned in 1807 - 1808 , the remaining convicts and free settlers were transported to Hobart and allocated land for re-settlement . However , as the existing small population was already experiencing difficulties producing enough food , the sudden doubling of the population was almost catastrophic . </P> <P> Starting in 1816 , more free settlers began arriving from Great Britain . On 3 December 1825 Tasmania was declared a colony separate from New South Wales , with a separate administration . </P> Macquarie\n", "answer": "1788"}

She was the second of five children , following Mary Amelia . Their three younger siblings were Caroline Celestia , Charles Frederick ( who died in infancy ) , and Grace Pearl . Wilder 's birth site is commemorated by a replica log cabin , the Little House Wayside . Life there formed the basis for her first book , Little House in the Big Woods ( 1932 ) . Wilder was a descendant of the Delano family , an ancestral family of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt . A progenitor of the Delano family emigrated to the Plymouth Colony in the early 1620s ; another family ancestor , Edmund Rice , emigrated in 1638 to the Massachusetts Bay Colony . One paternal ancestor , Edmund Ingalls , was born on June 27 , 1586 , in Skirbeck , Lincolnshire , England , and emigrated to America , where he died in Lynn , Massachusetts , on September 16 , 1648 . </P> <H3> Family on the move ( edit ) </H3> <P> Wilder moved with her family from Wisconsin in the year 1869 , when she was two years old . They stopped in Rothville , Missouri , and settled in Kansas , in Indian country near what is now Independence . Her younger sister Carrie ( 1870 -- 1946 ) was born there in August 1870 , not long before they moved again . According to Wilder in later years , her father had been told that the location would soon be open to white settlers but that was incorrect ; their homestead was actually on the Osage Indian reservation and they had no legal right to occupy it . They had just begun to farm when they heard rumors that the settlers would be evicted , and they departed in spring of 1871 . Although Laura portrayed the leave and that of other settlers as prompted by rumors of eviction in both her novel and in her Pioneer Girl memoirs , in the memoirs she also noted that her parents needed to recover their Wisconsin land because the buyer had not paid the entire mortgage . Several Kansas neighbors apparently were allowed to buy the land they had settled on so the rumors may have been untrue . </P> <P> From Kansas , the Ingalls family returned to Wisconsin , where they lived for the next three years . Those experiences formed the basis for the novels Little House in the Big Woods ( 1932 ) and Little House on the Prairie ( 1935 ) . The fictional chronology of Wilder 's books in this regard does not match fact : Wilder was two to four years old in Kansas and four to seven in Wisconsin ; in the novels she is four to five in Wisconsin ( Big Woods ) and six to seven in Kansas ( Prairie ) . According to a letter from her daughter , Rose Wilder Lane , to biographer William Anderson , the publisher had Wilder change her age in Prairie because it seemed unrealistic for a three - year - old to have memories so specific about her story of life in Kansas . To be consistent with her already established chronology , Wilder portrayed herself six to seven years old in Prairie and seven to nine years old in On the Banks of Plum Creek ( 1937 ) , the third volume of her fictionalized history , which takes place around 1874 . </P> <P> On the Banks of Plum Creek shows the family moving from Kansas to an area near Walnut Grove , Minnesota and settling in a dugout `` on the banks of Plum Creek '' . They really moved there from Wisconsin when Wilder was about seven years old , after briefly living with the family of Laura 's Uncle Peter Ingalls , first in their house in the Big Woods of Wisconsin and then on rented land near Lake City , Minnesota . In Walnut Grove Laura 's family first lived in a dugout on a preemption claim ; after wintering in the dugout they moved into a new house built on the same land . Two summers of ruined crops led the Ingalls to move to Iowa . On the way they stayed again with Laura 's Uncle Peter Ingalls , this time on his own farm near South Troy , Minnesota . Wilder 's younger and only brother , Charles Frederick Ingalls ( `` Freddie '' ) , was born there on November 1 , 1875 , and died nine months later on August 27 , 1876 . In Burr Oak , Iowa the Ingalls family helped run a hotel . Wilder 's youngest sibling , Grace , was born there on May 23 , 1877 . </P> <P> The family moved from Burr Oak back to Walnut Grove , where Wilder 's father served as the town butcher and justice of the peace . He accepted a railroad job in the spring of 1879 , which took him to eastern Dakota Territory , where they joined him that fall . Wilder did not write about 1876 -- 1877 , when they lived near Burr Oak , but skipped directly to Dakota Territory , portrayed in By the Shores of Silver Lake ( 1939 ) . Thus the fictional timeline caught up with her real life . </P> <H3> De Smet ( edit ) </H3> <P> Wilder 's father filed for a formal homestead over the winter of 1879 -- 1880 . De Smet , South Dakota became her parents ' and sister Mary Ingalls ' home for the remainder of their lives . After spending the mild winter of 1879 -- 1880 in the surveyor 's house , they watched the town of De Smet rise up from the prairie in 1880 . The following winter , 1880 -- 1881 , one of the most severe on record in the Dakotas , was later described by Wilder in her novel , The Long Winter ( 1940 ) . Once the family was settled in De Smet , Wilder attended school , worked several part - time jobs , and made friends . Among them was bachelor homesteader , Almanzo Wilder . This time in her life is documented in the books Little Town on the Prairie ( 1941 ) and These Happy Golden Years ( 1943 ) . </P> <H3> Young teacher ( edit ) </H3> <P> On December 10 , 1882 , two months before her 16th birthday , Wilder accepted her first teaching position . She taught three terms in one - room schools when she was not attending school in De Smet . ( In Little Town on the Prairie she receives her first teaching certificate on December 24 , 1882 , but that was an enhancement for dramatic effect. ) Her original `` Third Grade '' teaching certificate can be seen on page 25 of William Anderson 's book Laura 's Album ( 1998 ) . She later admitted she did not particularly enjoy teaching but felt the responsibility from a young age to help her family financially , and wage - earning opportunities for women were limited . Between 1883 and 1885 , she taught three terms of school , worked for the local dressmaker , and attended high school , although she did not graduate . </P> Laura and Almanzo Wilder , circa 1885 <P> Wilder 's teaching career and studies ended when she married Almanzo Wilder , whom she called `` Manly '' , on August 25 , 1885 . As he had a sister named Laura , his nickname for Wilder became `` Bess '' , from her middle name , Elizabeth . Wilder was 18 and he was 28 . He had achieved a degree of prosperity on his homestead claim , and their prospects seemed bright . She joined him in a new home , north of De Smet . </P> <H3> Children ( edit ) </H3> <P> On December 5 , 1886 , Wilder gave birth to her daughter Rose Wilder . In 1889 , Wilder gave birth to a son who died at 12 days of age before being named . He was buried at De Smet , Kingsbury County , in South Dakota . On the grave marker , he is remembered as `` Baby Son of A.J. Wilder '' . </P> <H3> Early marriage ( edit ) </H3> <P> Their first few years of marriage for the Wilders were frequently difficult . Complications from a life - threatening bout of diphtheria left Wilder 's husband partially paralyzed . While he eventually regained nearly full use of his legs , he needed a cane to walk for the remainder of his life . This setback , among many others , began a series of disastrous events that included the death of their newborn son ; the destruction of their barn along with its hay and grain by a mysterious fire ; the total loss of their home from a fire accidentally set by their daughter ; and several years of severe drought that left them in debt , physically ill , and unable to earn a living from their 320 acres ( 129.5 hectares ) of prairie land . These trials were documented in Wilder 's book The First Four Years ( published in 1971 ) . Around 1890 , the couple left De Smet and spent about a year resting at the home of Wilder 's husband 's parents on their Spring Valley , Minnesota farm before moving briefly to Westville , Florida , in search of a climate to improve Wilder 's husband 's health . They found , however , that the dry plains they were used to were very different from the humidity they encountered in Florida . The weather , along with feeling out of place among the locals , encouraged their return to De Smet in 1892 , where they purchased a small home . </P> <H2> Move to Mansfield , Missouri ( edit ) </H2> Rocky Ridge Farm , Mansfield , Missouri <P> In 1894 , the Wilder family moved to Mansfield , Missouri , and used their savings to make the down payment on an undeveloped property just outside town . They named the place Rocky Ridge Farm and moved into a ramshackle log cabin . At first , Wilder and her husband earned income only from wagon loads of fire wood they would sell in town for 50 cents . Financial security came slowly . Apple trees they planted did not bear fruit for seven years . Wilder 's parents - in - law visited around that time and gave them the deed to the house they had been renting in Mansfield , which was the economic boost Wilder 's family needed . They then added to the property outside town , and eventually accrued nearly 200 acres ( 80.9 hectares ) . Around 1910 , they sold the house in town , moved back to the farm , and completed the farmhouse with the proceeds . What began as about 40 acres ( 16.2 hectares ) of thickly wooded , stone - covered hillside with a windowless log cabin became in 20 years a relatively prosperous poultry , dairy , and fruit farm , and a 10 - room farmhouse . </P> <P> Wilder and her husband had learned from cultivating wheat as their sole crop in De Smet . They diversified Rocky Ridge Farm with poultry , a dairy farm , and a large apple orchard . Wilder became active in various clubs and was an advocate for several regional farm associations . She was recognized as an authority in poultry farming and rural living , which led to invitations to speak to groups around the region . </P> <H2> Writing career ( edit ) </H2> <P> An invitation to submit an article to the Missouri Ruralist in 1911 led to Wilder 's permanent position as a columnist and editor with that publication , which she held until the mid-1920s . She also took a paid position with the local Farm Loan Association , dispensing small loans to local farmers . </P> <P> Wilder 's column in the Ruralist , `` As a Farm Woman Thinks '' , introduced her to a loyal audience of rural Ozarkians , who enjoyed her regular columns . Her topics ranged from home and family , including her 1915 trip to San Francisco , California , to visit her daughter and the Pan-Pacific exhibition , to World War I and other world events , and to the fascinating world travels of her daughter as well as Wilder 's own thoughts on the increasing options offered to women during this era . While the couple was never wealthy until the `` Little House '' books began to achieve popularity , the farming operation and Wilder 's income from writing and the Farm Loan Association provided them with a stable living . </P> <P> `` ( By ) 1924 '' , according to the Professor John E. Miller , `` ( a ) fter more than a decade of writing for farm papers , Wilder had become a disciplined writer , able to produce thoughtful , readable prose for a general audience . '' At this time , her now - married daughter , Rose Wilder Lane , helped her publish two articles describing the interior of the farmhouse , in Country Gentleman magazine . </P> <P> It was also around this time that Lane began intensively encouraging Wilder to improve her writing skills with a view toward greater success as a writer than Lane had already achieved . The Wilders , according to Miller , had come to `` ( depend ) on annual income subsidies from their increasingly famous and successful daughter . '' They both had concluded that the solution for improving their retirement income was for Wilder to become a successful writer , herself . However , the `` project never proceeded very far . '' </P> <P> In 1928 , Lane hired out the construction of an English - style stone cottage for her parents on property adjacent to the farmhouse they had personally built and still inhabited . She remodeled and took it over . </P> <H3> Little House books ( edit ) </H3> Main article : List of Little House on the Prairie b\n\nQuestion:\nwhen did laura ingalls wilder move to missouri\n", "answer": "1894"}

'' </P> <P> On August 15 , 1997 -- the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary -- John Paul II promulgated the Latin typical edition , with his apostolic letter , Laetamur Magnopere . The Latin text , which became the official text of reference ( editio typica ) , amended the contents of the provisional French text at a few points . One of the changes consisted in the inclusion of the position on death penalty that is defended in John Paul II 's encyclical Evangelium Vitae of 1995 . </P> <P> As a result , the earlier translations from the French into other languages ( including English ) had to be amended and re-published as `` second editions '' . </P> <H2> Doctrinal value ( edit ) </H2> <P> In the apostolic constitution Fidei depositum , John Paul II declared that the Catechism of the Catholic Church is `` a valid and legitimate instrument for ecclesial communion and a sure norm for teaching the faith '' , and stressed that it `` is not intended to replace the local catechisms duly approved by the ecclesiastical authorities , the diocesan Bishops and the Episcopal Conferences '' . </P> <H2> Contents ( edit ) </H2> <P> A catechism has been defined as `` a book that explains the beliefs of the Christian religion by using a list of questions and answers '' . Documents of religious instruction have been written since the beginning of Christianity and a catechism is typically an assemblage of these smaller documents into one large compilation of Church doctrine and teachings . </P> <P> The Catechism itself is not in question - and - answer format . Rather , it is instead a source on which to base such catechisms ( e.g. Youcat and the United States Catholic Catechism for Adults ) and other expositions of Catholic doctrine , called a `` major catechism . '' As stated in the apostolic constitution Fidei depositum , with which its publication was ordered , it was given so `` that it may be a sure and authentic reference text for teaching Catholic doctrine and particularly for preparing local catechisms . '' </P> <P> The Catechism is arranged in four principal parts : </P> <Ul> <Li> The Profession of Faith ( the Apostle 's Creed ) </Li> <Li> The Celebration of the Christian Mystery ( the Sacred Liturgy , and especially the sacraments ) </Li> <Li> Life in Christ ( including the Ten Commandments ) </Li> <Li> Christian Prayer ( including the Lord 's Prayer ) </Li> </Ul> <P> This scheme is often referred to as the `` Four Pillars '' of the Faith . The contents are abundantly footnoted with references to sources of the teaching , in particular the Scriptures , the Church Fathers , and the Ecumenical Councils and other authoritative Catholic statements , principally those issued by recent popes . </P> <P> The section on Scripture in the Catechism recovers the Patristic tradition of `` spiritual exegesis '' as further developed through the scholastic doctrine of the `` four senses . '' This return to spiritual exegesis is based on the Second Vatican Council 's 1965 dogmatic constitution Dei verbum , which taught that Scripture should be `` read and interpreted in light of the same Spirit by whom it was written '' . The Catechism amplifies Dei verbum by specifying that the necessary spiritual interpretation should be sought through the four senses of Scripture , which encompass the literal sense and the three spiritual senses ( allegorical , moral , and anagogical ) . </P> <P> The literal sense pertains to the meaning of the words themselves , including any figurative meanings . The spiritual senses pertain to the significance of the things ( persons , places , objects or events ) denoted by the words . Of the three spiritual senses , the allegorical sense is foundational . It relates persons , events , and institutions of earlier covenants to those of later covenants , and especially to the New Covenant . Building on the allegorical sense , the moral sense instructs in regard to action , and the anagogical sense points to man 's final destiny . The teaching of the Catechism on Scripture has encouraged the pursuit of covenantal theology , an approach that employs the four senses to structure salvation history via the biblical covenants . </P> <H2> Comments ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 1992 , Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger ( later Pope Benedict XVI ) noted : </P> <P> It clearly show ( s ) that the problem of what we must do as human beings , of how we should live our lives so that we and the world may become just , is the essential problem of our day , and basically of all ages . After the fall of ideologies , the problem of man -- the moral problem -- is presented to today 's context in a totally new way : What should we do ? How does life become just ? What can give us and the whole world a future which is worth living ? Since the catechism treats these questions , it is a book which interests many people , far beyond purely theological or ecclesial circles . </P> <P> Ulf Ekman , former Charismatic pastor and the founder of Livets Ord , says that the Catechism is `` the best book he has ever read '' . </P> <H2> Derived works ( edit ) </H2> <P> It was expected that the universal Catechism would serve as a source and template for inculturated national catechisms . In the United States , for example , the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops published the United States Catholic Catechism for Adults , officially replacing their previous version , the Baltimore Catechism , though it had already been out of use for nearly forty years . </P> <P> The Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church was published in 2005 , and the first edition in English in 2006 . It is a more concise and dialogic version of the Catechism . The text of the Compendium is available in fourteen languages on the Vatican website , which also gives the text of the Catechism itself in nine languages . </P> <P> Youcat , a catechism for youth , based on the Catechism and its Compendium , was published in 2011 . The Vatican has acknowledged that some translations of Youcat contain errors regarding Church teaching on the status of other religions , contraception and euthanasia , whether due to simple error or poor translations . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Catholicism portal </Li> <Li> Christianity portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Catholic Catechist </Li> <Li> Catholic Directory </Li> <Li> Catholic spirituality </Li> <Li> Glossary of the Catholic Church </Li> <Li> History of the Catholic Church since 1962 </Li> <Li> Index of Catholic Church articles </Li> <Li> Outline of Catholicism </Li> <Li> Pastoral care </Li> <Li> Catholic theology </Li> <Li> Second Vatican Council </Li> <Li> The Common Catechism </Li> <Li> Timeline of the Catholic Church </Li> <Li> Universal call to holiness </Li> <Li> Vocational Discernment in the Catholic Church </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ In an interview in 30Days , 3 - 2004 Cottier remarked : `` Going back to the early years , the first ' big ' text I worked on was the social encyclical Centesimus annus .

This was to coincide with increasing deregulation of the private sector rental market as it was felt at the time that local authorities would have a better understanding of local rental market conditions than the DSS . Its full transfer took place in 1989 as part of a major reform of social security legislation which also saw the introduction of Income Support . </P> <H2> Concepts and terminology ( edit ) </H2> <P> Housing Benefit will only meet the pure rent costs of any liability . Central to benefit decisions is an assessment of eligible rent and ineligible services . Eligible rent is that part of the rent paid by a person which can legally be covered by housing benefit . Ineligible services are the parts of the claimant 's rent liability that he must meet himself . Ineligible services include such things as the cost of heating , lighting , water rates , meals and any general counselling and support that may be included in the rent charged but will not be met by Housing Benefit . </P> <P> The payment of the benefit is centred on the concept of a benefit week , which is a seven - day period running from a Monday to a Sunday . Housing Benefit may be paid on a weekly , fortnightly , lunar monthly or calendar monthly basis . Housing Benefit paid to landlords is usually paid four weeks in arrears . Regulations require local authorities to take into account the needs of the claimant when deciding on the frequency of benefit payments , however due to the complexity of calculating a calendar monthly payment and especially any overpayments that arise , most local authorities pay benefit fortnightly to claimants and four weekly to landlords . </P> <P> For claimants not on a `` passported benefit '' , the concept of a benefit week is particularly important as benefit will only be paid from the start of a tenancy if the form is requested on the same benefit week as moving in . In all other cases for tenants not on a passported benefit , Housing Benefit will start only from the Monday after the form was requested . If the form is returned within a month of request , otherwise benefit is payable from the Monday after the council receives it . </P> <P> Applicants who successfully apply for a passported benefit along with their Housing Benefit have a calendar month to return the Housing Benefit form , from the date of application to the passported benefit . If the form is returned within one month of that date benefit starts from the Monday after the start date of the passported benefit - even if that benefit is backdated . </P> <P> Originally using paper application forms , in recent years local authorities have begun to use a telephone - based application process . Under these latter application schemes , claimants would often contact the responsible central government department , who would then forward the details to the local authority . This has turned out to be a somewhat prescient decision ; the gateway for claimants to the new Universal Credit system , which replaces Housing Benefit , is the central government department , not local authorities . </P> <P> The date of claim will be the date the claimant you first contacted the Department for Works and Pensions , for claimants applying to the Department for Work and Pensions , and otherwise the date of claim will be treated as the date he contacted the Local Authority . </P> <H2> Benefit cap ( edit ) </H2> Main article : benefit cap <P> Due to a benefit cap many claimants have had their housing benefit reduced to 50p a week and are at risk of losing their homes if they can not pay their rent . New building providing supported housing for vulnerable people is being cut due to uncertainty whether prospective tenants will be able to pay the rent . Schemes affected include homes for war veterans , for people with learning disabilities helping them live independently . Safe housing for domestic violence victims could also be at risk . New schemes are postponed or cancelled and existing schemes are being closed . David Orr of the National Housing Federation said , `` With social care in crisis , the role supported housing plays in alleviating pressures on the NHS is ever more important . These changes have not even come in yet and they have taken 7,000 homes for vulnerable people out of the pipeline . The proposed changes in funding bear no relation to the real cost of providing this type of housing . It is time government put supported housing on a secure and sustainable footing . '' The most vulnerable people , elderly people , severely disabled people and people with mental health problems need a great deal of support and the benefit cap disproportionately pprevents them from getting what they need . </P> <P> Polly Neate of Shelter said , `` The money put forward ( by the government for social housing ) is only a fraction of what 's needed , given just how bad this crisis has become . Building new homes also takes time , and time is not on the side of the million private renters who could risk being tipped into homelessness by the freeze on housing benefit . Whether a struggling family or a young person in low - paid work , the freeze is stripping away the help people desperately need to pay their rent . ( ... ) We are urging the government to abandon the freeze on housing benefit in the autumn budget or risk making more people homeless . '' </P> <H2> Local Housing Allowance ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Local Housing Allowance <P> The Government has introduced a new rent restriction policy for the calculation of Housing Benefit for private tenants called Local Housing Allowance . The scheme replaces two previous methods of controlling high rents for most new tenancies. Old scheme cases where the local authority decided the level of restriction based on the cost of suitable alternative accommodation ( in operation from 15 January 1989 to 1 January 1996 ) , Reference Rent cases , where the level of eligible rent was decided by the Rent Service based on the lower of what a landlord would have been able to obtain had a landlord not been renting to a tenant on Housing Benefit ( the claim related rent ) and the average cost of similar properties in that area ( the local reference rent ) . </P> <P> For LHA cases the eligible rent is decided in part by the size of property a claimant needs . This figure is published monthly by the council and the Rent Service . If the tenant rents more expensive accommodation , the rent is restricted to the LHA rate for that area . By publicising how much Housing Benefit a tenant can get for the need for Pre-Tenancy Determinations is removed . </P> <P> The Local Housing Allowance is set at the 30th percentile level for rents in the Broad Market Rental Area . The Broad Market Rental areas are similar in geographic size to Counties . This has led to a number of counties such as Cambridgeshire criticising the scheme because market rents in the city area of the county are considerably higher than those in the shire areas of the county . The House of Lords ruled against the concept of very large Broad Market Rental areas in the Heffernan case ( R ( Heffernan ) v The Rent Service ( 2008 ) UKHL 58 ) . The DWP re-introduced legislation to overturn this decision , restoring its intention to use very large broad market rental areas to draw down the cost of the scheme . </P> <P> Local Housing Allowance was introduced across all Local Authority areas on 7 April 2008 . The legislation to enable the scheme is contained in the Welfare Reform Act which received Royal Assent in May 2007 . The local authorities that trialled the new system were known as Pathfinder Authorities . They were Argyll and Bute , Blackpool , Brighton and Hove , Conwy county borough , Coventry , East Riding of Yorkshire , City of Edinburgh , Guildford , City of Leeds , London Borough of Lewisham , North East Lincolnshire , Norwich , Pembrokeshire , City of Salford , South Norfolk , Metropolitan Borough of St Helens , Teignbridge , London Borough of Wandsworth </P> <P> The final scheme was different in that the maximum difference between the rent payable and the eligible local housing allowance was restricted to \u00a3 15 . In addition in some pilot authorities , all tenants whose rent had been assessed according to reference rent rules were transferred to LHA , when the national scheme came in only those who made a new claim or moved went on to LHA . </P> <P> From April 2011 the \u00a3 15 paid to those whose rent was below LHA levels was scrapped . Now the maximum payable will be the rent or the LHA rate , whichever is the lower . </P> <P> From April 2009 , the maximum LHA that can be awarded will be restricted to the rate payable for four rooms . </P> <H2> Reference rent cases ( edit ) </H2> <P> This scheme will remain in operation for existing claimants who do not have a break in their Housing Benefit claim or do not move property . It was introduced with effect from 2 January 1996 . The level of eligible rent is decided by the Rent Service . Either on application by the Local Authority on an annual basis or if the tenant had taken out a Pre Tenancy Determination . </P> <H2> Northern Ireland ( edit ) </H2> <P> In Northern Ireland , tenants must apply to the Northern Ireland Housing Executive regardless of whether they rent from a private landlord , from the NIHE itself , or from a housing association . </P> <H2> Non-lha Housing benefit claims ( edit ) </H2> <P> For Housing Benefit claims made before ( or still existing at ) the roll - out of Local Housing Allowance scheme on 7 April 2008 , different rent restriction rules apply . </P> <P> The earlier system for calculation of eligible rent is specific to the individual property . </P> <P> The maximum Housing Benefit will be based on : - </P> <Ul> <Li> the tenant 's actual rent less services if the rent is `` reasonable '' ; </Li> <Li> the rent that would be `` reasonable '' in the area for the size of premises the tenant occupies in comparison to what would have been obtained by the landlord had the property not been rented to someone on Housing Benefit ( the claim - related rent ) or </Li> <Li> the average level of rent that would have been `` reasonable '' for that type of accommodation in the area ( the Local Reference Rent ) </Li> </Ul> <P> or where the tenant has a home too large for the needs </P> <Ul> <Li> the average level of rent that would be payable for the type of accommodation reasonable in the area for the actual size of accommodation that the tenant needs for his / her household . ( Exceptionally large determination ) </Li> </Ul> <P> Further restrictions can be imposed if the tenant is occupying accommodation in the luxury end of the market . </P> <P> These restrictions are decided either by the council , if the property is exempt from the Reference Rent rules and the LHA , or the Rent Service if the benefit being paid is subject to Reference Rent rules . </P> <P> The Rent Officer may visit the property ( or may have done so already ) although this is not a requirement . If a property is visited and the Rent Officer is not given access , the Council may terminate the claim , unless access is granted . If there are services included in the rent ( such as fuel bills , water charges , laundry or room cleaning ) , the rent officer will deduct the value of these as Housing Benefit can not pay for them . </P> <P> The Rent Officer decision is the maximum that the Council can pay for Reference Rent cases , for cases that are treated under the Pre 1996 rules , the figure is used to decide how much the DWP awards the Local Authority in subsidy and is purely indicative . This decision is made annually , although the Local Council may be late in making the application . If the decision is higher the effective date of the increase will be the Monday of the week of the referral ; if the decision is lower , the effective date is the Monday after the new decision is received by the Local Council . This is to avoid overpayments arising as a result of the Rent Service decision . If the decision is lower , any overpayment is LA Error and may only be recovered if it is reasonable to expect that the claimant knew that the decision was going to be lower . </P> <P> The rent officer makes the following valuations . </P> <H3> Claim - related rent ( edit ) </H3> <P> This has three parts . The lowest of these three figures is called the claim - related rent and is shown on the pre-tenancy determination decision . </P> Significantly high rent ( edit ) <P> The rent officer will have decided if the rent your landlord has asked for is reasonable compared with other properties in the vicinity . If it is too high , the rent officer will set a reasonable figure . The `` vicinity '' means the immediate area around the property . If the property is in a town or city , this could mean just the street the property is in or a few adjoining streets . If the property is in the country , the `` vicinity '' could be a small village . </P> <P> The `` vicinity '' is much smaller than the Broad Market Rental Area used to decide LHA Rates . </P> Number of rooms ( size criteria ) ( edit ) <P> The rent officer will consider whether the property has more rooms than the Housing Benefit rules say are needed . If the property has too many rooms , the rent officer will decide what the eligible rent used would be for a similar property with the right number of rooms . </P> <P> The rules are strict and the rent officer is not able to alter them . If an extra room is needed ( for example if the claimant has special disability needs ) , the claimant should apply to the Council for a DHP . </P> Underoccupancy charge ( bedroom Tax ) ( edit ) <P> From April 2013 if a claimant is considered to be under - occupying their property , their payment of Housing Benefit will be reduced by 14 % for one bedroom and 25 % for two or more bedrooms considered to be additional to the claimant 's needs . DHP 's will be made available to cover the shortfall for those affected by the change . Priority will be given to claimants with disabilities . </P> Exceptionally high rent ( edit ) <P> After having made these decisions , the rent officer decides if the lowest figure is still much higher than most rents for properties in the neighbourhood with the right number of rooms .

First passed in 1876 and still in force with amendments , it is the primary document which defines how the Government of Canada interacts with the 614 First Nation bands in Canada and their members . Throughout its long history the Act has been an ongoing subject of controversy and has been interpreted in different ways by both Aboriginal Canadians and non-Aboriginal Canadians . The legislation has been amended many times , including `` over twenty major changes '' made by 2002 . </P> <P> The Act is very wide - ranging in scope , covering governance , land use , healthcare , education , and more on Indian reserves . Notably , the original Indian Act does two things affecting all indigenous peoples in Canada : </P> <Ul> <Li> It says how reserves and bands can operate . The Act sets out rules for governing Indian reserves , defines how bands can be created and spells out the powers of `` band councils '' . Bands do not have to have reserve lands to operate under the act . </Li> <Li> It defines who is , and who is not recognized as an `` Indian '' . The Act defines a number of types of Indian people who are not recognized as `` registered '' or `` status '' Indians and who are therefore denied membership in bands . </Li> </Ul> <P> The Act 's existence is necessitated by the fact that First Nations ( historically called `` Indians '' ) relate differently to the state because of inherited legal arrangements such as the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and various treaties , and because Canada 's constitution specifically assigns Native issues to the federal , rather than provincial governments , by the terms of Section 91 ( 24 ) of the Constitution Act , 1867 . The Indian Act replaces any laws on the topic passed by a local legislature before a province joined Canadian Confederation , creating a definitive national policy on the subject . The Act is not a treaty ; it is Canada 's legal response to the treaties . Nevertheless , its unilateral nature , imposed on indigenous peoples by the Canadian government in contrast to the treaties , is itself a source of discontent among Native peoples in Canada . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Original rationale and purpose </Li> <Li> 2 Definitions <Ul> <Li> 2.1 `` Reserve '' </Li> <Li> 2.2 `` Band '' </Li> <Li> 2.3 `` Indian '' <Ul> <Li> 2.3. 1 Loss of status prior to 1985 amendments <Ul> <Li> 2.3. 1.1 Discriminatory definition issues </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Policies enacted via the Indian Act <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Gender discrimination </Li> <Li> 3.2 Residential schools </Li> <Li> 3.3 Bans on religious ceremonies ( `` Potlatch Law '' ) </Li> <Li> 3.4 Restriction on access to the courts </Li> <Li> 3.5 Tax exemption </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Relation to the Constitution <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Section 88 </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 History of proposed and actual changes <Ul> <Li> 5.1 List of precursors and amendments <Ul> <Li> 5.1. 1 Pre-Confederation </Li> <Li> 5.1. 2 Post-Confederation </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5.2 Attempts to repeal or replace <Ul> <Li> 5.2. 1 Failed major changes </Li> <Li> 5.2. 2 Opt - outs </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Case law </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 Further reading </Li> <Li> 9 References <Ul> <Li> 9.1 Citations </Li> <Li> 9.2 Bibliography </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Original rationale and purpose ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Indian enfranchisement in Canada `` The great aim of our legislation has been to do away with the tribal system and assimilate the Indian people in all respects with the other inhabitants of the Dominion as speedily as they are fit to change . '' <P> John A Macdonald , 1887 </P> <P> The Indian Act was first passed in 1876 as a consolidation of various laws concerning indigenous peoples enacted by the separate colonies of British North America prior to Canadian Confederation , most notably the Gradual Civilization Act passed by the Parliament of the Province of Canada in 1857 and the Gradual Enfranchisement Act of 1869 . The Indian Act was passed by the Parliament of Canada under the provisions of Section 91 ( 24 ) of the Constitution Act , 1867 , which provides Canada 's federal government exclusive authority to govern in relation to `` Indians and Lands Reserved for Indians '' . It was an attempt to codify rights promised to Native peoples by British King George III in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 , while at the same time enforcing Euro - Canadian standards of `` civilization '' . The purpose of the act , as stated by its drafters , was to administer Indian affairs in such a way that Indian people would feel compelled to renounce their Indian status and join Canadian civilization as full members : a process called enfranchisement . </P> <P> The idea of enfranchisement predated the 1876 version of Indian Act and survived in some form until 1985 . Upon the introduction in 1857 by the Tach\u00e9 - Macdonald administration of the Gradual Civilization Act and until 1961 , the enfranchisement process was compulsory for men of age 21 able to read and write English . </P> <P> Reserves , under this legislation , were islands within Canada to which were attached a different set of rights . `` Enfranchisement '' derives from the idea of `` franchise '' , which has gradually been degraded as `` vote '' . Indigenous people with the franchise were allowed to vote for representatives , were expected to pay taxes and lived `` off - reserve '' . By contrast , groups of people who lived on a reserve were subject to a different set of rights and obligations . One needed to descend from an Indian to be allowed to live on a reserve . </P> <P> The tenure of land in a reserve was limited to the collective , or tribe , by virtue of a Crown protectorate . Interactions between enfranchised citizens and Indians were subject to strict controls ; for example , the enfranchised were forbidden by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 to traffic in alcohol or land with Indians . It was hoped through means of fiduciary duty voluntarily taken up by the Crown to preserve the Indian identity , but this was later vitiated by the compulsory enfranchisement scheme of the Gradual Civilization Act . The 1985 amendment to the Indian Act extinguished the idea of enfranchisement . </P> <H2> Definitions ( edit ) </H2> <H3> `` Reserve '' ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Indian reserve <P> Under the section entitled `` Reserves '' in the Indian Act , it is stated that reserves are `` to be held for use and benefit of Indians . </P> <P> 18 . ( 1 ) `` Subject to this Act , reserves are held by Her Majesty for the use and benefit of the respective bands for which they were set apart , and subject to this Act and to the terms of any treaty or surrender , the Governor in Council may determine whether any purpose for which lands in a reserve are used or are to be used is for the use and benefit of the band . Marginal note : Use of reserves for schools , etc . '' </P> -- R.S. , c . I - 6 , s . 18 . Indian Act <P> 18 . ( 2 ) `` The Minister may authorize the use of lands in a reserve for the purpose of Indian schools , the administration of Indian affairs , Indian burial grounds , Indian health projects or , with the consent of the council of the band , for any other purpose for the general welfare of the band , and may take any lands in a reserve required for those purposes , but where an individual Indian , immediately prior to the taking , was entitled to the possession of those lands , compensation for that use shall be paid to the Indian , in such amount as may be agreed between the Indian and the Minister , or , failing agreement , as may be determined in such manner as the Minister may direct . '' </P> -- DIANA , R.S. , c . I - 6 , s . 18 . Indian Act <H3> `` Band '' ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Band government <P> In the Indian Act , updated to April 2013 , the term `` band '' , </P> <P> `` means a body of Indians ( a ) for whose use and benefit in common , lands , the legal title to which is vested in Her Majesty , have been set apart before , on or after September 4 , 1951 , ( b ) for whose use and benefit in common , moneys are held by Her Majesty , or ( c ) declared by the Governor in Council to be a band for the purposes of this Act . '' </P> -- Indian Act <H3> `` Indian '' ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Indian Register <P> Fundamental to Canada 's ability to interact with First Nations peoples is the question of defining who they are ( e.g. who are the `` Indians '' of the Indian Act ? ) , and this aspect of the legislation has been an ongoing source of controversy throughout its history . Not all people who self - identify as `` Aboriginal '' are considered `` Indians '' under the terms of the act . Only those on the official Indian Register maintained by the federal government ( or a local `` band list '' in some cases ) are Status Indians , subject to the full legal benefits and restrictions of the Indian Act . Notably this excludes M\u00e9tis people , Inuit people , and so - called Non-Status Indians . Various amendments and court decisions have repeatedly altered the rules regarding who is eligible for Indian Status . Many bands now maintain their own band lists . </P> Loss of status prior to 1985 amendments ( edit ) <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section may contain too much repetition or redundant language . Please help improve it by merging similar text or removing repeated statements . ( August 2014 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Though people accepted into band membership under band rules may not be status Indians , Bill C - 31 clarified that various sections of the Indian Act would apply to such members . The sections in question are those relating to community life ( e.g. , land holdings ) . Sections relating to Indians ( Aboriginal people ) as individuals ( in this case , wills and taxation of personal property ) were not included . Prior to 1985 , Indians could lose status in a variety of ways including the following : </P> <Ul> <Li> marrying a man who was not a status Indian </Li> <Li> enfranchisement ( until 1960 , an Indian could vote in federal elections only by renouncing Indian status ) </Li> <Li> having at the age of 21 a mother and paternal grandmother who did not have status before marriage </Li> <Li> being born out of wedlock to a mother with status and a father without . </Li> </Ul> <P> These provisions interfered with the matrilineal cultures of many First Nations , whereby children were born to the mother 's clan and people , and gained their status in the tribe from her family . Often property and hereditary leadership passed through the maternal line . </P> <P> In Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell ( 1974 ) , these laws were upheld despite arguments made under the Canadian Bill of Rights . The Indian Act was amended in 1985 ( Bill C - 31 ) to restore stat\n", "answer": "1876"}

It is the eighth Doctor Who Christmas special since the show 's 2005 revival and the first to be within a series . It was written by head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat and directed by Saul Metzstein . </P> <P> The episode is set in the Victorian era and sees the Doctor ( Matt Smith ) brooding with the assistance of Silurian Madame Vastra ( Neve McIntosh ) , her wife Jenny Flint ( Catrin Stewart ) and Sontaran Strax ( Dan Starkey ) , after the loss of companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams in the previous episode , `` The Angels Take Manhattan '' . He is forced out of hiding to investigate mysterious , sentient snowmen that are building themselves and meets Clara Oswald ( Jenna - Louise Coleman ) , a governess also investigating the snowmen . They discover that the snowmen are being animated by the Great Intelligence ( voice of Ian McKellen ) with the help of a man named Dr Simeon ( Richard E. Grant ) . </P> <P> Building upon the character 's surprise introduction in `` Asylum of the Daleks '' , `` The Snowmen '' introduces Clara as the Doctor 's new companion , though ultimately it would be a third version of her character that would travel with the Doctor starting with `` The Bells of Saint John '' . In addition to Clara , `` The Snowmen '' also introduces a redesigned TARDIS , revised title sequence and theme music , and sees changes to the Doctor 's costume . The special was produced in August 2012 , with location filming in Newport , Wales and Bristol . It received final ratings of 9.87 million viewers in the UK , becoming the fourth most - watched programme of Christmas Day . `` The Snowmen '' was met with mostly positive reviews from critics , most of whom received the introduction and character of Clara well . However , some felt that Grant and McKellen were underused as villains or the plot was slight because of the focus on characterisation . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Prequels </Li> <Li> 1.2 Synopsis </Li> <Li> 1.3 Continuity </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Production <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Writing and design changes </Li> <Li> 2.2 Casting </Li> <Li> 2.3 Filming and effects </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Broadcast and reception <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Critical reception </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 DVD release </Li> <Li> 5 Soundtrack </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Prequels ( edit ) </H3> <P> To promote the special , three prequels were released . The first was broadcast during the 2012 Children in Need telethon on 16 November 2012 , titled `` The Great Detective '' . The Silurian Madame Vastra , her human wife Jenny Flint , and the Sontaran Strax ( all returning from `` A Good Man Goes to War '' ) describe a number of strange phenomena to a shadowed fourth detective . The fourth detective reveals himself to be the Doctor , and tells the group that he has retired . </P> <P> A second prequel , titled `` Vastra Investigates '' , was released online on 17 December 2012 . At the end of a case , Vastra and Jenny converse with an officer from Scotland Yard and apologise for Strax 's violent wishes for the culprit 's punishment . Vastra explains Strax 's alien origin as well as her own to the officer , much to his astonishment . Vastra reveals that she was awoken by an extension to the London Underground and initially disliked humans , though that changed when she fell in love with Jenny . On the carriage ride home , Jenny notices it is beginning to snow and Vastra notes that the snow should be impossible because there are no clouds in the sky . </P> <P> A third prequel , titled `` The Battle of Demon 's Run -- Two Days Later '' was released on the United States iTunes and Amazon Video stores on 25 March 2013 . Two days after the events of `` A Good Man Goes to War '' , Vastra and Jenny convince Strax that he is not mortally wounded and invite him to accompany them back to 1800s London . The scene had been filmed as an extra due to the anticipation that fans would ask how Strax was resurrected and came to be in Vastra 's employ . </P> <H3> Synopsis ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1842 England , a young boy builds a snowman , but refuses to play with the other children . The snowman starts speaking to the boy , repeating his assertions that the other children are silly . Fifty years later , the boy has grown up to be Dr. Walter Simeon , proprietor of the Great Intelligence Institute . He hires men to collect samples of snow , which he places in a large snow - filled globe in his laboratory before feeding the men to a group of animated snowmen . The Doctor , still despondent after losing his former companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams , has parked his TARDIS above Victorian London among the clouds . He uses his allies Vastra , Jenny , and Strax to keep people away from him . They also fill their time investigating mysteries throughout the city . </P> <P> Elsewhere , barmaid Clara Oswin Oswald investigates a disturbance outside the tavern she works at and finds the Doctor walking by . He attempts to leave discreetly , but Clara follows him to a coach . Not wishing to become involved in matters , the Doctor instructs Strax to bring him a memory worm that will erase the last hour of Clara 's memories with just a touch . Before they can do so , they are surrounded by snowmen created from snow with psychic properties who attack the group . The Doctor realises that Clara 's thoughts are creating the snowmen and ends the threat by instructing her to think of them melting . Clara cautions the Doctor that if he wipes her memory , she will forget how to deal with the snowmen . The Doctor reluctantly allows her to go and ascends a staircase to the sky to return to the TARDIS . Clara follows him and knocks on the door , but she hides and flees down the staircase when the Doctor answers . Clara returns to her other job as governess for the children of Captain Latimer . She learns that Latimer 's daughter has been having horrible dreams about their previous governess returning from the dead . Clara realises that the pond that contains the old governess ' body is the only thing still frozen around them . She attempts to track down the Doctor but instead attracts the attention of Jenny , who takes her to see Vastra . Vastra tells Clara she gets only one word to impress the Doctor with if she wants his help . Clara chooses the word `` Pond '' , which shocks the Doctor and arouses his interest . </P> The Doctor welcomes his new companion Clara to his redesigned TARDIS . The idea behind the redesign was to make the TARDIS look more like a machine again . <P> Acting on a tip from Strax , the Doctor visits the Great Intelligence Institute posing as Sherlock Holmes . He confronts Dr. Simeon and find a large glass globe in Simeon 's office that contains psychic snow . The Doctor speaks to the Great Intelligence , the entity that has been speaking to Dr. Simeon since he was a boy . He learns that the Great Intelligence has been controlling the snowmen and has taken interest in Latimer 's pond . The Doctor visits the pond and deduces that the Great Intelligence is using the old governess ' body as a DNA blueprint to form an ice creature that will retain its form and not melt . While Clara is putting the children to bed , the frozen body of the governess breaks into the house . The Doctor fights her off and is joined by Vastra , Jenny and Strax . Dr. Simeon arrives with more snowmen and tells them he wants the governess ' ice body . The Doctor flees with Clara to the roof of the mansion and then to the TARDIS hovering overhead . They are pursued by the ice governess , whom the Doctor traps under a layer of frozen ice crystals . Inside the TARDIS the Doctor gives Clara a TARDIS key , but the ice governess arrives and pulls Clara down off the cloud . </P> <P> The Doctor picks up Clara and takes her back to Latimer 's mansion , placing her under medical care of Strax . He collects the ice fragments from the governess and places them in a souvenir London Underground biscuit tin . He and Vastra travel to Simeon 's lab , where the Doctor notes the Intelligence 's plan to replace humanity with ice creatures and holds up the tin with the necessary DNA . Dr Simeon grabs the tin and opens it only to find the memory worm , which latches on to him . The Doctor states that the Great Intelligence , which has been existing as a mirror of Dr Simeon 's thoughts , will vanish with the erasure of Simeon 's memories . Instead , the Intelligence reveals that it existed long enough that it can now control Simeon 's body , which it uses to attack Vastra and the Doctor . The influence of the Great Intelligence quickly wanes , and Simeon falls dead . Outside , a salt - water rain has started , and the Doctor sees that another psychic ability has taken control of the snow from the Great Intelligence : the Latimer family , crying for Clara . Strax informs the Doctor upon his return to the Latimer mansion that Clara only has moments left , and she passes away as the Doctor returns the TARDIS key to her . At her funeral , the Doctor reads Clara 's full name on her tombstone and realises she is the woman he met in `` Asylum of the Daleks '' who became a Dalek , whom he refers to as `` Souffl\u00e9 Girl '' . He gleefully announces that a person dying twice is an impossibility and , bidding farewell to his allies for now , the Doctor departs in the TARDIS to investigate and find Clara . The episode concludes in contemporary times , where a young woman resembling Clara walks through the same graveyard , pausing by Clara 's tombstone . </P> <H3> Continuity ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Second Doctor previously encountered the Great Intelligence in the serials The Abominable Snowmen ( 1967 ) , set in the 1930s , and The Web of Fear ( 1968 ) , set in the 1960s . In these stories , the Great Intelligence uses robot Yeti as its physical presence . The events of The Web of Fear are alluded to by the Doctor in `` The Snowmen '' when he presents the London Underground biscuit tin to the Great Intelligence in Dr Simeon 's laboratory ; the Intelligence states , `` I do not understand these markings '' , in reference to the 1967 London Underground map design on the tin . The Doctor remarks that the Underground is a `` key strategic we\n", "answer": "231"}

Subsequent legal actions by the city of Cleveland and Browns season ticket holders led the NFL to broker a compromise that saw the Browns history , records , and intellectual property remain in Cleveland . In return , Modell was permitted to move his football organization to Baltimore where he established the Baltimore Ravens . The Ravens are officially regarded by the NFL as an expansion team that began play in 1996 . The city of Cleveland agreed to demolish Cleveland Stadium and build a new stadium on the same site , and the NFL agreed to reactivate the Browns by the 1999 season through either an expansion draft or a relocated franchise . The Browns were officially reactivated in 1998 through the expansion process and resumed play in 1999 . </P> <P> The compromise between Cleveland , the NFL , and Modell was a first in North American professional sports . The compromise has been cited in franchise moves and agreements in other leagues , including those in Major League Baseball , Major League Soccer , the National Basketball Association , and the National Hockey League . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Dissatisfaction with Cleveland Stadium </Li> <Li> 2 Announcing the move </Li> <Li> 3 Initial reaction </Li> <Li> 4 Settlement </Li> <Li> 5 Aftermath and Legacy </Li> <Li> 6 Effect on teams in other sports leagues <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Major League Baseball </Li> <Li> 6.2 Major League Soccer </Li> <Li> 6.3 National Hockey League </Li> <Li> 6.4 National Basketball Association </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 Further reading </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Dissatisfaction with Cleveland Stadium ( edit ) </H2> Art Modell . <P> In 1975 , knowing that Municipal Stadium was costing the city over $300,000 annually to operate , then - Browns owner Art Modell signed a 25 - year lease whereby he agreed to incur these expenses in exchange for quasi ownership of the stadium . Under the terms of the lease he agreed to give back the City a portion of the profits he would realize each year , and also agreed to make capital improvements to the stadium at his expense . Modell 's newly formed company , Stadium Corporation , paid an annual rent of $150,000 for the first five years and $200,000 afterwards to the city . </P> <P> Modell had originally promised never to move the Browns . He had publicly criticized the Baltimore Colts ' move to Indianapolis , and had testified in favor of the NFL in court cases where the league unsuccessfully tried to stop Al Davis from moving the Oakland Raiders to Los Angeles . </P> <P> However , Modell refused to share the suite revenue with the Cleveland Indians , who also played at Cleveland Stadium , even though much of the revenues were generated during baseball games as well as football games . </P> <P> In 1990 , the Indians prevailed upon the local governments and voters and convinced them to build them their own facility where they controlled the suite revenue . Modell , mistakenly believing that his revenues were not endangered , agreed to participate in the Gateway Project that built Jacobs Field ( now Progressive Field ) for the Indians and Gund Arena ( now Quicken Loans Arena ) for the Cleveland Cavaliers . Modell 's assumptions proved incorrect , and Stadium Corp 's suite revenues declined sharply when the Indians moved from the stadium to Jacobs Field in 1994 . Soaring player salaries and deficits put additional financial pressure on the Browns ' owner . Modell claimed to have lost $21 million between 1993 and 1994 . </P> <H2> Announcing the move ( edit ) </H2> <P> After Modell realized how much revenue he lost from the Indians moving out of Cleveland Stadium , he requested an issue be placed on the ballot to provide $175 million in tax dollars to refurbish the outmoded and declining Cleveland Stadium . </P> <P> On the field , the Browns , coached by Bill Belichick , were coming off a playoff season in which the team finished 11 -- 5 and advanced to the second round of the playoffs entering the 1995 season . Sports Illustrated even predicted the Browns would represent the AFC in Super Bowl XXX at the end of the season . However , the team disappointed many fans by losing three straight games after starting the season 3 -- 1 . </P> <P> On November 6 , 1995 , with the team sitting at 4 -- 5 , Modell announced in a press conference at Camden Yards that he had signed a deal to relocate the Browns to Baltimore in 1996 -- a move which would return the NFL to that city since the Colts relocated to Indianapolis after the 1983 season . The reason Modell chose to relocate to Baltimore was because he felt the city of Cleveland did not have the funding nor political will to build a first - class stadium . The very next day , on November 7 , Cleveland voters overwhelmingly approved the aforementioned tax issue to remodel Cleveland Stadium . </P> <H2> Initial reaction ( edit ) </H2> <P> The City of Cleveland sued Modell , the Browns , Stadium Corp , the Maryland Stadium Authority , and the authority 's director , John A. Moag Jr. , in City of Cleveland v. Cleveland Browns , et al. , Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas Case No . CV - 95 - 297833 , for breaching the Browns ' lease , which required the team to play its home games at Cleveland Stadium for several years beyond 1995 , filing an injunction to keep the Browns in the city until at least 1998 . Several other lawsuits were filed by fans and ticket holders . The United States Congress even held hearings on the matter . </P> <P> Actor / comedian Drew Carey returned to his hometown of Cleveland on November 26 , 1995 , to host `` Fan Jam '' in protest of the proposed move . A protest was held in Pittsburgh during the Browns ' game there against the Pittsburgh Steelers , but ABC , the network broadcasting the game ( and also the home of Carey 's new sitcom that had just premiered ) , declined to cover or mention the protest . That game was one of the few instances that Steelers fans and Browns fans were supportive of each other , as fans in Pittsburgh felt that Modell was robbing their team of their long - standing rivalry with the Browns . Browns fans reacted with anger to the news , wearing hats and T - shirts that read `` Muck Fodell '' . </P> <P> On the field , the Browns stumbled to finish 5 -- 11 after the announcement , ahead of only the expansion Jacksonville Jaguars , to whom they lost twice , in the AFC Central , becoming the first team in the NFL 's modern era to lose twice to a first - year expansion team . Virtually all of the team 's sponsors pulled their support , leaving Cleveland Stadium devoid of advertising during the team 's final weeks . The final game the team played at Cleveland Municipal Stadium was a 26 -- 10 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals , the first and only win since the announcement of the relocation . The game itself was blacked out on television locally , but NBC did broadcast extensive pregame coverage from Cleveland . </P> <H2> Settlement ( edit ) </H2> <P> After extensive talks between the NFL , the Browns , and officials of the two cities , Cleveland accepted a legal settlement that would keep the Browns ' legacy in Cleveland . On February 9 , 1996 , the NFL announced that the Browns would be ' deactivated ' for three years , and that a new stadium would be built for a new Browns team , as either an expansion team or a team moved from another city , that would begin play in 1999 . Modell would in turn then be granted a new franchise ( the 31st NFL franchise ) , for Baltimore , retaining the current contracts of players and personnel . There would be a reactivated team for Cleveland , where the Browns ' name , colors , history , records , awards , and archives would remain in Cleveland . The only other current NFL team to suspend operations without merging with another was Cleveland 's previous NFL team , the Rams , during the 1943 season at the height of World War II . </P> <P> An additional stipulation was that in any future realignment plan , the Browns would automatically be placed in a division with the Pittsburgh Steelers and Cincinnati Bengals , because of longstanding rivalries with those two teams . Upon their reactivation in 1999 , the Browns were placed back in the AFC Central with the Steelers and Bengals , as well as the Ravens , Titans , and Jaguars . This arrangement had the effect of creating -- for the first time in NFL history -- an alignment with teams from Baltimore , Cleveland and Pittsburgh all playing in the same division . When the NFL realigned into divisions of four teams for the 2002 season , Cleveland , Pittsburgh , Cincinnati and Baltimore remained together , but in the newly created AFC North . </P> <H2> Aftermath and legacy ( edit ) </H2> <P> The return of the NFL to Baltimore compelled the departure of the professional football team already in Baltimore at the time , the Grey Cup champion Baltimore Stallions of the Canadian Football League ( CFL ) . Although they had generated respectable fan support during their two seasons in Baltimore , Stallions owner Jim Speros knew his team could not compete with an NFL team and opted to establish a new franchise in Montreal . They subsequently adopted the name of the team that previously played in the city , the Alouettes . </P> <P> Focus groups , a telephone survey , and a fan contest were all held to help select a new name for Modell 's team . Starting with a list of over 100 possible names , the team 's management reduced it to 17 . From there , focus groups of a total of 200 Baltimore area residents reduced the list of names to six , and then a phone survey of 1000 people trimmed it down to three , Marauders , Americans , and Ravens . Finally , a fan contest drawing 33,288 voters picked `` Ravens '' , a name that alludes to the famous poem , `` The Raven '' , by Edgar Allan Poe , who spent the latter part of his life in Baltimore , and is also buried there . The team also adopted purple and black as their team colors , a stark contrast to the brown and orange colors of the Browns . Ex-Baltimore Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas disowned the Colts after their move to Indianapolis . The former Colts Marching Band , which remained in Baltimore after the Colts moved , was subsequently renamed the Baltimore 's Marching Ravens . Along with the San Francisco 49ers , Buffalo Bills , and Washington Redskins , the Ravens are one of only four NFL teams with an official marching band . </P> <P> Modell 's move to Baltimore came at the height of NFL teams relocating . The move also fueled a proliferation of 12 new stadiums throughout the NFL . Several NFL franchises used the threat of relocation to coerce their respective cities to build new stadiums with public funds . Such franchises include the Seahawks , Buccaneers , Bengals , Lions , Cardinals , and Bears . In the three - year period from 1995 -- 1997 , four NFL teams moved . In ad\n", "answer": "1998"}

The answer should be a number\n\nQuestion:\nwhen did the nfl change to a 16 game schedule\n\nDocument:\nNFL regular season - wikipedia <H1> NFL regular season </H1> Jump to : navigation , search <P> The National Football League ( NFL ) regular season begins the weekend after Labor Day in early September and ends in December or early January . It consists of 256 games , where each team ( 32 total ) plays 16 games during a 17 - week period . Since 2012 , the NFL schedule generally has games in one of five time slots during the week . The first game of the week is played on Thursday night , kicking off at 8 : 25 PM ( ET ) . The majority of games are played on Sunday , most kicking off at 1 : 00 PM ( ET ) , some late afternoon games starting at 4 : 05 or 4 : 25 PM ( ET ) . Additionally , one Sunday night game is played every week at 8 : 30 PM ( ET ) . One Monday night game then starts at 8 : 30 PM ( ET ) every week with the exception of the first week of the regular season , in which two Monday night games are played back - to - back ( the second game always occurring on the West coast ) , as well as the last week of the season , in which no Monday night game is held . In addition to these regularly scheduled games , there are occasionally games at other times , such as a Saturday afternoon or evening , or the annual Thanksgiving Day games in which three games are played . During the final week of the regular season , all games are held on Sunday . </P> <P> In place since 2006 , the current broadcasting contract establishes broadcast partners for each game . The Sunday afternoon games are broadcast either on CBS or Fox . CBS has the broadcast rights for teams in the American Football Conference while Fox has the rights for teams in the National Football Conference . In games where teams from both conferences play each other , the network with the broadcast rights for the `` away '' team will broadcast the game . In each local television market , three Sunday afternoon games are shown . One of the two networks gets a doubleheader , while the other network has the right to broadcast a single game ; the networks alternate weeks when each has the right to the doubleheader . Doubleheader games are broadcast at 1 : 00 ( ET ) and 4 : 25 PM ( ET ) . The network with the single game will have an official kick - off time at either 1 : 00 PM ( ET ) or 4 : 05 PM ( ET ) . In addition to the regular Sunday afternoon games , there are three prime time games each week . The Thursday night game is broadcast by the NFL Network ( with , starting in 2016 , five of those Thursday games also being simulcast by CBS and another five on NBC ) . The Sunday night game is broadcast by NBC , while the Monday night game is broadcast by ESPN . </P> <P> The NFL uses a strict scheduling algorithm to determine which teams play each other from year to year , based on the current division alignments and the final division standings from the previous season . The current formula has been in place since 2002 , the last year that the NFL expanded its membership . Generally , each team plays the other three teams in its own division twice , all four teams from a single division in the AFC once , all four teams from a single division in the NFC once , and two additional intraconference games based on the standings from the previous season . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Game times </Li> <Li> 2 History </Li> <Li> 3 Scheduling formula <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Current formula </Li> <Li> 3.2 Past formulas <Ul> <Li> 3.2. 1 1995 -- 1998 NFL scheduling formula </Li> <Li> 3.2. 2 1978 -- 1994 NFL scheduling formula </Li> <Li> 3.2. 3 Regular season expansion proposals </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Scheduled division matchups </Li> <Li> 5 Regular season games played outside the U.S. </Li> <Li> 6 Disruptions of the schedule <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Conflicts with other sports leagues and organizations </Li> <Li> 6.2 Labor disputes </Li> <Li> 6.3 Natural disasters </Li> <Li> 6.4 Other major news events </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Game times ( edit ) </H2> Main article : NFL on television <P> Since 1990 , the majority of NFL regular - season games are played on Sundays at 1 pm , or around 4 : 00 to 4 : 25pm ET ( see below ) , with the late afternoon ( ET ) games usually reserved either for matches hosted in the Pacific Time Zone or Mountain Time Zone , or for one or more marquee contests . The current NFL television contract awards the American broadcast of these games to Fox or CBS , with Fox showing games where the visiting team is from the NFC and CBS showing games where the visiting team is from the AFC . Each of these Sunday afternoon games is televised on a regional basis to a few or several areas around the country . </P> <P> On each Sunday of the regular season , either CBS or Fox air two games in a doubleheader package , while the other network may show only one game . Late games scheduled to air on the network showing only one game are scheduled to start at 4 : 00pm EST , while the second game of a doubleheader will kick off later at 4 : 25pm ; this is to avoid conflicts with 1 : 00pm games that have run late . </P> <P> The schedule allows for 4 other regular time slots , in which these games are broadcast nationally across the country : </P> <Ol> <Li> One Sunday night game , which has been regularly scheduled since 1987 , and has aired on NBC since 2006 . </Li> <Li> One Monday Night Football game , which has been regularly scheduled since 1970 , and has been appearing on ESPN since 2006 . Also since 2006 , two games have been on the first Monday of the season . The practice of holding a Monday night game during the last week of the season ended after the 2002 season due to , among other reasons , low ratings , and a competitive imbalance involved for potential playoff teams who would have one less day of rest before the postseason . </Li> <Li> On Thursday nights since 2006 , one game has been played and aired on the NFL Network on the weeks including and after Thanksgiving Day . In addition , during the day on Thanksgiving , the NFL has played Thanksgiving Day games since 1920 ; by tradition the Dallas Cowboys and the Detroit Lions always host these afternoon games , and in recent years there has been a night game as well on Thanksgiving . Beginning with the 2012 season , the NFL has played games on Thursday nights for the whole season . </Li> <Li> Should there be a need for it , an occasional Saturday afternoon or night game , only in mid to late December , due to the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961 . December Saturday games have been a part of the schedule every season since 1970 , except for 2013 . </Li> </Ol> <P> Since the 2006 season , the NFL has used a `` flexible scheduling '' system for the last seven weeks of the regular season when there is a Sunday night game . In 2014 , that was expanded to include weeks 5 -- 17 . Flex scheduling ensures quality matchups on Sunday nights and it allows for surprise teams to play in primetime . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Number of regular season games per team </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1935 -- 1936 </Td> <Td> 12 games </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1937 -- 1942 , 1946 </Td> <Td> 11 games ( 12 weeks ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1943 -- 1945 </Td> <Td> 10 games ( 12 weeks ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1947 -- 1960 </Td> <Td> 12 games ( variable weeks ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1961 -- 1965 , 1967 - 1977 </Td> <Td> 14 games ( 14 weeks ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1966 </Td> <Td> 14 games ( 15 weeks , odd number of teams ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1978 -- 1981 , 1983 -- 1986 , 1988 -- 1989 </Td> <Td> 16 games ( 16 weeks ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1982 </Td> <Td> 9 games ( 17 weeks , strike ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> 15 games ( 16 weeks , strike ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1990 -- 1992 , 1994 -- 2000 , 2002 -- present </Td> <Td> 16 games ( 17 weeks ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1993 </Td> <Td> 16 games ( 18 weeks , additional bye week ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2001 </Td> <Td> 16 games ( 18 weeks , September 11 attacks ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> In its early years after 1920 , the NFL did not have a set schedule , and teams played as few as eight and as many as sixteen games , many against independent professional , college , or amateur teams . From 1926 through 1946 , they played from eleven to fourteen games per season , depending on the number of teams in the league . From 1947 through 1960 , each NFL team played 12 games per season . The American Football League began play in 1960 and introduced a balanced schedule of 14 games per team over a fifteen - week season , in which each of the eight teams played each of the other teams twice , with one bye week . Competition from the new league caused the NFL to expand and follow suit with a fourteen - game schedule in 1961 . </P> <P> Also in 1961 , the U.S. Congress passed the Sports Broadcasting Act in response to a court decision which ruled that the NFL 's method of negotiating television broadcasting rights violated antitrust laws . The law allows the league to sell the rights to all regular season and postseason games to the networks , but prohibits the league from directly competing with high school and college football games . Since high school and college teams typically play games on Friday and Saturday , respectively , the NFL can not hold games on those days until those seasons generally end in mid-December . </P> <P> From 1961 through 1977 , the NFL schedule consisted of fourteen regular season games played over fourteen weeks , except in 1966 . Opening weekend typically was the weekend after Labor Day , or rarely two weekends after Labor Day . Teams played six or seven exhibition games . In 1966 ( and 1960 ) , the NFL had an odd number of franchises , so one team was idle each week . In 1978 , the league changed the schedule to include sixteen regular season games and four exhibition games . From 1978 through 1989 , the sixteen games were played over sixteen weeks . </P> <P> In 1990 , the NFL re-introduced a bye week to the schedule , which it had not had since 1966 . Each team played sixteen regular season games over seventeen weeks . During the season , on a rotating basis , each team would have the weekend off . As a result , opening weekend was moved up to Labor Day weekend . The league had an odd number of teams ( 31 ) from 1999 to 2001 . During that period , at least one team had to be given a bye on any given week . For the 1993 season , the league experimented with the schedule by adding a second bye week for each team , resulting in an 18 - week regular season . In 2001 , the September 11th attacks resulted in the league postponing its week 2 games , leading to another 18 - week season . </P> <P> Since the 2002 season , the league has scheduled a nationally televised regular season kickoff game on the Thursday night after Labor Day , prior to the first Sunday of NFL games to kick off the season . The first one , featuring the San Francisco 49ers and the New York Giants , was held on September 5 , 2002 largely to celebrate New York City 's resilience in the wake of the September 11 , 2001 attacks . Since 2004 , the NFL has indicated that the opening game will normally be hosted by the defending Super Bowl champions as the official start of their title defense . Under this scheduling system , the earliest the regular season could begin is September 4 , as it was in the 2008 and 2014 seasons , due to September 1 falling on a Monday , while the latest possible is September 10 , as it was in the 2009 and 2015 seasons , due to September 1 falling on a Tuesday . </P> <H2> Scheduling formula ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Current formula ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> POS </Th> <Th> NFC East </Th> <Th> NFC North </Th> <Th> NFC South </Th> <Th> NFC West </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1st </Td> <Td> Eagles </Td> <Td> Vikings </Td> <Td> Saints </Td> <Td> Seahawks </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2nd </Td> <Td> Cowboys </Td> <Td> Lions </Td> <Td> Panthers </Td> <Td> Rams </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3rd </Td> <Td> Redskins </Td> <Td> Packers </Td> <Td> Falcons </Td> <Td> Cardinals </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 4th </Td> <Td> Giants </Td> <Td> Bears </Td> <Td> Buccaneers </Td> <Td> 49ers </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"5\"> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> POS </Th> <Th> AFC East </Th> <Th> AFC North </Th> <Th> AFC South </Th> <Th> AFC West </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1st </Td> <Td> Patriots </Td> <Td> Steelers </Td> <Td> Jaguars </Td> <Td> Chiefs </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2nd </Td> <Td> Bills </Td> <Td> Ravens </Td> <Td> Titans </Td> <Td> Chargers </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3rd </Td> <Td> Dolphins </Td> <Td> Bengals </Td> <Td> Colts </Td> <Td> Raider\n", "answer": "1978"}
{"content": "Answer the question based on the information provided in the document given below. The answer should be a number\n\nDocument:\norn screening programs are only detectable after irreversible damage has been done ; in some cases sudden death is the first manifestation of a disease . Screening programs are often run by state or national governing bodies with the goal of screening all infants born in the jurisdiction . The number of diseases screened for is set by each jurisdiction , and can vary greatly . Most newborn screening tests are done by measuring metabolites and enzyme activity in whole blood samples collected on specialized filter paper . Many areas are starting to screen infants for hearing loss using automated auditory brainstem response and congenital heart defects using pulse oximetry . Infants who screen positive undergo further testing to determine if they are truly affected with a disease or if the test result was a false positive . Follow - up testing is typically coordinated between geneticists and the infant 's pediatrician or primary care physician . </P> <P> Newborn screening debuted as a public health program in the United States in the early 1960s , and has expanded to countries around the world , with different testing menus in each country . Both prenatal screening ( screening before birth ) and newborn screening ( screening soon after birth ) have improved health care . The first disorder detected by modern newborn screening programs was phenylketonuria , a metabolic condition in which the inability to degrade the essential amino acid phenylalanine can cause irreversible mental retardation unless detected early . With early detection and dietary management , the negative effects of the disease can be largely eliminated . Robert Guthrie developed a simple method using a bacterial inhibition assay that could detect high levels of phenylalanine in blood shortly after a baby was born . Guthrie also pioneered the collection of blood on filter paper which could be easily transported , recognizing the need for a simple system if the screening was going to be done on a large scale . Newborn screening around the world is still done using similar filter paper . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Targeted disorders <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Amino acid disorders </Li> <Li> 1.2 Fatty acid oxidation disorders </Li> <Li> 1.3 Endocrinopathies </Li> <Li> 1.4 Hemoglobinopathies </Li> <Li> 1.5 Organic acidemias </Li> <Li> 1.6 Cystic fibrosis </Li> <Li> 1.7 Urea cycle disorders </Li> <Li> 1.8 Lysosomal storage disorders </Li> <Li> 1.9 Hearing loss </Li> <Li> 1.10 Congenital heart defects </Li> <Li> 1.11 Severe combined immunodeficiency </Li> <Li> 1.12 Other conditions </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Disease qualification </Li> <Li> 3 Techniques <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Sample collection </Li> <Li> 3.2 Laboratory testing </Li> <Li> 3.3 Reporting results </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Laboratory performance </Li> <Li> 5 History </Li> <Li> 6 Society and culture <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Controversies </Li> <Li> 6.2 Bioethics </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Targeted disorders ( edit ) </H2> See also : List of disorders included in newborn screening programs <P> Newborn screening is intended as a public health program to identify infants with treatable conditions before they present clinically , or suffer irreversible damage . Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) was the first disorder targeted for newborn screening , being implemented in a small number of hospitals and quickly expanding across the United States and the rest of the world . After the success of newborn screening for PKU ( 39 infants were identified and treated in the first two years of screening , with no false negative results ) , Guthrie and others looked for other disorders that could be identified and treated in infants , eventually developing bacterial inhibition assays to identify classic galactosemia and maple syrup urine disease . </P> <P> Newborn screening has expanded since the introduction of PKU testing in the 1960s , but can vary greatly between countries . In 2011 , the United States screened for 54 conditions , Germany for 12 , the United Kingdom for 2 ( PKU and medium chain acyl - CoA dehydrogenase deficiency ( MCADD ) ) , while France and Hong Kong only screened for one condition ( PKU and congenital hypothyroidism , respectively ) . The conditions included in newborn screening programs around the world vary greatly , based on the legal requirements for screening programs , prevalence of certain diseases within a population , political pressure , and the availability of resources for both testing and follow - up of identified patients . </P> <H3> Amino acid disorders ( edit ) </H3> <P> Newborn screening originated with an amino acid disorder , phenylketonuria ( PKU ) , which can be easily treated by dietary modifications , but causes severe mental retardation if not identified and treated early . Robert Guthrie introduced the newborn screening test for PKU in the early 1960s . With the knowledge that PKU could be detected before symptoms were evident , and treatment initiated , screening was quickly adopted around the world . Austria started screening for PKU in 1966 and England in 1968 . </P> <H3> Fatty acid oxidation disorders ( edit ) </H3> <P> With the advent of tandem mass spectrometry as a screening tool , several fatty acid oxidation disorders were targeted for inclusion in newborn screening programs . Medium chain acyl - CoA dehydrogenase deficiency ( MCADD ) , which had been implicated in several cases of sudden infant death syndrome was one of the first conditions targeted for inclusion . MCADD was the first condition added when the United Kingdom expanded their screening program from PKU only . Population based studies in Germany , the United States and Australia put the combined incidence of fatty acid oxidation disorders at 1 : 9300 among Caucasians . The United States screens for all known fatty acid oxidation disorders , either as primary or secondary targets , while other countries screen for a subset of these . </P> <P> The introduction of screening for fatty acid oxidation disorders has been shown to have reduced morbidity and mortality associated with the conditions , particularly MCADD . An Australian study found a 74 % reduction in episodes of severe metabolic decompensation or death among individuals identified by newborn screening as having MCADD versus those who presented clinically prior to screening . Studies in the Netherlands and United Kingdom found improvements in outcome at a reduced cost when infants were identified before presenting clinically . </P> <P> Newborn screening programs have also expanded the information base available about some rare conditions . Prior to its inclusion in newborn screening , short - chain acyl - CoA dehydrogenase deficiency ( SCADD ) was thought to be life - threatening . Most patients identified via newborn screening as having this enzyme deficiency were asymptomatic , to the extent that SCADD was removed from screening panels in a number of regions . Without the cohort of patients identified by newborn screening , this clinical phenotype would likely not have been identified . </P> <H3> Endocrinopathies ( edit ) </H3> <P> The most commonly included disorders of the endocrine system are congenital hypothyroidism ( CH ) and congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( CAH ) . Testing for both disorders can be done using blood samples collected on the standard newborn screening card . Screening for CH is done by measuring thyroxin ( T4 ) , thyrotropin ( TSH ) or a combination of both analytes . Elevated 17\u03b1 - hydroxyprogesterone ( 17\u03b1 - OHP ) is the primary marker used when screening for CAH , most commonly done using enzyme - linked immunosorbant assays , with many programs using a second tier tandem mass spectrometry test to reduce the number of false positive results . Careful analysis of screening results for CAH may also identify cases of congenital adrenal hypoplasia , which presents with extremely low levels of 17\u03b1 - OHP . </P> <P> CH was added to many newborn screening programs in the 1970s , often as the second condition included after PKU . The most common cause of CH is dysgenesis of the thyroid gland After many years of newborn screening , the incidence of CH worldwide had been estimated at 1 : 3600 births , with no obvious increases in specific ethnic groups . Recent data from certain regions have showed an increase , with New York reporting an incidence of 1 : 1700 . Reasons for the apparent increase in incidence have been studied , but no explanation has been found . </P> <P> Classic CAH , the disorder targeted by newborn screening programs , is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme steroid 21 - hydroxylase , and comes in two forms - simple virilizing and a salt - wasting form . Incidence of CAH can vary greatly between populations . The highest reported incidence rates are among the Yupic Eskimos of Alaska ( 1 : 280 ) and on the French island of R\u00e9union ( 1 : 2100 ) . </P> <H3> Hemoglobinopathies ( edit ) </H3> Sickle cells in human blood : both normal red blood cells and sickle - shaped cells are present <P> Any condition that results in the production of abnormal hemoglobin is included under the broad category of hemoglobinopathies . Worldwide , it is estimated that 7 % of the population may carry a hemoglobinopathy with clinical significance . The most well known condition in this group is sickle cell disease . Newborn screening for a large number of hemoglobinopathies is done by detecting abnormal patterns using isoelectric focusing , which can detect many different types of abnormal hemoglobins . In the United States , newborn screening for sickle cell disease was recommended for all infants in 1987 , however it was not implemented in all 50 states until 2006 . </P> <P> Early identification of individuals with sickle cell disease and other hemoglobinopathies allows treatment to be initiated in a timely fashion . Penicillin has been used in children with sickle cell disease , and blood transfusions are used for patients identified with severe thalassemia . </P> <H3> Organic acidemias ( edit ) </H3> <P> Most jurisdictions did not start screening for any of the organic acidemias before tandem mass spectrometry significantly expanded the list of disorders detectable by newborn screening . Quebec has run a voluntary second - tier screening program since 1971 using urine samples collected at three weeks of age to screen for an expanded list of organic acidemias using a thin layer chromatography method . Newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry can detect several organic acidemias , including propionic acidemia , methylmalonic acidemia and isovaleric acidemia . </P> <H3> Cystic fibrosis ( edit ) </H3> <P> Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) was first added to newborn screening programs in New Zealand and regions of Australia in 1981 , by measuring immunoreactive trypsinogen ( IRT ) in dried blood spots . After the CFTR gene was identified , Australia introduced a two tier testing program to reduce the number of false positives . Samples with an elevated IRT value were then analyzed with molecular methods to identify the presence of disease causing mutations before being reported back to parents and health care providers . CF is included in the core panel of conditions recommended for inclusion in all 50 states , Texas was the last state to implement their screening program for CF in 2010 . Alberta was the first Canadian province to implement CF screening in 2007 . Quebec , New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island do not include CF in their screening programs . The United Kingdom as well as many European Union countries screen for CF as well . Switzerland is one of the latest countries to add CF to their newborn screening menu , doing so in January 2011 . </P> <H3> Urea cycle disorders ( edit ) </H3> <P> Disorders of the distal urea cycle , such as citrullinemia , argininosuccinic aciduria and argininemia are included in newborn screening programs in many jurisdictions that using tandem mass spectrometry to identify key amino acids . Proximal urea cycle defects , such as ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiency are not included in newborn screening panels because they are not reliably detected using current technology , and also because severely affected infants will present with clinical symptoms before newborn screening results are available . Some regions claim to screen for HHH syndrome ( hyperammonemia , hyperornithinemia , homocitrullinuria ) based on the detection of elevated ornithine levels in the newborn screening dried blood spot , but other sources have shown that affected individuals do not have elevated ornithine at birth . </P> <H3> Lysosomal storage disorders ( edit ) </H3> <P> Lysosomal storage disorders are not included in newborn screening programs with high frequency . As a group , they are heterogenous , with screening only being feasible for a small fraction of the approximately 40 identified disorders . The arguments for their inclusion in newborn screening programs center around the advantage of early treatment ( when treatment is available ) , avoiding a diagnostic odyssey for families and providing information for family planning to couples who have an affected child . The arguments against including these disorders , as a group or individually center around the difficulties with reliably identifying individuals who will be affected with a severe form of the disorder , the relatively unproven nature of the treatment methods , and the high cost / high risk associated with some treatme\n\nQuestion:\nwhen did they start screening for cystic fibrosis\n", "answer": "1981"}

Originally , Western Sephardic Jews settling in England in the 17th century would have prepared fried fish in a manner similar to Pescado frito , which is coated in a flour . Battered fish is first coated in flour then dipped into a batter consisting of flour mixed with liquid , usually water but sometimes beer . Some newer modifications to the recipe may have cornflour added , and instead of beer sometimes soda water is added . In 1860 , the first fish and chip shop was opened in London by Joseph Malin who sold `` fish fried in the Jewish fashion '' . </P> <P> Fish and chips became a stock meal among the working classes in England as a consequence of the rapid development of trawl fishing in the North Sea , and the development of railways which connected the ports to major industrial cities during the second half of the 19th century , so that fresh fish could be rapidly transported to the heavily populated areas . </P> <P> Deep - fried chips ( slices or pieces of potato ) as a dish may have first appeared in England in about the same period : the Oxford English Dictionary notes as its earliest usage of `` chips '' in this sense the mention in Charles Dickens ' A Tale of Two Cities ( 1859 ) : `` Husky chips of potatoes , fried with some reluctant drops of oil '' . </P> <P> The modern fish - and - chip shop ( `` chippy '' or `` chipper '' in modern British slang ) originated in the United Kingdom , although outlets selling fried food occurred commonly throughout Europe . Early fish - and - chip shops had only very basic facilities . Usually these consisted principally of a large cauldron of cooking fat , heated by a coal fire . The fish - and - chip shop later evolved into a fairly standard format , with the food served , in paper wrappings , to queuing customers , over a counter in front of the fryers . By 1910 , there were more than 25,000 fish and chip shops across the country , and in the 1920s there were more than 35,000 shops . As a boy Alfred Hitchcock lived above a fish and chip shop in London , which was the family business . According to Professor John Walton , author of Fish and Chips and the British Working Class , the British government made safeguarding supplies of fish and chips during World War I a priority : `` The cabinet knew it was vital to keep families on the home front in good heart , unlike the German regime that failed to keep its people well fed '' . In 1928 , Harry Ramsden opened his fish and chip shop in Guiseley , West Yorkshire . On a single day in 1952 , the shop served 10,000 portions of fish and chips , earning a place in the Guinness Book Of Records . In George Orwell 's The Road to Wigan Pier ( 1937 ) , documenting his experience of working class life in the north of England , the author considered fish and chips chief among the ' home comforts ' which acted as a panacea to the working classes . During World War II , fish and chips remained one of the few foods in the United Kingdom not subject to rationing . Prime Minister Winston Churchill referred to the combination of fish and chips as `` the good companions '' . John Lennon enjoyed his fish and chips -- a staple of the working class -- smothered in ketchup . </P> <P> British fish and chips were originally served in a wrapping of old newspapers but this practice has now largely ceased , with plain paper , cardboard , or plastic being used instead . In the United Kingdom , the Fish Labelling Regulations 2003 and in Ireland the European Communities ( Labelling of Fishery and Aquaculture Products ) Regulations 2003 respectively enact directive 2065 / 2001 / EC , and generally mean that `` fish '' must be sold with the particular commercial name or species named ; so , for example , `` cod and chips '' now appears on menus rather than the more vague `` fish and chips '' . In the United Kingdom the Food Standards Agency guidance excludes caterers from this ; but several local Trading Standards authorities and others do say it can not be sold merely as `` fish and chips '' . </P> <H3> United Kingdom ( edit ) </H3> A blue plaque in Oldham ( Greater Manchester ) in England marking the 1860s origins of the fish and chip shop and the fast food industry <P> A prominent meal in British culture , the dish became popular in wider circles in London and South East England in the middle of the 19th century : Charles Dickens mentions a `` fried fish warehouse '' in Oliver Twist , first published in 1838 , while in the north of England a trade in deep - fried chipped potatoes developed . The first chip shop stood on the present site of Oldham 's Tommyfield Market . It remains unclear exactly when and where these two trades combined to become the fish - and - chip shop industry we know . A Jewish immigrant , Joseph Malin , opened the first recorded combined fish - and - chip shop in London in 1860 or in 1865 ; a Mr Lees pioneered the concept in the North of England , in Mossley , in 1863 . </P> <P> The concept of a fish restaurant , as opposed to take - away , was introduced by Samuel Isaacs ( born 1856 in Whitechapel , London ; died 1939 in Brighton , Sussex ) who ran a thriving wholesale and retail fish business throughout London and the South of England in the latter part of the 19th century . Isaacs ' first restaurant opened in London in 1896 serving fish and chips , bread and butter , and tea for nine pence , and its popularity ensured a rapid expansion of the chain . </P> <P> The restaurants were carpeted , had table service , tablecloths , flowers , china and cutlery , and made the trappings of upmarket dining affordable to the working classes for the first time . They were located in Tottenham Court Road , St Pancras , The Strand , Hoxton , Shoreditch , Brixton and other London districts , as well as Clacton , Brighton , Ramsgate , Margate and other seaside resorts in southern England . Menus were expanded in the early 20th century to include meat dishes and other variations as their popularity grew to a total of thirty restaurants . Sam Isaacs ' trademark was the phrase `` This is the Plaice '' , combined with a picture of the punned - upon fish in question . A glimpse of the old Brighton restaurant at No. 1 Marine Parade can be seen in the background of Norman Wisdom 's 1955 film One Good Turn just as Wisdom / Pitkin runs onto the seafront ; this is now the site of a Harry Ramsden 's fish and chips restaurant . A blue plaque at Oldham 's Tommyfield Market marks the first chips fried in England in 1860 , and the origin of the fish and chip shop and fast food industries . </P> Fish and chips traditionally wrapped in white paper and newspaper <P> Dundee City Council claims that chips were first sold by a Belgian immigrant , Edward De Gernier , in the city 's Greenmarket in the 1870s . </P> <P> In Edinburgh , a combination of Gold Star brown sauce and water or malt vinegar , known as `` sauce '' , or more specifically as `` chippy sauce '' , has great popularity . </P> <H3> Fish & chips Awards ( edit ) </H3> <P> The annual National Fish & Chips Awards were set up in the UK in 1988 . The 30th Annual Fish & Chips Awards ceremony was attended by Norwegian ambassador to the UK Mona Juul . </P> <H3> Ireland ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Irish cuisine <P> In Ireland , the first fish and chips were sold by an Italian immigrant , Giuseppe Cervi , who mistakenly stepped off an North American - bound ship at Queenstown ( now Cobh ) in County Cork in the 1880s and walked all the way to Dublin . He started by selling fish and chips outside Dublin pubs from a handcart . He then found a permanent spot in Great Brunswick Street ( now Pearse Street ) . His wife Palma would ask customers `` Uno di questa , uno di quella ? '' This phrase ( meaning `` one of this , one of that '' ) entered the vernacular in Dublin as `` one and one '' , which is still a way of referring to fish and chips in the city . </P> <H3> New Zealand ( edit ) </H3> Main article : New Zealand cuisine <P> Fish and chips are the most popular takeaway food in New Zealand . Food historians have been unable to pinpoint exactly when the meal became an established part of New Zealand cuisine but all recognise that the first fish and chips shops were introduced by British settlers before World War I. During the 20th century , nearly every small town and suburb in New Zealand had at least one fish - and - chip shop . As in Britain , Friday night has been the traditional night to eat fish . </P> <P> Traditionally , fish and chips were served in wrappings of newspaper . With the decline of the newspaper industry , this has become less common . </P> <P> In 1980 , four up - and - coming Labour Party politicians , including David Lange , were nicknamed the `` Fish and Chip Brigade '' due to a picture published at the time with the group eating fish and chips . </P> <H3> United States ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Cuisine of the United States <P> In the United States , the dish is most commonly sold as `` fish and chips '' , except in Upstate New York and Wisconsin and other parts of the Northeast and Upper Midwest , where this dish would be called a fish fry . Despite the name `` fish and chips '' , and the US meaning of `` chips '' , the dish is served with French fries ( much thinner than British and Irish chips ) . In the Southern United States , a common form of cuisine is fried catfish with French fries , accompanied by coleslaw , pickles , raw onion slices and lemon slices . </P> <H2> Composition ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Cooking ( edit ) </H3> Frying range <P> Traditional frying uses beef dripping or lard ; however , vegetable oils , such as peanut oil ( used because of its relatively high smoke point ) now predominate . A minority of vendors in the North of England and Scotland , and the majority of vendors in Northern Ireland , still use dripping or lard , as it imparts a different flavour to the dish , but this makes the fried chips unsuitable for vegetarians and for adherents of certain faiths . Lard is used in some living industrial history museums , such as the Black Country Living Museum . </P> <H3> Thickness ( edit ) </H3> Fish and chips at a Hesburger fast food restaurant , advertised as particularly English <P> British and Irish chips are usually thicker than American - style French fries sold by major multinational fast food chains , resulting in a lower fat content per portion . In their homes or in some restaurants , people in or from the United States may eat a thick type of chip , more similar to the British and Irish variant , sometimes referred to as steak fries . </P> <H3> Batter ( edit ) </H3> <P> In Britain and Ireland , fish and chip shops traditionally use a simple water and flour batter , adding a little sodium bicarbonate ( baking soda ) and a little vinegar to create lightness , as they react to create bubbles in the batter .

Child actor Bryan Beck stepped into the role on September 8 , 1982 to 1986 . </P> <P> On December 19 , 1991 , Burton stepped into the role on a contractual basis as a SORASed Jason Quartermaine . In November 1999 , ABC confirmed that Burton had decided not to renew his contract which expired in December to pursue other opportunities . Burton last appeared on contract on January 27 , 2000 . In June 2000 , ABC confirmed that Burton would reprise his role for a six - week stint starting on August 25 , 2000 until he last appeared on October 10 , 2000 . In December 2000 , it was announced that Burton would return to the series once again and began airing on January 29 , 2001 . In January 2001 , Burton announced that his return was only temporary due to his commitment to film a pilot for his DreamWorks Television development deal . Whether he returned to the role full - time would depend on whether the series was picked up . The pilot was not picked up , Burton landed a role in a major motion picture leading to his departure on April 29 , 2001 . Burton returned to the series on contract in 2002 during May Sweeps . </P> <P> In late 2008 , Burton 's contract expired and forcing to make a decision on re-signing with the show . After months of speculation , he announced in a public appearance that he re-signed with the show . Burton stated that he would be willing to take a pay cut because he understands that money is a lot tighter now than it has been in recent years and stated that he is blessed to have a job right now . In 2011 , rumors began circulating that Burton could depart from the series due to contract negotiations . However , in May 2011 Burton announced via Twitter that he had re-signed with the series again . On August 23 , 2012 , Jamey Giddens of the website Daytime Confidential reported that contract negotiations were not going well and Burton was close to walking away from the series . On August 28 , 2012 , Burton confirmed in an interview with TV Guide 's Michael Logan that he would exit the series and agreed to stay long enough for the producers to write his character out properly . Following the announcement that Sean Kanan ( A.J. Quartermaine ) was returning to the series in an undisclosed role , rumors began circulating that Kanan might be a recast of Jason . Kanan 's resemblance to Burton fed into the rumors . </P> <P> On September 2 , 2014 , executive producer Frank Valentini announced on Twitter that former All My Children and The Young and the Restless actor Billy Miller would join the cast as Jason . On September 30 , 2014 , Miller 's air date as Jason was revealed to be on October 1 . </P> <P> In June 2017 , it was announced that Burton would return to the series in an undisclosed role , later referred to as `` Patient 6 . '' In November 2017 , it was announced that Burton had reprised the role of Jason , while Miller 's casting was retconned to the character of Andrew Cain . </P> <H3> Characterization ( edit ) </H3> `` I guess the writers started seeing something that was happening and they had the idea of making me a new character and basically starting from scratch . It has been a great journey for me as an actor and for me , personally . '' -- Burton on Jason Morgan <P> Steve Burton 's early years on the soap as the `` rich , wholesome preppy '' Jason Quartermaine would come to a shocking , and dramatic end in 1995 after a car accident caused by his brother , A.J. leaves the character as a brain damaged amnesiac . Following Jason 's split from the Quartermaines , except for his sister Emily and grandmother Lila Morgan Quartermaine ( Anna Lee ) , and a change of his surname to Morgan , he would become the right - hand man for mob boss , Sonny Corinthos ( Maurice Benard ) . At the time , Burton was considering leaving the show and joked that a producer noted that he played every scene , the same way , as if someone was about to die . Burton 's decision to stay stemmed from a conversation with Benard who gave him advice on how to improve . While still portraying Jason Quartermaine , the writers saw the chemistry between him and Benard and decided to create Jason Morgan . </P> `` Am I a villain ? I guess . If I kill people , then I guess I 'm a villain . The audience knows that it 's been done . But they do n't care . '' -- Burton on his character 's change in direction <P> With a new personality shift , Burton 's Jason went from `` preppy and wholesome '' to `` angry , stoic and emotionless . '' In the early stages of his transformation into Jason Morgan , he would experience fits of rage and was even given the nickname `` anger boy . '' Post accident , as Jason matured the fits of rage subsided , Jason was very light and fun during his relationship with Robin Scorpio . It was n't until after he was hurt multiple times that Jason grew darker and more intense . Jason was seen as `` stone cold , '' and he did n't show much personality , unless it was with his closest loved ones . Despite the drastic change , Burton described his character as `` vulnerable , caring , honest , and honorable '' around those that he loves . Burton welcomed the change in story for his character , noting that it can sometimes become annoying playing `` just plain nice '' all the time . Within the mob and despite constant conflicts with law enforcement , Jason operated as a vigilante often taking down criminals who targeted the Corinthos family and tried to bring illegal substances and weapons into Port Charles , New York . Jason was known to show loyalty and compassion to those he held closest to him . His acts of extreme loyalty and compassion could be seen through his friendships with Sonny and Carly , his romantic relationships and his relationship with his nephew Michael , who he raised for the first year of Michael 's life . The passing years also saw a thaw in Jason 's relationship with the Quartermaines . The death of his father Alan and a shooting that left Michael in a year - long coma opened his eyes to what the Quartermaines suffered after his own accident . For that point on , Jason was shown to be more open to a relationship with his mother Monica , and eventually his grandfather Edward Quartermaine ( John Ingle ) . The extent of the thaw with his family could also be seen through Jason 's decision to name his son , Daniel Edward , after his grandfather . </P> <H2> Storylines ( edit ) </H2> <H3> 1980s ( edit ) </H3> <P> Jason was conceived out of his father , Alan Quartermaine 's ( Stuart Damon ) , affair with Susan Moore ( Gail Ramsey ) . Jason was born on September 14 , 1981 at Our Lady of Mercy Hospital in New York City . When Jason was born , Alan supported him financially , but was fighting for custody of his other son , A.J. . Jason lived with his mother and Scott Baldwin ( Kin Shriner ) up until her death , upon which he lived with Susan 's aunt , Alice Grant ( Lieux Dressler ) . Then he moved into the Quartermaine mansion with Alan . Alan 's wife , Monica ( Leslie Charleson ) , initially rejected Jason , but eventually grew to love him and later adopted him . Jason and A.J. were sent off to boarding school as children . In December 1991 , Jason was aged several years , re-establishing his birth year as 1974 then to 1976 in 2016 . </P> <H3> 1990s ( edit ) </H3> <P> When a newly SORASed Jason and older brother A.J. return to town , Jason , who is a successful student and athlete , is treated as the family favorite while A.J. is failing and dealing with alcoholism . Jason has relationships with Karen Wexler ( Cari Shayne ) , Brenda Barrett ( Vanessa Marcil ) , Robin Scorpio ( Kimberly McCullough ) and Keesha Ward ( Senait Ashenafi ) . Jason supports Monica through her health crisis with breast cancer and adores his adoptive sister , Emily Quartermaine ( then Amber Tamblyn ) . In December 1995 , an intoxicated A.J. runs his car into a tree . Jason , who was attempting to stop A.J. from driving , is in the passenger seat and hits his head on a large boulder after being ejected from the car . Jason suffers brain injuries that result in total memory loss . Upon waking up from his coma , Jason had no recollection of his past and resented all of the Quartermaines except his grandmother Lila Quartermaine ( Anna Lee ) and sister Emily . His personality drastically changes . Jason eventually turns his back on his family , and changes his surname to Morgan , Lila 's maiden name . Jason meets Robin again on a bridge and they begin a friendship which turns into a romantic relationship . Robin encouraged Jason to develop relationships with Lila , Emily , and Monica , and he stood by Robin at the Nurses Ball , where she shares with Port Charles for the first time that she is HIV positive . Robin leaves for college at Yale University and Jason asks her friend Sonny Corinthos ( Maurice Benard ) for a job . His loyalty and hard work impress Sonny . Jason becomes Sonny 's personal enforcer in his mob business . Robin returns in 1997 and was with Jason when he was shot for the first time by the Tin Man . Jason was operated on and saved . Robin begged Jason to leave his dangerous life behind . When Jason refused Robin begged Sonny to fire Jason . Initially hesitant , Sonny finally relented . Jason was infuriated when Sonny told him he was fired , and knew Robin was to blame . He and Robin broke up , and Robin made plans to leave town again . Jason met Robin on the bridge , and they said a last goodbye . </P> <P> To help Carly Benson ( then Sarah Joy Brown ) , Jason pretends to be the father of her baby .

{"content": "Answer the question based on the information provided in the document given below. The answer should be a number\n\nQuestion:\nwhen did the nfl change to a 16 game schedule\n\nDocument:\ne new league caused the NFL to expand and follow suit with a fourteen - game schedule in 1961 . </P> <P> Also in 1961 , the U.S. Congress passed the Sports Broadcasting Act in response to a court decision which ruled that the NFL 's method of negotiating television broadcasting rights violated antitrust laws . The law allows the league to sell the rights to all regular season and postseason games to the networks , but prohibits the league from directly competing with high school and college football games . Since high school and college teams typically play games on Friday and Saturday , respectively , the NFL can not hold games on those days until those seasons generally end in mid-December . </P> <P> From 1961 through 1977 , the NFL schedule consisted of fourteen regular season games played over fourteen weeks , except in 1966 . Opening weekend typically was the weekend after Labor Day , or rarely two weekends after Labor Day . Teams played six or seven exhibition games . In 1966 ( and 1960 ) , the NFL had an odd number of franchises , so one team was idle each week . In 1978 , the league changed the schedule to include sixteen regular season games and four exhibition games . From 1978 through 1989 , the sixteen games were played over sixteen weeks . </P> <P> In 1990 , the NFL re-introduced a bye week to the schedule , which it had not had since 1966 . Each team played sixteen regular season games over seventeen weeks . During the season , on a rotating basis , each team would have the weekend off . As a result , opening weekend was moved up to Labor Day weekend . The league had an odd number of teams ( 31 ) from 1999 to 2001 . During that period , at least one team had to be given a bye on any given week . For the 1993 season , the league experimented with the schedule by adding a second bye week for each team , resulting in an 18 - week regular season . In 2001 , the September 11th attacks resulted in the league postponing its week 2 games , leading to another 18 - week season . </P> <P> Since the 2002 season , the league has scheduled a nationally televised regular season kickoff game on the Thursday night after Labor Day , prior to the first Sunday of NFL games to kick off the season . The first one , featuring the San Francisco 49ers and the New York Giants , was held on September 5 , 2002 largely to celebrate New York City 's resilience in the wake of the September 11 , 2001 attacks . Since 2004 , the NFL has indicated that the opening game will normally be hosted by the defending Super Bowl champions as the official start of their title defense . Under this scheduling system , the earliest the regular season could begin is September 4 , as it was in the 2008 and 2014 seasons , due to September 1 falling on a Monday , while the latest possible is September 10 , as it was in the 2009 and 2015 seasons , due to September 1 falling on a Tuesday . </P> <H2> Scheduling formula ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Current formula ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> POS </Th> <Th> NFC East </Th> <Th> NFC North </Th> <Th> NFC South </Th> <Th> NFC West </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1st </Td> <Td> Eagles </Td> <Td> Vikings </Td> <Td> Saints </Td> <Td> Seahawks </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2nd </Td> <Td> Cowboys </Td> <Td> Lions </Td> <Td> Panthers </Td> <Td> Rams </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3rd </Td> <Td> Redskins </Td> <Td> Packers </Td> <Td> Falcons </Td> <Td> Cardinals </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 4th </Td> <Td> Giants </Td> <Td> Bears </Td> <Td> Buccaneers </Td> <Td> 49ers </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"5\"> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> POS </Th> <Th> AFC East </Th> <Th> AFC North </Th> <Th> AFC South </Th> <Th> AFC West </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1st </Td> <Td> Patriots </Td> <Td> Steelers </Td> <Td> Jaguars </Td> <Td> Chiefs </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2nd </Td> <Td> Bills </Td> <Td> Ravens </Td> <Td> Titans </Td> <Td> Chargers </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3rd </Td> <Td> Dolphins </Td> <Td> Bengals </Td> <Td> Colts </Td> <Td> Raiders </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 4th </Td> <Td> Jets </Td> <Td> Browns </Td> <Td> Texans </Td> <Td> Broncos </Td> </Tr> </Table> This chart of the 2017 season standings displays an application of the NFL scheduling formula . The Philadelphia Eagles in 2017 ( highlighted in green ) finished in first place in the NFC East . Thus , in 2018 , the Eagles will play two games against each of its division rivals ( highlighted in light blue ) , one game against each team in the NFC South and AFC South ( highlighted in yellow ) , and one game each against the first - place finishers in the NFC North and NFC West ( highlighted in orange ) . <P> Currently , the thirteen different opponents each team faces over the 16 - game regular season schedule are set using a pre-determined formula : </P> <Ul> <Li> Each team plays twice against each of the other three teams in its division : once at home , and once on the road ( six games ) . </Li> <Li> Each team plays once against each of the four teams from another division within its own conference , with the assigned division based on a three - year rotation : two at home , and two on the road ( four games ) . </Li> <Li> Each team plays once against one team from each of the remaining two divisions within its conference , based on the final division standings from the prior season : one at home , one on the road ( two games ) . </Li> <Li> Each team plays once against each of the four teams from a division in the other conference , with the assigned division based on a four - year rotation : two at home , and two on the road ( four games ) . </Li> </Ul> <P> Under this formula , all teams are guaranteed to play every other team in their own conference at least once every three years , and to play every team in the other conference exactly once every four years . The formula also guarantees a similar schedule for every team in a division each season , as all four teams will play fourteen out of their sixteen games against common opponents or each other . </P> <P> Non-divisional intraconference match - ups can occur over consecutive years if two teams happen to finish in the same place consistently . For example , even though the Colts and Patriots are in different divisions within the same conference , the two teams played each other every season between 2003 and 2012 , largely because both teams often finished in first place in their divisions each previous season . Similarly , the Redskins and the Rams played each other each season from 2008 to 2012 because both teams often landed in fourth place in their divisions . </P> <P> Outside intradivisional match - ups ( each of which is played twice - yearly ) , the home team for each match - up is also determined by the league according to a set rotation designed to largely alternate home and away designations over successive years . This rotation was slightly adjusted in 2010 for teams playing against the NFC West and AFC West , after several east - coast teams ( such as the New England Patriots and New York Jets in 2008 ) all had to make four cross-country trips to play games in San Diego , San Francisco , Oakland , and Seattle in one season . </P> <P> Although this scheduling formula determines each of the thirty - two teams ' respective opponents , the league usually does not release the final regular schedule with specific dates and times until the spring ; the NFL needs several months to coordinate the entire season schedule to align with various secondary objectives , such as accommodating various scheduling conflicts and maximizing potential TV ratings . Since 2010 , the last week of the regular season has consisted solely of divisional match - ups , in an attempt to discourage playoff - bound teams from resting their starters and playing their reserves . </P> <H3> Past formulas ( edit ) </H3> <P> Prior to 2002 ( when the league expanded to 32 teams ) the league used similar scheduling rubrics , though they were adjusted for the number of teams and divisions . From 1970 to 1994 , and again from 1999 to 2001 , the league did not have equal numbers of teams in every division , so not every team 's opposition could be determined by the same means . While teams playing against their division rivals twice each has been a tradition since at least the AFL -- NFL merger , not all teams would play the same amount of divisional games between the divisions due to the imbalances that had existed . The AFC Central in between 1999 and 2001 , consisting of six teams resulting in part from the Cleveland Browns relocation controversy , forced teams to play ten intradivision games in a 16 - game schedule . The only time since the merger that the league has been completely `` balanced '' has been from 1995 to 1998 ( with six divisions of five teams each ) and since 2002 ( with eight divisions of four teams each ) . From 1978 up to 2002 , most teams always played four of the teams from a division in the other conference on a rotating basis ( with certain exceptions differing between time periods ) , while lacking a rotary schedule within its own conference ; this meant that while a team would be more likely to play every team in the other conference on a regular basis , they could go far longer without playing every team in their own . For example , between 1970 ( when the leagues merged ) and 2002 ( when the current schedule was introduced ) the Denver Broncos and the Miami Dolphins played only 6 times , including a stretch where they met only once between 1976 and 1997 . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> POS </Th> <Th> AFC East </Th> <Th> AFC Central </Th> <Th> AFC West </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1st </Td> <Td> Bills </Td> <Td> Bengals </Td> <Td> Raiders </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2nd </Td> <Td> Dolphins </Td> <Td> Oilers </Td> <Td> Chiefs </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3rd </Td> <Td> Colts </Td> <Td> Steelers </Td> <Td> Seahawks </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 4th </Td> <Td> Jets </Td> <Td> Browns </Td> <Td> Chargers </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5th </Td> <Td> Patriots </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> Broncos </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"4\"> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> POS </Th> <Th> NFC East </Th> <Th> NFC Central </Th> <Th> NFC West </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1st </Td> <Td> Giants </Td> <Td> Bears </Td> <Td> 49ers </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2nd </Td> <Td> Eagles </Td> <Td> Buccaneers </Td> <Td> Saints </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3rd </Td> <Td> Redskins </Td> <Td> Lions </Td> <Td> Rams </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 4th </Td> <Td> Cowboys </Td> <Td> Packers </Td> <Td> Falcons </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5th </Td> <Td> Cardinals </Td> <Td> Vikings </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> This is an example of the formula used for determining opponents for teams that finished in last place in each of the five - team divisions between 1978 and 1994 , when the league consisted of 28 teams playing 16 games each .

Therefore , in 1991 , they played all of their division rivals ( marked in red ) twice each , one game against each team in the four - team AFC Central ( marked in yellow ) , two games against the last - place finisher in the AFC West ( marked in orange ) , and one game each against the last - place finishers in the NFC East and NFC Central ( marked in blue ) . <Table> <Tr> <Th> POS </Th> <Th> AFC East </Th> <Th> AFC Central </Th> <Th> AFC West </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1st </Td> <Td> Patriots </Td> <Td> Steelers </Td> <Td> Broncos </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2nd </Td> <Td> Bills </Td> <Td> Bengals </Td> <Td> Chiefs </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3rd </Td> <Td> Colts </Td> <Td> Jaguars </Td> <Td> Chargers </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 4th </Td> <Td> Dolphins </Td> <Td> Oilers </Td> <Td> Raiders </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5th </Td> <Td> Jets </Td> <Td> Ravens </Td> <Td> Seahawks </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"4\"> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> POS </Th> <Th> NFC East </Th> <Th> NFC Central </Th> <Th> NFC West </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1st </Td> <Td> Cowboys </Td> <Td> Packers </Td> <Td> Panthers </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2nd </Td> <Td> Eagles </Td> <Td> Vikings </Td> <Td> 49ers </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3rd </Td> <Td> Redskins </Td> <Td> Bears </Td> <Td> Rams </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 4th </Td> <Td> Cardinals </Td> <Td> Buccaneers </Td> <Td> Falcons </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5th </Td> <Td> Giants </Td> <Td> Lions </Td> <Td> Saints </Td> </Tr> </Table> This is an example of the formula used for determining a team 's opponents between 1995 and 1998 , when the league consisted of six divisions of five teams each .

The term ZIP is an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan ; it was chosen to suggest that the mail travels more efficiently and quickly ( zipping along ) when senders use the code in the postal address . The basic format consists of five digits . An extended ' ZIP + 4 ' code was introduced in 1983 which includes the five digits of the ZIP Code , followed by a hyphen and four additional digits that determine a more specific location . </P> <P> The term ZIP Code was originally registered as a servicemark by the U.S. Postal Service , but its registration has since expired . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Early history and five - digit ZIP Codes </Li> <Li> 1.2 ZIP + 4 </Li> <Li> 1.3 Postal bar code </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Structure and allocation <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Scope and international mail </Li> <Li> 2.2 By type and use </Li> <Li> 2.3 By geography <Ul> <Li> 2.3. 1 Primary state prefixes </Li> <Li> 2.3. 2 Secondary regional prefixes ( 123xx ) and local ZIP Codes ( 12345 ) </Li> <Li> 2.3. 3 ZIP Codes and previous zoning lines </Li> <Li> 2.3. 4 Division and reallocation of ZIP codes </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Other uses <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Delivery services </Li> <Li> 3.2 Statistics </Li> <Li> 3.3 Marketing </Li> <Li> 3.4 Legislative districts </Li> <Li> 3.5 Internet </Li> <Li> 3.6 Credit card security </Li> <Li> 3.7 Insurance rating </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Early History and five - digit ZIP Codes ( edit ) </H3> A 1963 U.S. Post Office sign <P> The early history and context of postal codes began with postal district / zone numbers . The United States Post Office Department ( USPOD ) implemented postal zones for numerous large cities in 1943 . For example : </P> <P> Mr. John Smith </P> <P> 3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue </P> Minneapolis 16 , Minnesota <P> The `` 16 '' was the number of the postal zone from the specific city . </P> <P> By the early 1960s , a more organized system was needed , and non-mandatory five - digit ZIP Codes were introduced nationwide on July 1 , 1963 . The USPOD issued its Publication 59 : Abbreviations for Use with ZIP Code on October 1 , 1963 , with the list of two - letter state abbreviations which are generally written with both letters capitalized . An earlier list in June had proposed capitalized abbreviations ranging from two to five letters . According to Publication 59 , the two - letter standard was `` based on a maximum 23 - position line , because this has been found to be the most universally acceptable line capacity basis for major addressing systems '' , which would be exceeded by a long city name combined with a multi-letter state abbreviation , such as `` Sacramento , Calif . '' along with the ZIP Code . The abbreviations have remained unchanged , with the exception of Nebraska , which was changed from NB to NE in 1969 at the request of the Canadian postal administration , to avoid confusion with the Canadian province of New Brunswick . </P> <P> Robert Moon is considered the father of the ZIP Code ; he submitted his proposal in 1944 while working as a postal inspector . The post office only credits Moon with the first three digits of the ZIP Code , which describe the sectional center facility ( SCF ) or `` sec center . '' An SCF is a central mail processing facility with those three digits . The SCF sorts mail to all post offices with those first three digits in their ZIP Codes . The mail is sorted according to the final two digits of the ZIP Code and sent to the corresponding post offices in the early morning . Sectional centers do not deliver mail and are not open to the public ( though the building may include a post office open to the public ) , and most of their employees work night shift . Mail picked up at post offices is sent to their own SCF in the afternoon , where the mail is sorted overnight . In the cases of large cities , the last two digits coincide with the older postal zone number thus : </P> <P> Mr. John Smith </P> <P> 3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue </P> Minneapolis , MN 55416 <P> In 1967 , these became mandatory for second and third - class bulk mailers , and the system was soon adopted generally . The United States Post Office used a cartoon character which it called Mr. ZIP to promote the use of the ZIP Code . He was often depicted with a legend such as `` USE ZIP CODE '' in the selvage of panes of postage stamps or on the covers of booklet panes of stamps . </P> <P> In 1971 Elmira ( NY ) Star Gazette reporter Dick Baumbach found out the White House was not using a zip code on its envelopes . Herb Klein , special assistant to President Nixon , responded by saying the next printing of envelopes would include the zip code . That did occur . </P> <H3> ZIP + 4 ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1983 , the U.S. Postal Service introduced an expanded ZIP Code system that it called ZIP + 4 , often called `` plus - four codes '' , `` add - on codes '' , or `` add - ons '' . A ZIP + 4 Code uses the basic five - digit code plus four additional digits to identify a geographic segment within the five - digit delivery area , such as a city block , a group of apartments , an individual high - volume receiver of mail , a post office box , or any other unit that could use an extra identifier to aid in efficient mail sorting and delivery . However , initial attempts to promote universal use of the new format met with public resistance and today the plus - four code is not required . In general , mail is read by a multiline optical character reader ( MLOCR ) that almost instantly determines the correct ZIP + 4 Code from the address -- along with the even more specific delivery point -- and sprays an Intelligent Mail barcode ( IM ) on the face of the mail piece that corresponds to 11 digits -- nine for the ZIP + 4 Code and two for the delivery point . </P> <P> For Post Office Boxes , the general ( but not invariable ) rule is that each box has its own ZIP + 4 code . The add - on code is often one of the following : the last four digits of the box number ( e.g. PO Box 107050 , Albany , NY 12201 - 7050 ) , zero plus the last three digits of the box number ( e.g. , PO Box 17727 , Eagle River , AK 99577 - 0727 ) , or , if the box number consists of fewer than four digits , enough zeros are attached to the front of the box number to produce a four - digit number ( e.g. , PO Box 77 , Juneau , AK 99750 - 0077 ) . However , there is no uniform rule , so the ZIP + 4 Code must be looked up individually for each box . </P> <H3> Postal bar Code ( edit ) </H3> <P> The ZIP Code is often translated into an Intelligent Mail barcode that is printed on the mailpiece to make it easier for automated machines to sort . A barcode can be printed by the sender ( some word - processing programs such as WordPerfect and Microsoft Word include the feature - but is not recommended as the address to ZIP lookup tables can be significantly out of date ) . It is better to let the post office put one on when it processes the piece . In general , the post office uses OCR technology , though in some cases a human might have to read and enter the address . </P> <P> Customers who send bulk mail can get a discount on postage if they have printed the barcode themselves and have presorted the mail . This requires more than just a simple font ; mailing lists must be standardized with up - to - date Coding Accuracy Support System ( CASS ) - certified software that adds and verifies a full , correct ZIP + 4 Code and an additional two digits representing the exact delivery point . Furthermore , mail must be sorted in a specific manner to an 11 digit zip with at least 150 mailpieces for each qualifying ZIP code and must be accompanied by documentation confirming this . These steps are usually done with PAVE - certified software that also prints the barcoded address labels and the barcoded sack or tray tags . </P> <P> This means that every single mailable point in the country has its own 12 - digit number ( at least in theory ) . The delivery - point digits ( the 10th and 11th digits ) are calculated based on the primary or secondary number of the address . The USPS publishes the rules for calculating the delivery point in a document called the CASS Technical Guide . However , when confronted with two addresses like 18 and 18C , often CASS will assign the same 12 - digit number to two distinct mail delivery points . The last digit is always a check digit , which is obtained by summing all 5 , 9 or 11 digits , taking the residue modulo 10 of this sum ( i.e. , the remainder after dividing by 10 ) and finally subtracting this from 10 . ( Thus , the check digit for 10001 - 0001 00 would be 7 , since 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 , 3 \u2261 3 ( mod 10 ) and 10 -- 3 = 7 . ) </P> <H2> Structure and allocation ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Scope and international mail ( edit ) </H3> <P> ZIP Codes designate delivery points within the United States ( including territories ) , and overseas stations of its armed forces . There are also ZIP Codes for independent countries of the Federated States of Micronesia , the Republic of the Marshall Islands , and the Republic of Palau , each of which is integrated into the U.S. postal system under a Compact of Free Association . </P> <P> Mail to U.S. diplomatic missions overseas is addressed as if it were addressed to a street address in Washington , D.C. The four - digit diplomatic pouch number is used as a building number , while the city in which the embassy or consulate is located is combined with the word `` Place '' to form a street name . Each mission uses a ZIP + 4 Code consisting of 20521 and the diplomatic pouch number . For example , the mailing address of the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi , India would be : </P> <P> Embassy of the United States of America </P> <P> 9000 New Delhi Place </P> Washington , DC 20521 - 9000 <H3> By type and use ( edit ) </H3> U.S. postage stamp , 1973 : `` It all depends on ZIP Code '' <P> There are four types of ZIP Codes : </P> <Ul> <Li> Unique : assigned to a single high - volume address </Li> <Li> Post Office Box only : used only for PO Boxes at a given facility , not for any other type of delivery </Li> <Li> Military : used to route mail for the U.S. military </Li> <Li> Standard : all other ZIP Codes . </Li> </Ul> <P> Unique ZIP Codes are used for governmental agencies , universities , businesses , or buildings that receive such extremely high volumes of mail that they need their own ZIP Codes . Government examples include 20505 for the Central Intelligence Agency in Washington , D.C. ; 81009 for the Federal Citizen Information Center of the U.S. General Services Administration ( GSA ) in Pueblo , Colorado . Examples of private address unique ZIP Codes include the headquarters of Wal - Mart ( 72716 ) . </P> <P> An example of a PO Box only ZIP Code is 22313 , which is used for PO Boxes at the main post office in Alexandria , Virginia , such as those used by the United States Patent and Trademark Office . In the area surrounding that post office , home and business mail delivery addresses use ZIP Code 22314 , which is thus a Standard ZIP Code . </P> <P> In certain exceptional cases , a nominally Standard - type ZIP Code may , in practice , be used as one of the three other types . For example , the ZIP Code 43210 in Columbus , Ohio is listed as a Standard - type ZIP Code . However , since its geographic boundaries are essentially coterminous with those of The Ohio State University 's main campus , it is effectively exclusive to the university even though it is not officially a `` Unique '' - type ZIP code . </P> <H3> By geography ( edit ) </H3> Primary state prefixes ( edit ) <P> ZIP Codes are numbered with the first digit representing a certain group of U.S. states , the second and third digits together representing a region in that group ( or perhaps a large city ) and the fourth and fifth digits representing a group of delivery addresses within that region . The main town in a region ( if applicable ) often gets the first ZIP Codes for that region ; afterward , the numerical order often follows the alphabetical order . Because ZIP Codes are intended for efficient postal delivery , there are unusual cases where a ZIP Code crosses state boundaries , such as a military facility spanning multiple states or remote areas of one state most easily serviced from a bordering state . For example , ZIP Code 42223 serves Fort Campbell , which spans Christian County , Kentucky and Montgomery County , Tennessee , and ZIP Code 97635 includes portions of Lake County , Oregon and Modoc County , California . </P> <P> In general , the first three digits designate a sectional center facility , the mail sorting and distribution center for an area . A sectional center facility may have more than one three - digit code assigned to it . For example , the Northern Virginia sectional center facility in Merrifield is assigned codes 220 , 221 , 222 and 223 . In some cases , a sectional center facility may serve an area in an adjacent state , usually due to the lack of a proper location for a center in that region . For example , 739 in Oklahoma is assigned to Liberal , Kansas ; 865 in Arizona is assigned to Gallup , New Mexico ; and 961 in California to Reno , Nevada . </P> <P> In terms of geographic location , many of the lowest ZIP Codes , which begin with ' 0 ' , are in the New England region . Also in the ' 0 ' region are New Jersey ( non-contiguous with the remainder of the ' 0 ' area ) , Puerto Rico , the \n", "answer": "1963"}

The memorial was one of the few to survive the Great Fire of London in 1666 and is now in St Paul 's Cathedral . The statue was claimed by Izaac Walton in his biography to have been modelled from the life by Donne in order to suggest his appearance at the resurrection ; it was to start a vogue in such monuments during the course of the 17th century . In 2012 a bust of the poet by Nigel Boonham was unveiled outside in the cathedral churchyard . </P> <H2> Writings ( edit ) </H2> <P> Donne 's earliest poems showed a developed knowledge of English society coupled with sharp criticism of its problems . His satires dealt with common Elizabethan topics , such as corruption in the legal system , mediocre poets , and pompous courtiers . His images of sickness , vomit , manure , and plague reflected his strongly satiric view of a world populated by all the fools and knaves of England . His third satire , however , deals with the problem of true religion , a matter of great importance to Donne . He argued that it was better to examine carefully one 's religious convictions than blindly to follow any established tradition , for none would be saved at the Final Judgment , by claiming `` A Harry , or a Martin taught ( them ) this . '' </P> <P> Donne 's early career was also notable for his erotic poetry , especially his elegies , in which he employed unconventional metaphors , such as a flea biting two lovers being compared to sex . In `` Elegy XIX : To His Mistris Going to Bed '' he poetically undressed his mistress and compared the act of fondling to the exploration of America . In `` Elegy XVIII '' he compared the gap between his lover 's breasts to the Hellespont . Donne did not publish these poems , although he did allow them to circulate widely in manuscript form . </P> <P> ... any mans death diminishes me , because I am involved in Mankinde ; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls ; It tolls for thee ... </P> -- Donne , Meditation XVII <P> Some have speculated that Donne 's numerous illnesses , financial strain , and the deaths of his friends all contributed to the development of a more somber and pious tone in his later poems . The change can be clearly seen in `` An Anatomy of the World '' ( 1611 ) , a poem that Donne wrote in memory of Elizabeth Drury , daughter of his patron , Sir Robert Drury of Hawstead , Suffolk . This poem treats Elizabeth 's demise with extreme gloominess , using it as a symbol for the Fall of Man and the destruction of the universe . </P> <P> The poem `` A Nocturnal upon S. Lucy 's Day , Being the Shortest Day '' , concerns the poet 's despair at the death of a loved one . In it Donne expresses a feeling of utter negation and hopelessness , saying that `` I am every dead thing ... re-begot / Of absence , darkness , death . '' This famous work was probably written in 1627 when both Donne 's friend Lucy , Countess of Bedford , and his daughter Lucy Donne died . Three years later , in 1630 , Donne wrote his will on Saint Lucy 's Day ( 13 December ) , the date the poem describes as `` Both the year 's , and the day 's deep midnight '' . </P> <P> The increasing gloominess of Donne 's tone may also be observed in the religious works that he began writing during the same period . His early belief in the value of scepticism now gave way to a firm faith in the traditional teachings of the Bible . Having converted to the Anglican Church , Donne focused his literary career on religious literature . He quickly became noted for his sermons and religious poems . The lines of these sermons and devotional works would come to influence future works of English literature , such as Ernest Hemingway 's For Whom the Bell Tolls , which took its title from a passage in Meditation XVII of Devotions upon Emergent Occasions , and Thomas Merton 's No Man is an Island , which took its title from the same source . </P> <P> Towards the end of his life Donne wrote works that challenged death , and the fear that it inspired in many men , on the grounds of his belief that those who die are sent to Heaven to live eternally . One example of this challenge is his Holy Sonnet X , `` Death Be Not Proud '' , from which come the famous lines `` Death , be not proud , though some have called thee / Mighty and dreadful , for thou art not so . '' Even as he lay dying during Lent in 1631 , he rose from his sickbed and delivered the Death 's Duel sermon , which was later described as his own funeral sermon . Death 's Duel portrays life as a steady descent to suffering and death ; death becomes merely another process of life , in which the ' winding sheet ' of the womb is the same as that of the grave . Hope is seen in salvation and immortality through an embrace of God , Christ and the Resurrection . </P> <H2> Style ( edit ) </H2> <P> His work has received much criticism over the years , especially concerning his metaphysical form . Donne is generally considered the most prominent member of the metaphysical poets , a phrase coined in 1781 by Samuel Johnson , following a comment on Donne by John Dryden . Dryden had written of Donne in 1693 : `` He affects the metaphysics , not only in his satires , but in his amorous verses , where nature only should reign ; and perplexes the minds of the fair sex with nice speculations of philosophy , when he should engage their hearts , and entertain them with the softnesses of love . '' In Life of Cowley ( from Samuel Johnson 's 1781 work of biography and criticism Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets ) , Johnson refers to the beginning of the seventeenth century in which there `` appeared a race of writers that may be termed the metaphysical poets '' . Donne 's immediate successors in poetry therefore tended to regard his works with ambivalence , with the Neoclassical poets regarding his conceits as abuse of the metaphor . However he was revived by Romantic poets such as Coleridge and Browning , though his more recent revival in the early twentieth century by poets such as T.S. Eliot and critics like FR Leavis tended to portray him , with approval , as an anti-Romantic . </P> <P> Donne is considered a master of the metaphysical conceit , an extended metaphor that combines two vastly different ideas into a single idea , often using imagery . An example of this is his equation of lovers with saints in `` The Canonization '' . Unlike the conceits found in other Elizabethan poetry , most notably Petrarchan conceits , which formed clich\u00e9d comparisons between more closely related objects ( such as a rose and love ) , metaphysical conceits go to a greater depth in comparing two completely unlike objects . One of the most famous of Donne 's conceits is found in `` A Valediction : Forbidding Mourning '' where he compares two lovers who are separated like the two legs of a compass . </P> <P> Donne 's works are also witty , employing paradoxes , puns , and subtle yet remarkable analogies . His pieces are often ironic and cynical , especially regarding love and human motives . Common subjects of Donne 's poems are love ( especially in his early life ) , death ( especially after his wife 's death ) , and religion . </P> <P> John Donne 's poetry represented a shift from classical forms to more personal poetry . Donne is noted for his poetic metre , which was structured with changing and jagged rhythms that closely resemble casual speech ( it was for this that the more classical - minded Ben Jonson commented that `` Donne , for not keeping of accent , deserved hanging '' ) . </P> <P> Some scholars believe that Donne 's literary works reflect the changing trends of his life , with love poetry and satires from his youth and religious sermons during his later years . Other scholars , such as Helen Gardner , question the validity of this dating -- most of his poems were published posthumously ( 1633 ) . The exception to these is his Anniversaries , which were published in 1612 and Devotions upon Emergent Occasions published in 1624 . His sermons are also dated , sometimes specifically by date and year . </P> <H2> Legacy ( edit ) </H2> John Donne Memorial by Nigel Boonham , 2012 , St Paul 's Cathedral Churchyard <P> Donne is commemorated as a priest in the calendar of the Church of England and in the Calendar of Saints of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America on 31 March . </P> <P> During his lifetime several likenesses were made of the poet . The earliest was the anonymous portrait of 1594 now in the National Portrait Gallery , London which has been recently restored . One of the earliest Elizabethan portraits of an author , the fashionably dressed poet is shown darkly brooding on his love . The portrait was described in Donne 's will as `` that picture of myne wych is taken in the shaddowes '' , and bequeathed by him to Robert Kerr , 1st Earl of Ancram . Other paintings include a 1616 head and shoulders after Isaac Oliver , also in the National Portrait Gallery , and a 1622 head and shoulders in the Victoria and Albert Museum . In 1911 the young Stanley Spencer devoted a visionary painting to John Donne arriving in heaven ( 1911 ) which is now in the Fitzwilliam Museum . </P> <H3> In literature ( edit ) </H3> <P> After Donne 's death , a number of poetical tributes were paid to him , of which one of the principal ( and most difficult to follow ) was his friend Lord Herbert of Cherbury 's `` Elegy for Doctor Donne '' . Posthumous editions of Donne 's poems were accompanied by several `` Elegies upon the Author '' over the course of the next two centuries . Six of these were written by fellow churchmen , others by such courtly writers as Thomas Carew , Sidney Godolphin and Endymion Porter . In 1963 came Joseph Brodsky 's `` The Great Elegy for John Donne '' . </P> <P> Beginning in the 20th century , several historical novels appeared taking as their subject various episodes in Donne 's life . His courtship of Anne More is the subject of Elizabeth Gray Vining 's Take Heed of Loving Me : A novel about John Donne ( 1963 ) and Maeve Haran 's The Lady and the Poet ( 2010 ) . Both characters also make interspersed appearances in Mary Novik 's Conceit ( 2007 ) , where the main focus is on their rebellious daughter Pegge . English treatments include Garry O'Connor 's Death 's Duel : a novel of John Donne ( 2015 ) , which deals with the poet as a young man . He also plays a significant role in Christie Dickason 's The Noble Assassin ( 2012 ) , a novel based on the life of Donne 's patron and ( the author claims ) his lover , Lucy Russell , Countess of Bedford . Finally there is Bryan Crockett 's Love 's Alchemy : a John Donne Mystery ( 2015 ) , in which the poet , blackmailed into service in Robert Cecil 's network of spies , attempts to avert political disaster and at the same time outwit Cecil . </P> <H3> Musical settings ( edit ) </H3> <P> There were musical settings of Donne 's lyrics even during his lifetime . These included Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger ( `` So , so , leave off this last lamenting kisse '' in his 1609 Ayres ) ; John Cooper ( `` The Message '' ) ; Henry Lawes ( `` Break of Day '' ) ; `` John Dowland ( '' Break of Day '' and `` To ask for all thy love '' ) ; and settings of `` A Hymn to God the Father '' by John Hilton the younger and Pelham Humfrey ( 1688 ) . After the 17th century there were no more until the start of the 20th century with Havergal Brian ( `` A nocturnal on St Lucy 's Day '' , first performed in 1905 ) , Eleanor Everest Freer ( `` Break of Day , published in 1905 ) and Walford Davies ( '' The Cross `` , 1909 ) among the earliest . In 1945 , Benjamin Britten set nine of Donne 's Holy Sonnets in his song cycle for voice and piano The Holy Sonnets of John Donne . Lieder.net currently lists 162 settings of 62 texts by Donne . One not recorded there is a version of the song `` Go and Catch a Falling Star '' on John Renbourn 's debut album John Renbourn ( 1966 ) in which the last line is altered to `` False , ere I count one , two , three '' </P> <P> In 1954 , Priaulx Rainier set prose texts by Donne to music in h\n", "answer": "1966"}

In January 1999 , Wizards of the Coast began publishing the highly successful Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game . The game proved to be very popular , selling nearly 400,000 copies in less than six weeks , and selling 10 times better than Wizards ' initial projections . There was such a high demand for Pok\u00e9mon cards that some sports card series were discontinued in 1999 because so many printers were producing Pok\u00e9mon cards . The game won the 1999 National Parenting Center 's Seal of Approval . </P> <P> Within a year , Wizards had sold millions of copies of the Pok\u00e9mon game , and the company released a new set that included an instructional CD - ROM . Wizards continued to publish the game until 2003 . One of Nintendo 's affiliates , Pok\u00e9mon USA , had begun producing a new edition for the game before the last of its agreements with Wizards expired September 30 , and Wizards filed suit against Nintendo the following day , October 1 , 2003 . The two companies resolved their differences in December 2003 without going to court . </P> <H3> Acquisition by Hasbro ( edit ) </H3> <P> Seeing the continued success of Pok\u00e9mon and Magic : The Gathering , the game and toy giant Hasbro bought Wizards of the Coast in September 1999 , for about US $325 million . Hasbro had expressed interest in purchasing Wizards of the Coast as early as 1994 , and had been further impressed after the success of its Pok\u00e9mon game . Avalon Hill was made a division of Wizards of the Coast , in late 1999 ; the company had been purchased by Hasbro in the summer of 1998 . </P> <P> Vince Caluori became President of Wizards of the Coast in November 1999 . As of January 1 , 2001 , Peter Adkison resigned from Wizards . Chuck Huebner became President and CEO of Wizards of the Coast in June 2002 , and Loren Greenwood succeeded Huebner in these positions in April 2004 . Greg Leeds succeeded Loren Greenwood as President and CEO of Wizards of the Coast in March 2008 . </P> <P> In November 1999 , Wizards announced that Gen Con would leave Milwaukee after the 2002 convention . Hasbro sold Origins to GAMA , and in May 2002 sold Gen Con to Peter Adkison . Wizards also outsourced its magazines by licensing Dungeon , Dragon , Polyhedron , and Amazing Stories to Paizo Publishing . Wizards released the Dungeons & Dragons miniatures collectible pre-painted plastic miniatures games in 2003 , and added a licensed Star Wars line in 2004 , and through its Avalon Hill brand an Axis & Allies World War II miniatures game in 2005 . Wizards of the Coast 's book publishing division has produced hundreds of titles that have sold millions of copies in over 16 languages . </P> <P> After the company 's great success in 1999 with Pok\u00e9mon , Wizards of the Coast acquired and expanded The Game Keeper , a US chain of retail gaming stores , eventually changing its name to Wizards of the Coast , including the company 's flagship gaming center on The Ave in Seattle for several years , and its retail stores , which were mostly in shopping malls in the US . The gaming center was closed by March 2001 and eventually Wizards announced in December 2003 that it would close all of its stores in order to concentrate on game design . The stores were closed in the spring of 2004 . </P> <H3> 2000s - 2010s ( edit ) </H3> <P> In early 2006 , Wizards of the Coast filed a lawsuit against Daron Rutter , then administrator of the MTGSalvation website ( on which he is known as `` Rancored Elf '' ) . The charges stemmed from Rutter publicly posting confidential prototypes for upcoming Magic : The Gathering card sets to the MTGSalvation forums , ten months before the cards were to be released . Mark Rosewater explained the outcome : `` I can say that we ( Wizards of the Coast ) settled the lawsuit with Rancored Elf out of court to both parties ' satisfaction . '' </P> <P> Paizo Publishing 's license to produce Dragon and Dungeon magazines , which Paizo had been publishing since it spun off from Wizards of the Coast 's periodicals department in 2002 , expired in September 2007 . Wizards then moved the magazines to an online model . On June 6 , 2008 , Wizards released the 4th Edition of Dungeons & Dragons , with the retail availability of a new set of core rulebooks . Wizards began introducing 4th Edition online content in Dragon and Dungeon magazines . 4th Edition is designed to offer more streamlined game play , while the new rules framework intended to reduce the preparation time needed to run a game and make the game more accessible to new players . </P> <P> As of 2008 , the company employs over 300 people . On April 6 , 2009 , Wizards of the Coast suspended all sales of its products for the Dungeons & Dragons games in PDF format from places such as ONEBOOKSHELF.com and its subsidiaries RPGNow.com and DRIVETHRURPG.com . This coincides with a lawsuit brought against eight people in an attempt to prevent future copyright infringement of their books , and includes the recent 4th edition Dungeons & Dragons products that were made available through these places as well as all older editions PDFs of the game . </P> <P> A 5th edition of D&D was released on July 15 , 2014 featuring a set of pre-generated characters , a set of instructions for basic play , and the adventure module Lost Mine of Phandelver . In 2016 , Chris Cocks was announced as a replacement for Greg Leeds . </P> <H2> Games and products ( edit ) </H2> Main article : List of Wizards of the Coast products <P> In addition to Dungeons & Dragons , Magic : The Gathering , and Pok\u00e9mon , Wizards has produced numerous other games , including board , card , miniature , and role - playing games .

In 2011 , Statistics Canada reported approximately 2 million people identifying as adherents . The United Church was founded in 1925 as a merger of four Protestant denominations with a total combined membership of about 600,000 members : the Methodist Church , Canada , the Congregational Union of Ontario and Quebec , two - thirds of the congregations of the Presbyterian Church in Canada , and the Association of Local Union Churches , a movement predominantly of the Canadian Prairie provinces . The Canadian Conference of the Evangelical United Brethren Church joined the United Church of Canada on January 1 , 1968 . </P> <P> Membership peaked in 1964 at 1.1 million , and has declined since that time . From 1991 to 2001 , the number of people claiming an affiliation with the United Church decreased by 8 % , the third largest decrease in mainstream Christian denominations in Canada . Church statistics for the end of 2014 showed 413,717 members in 327,847 households under pastoral care . As of December 31 , 2016 , 132,459 people attend services in 2,141 communities of faith representing 2,834 congregations on a regular basis . </P> <P> The United Church has a `` council - based '' structure , where each council ( congregational , regional , or denominational ) have specific responsibilities . In some areas , each of these councils have sole authority , while in others , approval of other councils is required before action is taken . ( For example , a congregation requires regional council approval before a minister can be called or appointed to the congregation . ) The policies of the church are inclusive and liberal : there are no restrictions of gender , sexual orientation or marital status for a person considering entering the ministry ; interfaith marriages are recognized ; communion is offered to all Christian adults and children , regardless of denomination or age . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Governance and structure <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Moderator </Li> <Li> 1.2 Governance structure </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Ministry </Li> <Li> 3 Beliefs and practices <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Bible </Li> <Li> 3.2 Sacraments <Ul> <Li> 3.2. 1 Communion </Li> <Li> 3.2. 2 Baptism </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3.3 Inclusiveness </Li> <Li> 3.4 Marriage </Li> <Li> 3.5 Interfaith relations </Li> <Li> 3.6 Abortion </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Membership <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Benefits of membership </Li> <Li> 4.2 Transfer of membership and removal from rolls </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 History <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Inauguration </Li> <Li> 5.2 Crest </Li> <Li> 5.3 1930s </Li> <Li> 5.4 1940s </Li> <Li> 5.5 1950s </Li> <Li> 5.6 1960s </Li> <Li> 5.7 1970s </Li> <Li> 5.8 1980s </Li> <Li> 5.9 1990s </Li> <Li> 5.10 2000s </Li> <Li> 5.11 2010s </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Music </Li> <Li> 7 Public positions and policies <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Indigenous people </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 Criticism from outside the church </Li> <Li> 9 References </Li> <Li> 10 Further reading </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Governance and structure ( edit ) </H2> <P> The rules for governance are set out in The Manual , first written in 1925 , and updated on a regular basis . </P> <H3> Moderator ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Moderator of the United Church of Canada <P> The voice and face of the church is the Moderator , who is elected to a three - year term at each General Council .

There are two `` streams '' , ordered ministry and lay ministry . Ordered ministry includes ordained ministers and diaconal ministers . Lay ministry refers to licensed lay ministers , designated lay ministers ( DLM ) and congregational designated ministers ( CDM ) . There are no restrictions on gender , sexual orientation , age , or marital status for any branches of ministry . </P> <H2> Beliefs and practices ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Bible ( edit ) </H3> <P> The United Church believes that the Bible is central to the Christian faith and was written by people who were inspired by God . The church also believes that the circumstances under which the books of the Bible were written were of a particular place and time , and some things can not be reconciled with our lives today , such as slavery . The United Church of Canada uses the historical - critical method of interpreting the bible . </P> <H3> Sacraments ( edit ) </H3> <P> The two sacraments of the United Church are Communion and Baptism . </P> Communion ( edit ) <P> Communion is the ritual sharing of the elements of bread and wine ( or , more commonly , grape juice ) as a remembrance of the Last Supper that Jesus shared with his followers . It is usually celebrated at a table at the front of the sanctuary , where the minister blesses the elements before they are distributed to the congregation . There is no restriction regarding age or United Church membership -- Communion is open to young children as well as Christians from other denominations . The actual distribution can take several forms , including passing a tray of bread cubes and another tray of small juice glasses from person to person , and then eating the bread and drinking the juice in unison ; and `` intinction '' , where each person takes a piece of bread , dips it into a cup of juice and then eats the juice - soaked bread . </P> <P> There is no guideline for frequency . Some congregations celebrate communion once a month , others on a quarterly basis . </P> Baptism ( edit ) <P> The belief of the United Church is that baptism is not a requirement for God 's love ; it is not considered a passport to heaven , nor does the church believe that those who die unbaptised are condemned or damned for eternity . Rather , the church believes that baptism is the first step in church membership , where the parents make a profession of faith on behalf of the infant in the hope that their child will later confirm that profession at or around the age of 13 . </P> <P> The United Church practices infant baptism , but in cases where a person was not baptised as an infant , baptism can be performed at any age . In the case of infant baptism , the parents of the infant , before the congregation , agree to a series of statements about the beliefs of the United Church on behalf of their child . They also promise to encourage the child to seek full membership at an appropriate time . The members of the congregation also promise the parents that they will help to raise the child in a Christian community . The minister then places water on the candidate 's head three times ( expressing the Trinity of Father , Son and Holy Spirit ) and traces a cross on the person 's forehead with water . Baptism by immersion is also an option for adults who request it . </P> <P> In the 1970s , the United Church reached an ecumenical agreement with the Presbyterian , Lutheran , Catholic , and Anglican churches in Canada that baptisms within these churches are mutually recognized as valid . Further to that , the United Church recognizes the validity of any baptism by another denomination that was performed with water and in the name of the Father , Son and Holy Spirit . </P> <H3> Inclusiveness ( edit ) </H3> <P> Remembering that Jesus was reported to have welcomed tax collectors , prostitutes and other `` undesirables '' to his table , the church attempts to welcome everyone , regardless of age , race , class , gender , sexual orientation , or physical ability . In the same manner , there is also no restriction on those interested in entering ministry . </P> <H3> Marriage ( edit ) </H3> <P> Believing that marriage is a celebration of God 's love , the church recognizes and celebrates all legal marriages , including same - sex couples , previously divorced people , and couples of different religions . The actual policy of whom to marry is left up to the church council of each community of faith . For instance , one congregation might not allow same - sex marriages to be performed in their building , while another allows all marriages regardless of sexual orientation . </P> <H3> Interfaith relations ( edit ) </H3> <P> The church believes that there are many paths to God . The United Church 's path is through Jesus Christ , but the church also recognizes that Christians ' understanding of this is limited by an incomplete comprehension of God ; their belief is that the Holy Spirit of God is also at work through other non-Christian faiths . </P> <H3> Abortion ( edit ) </H3> <P> The church supports the right of women to have access to safe abortions that are covered by provincial health care , but also supports better access to contraception , sexual education , and counselling that might eventually make abortion unnecessary . </P> <H2> Membership ( edit ) </H2> <P> A full member is one who has been baptised , either as infant , child , youth or adult , and has made a public profession of faith before the congregation . Membership is not required in order to worship at a United Church , and many who regularly attend worship are adherents rather than members . </P> <P> In order to become a full member , a person goes through a process called `` confirmation '' . This is offered to adults ( starting at around age 13 ) and usually involves a series of classes about the beliefs of the United Church . Following this , the candidate makes a public profession of faith before the congregation , thereby `` confirming '' the statements made by his or her parents during baptism . If the person is unbaptised , the minister baptises the person before the profession of faith . The new member 's name is then entered on the official Roll of Members for that congregation . </P> <H3> Benefits of membership ( edit ) </H3> <P> Only members can be a part of a congregation 's board or council , and only members can vote on spiritual matters at congregational meetings -- usually whether to issue a `` call '' to a new minister to join the congregation . ( On temporal matters -- those that deal with finances , property , etc. -- a motion is usually made at the start of a congregational meeting to allow all who are present , rather than just members , the right to vote . ) </P> <H3> Transfer of membership and removal from rolls ( edit ) </H3> <P> Although confirmation takes place at the congregational level , the person is a member of the entire United Church of Canada , not just one congregation ; therefore membership can be transferred freely from congregation to congregation . </P> <P> A congregation may remove members from i\n\nQuestion:\nwhen did the united church of canada form\n", "answer": "1925"}

The Kingdom of Congo remained present in the region between the 14th and the early 19th centuries . Belgian colonization began when King Leopold II founded the Congo Free State , a corporate state run solely by King Leopold . Reports of widespread murder and torture in the rubber plantations led the Belgian government to seize the Congo from Leopold II and establish the Belgian Congo . Under Belgian rule numerous Christian organizations attempted to Westernize the Congolese people . </P> <P> After an uprising by the Congolese people , Belgium surrendered to the independence of the Congo in 1960 . However , the Congo remained unstable because tribal leaders had more power than the central government . Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba tried to restore order with the aid of the Soviet Union as part of the Cold War , causing the United States to support a coup led by Colonel Joseph Mobutu in 1965 . Mobutu quickly seized complete power of the Congo and renamed the country Zaire . He sought to Africanize the country , changing his own name to Mobutu Sese Seko , and demanded that African citizens change their Western names to traditional African names . Mobutu sought to repress any opposition to his rule , in which he successfully did throughout the 1980s . However , with his regime weakened in the 1990s , Mobutu was forced to agree to a power - sharing government with the opposition party . Mobutu remained the head of state and promised elections within the next two years that never took place . </P> <P> In the First Congo War , Rwanda invaded Zaire ; Mobutu lost his power during this process . Laurent - Desire Kabila took power and renamed the country the Democratic Republic of the Congo . After a disappointing rule under Kabila , the Second Congo War broke out , resulting in a regional war in which different African nations took part . Kabila was assassinated by his bodyguard in 2001 , and his son , Joseph , succeeded him and was later elected president by the Congolese government in 2006 . Kabila quickly sought peace . Foreign soldiers remained in the Congo for a few years and a power - sharing government between Kabila and the opposition party was set up . Kabila later resumed complete control over the Congo and was re-elected in a disputed election in 2011 . Today , the Congo remains dangerously unstable . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Early history </Li> <Li> 2 Colonial rule <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Congo Free State ( 1885 -- 1908 ) </Li> <Li> 2.2 Belgian Congo ( 1908 -- 60 ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Independence and the Congo Crisis ( 1960 -- 65 ) </Li> <Li> 4 Zaire ( 1965 -- 97 ) </Li> <Li> 5 Civil Wars ( 1996 - 2003 ) <Ul> <Li> 5.1 First Congo War ( 1996 -- 97 ) </Li> <Li> 5.2 Second Congo War ( 1998 -- 2003 ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Joseph Kabila period <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Transitional government ( 2003 -- 06 ) </Li> <Li> 6.2 Kabila overstays his term </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Continued conflicts <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Conflict in Kivu ( 2004 - present ) <Ul> <Li> 7.1. 1 Allied Democratic Forces insurgency </Li> <Li> 7.1. 2 Ethnic Mai Mai factions </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7.2 Conflict in Katanga </Li> <Li> 7.3 Conflict in Kasai </Li> <Li> 7.4 Ituri conflict </Li> <Li> 7.5 Dongo Conflict </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 See also </Li> <Li> 9 Notes </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 Sources </Li> <Li> 12 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Early history ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Early Congolese history Map of the Kingdom of Kongo <P> The area now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo was populated as early as 80,000 years ago , as shown by the 1988 discovery of the Semliki harpoon at Katanda , one of the oldest barbed harpoons ever found , which is believed to have been used to catch giant river catfish . During its recorded history , the area has also been known as Congo , Congo Free State , Belgian Congo , and Zaire . </P> <P> The Kingdom of Kongo existed from the 14th to the early 19th century . Until the arrival of the Portuguese it was the dominant force in the region along with the Kingdom of Luba , the Kingdom of Lunda , the Mongo people and the Anziku Kingdom . </P> <H2> Colonial rule ( edit ) </H2> See also : Belgian overseas colonies <H3> Congo Free state ( 1885 -- 1908 ) ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Congo Free State Children mutilated during King Leopold II 's rule <P> The Congo Free State was a corporate state privately controlled by Leopold II of Belgium through the Association internationale africaine , a non-governmental organization . Leopold was the sole shareholder and chairman . The state included the entire area of the present Democratic Republic of the Congo . Under Leopold II , the Congo Free State became one of the most infamous international scandals of the turn of the twentieth century . The report of the British Consul Roger Casement led to the arrest and punishment of white officials who had been responsible for cold - blooded killings during a rubber - collecting expedition in 1900 , including a Belgian national who caused the shooting of at least 122 Congolese natives . Estimates of the total death toll vary considerably . The first census was only done in 1924 , so it is even more difficult to quantify the population loss of the period . Roger Casement 's famous 1904 report estimated ten million people . According to Casement 's report , indiscriminate `` war '' , starvation , reduction of births and tropical diseases caused the country 's depopulation . European and U.S. press agencies exposed the conditions in the Congo Free State to the public in 1900 . By 1908 public and diplomatic pressure had led Leopold II to annex the Congo as the Belgian Congo colony . </P> <H3> Belgian Congo ( 1908 -- 60 ) ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Belgian Congo <P> On 15 November 1908 King L\u00e9opold II of Belgium formally relinquished personal control of the Congo Free State . The renamed Belgian Congo was put under the direct administration of the Belgian government and its Ministry of Colonies . </P> <P> Belgian rule in the Congo was based around the `` colonial trinity '' ( trinit\u00e9 coloniale ) of state , missionary and private company interests . The privileging of Belgian commercial interests meant that large amounts of capital flowed into the Congo and that individual regions became specialised . The interests of the government and private enterprise became closely tied ; the state helped companies break strikes and remove other barriers imposed by the indigenous population . The country was split into nesting , hierarchically organised administrative subdivisions , and run uniformly according to a set `` native policy '' ( politique indig\u00e8ne ) -- in contrast to the British and the French , who generally favoured the system of indirect rule whereby traditional leaders were retained in positions of authority under colonial oversight . There was also a high degree of racial segregation . Large numbers of white immigrants who moved to the Congo after the end of World War II came from across the social spectrum , but were nonetheless always treated as superior to blacks . </P> <P> During the 1940s and 1950s , the Congo experienced an unprecedented level of urbanisation and the colonial administration began various development programmes aimed at making the territory into a `` model colony '' . Notable advances were made in treating diseases such as African trypanosomiasis . One of the results of these measures was the development of a new middle class of Europeanised African \u00e9volu\u00e9s in the cities . By the 1950s the Congo had a wage labour force twice as large as that in any other African colony . The Congo 's rich natural resources , including uranium -- much of the uranium used by the U.S. nuclear programme during World War II was Congolese -- led to substantial interest in the region from both the Soviet Union and the United States as the Cold War developed . </P> <H2> Independence and the Congo crisis ( 1960 -- 65 ) ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Congo Crisis <P> Following riots in Leopoldville 4 -- 7 January 1959 , and in Stanleyville on 31 October 1959 , the Belgians realised they could not maintain control of such a vast country in the face of rising demands for independence . Belgian and Congolese political leaders held a Round Table Conference in Brussels beginning on 18 January 1960 . At the end of the conference on 27 January 1960 it was announced that elections would be held in the Congo on 22 May 1960 , and full independence granted on 30 June 1960 . The Congo was indeed granted its independence on 30 June 1960 , and adopted the name `` Republic of the Congo '' ( R\u00e9publique du Congo ) . The French colony of Middle Congo ( Moyen Congo ) also chose the name Republic of Congo upon its independence , so the two countries are more commonly known as Congo - L\u00e9opoldville and Congo - Brazzaville , after their capital cities . President Mobutu changed the country 's official name to Zaire in 1971 . That name comes from Portuguese , adapted from the Kongo word nzere or nzadi ( `` river that swallows all rivers '' ) </P> <P> In 1960 , the country was very unstable -- regional tribal leaders held far more power than the central government -- and with the departure of the Belgian administrators , almost no skilled bureaucrats remained in the country . The first Congolese graduated university only in 1956 , and very few in the new nation had any idea how to manage a country of such size . </P> <P> Parliamentary elections in 1960 produced the nationalist Patrice Lumumba as prime minister and pro-Western Joseph Kasavubu as president of the newly independent Republic of The Congo . </P> <P> On 5 July 1960 , a military mutiny by Congolese soldiers against their European officers broke out in the capital and rampant looting began . On 11 July 1960 the richest province of the country , Katanga , seceded under Moise Tshombe . The United Nations sent 20,000 peacekeepers to protect Europeans in the country and try to restore order . Western paramilitaries and mercenaries , often hired by mining companies to protect their interests , also began to pour into the country . In this period Congo 's second richest province , Kasai , also announced its independence on 8 August 1960 . </P> <P> Prime Minister Lumumba turned to the USSR for assistance . Nikita Khrushchev agreed to help , offering advanced weaponry and technical advisors . The United States viewed the Soviet presence as an attempt to take advantage of the situation and gain a proxy state in sub-Saharan Africa . UN forces were ordered to block any shipments of arms into the country . The United States also looked for a way to replace Lumumba as leader . President Kasavubu had clashed with Prime Minister Lumumba and advocated an alliance with the West rather than the Soviets . The U.S. sent weapons and CIA personnel to aid forces allied with Kasavubu and combat the Soviet presence . On 14 September 1960 , with U.S. and CIA support , Colonel Joseph Mobutu overthrew the government and arrested Lumumba . </P> <P> On 17 January 1961 Mobutu sent Lumumba to \u00c9lisabethville ( now Lubumbashi ) , capital of Katanga . In full view of the press he was beaten and forced to eat copies of his own speeches . For three weeks afterward , he was not seen or heard from . Then Katangan radio announced implausibly that he had escaped and been killed by villagers . It was soon clear that in fact he had been tortured and killed along with two others shortly after his arrival .

Without bridges , the Pittsburgh region would be a series of fragmented valleys , hillsides , river plains , and isolated communities . </P> <P> A 2006 study determined that Pittsburgh has 446 bridges , and with its proximity to three major rivers and countless hills and ravines , Pittsburgh is known as `` The City of Bridges '' . The city of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County are the largest owners of great bridges in the country , in proper proportion to their size , with the possible exception of the City of New York , which is built on an island and surrounded by large bodies of water . </P> <P> According to a 2011 study by Transportation for America , 1,194 bridges in the Pittsburgh area -- or 30.4 % -- were deficient , the highest proportion in the nation . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Major bridges </Li> <Li> 3 Notable bridges </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> Pittsburgh 's first river bridges , made of wood and long since replaced , opened in 1818 at Smithfield Street and 1819 at Sixth Street ( then St. Clair Street ) . The city 's oldest in - service bridge is the current Smithfield Street Bridge , which opened in 1883 ; it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976 . Pittsburgh waged a massive road and bridge building campaign from 1924 to 1940 ; most of Pittsburgh 's oldest major bridges date from this period . The coming of the Interstate Highway System triggered more construction in the second half of the twentieth century , as vehicular speed and throughput requirements increased . The result of more than 100 years of bridge building is a collection of most of the major types of bridge ( suspension , cantilever , arch , etc . ) , mostly built from locally produced steel , including about forty river spans . </P> <P> Many of the bridges in the Downtown area are colored Aztec Gold , either constructed as such or painted afterward , to match the city 's official colors of black and gold . A few old and out - of - service bridges , such as the Hot Metal Bridge ( which stood dormant until reopening as a passenger bridge in the year 2000 ) , are exceptions to this rule . </P> <H2> Major bridges ( edit ) </H2> <P> This table lists all bridges crossing the Allegheny , Monongahela and Ohio rivers in the City of Pittsburgh limits . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Crossing </Th> <Th> Carries </Th> <Th> River </Th> <Th> Image </Th> <Th> </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Fort Pitt Bridge </Td> <Td> I - 376 / US 19 Truck / US 22 / US 30 </Td> <Td> Monongahela </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 40 \u00b0 26 \u2032 20 '' N 80 \u00b0 00 \u2032 40 '' W \ufeff / \ufeff 40.4388 \u00b0 N 80.0111 \u00b0 W \ufeff / 40.4388 ;

This is known as the Glorious Revolution , also called the Revolution of 1688 . Locke claims in the `` Preface '' to the Two Treatises that its purpose is to justify William III 's ascension to the throne , though Peter Laslett suggests that the bulk of the writing was instead completed between 1679 -- 1680 ( and subsequently revised until Locke was driven into exile in 1683 ) . According to Laslett , Locke was writing his Two Treatises during the Exclusion Crisis , which attempted to prevent James II from ever taking the throne in the first place . Anthony Ashley - Cooper , 1st Earl of Shaftesbury , Locke 's mentor , patron and friend , introduced the bill , but it was ultimately unsuccessful . Richard Ashcraft , following in Laslett 's suggestion that the Two Treatises were written before the Revolution , objected that Shaftesbury 's party did not advocate revolution during the Exclusion Crisis . He suggests that they are instead better associated with the revolutionary conspiracies that swirled around what would come to be known as the Rye House Plot . Locke , Shaftesbury and many others were forced into exile ; some , such as Sidney , were even executed for treason . Locke knew his work was dangerous -- he never acknowledged his authorship within his lifetime . </P> <H2> Publication history ( edit ) </H2> The only edition of the Treatises published in America during the 18th century ( 1773 ) <P> Two Treatises was first published , anonymously , in December 1689 ( following printing conventions of the time , its title page was marked 1690 ) . Locke was unhappy with this edition , complaining to the publisher about its many errors . For the rest of his life , he was intent on republishing the Two Treatises in a form that better reflected his meaning . Peter Laslett , one of the foremost Locke scholars , has suggested that Locke held the printers to a higher `` standard of perfection '' than the technology of the time would permit . Be that as it may , the first edition was indeed replete with errors . The second edition was even worse , and finally printed on cheap paper and sold to the poor . The third edition was much improved , but Locke was still not satisfied . He made corrections to the third edition by hand and entrusted the publication of the fourth to his friends , as he died before it could be brought out . </P> <P> The Two Treatises begin with a Preface announcing what Locke hopes to achieve , but he also mentions that more than half of his original draft , occupying a space between the First and Second Treatises , has been irretrievably lost . Peter Laslett maintains that , while Locke may have added or altered some portions in 1689 , he did not make any revisions to accommodate for the missing section ; he argues , for example , that the end of the First Treatise breaks off in mid-sentence . </P> <P> In 1691 Two Treatises was translated into French by David Mazzel , a French Huguenot living in the Netherlands . This translation left out Locke 's `` Preface , '' all of the First Treatise , and the first chapter of the Second Treatise ( which summarised Locke 's conclusions in the First Treatise ) . It was in this form that Locke 's work was reprinted during the 18th century in France and in this form that Montesquieu , Voltaire and Rousseau were exposed to it . The only American edition from the 18th century was printed in 1773 in Boston ; it , too , left out all of these sections . There were no other American editions until the 20th century . </P> <H2> Main ideas ( edit ) </H2> <P> Two Treatises is divided into the First Treatise and the Second Treatise . The original title of the Second Treatise appears to have been simply `` Book II , '' corresponding to the title of the First Treatise , `` Book I . '' Before publication , however , Locke gave it greater prominence by ( hastily ) inserting a separate title page : `` An Essay Concerning the True Original , Extent and End of Civil Government . '' The First Treatise is focused on the refutation of Sir Robert Filmer , in particular his Patriarcha , which argued that civil society was founded on a divinely sanctioned patriarchalism . Locke proceeds through Filmer 's arguments , contesting his proofs from Scripture and ridiculing them as senseless , until concluding that no government can be justified by an appeal to the divine right of kings . </P> <P> The Second Treatise outlines a theory of civil society . Locke begins by describing the state of nature , a picture much more stable than Thomas Hobbes ' state of `` war of every man against every man , '' and argues that all men are created equal in the state of nature by God . From this , he goes on to explain the hypothetical rise of property and civilization , in the process explaining that the only legitimate governments are those that have the consent of the people . Therefore , any government that rules without the consent of the people can , in theory , be overthrown . </P> <H2> First Treatise ( edit ) </H2> Title page from Filmer 's Patriarcha ( 1680 ) <P> The First Treatise is an extended attack on Sir Robert Filmer 's Patriarcha . Locke 's argument proceeds along two lines : first , he undercuts the Scriptural support that Filmer had offered for his thesis , and second he argues that the acceptance of Filmer 's thesis can lead only to slavery ( and absurdity ) . Locke chose Filmer as his target , he says , because of his reputation and because he `` carried this Argument ( jure divino ) farthest , and is supposed to have brought it to perfection '' ( 1st Tr. , \u00a7 5 ) . </P> <P> Filmer 's text presented an argument for a divinely ordained , hereditary , absolute monarchy . According to Filmer , the Biblical Adam in his role as father possessed unlimited power over his children and this authority passed down through the generations . Locke attacks this on several grounds . Accepting that fatherhood grants authority , he argues , it would do so only by the act of begetting , and so can not be transmitted to one 's children because only God can create life . Nor is the power of a father over his children absolute , as Filmer would have it ; Locke points to the joint power parents share over their children outlined in the Bible . In the Second Treatise Locke returns to a discussion of parental power . ( Both of these discussions have drawn the interest of modern feminists such as Carole Pateman . ) </P> <P> Filmer also suggested that Adam 's absolute authority came from his ownership over all the world . To this , Locke rebuts that the world was originally held in common ( a theme that will return in the Second Treatise ) . But , even if it were not , he argues , God 's grant to Adam covered only the land and brute animals , not human beings . Nor could Adam , or his heir , leverage this grant to enslave mankind , for the law of nature forbids reducing one 's fellows to a state of desperation , if one possesses a sufficient surplus to maintain oneself securely . And even if this charity were not commanded by reason , Locke continues , such a strategy for gaining dominion would prove only that the foundation of government lies in consent . </P> <P> Locke intimates in the First Treatise that the doctrine of divine right of kings ( jure divino ) will eventually be the downfall of all governments . In his final chapter Locke asks , `` Who heir ? '' If Filmer is correct , there should be only one rightful king in all the world -- the heir of Adam . But since it is impossible to discover the true heir of Adam , no government , under Filmer 's principles , can require that its members obey its rulers . Filmer must therefore say that men are duty - bound to obey their present rulers . Locke writes : </P> <P> I think he is the first Politician , who , pretending to settle Government upon its true Basis , and to establish the Thrones of lawful Princes , ever told the World , That he was properly a King , whose Manner of Government was by Supreme Power , by what Means soever he obtained it ; which in plain English is to say , that Regal and Supreme Power is properly and truly his , who can by any Means seize upon it ; and if this be , to be properly a King , I wonder how he came to think of , or where he will find , an Usurper . ( 1st Tr. , \u00a7 79 ) </P> <P> Locke ends the First Treatise by examining the history told in the Bible and the history of the world since then ; he concludes that there is no evidence to support Filmer 's hypothesis . According to Locke , no king has ever claimed that his authority rested upon his being the heir of Adam . It is Filmer , Locke alleges , that is the innovator in politics , not those who assert the natural equality and freedom of man . </P> <H2> Second Treatise ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( March 2008 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> In the Second Treatise Locke develops a number of notable themes . It begins with a depiction of the state of nature , wherein individuals are under no obligation to obey one another but are each themselves judge of what the law of nature requires . It also covers conquest and slavery , property , representative government , and the right of revolution . </P> <H3> State of nature ( edit ) </H3> <P> Locke defines the state of nature thus : </P> <P> To properly understand political power and trace its origins , we must consider the state that all people are in naturally . That is a state of perfect freedom of acting and disposing of their own possessions and persons as they think fit within the bounds of the law of nature . People in this state do not have to ask permission to act or depend on the will of others to arrange matters on their behalf . The natural state is also one of equality in which all power and jurisdiction is reciprocal and no one has more than another . It is evident that all human beings -- as creatures belonging to the same species and rank and born indiscriminately with all the same natural advantages and faculties -- are equal amongst themselves . They have no relationship of subordination or subjection unless God ( the lord and master of them all ) had clearly set one person above another and conferred on him an undoubted right to dominion and sovereignty . </P> <P> The work of Thomas Hobbes made theories based upon a state of nature popular in 17th - century England , even as most of those who employed such arguments were deeply troubled by his absolutist conclusions . Locke 's state of nature can be seen in light of this tradition . There is not and never has been any divinely ordained monarch over the entire world , Locke argues . However , the fact that the natural state of humanity is without an institutionalized government does not mean it is lawless . Human beings are still subject to the laws of God and nature . In contrast to Hobbes , who posited the state of nature as a hypothetical possibility , Locke takes great pains to show that such a state did indeed exist . Actually , it still exists in the area of international relations where there is not and is never likely to be any legitimate overarching government ( i.e. , one directly chosen by all the people subject to it ) . Whereas Hobbes stresses the disadvantages of the state of nature , Locke points to its good points . It is free , if full of continual dangers ( 2nd Tr. , \u00a7 123 ) .

One of the earliest Elizabethan portraits of an author , the fashionably dressed poet is shown darkly brooding on his love . The portrait was described in Donne 's will as `` that picture of myne wych is taken in the shaddowes '' , and bequeathed by him to Robert Kerr , 1st Earl of Ancram . Other paintings include a 1616 head and shoulders after Isaac Oliver , also in the National Portrait Gallery , and a 1622 head and shoulders in the Victoria and Albert Museum . In 1911 the young Stanley Spencer devoted a visionary painting to John Donne arriving in heaven ( 1911 ) which is now in the Fitzwilliam Museum . </P> <H3> In literature ( edit ) </H3> <P> After Donne 's death , a number of poetical tributes were paid to him , of which one of the principal ( and most difficult to follow ) was his friend Lord Herbert of Cherbury 's `` Elegy for Doctor Donne '' . Posthumous editions of Donne 's poems were accompanied by several `` Elegies upon the Author '' over the course of the next two centuries . Six of these were written by fellow churchmen , others by such courtly writers as Thomas Carew , Sidney Godolphin and Endymion Porter . In 1963 came Joseph Brodsky 's `` The Great Elegy for John Donne '' . </P> <P> Beginning in the 20th century , several historical novels appeared taking as their subject various episodes in Donne 's life . His courtship of Anne More is the subject of Elizabeth Gray Vining 's Take Heed of Loving Me : A novel about John Donne ( 1963 ) and Maeve Haran 's The Lady and the Poet ( 2010 ) . Both characters also make interspersed appearances in Mary Novik 's Conceit ( 2007 ) , where the main focus is on their rebellious daughter Pegge . English treatments include Garry O'Connor 's Death 's Duel : a novel of John Donne ( 2015 ) , which deals with the poet as a young man . He also plays a significant role in Christie Dickason 's The Noble Assassin ( 2012 ) , a novel based on the life of Donne 's patron and ( the author claims ) his lover , Lucy Russell , Countess of Bedford . Finally there is Bryan Crockett 's Love 's Alchemy : a John Donne Mystery ( 2015 ) , in which the poet , blackmailed into service in Robert Cecil 's network of spies , attempts to avert political disaster and at the same time outwit Cecil . </P> <H3> Musical settings ( edit ) </H3> <P> There were musical settings of Donne 's lyrics even during his lifetime . These included Alfonso Ferrabosco the younger ( `` So , so , leave off this last lamenting kisse '' in his 1609 Ayres ) ; John Cooper ( `` The Message '' ) ; Henry Lawes ( `` Break of Day '' ) ; `` John Dowland ( '' Break of Day '' and `` To ask for all thy love '' ) ; and settings of `` A Hymn to God the Father '' by John Hilton the younger and Pelham Humfrey ( 1688 ) . After the 17th century there were no more until the start of the 20th century with Havergal Brian ( `` A nocturnal on St Lucy 's Day '' , first performed in 1905 ) , Eleanor Everest Freer ( `` Break of Day , published in 1905 ) and Walford Davies ( '' The Cross `` , 1909 ) among the earliest . In 1945 , Benjamin Britten set nine of Donne 's Holy Sonnets in his song cycle for voice and piano The Holy Sonnets of John Donne . Lieder.net currently lists 162 settings of 62 texts by Donne . One not recorded there is a version of the song `` Go and Catch a Falling Star '' on John Renbourn 's debut album John Renbourn ( 1966 ) in which the last line is altered to `` False , ere I count one , two , three '' </P> <P> In 1954 , Priaulx Rainier set prose texts by Donne to music in her Cycle for Declamation for solo voice . On 1992 's album Duality , the English Neoclassical Dark Wave band In The Nursery used the entirety of Donne 's `` A Valediction : Forbidding Mourning '' for the track `` Mecciano and an augmented version of `` A Fever '' for the track `` Corruption . '' </P> <P> In the 21st century there have been settings of prose texts by Donne . In 2009 , the American Jennifer Higdon composed the choral piece On the Death of the Righteous based on Donne 's sermons . Still more recent is the Russian minimalist Anton Batagov 's `` I Fear No More , selected songs and meditations of John Donne '' ( 2015 ) . </P> <H2> Works ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Biathanatos ( 1608 ) </Li> <Li> Pseudo-Martyr ( 1610 ) </Li> <Li> Ignatius His Conclave ( 1611 ) </Li> <Li> Devotions upon Emergent Occasions ( 1624 ) </Li> <Li> Poems ( 1633 ) </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ The version of Meditation XVII found on wikiquote .

The game 's general principles put it into the Crazy Eights family of card games . The game was originally developed in 1971 by Merle Robbins in Reading , Ohio , a suburb of Cincinnati . It has been a Mattel brand since 1992 . When his family and friends began to play more and more , he spent $8,000 to have 5,000 copies of the game made . He sold it from his barbershop at first , and local businesses began to sell it as well . Robins later sold the rights to UNO to a group of friends headed by Robert Tezak , a funeral parlor owner in Joliet , Illinois , for $50,000 plus royalties of 10 cents per game . Tezak formed International Games , Inc. , to market UNO , with offices behind his funeral parlor . The games were produced by Lewis Saltzman of Saltzman Printers in Maywood , Illinois . In 1992 , International Games became part of the Mattel family of companies.

Action cards ( Skip , Draw Two and Reverse ) are worth 20 Points while Wild and Wild Draw Four cards are worth 50 Points . </P> <P> The deck consists of 108 cards , of which there are 25 of each color ( red , green , blue , and yellow ) , each color having two of each rank except zero . The ranks in each color are zero to nine , `` Skip '' , `` Draw Two '' , and `` Reverse '' ( the last three being `` action cards '' ) . In addition , the deck contains four each of `` Wild '' and `` Wild Draw Four '' cards . </P> <P> To start a hand , seven cards are dealt to each player , with the top card of the deck flipped over and set aside to begin the discard pile . The player to the dealer 's left plays first unless the first card on the discard pile is an action or Wild card ( see below ) . On a player 's turn , they must do one of the following : </P> <Ul> <Li> play a card matching the discard in color , number , or symbol </Li> <Li> play a Wild card , or a playable Wild Draw Four card ( see restriction below ) </Li> <Li> draw the top card of the deck </Li> </Ul> <P> Play proceeds clockwise around the table . </P> <P> Action and Wild cards have the following effects : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Card </Th> <Th> Effect when played from hand </Th> <Th> Effect as first discard </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Skip </Td> <Td> Next player in sequence misses a turn </Td> <Td> Player to dealer 's left misses a turn </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Reverse </Td> <Td> Order of play switches directions ( clockwise to counterclockwise , or vice versa ) </Td> <Td> Dealer plays first ; play proceeds counterclockwise </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Draw Two ( + 2 ) </Td> <Td> Next player in sequence draws two cards and misses a turn </Td> <Td> Player to dealer 's left draws two cards and misses a turn </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Wild </Td> <Td> Player determines the next color to be matched ( may be used on any turn even if the player has matching color ) </Td> <Td> Player who puts the color card down chooses the color of the new card by putting down a card of that color . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Wild Draw Four / Draw Four Wild ( + 4 and wild ) </Td> <Td> Player determines next color to be matched ; next player in sequence draws four cards and misses a turn .

The player may have cards of a different color matching the current number or symbol or a Wild card and still play the Wild Draw Four card . A player who plays a Wild Draw Four may be challenged by the next player in sequence ( see Penalties ) to prove that their hand meets this condition . </Li> <Li> If the entire deck is used during play , the top discard is set aside and the rest of the pile is shuffled to create a new deck . Play then proceeds normally . </Li> <Li> It is illegal to trade cards of any sort with another player . </Li> </Ul> <P> A player who plays their next - to - last - card must call `` Uno '' as a warning to the other players . </P> <P> The first player to get rid of their last card ( `` going out '' ) wins the hand and scores points for the cards held by the other players . Number cards count their face value , all action cards count 20 , and Wild and Wild Draw Four cards count 50 . If a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four card is played to go out , the next player in the sequence must draw the appropriate number of cards before the score is tallied . If the next player has a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four card , it can be stacked and possibly bring the `` out '' player back into play . </P> <P> The first player to score 500 points wins the game . </P> <H3> Penalties ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> If a player does not call `` Uno '' after laying down their next - to - last card and is caught before the next player in sequence takes a turn ( i.e. , plays a card from their hand , draws from the deck , or touches the discard pile ) , they must draw two cards as a penalty . If the player is not caught in time ( subject to interpretation ) or remembers to call `` Uno '' before being caught , they suffer no penalty . If a player falsely calls `` Uno '' while having multiple cards in their hand , they must draw two cards . </Li> <Li> If a player plays a Wild Draw Four card , the following player can challenge its use . The player who used the Wild Draw Four must privately show their hand to the challenging player , in order to demonstrate that they had no matching colored cards . If the challenge is correct , then the challenged player draws four cards instead . If the challenge is wrong , then the challenger must draw six cards ; the four cards they were already required to draw plus two more cards . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Two - player game ( edit ) </H3> <P> In a two - player game , the Reverse card acts like a Skip card ; when played , the other player misses a turn . </P> <H3> House rules ( edit ) </H3> <P> The following house rules are suggested in the Uno rulebook , to alter the game : </P> <Ul> <Li> Progressive Uno : If a draw card is played , and the following player has the same card , they can play that card and `` stack '' the penalty , which adds to the current penalty and passes it to the following player . </Li> <Li> Seven - O : When a certain card is played , the player is able to trade hands with another player or with all players . For example , the person who played the 7 card is able to switch all of their cards with another player ; the player who played the 0 card is able to make every player exchange all their cards to the next player . </Li> <Li> Jump - In : If a player has exactly the same card ( both number and color ) as the top card of the discard pile , they may play it immediately , even if it is not their turn . The game then continues as if that player had just taken their turn . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Strategies ( edit ) </H2> <P> A strategy at Uno may be offensive ( aiming to go out ) , or defensive ( aiming to minimize the value of one 's hand , in the event that another player goes out , thus getting those points ) . Part of the skill of playing Uno is knowing when to adopt an offensive or defensive strategy . </P> <P> An offensive strategy would be holding on to Wild and Wild Draw Four cards because they can be played near the end of the hand in order to go out ( when it 's harder to play a matching card ) . However , a defensive strategy would advise getting rid of such cards early , because they have a high point value . </P> <P> A defensive strategy would advise playing a high card in order to reduce the point value of the hand . However , an offensive strategy would suggest playing a 0 when the player wants to continue on the current color , because it is less likely to be matched by another 0 of a different color ( there is only one 0 of each color , but two of each 1 -- 9 ) . </P> <P> A player holding only one card is required to call out `` Uno '' or risk being penalized if caught . A player who calls `` Uno '' risks being the target of concerted action by the other players , who may be able to use action cards to prevent that player from going out . Depending on the level and seriousness of play , some players may deliberately avoid saying `` Uno '' , in the hope of avoiding detection and then going out on the next turn . For this reason , it is useful to conceal how many cards are in your hand and to keep track of how many cards every other player holds . </P> <P> Little has been published on the optimal strategy for the game of Uno . Simulations of games may shed some light on the matter . Attempts to reduce point count in a player 's hands can be `` read '' by other players if too transparent .

The 1974 television film called Wonder Woman directed by Vincent McEveety and starring Cathy Lee Crosby , was a pilot for an intended television series being considered by ABC . Ratings were described as `` respectable but not exactly wondrous , '' and ABC did not pick up the pilot . Instead , Warner Bros. and ABC developed the 1975 television series , Wonder Woman , that fit the more traditional presentation of the character as created by William Moulton Marston , turning away from the 1968 -- 72 era that had influenced the pilot . Wonder Woman , which premiered in 1975 , starred Lynda Carter and eventually led to the full series . Crosby would later claim that she was offered the chance to reprise the role in that series . </P> <H2> Cast and characters ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Lynda Carter as Diana Prince / Wonder Woman </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> This version of the character is exclusive to the continuity of the TV series Wonder Woman and is an adaptation of Diana Prince / Wonder Woman .

Keen to make a distinction from the last pilot , producers gave the pilot the rather paradoxical title The New Original Wonder Woman . Scripting duties were given to Stanley Ralph Ross , who was instructed to be more faithful to the comic book and to create a subtle `` high comedy . '' Ross set the pilot in World War II , the era in which the original comic book began . </P> <P> After an intensive talent search , Lynda Carter , who had had a handful of minor acting roles and had been the 1972 Miss World USA and a Bob Hope USO cast member , was chosen for the lead role . For the role of Steve Trevor , the producers chose Lyle Waggoner , despite his dark brown , almost - black , hair not matching the comic 's blond Trevor , who at the time was better known as a comedic actor after several years co-starring in The Carol Burnett Show . He was also known to Ross as having been one of the leading candidates to play Batman a decade earlier , but instead Adam West was signed . Waggoner was also considered a pin - up hunk , having done a semi-nude pictorial in the first issue of Playgirl . </P> <P> Although the pilot followed the original comic book closely , in particular the aspect of Wonder Woman joining the military under the name Diana Prince , a number of elements were dropped . It mainly omitted Diana 's origin , including her birth on Paradise Island . The comic book Diana obtains the credentials of a look - alike nurse . Although the pilot shows Diana briefly as a nurse at one point , Diana takes on the identity of a Navy Yeoman Petty Officer First Class . </P> <P> One change , which was later to become synonymous with the show , was the transformation of Diana Prince into Wonder Woman by spinning . During the filming of the pilot , producers were trying to figure out a way to show how Diana Prince became Wonder Woman , when Carter suggested that she do a spin . </P> <P> Unlike the earlier pilot , the comic - book origins of the character were emphasized by the retention of the character 's traditional uniform ( the design of which was interpreted and executed by Donald Lee Feld , credited as `` Donfeld '' ) with the original setting and through the use of comic book elements . The series 's title sequence was animated in the form of a series of comic book panels featuring Wonder Woman performing a variety of heroic feats . Within the show , location and exposition were handled through comic book - style text panels . Transitions between scenes and commercial breaks were marked by animated starburst sequences . </P> Synopsis ( edit ) <P> In early 1942 , during the Second World War , American pilot Major Steve Trevor ( Waggoner ) bails out during an air battle over the Bermuda Triangle , location of Paradise Island . The island is home to the Amazons : beautiful , ageless women with great strength , agility , and intelligence . Amazon princess Diana ( Carter ) rescues the handsome unconscious Trevor and helps nurse him back to health . Her mother , the Amazon queen ( Cloris Leachman ; succeeded by Carolyn Jones and Beatrice Straight in later episodes ) , decrees that Olympic - style games shall be held to select one Amazon to return Trevor back to America . But she forbids her own daughter Diana , the princess , to participate . Diana states that since she is not allowed to participate , she does not want to be present for the games and will take a retreat to the other side of the island . The games are held with participants wearing masks and numbers , shown as Roman numerals in triangles on white sleeveless short tunic - dresses . Among the contestants is a blonde Amazon . During the events , the blonde Amazon shows exceptional skills and she ties for first with another Amazon . To break the deadlock , the `` bullets and bracelets '' event is decided as the tiebreaker , wherein each of the women takes turns shooting at the other ; the one being shot at must deflect the bullets with her bulletproof bracelets . The blond woman wins the event , superficially injuring her opponent 's arm . When she is pronounced the winner , she removes her mask and wig and reveals that she is Diana . Her mother , though initially shocked , relents and allows her to go to America . </P> <P> Diana 's uniform as Wonder Woman , designed by Queen Hippolyta , features emblems of America , the land to which she will be returning Steve Trevor . A golden belt will be the source of her strength and power while away from Paradise Island . She has her bullet - deflecting bracelets and also receives a golden lasso which is unbreakable and forces people to obey and tell the truth when bound with it . As shown later in flashback , Hippolyta also teaches Diana how to transform her clothes magically into the uniform . </P> <P> Diana , as Wonder Woman , flies to Washington , D.C. in an invisible plane . After dropping Trevor off at a hospital , the heroine stumbles upon a bank robbery , which she stops . A theatrical agent who sees her in action offers to help make her bullets and bracelets act a stage attraction . Diana is hesitant , but needing money in this new society , she agrees . </P> <P> Meanwhile , Trevor 's civilian secretary Marcia ( Stella Stevens ) is a double agent for the Nazi Fifth Columnists . She seeks to aid top spies in killing Trevor and opposing this new threat , Wonder Woman . Her first attempt is arranging for an accomplice to fire a machine gun at Wonder Woman during her stage act . Later , as spy activities increase , Trevor leaves the hospital but gets in a fight and is captured , prompting his `` nurse '' Diana to come to his rescue .

The answer should be a number\n\nDocument:\n and therefore , it does not need to be notified in an informed consent . </P> Absorbable mesh ( edit ) Main article : Biomesh <P> Biomeshes are increasingly popular since their first use in 1999 and their subsequent introduction on the market in 2003 . Their use is an instance of regenerative medicine . Unlike synthetic non-absorbable meshes , they are absorbable , and can be used for repair in an infected environment , such as an incarcerated hernia . Moreover , they seem to improve comfort and presumably , they reduce the risk of inguinodynia . They have been tested after mesh - related inguinodynia . Some meshes have a price comparable to the high end of synthetic meshes , the cheapest ( $500 ) being Surgisis - Biodesign , manufactured by Cook Group , made from the extra cellular matrix of pig small intestinal submucosa . Currently , there exists one synthetic totally absorbable mesh , Tigr Matrix , manufactured by Novus Scientific , on the US market ( 510 ( k ) Food and Drug Administration clearance ) since 2010 and on the EU market since 2011 . It only has one 3 - year pre-clinical evidence on sheep . </P> <P> Though their benefit is not fully established yet , the market for biological meshes is exploding , and if the current trend is confirmed , they may replace synthetic meshes in the US by 2016 </P> <H2> Suture repairs ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Tension repairs ( edit ) </H3> Bassini ( edit ) Bassini technique , first suture. 1 . Aponeurosis musculi obliq . ext. ; 2 . Musculus obliquus internus ; 3 . Musculus transversalis ; 4 . Fascia transversalis ; 5 . Peritoneum ; 6 . Ligamentum inguinale . <P> The first efficient inguinal hernia repair was described by Edoardo Bassini in the 1880s . The Bassini technique is a `` tension '' repair , in which the edges of the defect are sewn back together , without any mesh . In the Bassini technique , the conjoint tendon ( formed by the distal ends of the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles ) is approximated to the inguinal ligament and closed . Today , Bassini 's main interest is historical . It remains performed in some developing countries , if surgeons do not have knowledge of the mosquito - net alternative to commercial meshes in Lichtenstein repair , or if they ignore more efficient suture - based repairs . </P> McVay / Cooper 's ligament ( edit ) <P> The floor of the canal is reinforced by approximating the transversus abdominal aponeurosis and transverse fascia to pectineal ( Cooper 's ) ligament medially from the pubic tubercle to the femoral vein . Lateral to this the floor is restored by approximating the femoral sheath to the inguinal ligament . It is also used in femoral hernia repairs . </P> Shouldice ( edit ) <P> The Shouldice technique is the mainstream suture - based repair . It is a relatively difficult four layer reconstruction of fascia transversalis ; however , it has relatively low reported recurrence rates in the hand of a surgeon experienced with this method . </P> <P> Shouldice repairs are less commonly used today than in previous years , especially in developed countries . This is mostly due to the fact that mesh - based Lichtenstein method is easier to perform . The Shouldice repair has a higher rate of hernia recurrence in the hands of surgeons inexperienced with them ( < 200 operations / year ) . Another drawback is the post-operative pain due to the tension on muscles , which generally lasts some weeks . However , this pain is well - managed with analgesics , and this short - term pain must be balanced with the much lower risk of long - term pain of the Shouldice technique , which is half Lichtenstein ( but similar to laparoscopic ) . This is why few tension repairs are still in use today ; these include the Shouldice and the Cooper 's ligament / McVay repair . </P> <P> The main advantage of the Shouldice technique remains the relatively low report of chronic pain ( 10 % incidence ) , as compared with mesh - based open repair ( Lichtenstein ) ( 20 % incidence ) . However , the risk of chronic pain with this method is comparable to a laparoscopic repair performed by a surgeon experienced with inguinal hernia repair ( i.e. > 200 hernias / year ) ( 8 % incidence ) ( and not simply a surgeon experienced with laparoscopy . This difference is important ) . </P> <P> Moreover , if the surgeon is not experienced enough with the Shouldice technique , as is the case for most surgeons nowadays , mesh - based repair can be advised . For example , in developing countries , where commercial meshes are expensive , but where surgeons might also be less qualified , a mosquito - net mesh open repair can be better than Shouldice . Indeed , both have a similar cost ( a mosquito - net mesh costs less than $0.01 . Its sterilization costs less than $1 ) , and mesh repair is easier to perform than Shouldice . Desarda repair is also another option , but it is less widely known . </P> <P> Another advantage of suture - based repairs over permanent mesh repairs is that they do not introduce significant permanent foreign - body material , at worst , only polypropylene non-absorbable sutures . Permanent meshes can cause additional long - term complications due to this fact . </P> <H3> Tension - free repairs ( edit ) </H3> Desarda ( edit ) <P> The Desarda technique is an emerging suture - based technique . It can be performed with absorbable sutures . It is simpler and faster to perform than Shouldice and Lichtenstein . It also gives similar results to Lichtenstein in terms of recurrence , with the significant benefit of not introducing permanent foreign - body material . Moreover , this technique is tension - free , mesh - free , and it pays attention to the physiology . Other techniques using a flap from the external oblique aponeurosis were proposed independently by other surgeons . </P> Guarnieri ( edit ) <P> Guarnieri technique appeared in 1988 . It can be used with or without mesh . Like Desarda technique , the Guarnieri method pays attention to the physiology , and it is also tension - free . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Simons , M.P. ; Aufenacker , T. ; Bay - Nielsen , M. ; Bouillot , J.L. ; Campanelli , G. ; Conze , J. ; Lange , D. ; Fortelny , R. ; et al.

( BMI ) , for more than 4 million performances of the song in the US . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Background and recording </Li> <Li> 2 Release and aftermath </Li> <Li> 3 Personnel </Li> <Li> 4 Charts <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Weekly charts </Li> <Li> 4.2 Year - end charts </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Parody </Li> <Li> 6 Guns N ' Roses version <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Charts </Li> <Li> 6.2 Track listing </Li> <Li> 6.3 Personnel </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> </Ul> <H2> Background and Recording ( edit ) </H2> <P> Even before Tom Mankiewicz had finished writing the screenplay to Live and Let Die , producers Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli invited Paul McCartney to write the theme song . McCartney asked to be sent a copy of Ian Fleming 's novel . `` I read it and thought it was pretty good . That afternoon I wrote the song and went in the next week and did it ... It was a job of work for me in a way because writing a song around a title like that 's not the easiest thing going . '' </P> <P> Originally , producer Harry Saltzman was interested in having Shirley Bassey or Thelma Houston perform it instead of Wings . Martin said McCartney would allow the song to be used in the movie only if Wings was able to perform the song in the opening credits . Saltzman , who had previously rejected the chance to produce A Hard Day 's Night , decided not to make the same mistake twice and agreed . A second version of the song , performed by B.J. Arnau , also appears in the film . Arnau 's performance originally was meant for the group Fifth Dimension . The Arnau version of the song appears on the soundtrack album as a component in a medley that also contains two George Martin - composed instrumental pieces , `` Fillet of Soul -- New Orleans '' and `` Fillet of Soul -- Harlem '' . It was also released by RCA Records as a single in late June 1973 . </P> <P> Wings recorded `` Live and Let Die '' during the sessions for the Red Rose Speedway album , in October 1972 . The song was recorded at AIR Studios , with Ray Cooper providing percussion instruments . </P> <H2> Release and aftermath ( edit ) </H2> <P> The song `` Live and Let Die '' was previewed in the 1973 television special James Paul McCartney , which aired on 16 April in the United States and 10 May in the United Kingdom . In the segment , McCartney and Wings were shown performing the song in his studio while clips of the film were shown , before the film 's US theatrical release on 27 June . </P> <P> The single reached No. 2 in the US and No. 9 in the UK . The single was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of over one million copies . </P> <P> Sales of the single release and of the sheet music were `` solid . '' The sheet music used the line `` in this ever - changing world in which we live in '' as part of the opening verse of the song . In the Washington Post interview more than 30 years later , McCartney told the interviewer , `` I do n't think about the lyric when I sing it . I think it 's ' in which we 're living ' , or it could be ' in which we live in ' , and that 's kind of , sort of , wronger but cuter , '' before deciding that it was `` in which we 're living . '' </P> <P> `` Live and Let Die '' was not featured on a McCartney album until the Wings Greatest compilation in 1978 , and was included again on 1987 's All the Best ! and 2001 's Wingspan : Hits and History . The entire soundtrack also was released in quadrophonic . </P> <P> United Artists promoted the song in trade advertisements for Academy Award consideration , though producer Broccoli opposed the marketing tactic as unnecessary . The song became the first James Bond theme song to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song ( garnering McCartney his second Academy Award nomination and Linda her first ) . In the Academy Award performance of the song , entertainer Connie Stevens dressed in a `` silver - lam\u00e9 outfit '' with a Native American - looking headdress `` descended from the ceiling '' and then was `` variously lifted and tossed about '' by dancers dressed in various colours until she left the scene . The song lost to the eponymous theme song from the musical film The Way We Were . </P> <P> In Wings ' live performances of the song , the instrumental break featured flashpots and a laser light show . McCartney has continued to play the song on his solo tours , often using pyrotechnics . `` Live and Let Die '' is the only song to appear on all of McCartney 's live albums ( except for the acoustic - based Unplugged . ) </P> <P> Following the 9 / 11 attacks , the song was placed on Clear Channel 's list of inappropriate song titles . </P> <P> The song was included in the movie Shrek The Third ( 2007 ) and on its soundtrack . The song was featured in American Hustle , directed by David O. Russell . </P> <H2> Personnel ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Paul McCartney -- lead vocals , piano </Li> <Li> Linda McCartney -- backing vocals , keyboards </Li> <Li> Henry McCullough -- lead guitar </Li> <Li> Denny Laine -- backing vocals , bass guitar </Li> <Li> Denny Seiwell -- drums </Li> <Li> Ray Cooper -- percussion </Li> <Li> George Martin -- orchestral arrangement </Li> </Ul> <H2> Charts ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <H3> Weekly charts ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Chart ( 1973 ) </Th> <Th> Peak position </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Australia ( Kent Music Report ) </Td> <Td> 5 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Canada ( RPM 100 Top Singles ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Germany ( Media Control ) </Td> <Td> 31 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Japan ( Oricon ) </Td> <Td> 25 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Netherlands ( Dutch Top 40 ) </Td> <Td> 29 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> New Zealand ( Listener ) </Td> <Td> 20 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Norway ( VG - lista ) </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> UK ( Official Charts Company ) </Td> <Td> 9 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> US Billboard Hot 100 </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> US Billboard Easy Listening </Td> <Td> 8 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> US Cash Box Top 100 </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> US Record World Singles Chart </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> </P> </Td> <Td> <H3> Year - end charts ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Chart ( 1973 ) </Th> <Th> Rank </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Australia </Td> <Td> 36 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Canada </Td> <Td> 39 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> US Cash Box </Td> <Td> 33 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> US Billboard Hot 100 </Td> <Td> 56 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> </P> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Parody ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 1984 , McCartney asked `` Weird Al '' Yankovic when he was going to parody one of his songs .

{"content": "Answer the question based on the information provided in the document given below. The answer should be a number\n\nDocument:\n <Li> 19 Notes </Li> <Li> 20 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> Housing benefit was transferred from the Department of Social Security to local authorities in 1982 . This was to coincide with increasing deregulation of the private sector rental market as it was felt at the time that local authorities would have a better understanding of local rental market conditions than the DSS . Its full transfer took place in 1989 as part of a major reform of social security legislation which also saw the introduction of Income Support . </P> <H2> Concepts and terminology ( edit ) </H2> <P> Housing Benefit will only meet the pure rent costs of any liability . Central to benefit decisions is an assessment of eligible rent and ineligible services . Eligible rent is that part of the rent paid by a person which can legally be covered by housing benefit . Ineligible services are the parts of the claimant 's rent liability that he must meet himself . Ineligible services include such things as the cost of heating , lighting , water rates , meals and any general counselling and support that may be included in the rent charged but will not be met by Housing Benefit . </P> <P> The payment of the benefit is centred on the concept of a benefit week , which is a seven - day period running from a Monday to a Sunday . Housing Benefit may be paid on a weekly , fortnightly , lunar monthly or calendar monthly basis . Housing Benefit paid to landlords is usually paid four weeks in arrears . Regulations require local authorities to take into account the needs of the claimant when deciding on the frequency of benefit payments , however due to the complexity of calculating a calendar monthly payment and especially any overpayments that arise , most local authorities pay benefit fortnightly to claimants and four weekly to landlords . </P> <P> For claimants not on a `` passported benefit '' , the concept of a benefit week is particularly important as benefit will only be paid from the start of a tenancy if the form is requested on the same benefit week as moving in . In all other cases for tenants not on a passported benefit , Housing Benefit will start only from the Monday after the form was requested . If the form is returned within a month of request , otherwise benefit is payable from the Monday after the council receives it . </P> <P> Applicants who successfully apply for a passported benefit along with their Housing Benefit have a calendar month to return the Housing Benefit form , from the date of application to the passported benefit . If the form is returned within one month of that date benefit starts from the Monday after the start date of the passported benefit - even if that benefit is backdated . </P> <P> Originally using paper application forms , in recent years local authorities have begun to use a telephone - based application process . Under these latter application schemes , claimants would often contact the responsible central government department , who would then forward the details to the local authority . This has turned out to be a somewhat prescient decision ; the gateway for claimants to the new Universal Credit system , which replaces Housing Benefit , is the central government department , not local authorities . </P> <P> The date of claim will be the date the claimant you first contacted the Department for Works and Pensions , for claimants applying to the Department for Work and Pensions , and otherwise the date of claim will be treated as the date he contacted the Local Authority . </P> <H2> Benefit cap ( edit ) </H2> Main article : benefit cap <P> Due to a benefit cap many claimants have had their housing benefit reduced to 50p a week and are at risk of losing their homes if they can not pay their rent . New building providing supported housing for vulnerable people is being cut due to uncertainty whether prospective tenants will be able to pay the rent . Schemes affected include homes for war veterans , for people with learning disabilities helping them live independently . Safe housing for domestic violence victims could also be at risk . New schemes are postponed or cancelled and existing schemes are being closed . David Orr of the National Housing Federation said , `` With social care in crisis , the role supported housing plays in alleviating pressures on the NHS is ever more important . These changes have not even come in yet and they have taken 7,000 homes for vulnerable people out of the pipeline . The proposed changes in funding bear no relation to the real cost of providing this type of housing . It is time government put supported housing on a secure and sustainable footing . '' The most vulnerable people , elderly people , severely disabled people and people with mental health problems need a great deal of support and the benefit cap disproportionately pprevents them from getting what they need . </P> <P> Polly Neate of Shelter said , `` The money put forward ( by the government for social housing ) is only a fraction of what 's needed , given just how bad this crisis has become . Building new homes also takes time , and time is not on the side of the million private renters who could risk being tipped into homelessness by the freeze on housing benefit . Whether a struggling family or a young person in low - paid work , the freeze is stripping away the help people desperately need to pay their rent . ( ... ) We are urging the government to abandon the freeze on housing benefit in the autumn budget or risk making more people homeless . '' </P> <H2> Local Housing Allowance ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Local Housing Allowance <P> The Government has introduced a new rent restriction policy for the calculation of Housing Benefit for private tenants called Local Housing Allowance . The scheme replaces two previous methods of controlling high rents for most new tenancies. Old scheme cases where the local authority decided the level of restriction based on the cost of suitable alternative accommodation ( in operation from 15 January 1989 to 1 January 1996 ) , Reference Rent cases , where the level of eligible rent was decided by the Rent Service based on the lower of what a landlord would have been able to obtain had a landlord not been renting to a tenant on Housing Benefit ( the claim related rent ) and the average cost of similar properties in that area ( the local reference rent ) . </P> <P> For LHA cases the eligible rent is decided in part by the size of property a claimant needs . This figure is published monthly by the council and the Rent Service . If the tenant rents more expensive accommodation , the rent is restricted to the LHA rate for that area . By publicising how much Housing Benefit a tenant can get for the need for Pre-Tenancy Determinations is removed . </P> <P> The Local Housing Allowance is set at the 30th percentile level for rents in the Broad Market Rental Area . The Broad Market Rental areas are similar in geographic size to Counties . This has led to a number of counties such as Cambridgeshire criticising the scheme because market rents in the city area of the county are considerably higher than those in the shire areas of the county . The House of Lords ruled against the concept of very large Broad Market Rental areas in the Heffernan case ( R ( Heffernan ) v The Rent Service ( 2008 ) UKHL 58 ) . The DWP re-introduced legislation to overturn this decision , restoring its intention to use very large broad market rental areas to draw down the cost of the scheme . </P> <P> Local Housing Allowance was introduced across all Local Authority areas on 7 April 2008 . The legislation to enable the scheme is contained in the Welfare Reform Act which received Royal Assent in May 2007 . The local authorities that trialled the new system were known as Pathfinder Authorities . They were Argyll and Bute , Blackpool , Brighton and Hove , Conwy county borough , Coventry , East Riding of Yorkshire , City of Edinburgh , Guildford , City of Leeds , London Borough of Lewisham , North East Lincolnshire , Norwich , Pembrokeshire , City of Salford , South Norfolk , Metropolitan Borough of St Helens , Teignbridge , London Borough of Wandsworth </P> <P> The final scheme was different in that the maximum difference between the rent payable and the eligible local housing allowance was restricted to \u00a3 15 . In addition in some pilot authorities , all tenants whose rent had been assessed according to reference rent rules were transferred to LHA , when the national scheme came in only those who made a new claim or moved went on to LHA . </P> <P> From April 2011 the \u00a3 15 paid to those whose rent was below LHA levels was scrapped . Now the maximum payable will be the rent or the LHA rate , whichever is the lower . </P> <P> From April 2009 , the maximum LHA that can be awarded will be restricted to the rate payable for four rooms . </P> <H2> Reference rent cases ( edit ) </H2> <P> This scheme will remain in operation for existing claimants who do not have a break in their Housing Benefit claim or do not move property . It was introduced with effect from 2 January 1996 . The level of eligible rent is decided by the Rent Service . Either on application by the Local Authority on an annual basis or if the tenant had taken out a Pre Tenancy Determination . </P> <H2> Northern Ireland ( edit ) </H2> <P> In Northern Ireland , tenants must apply to the Northern Ireland Housing Executive regardless of whether they rent from a private landlord , from the NIHE itself , or from a housing association . </P> <H2> Non-lha Housing benefit claims ( edit ) </H2> <P> For Housing Benefit claims made before ( or still existing at ) the roll - out of Local Housing Allowance scheme on 7 April 2008 , different rent restriction rules apply . </P> <P> The earlier system for calculation of eligible rent is specific to the individual property . </P> <P> The maximum Housing Benefit will be based on : - </P> <Ul> <Li> the tenant 's actual rent less services if the rent is `` reasonable '' ; </Li> <Li> the rent that would be `` reasonable '' in the area for the size of premises the tenant occupies in comparison to what would have been obtained by the landlord had the property not been rented to someone on Housing Benefit ( the claim - related rent ) or </Li> <Li> the average level of rent that would have been `` reasonable '' for that type of accommodation in the area ( the Local Reference Rent ) </Li> </Ul> <P> or where the tenant has a home too large for the needs </P> <Ul> <Li> the average level of rent that would be payable for the type of accommodation reasonable in the area for the actual size of accommodation that the tenant needs for his / her household . ( Exceptionally large determination ) </Li> </Ul> <P> Further restrictions can be imposed if the tenant is occupying accommodation in the luxury end of the market . </P> <P> These restrictions are decided either by the council , if the property is exempt from the Reference Rent rules and the LHA , or the Rent Service if the benefit being paid is subject to Reference Rent rules . </P> <P> The Rent Officer may visit the property ( or may have done so already ) although this is not a requirement . If a property is visited and the Rent Officer is not given access , the Council may terminate the claim , unless access is granted . If there are services included in the rent ( such as fuel bills , water charges , laundry or room cleaning ) , the rent officer will deduct the value of these as Housing Benefit can not pay for them . </P> <P> The Rent Officer decision is the maximum that the Council can pay for Reference Rent cases , for cases that are treated under the Pre 1996 rules , the figure is used to decide how much the DWP awards the Local Authority in subsidy and is purely indicative . This decision is made annually , although the Local Council may be late in making the application . If the decision is higher the effective date of the increase will be the Monday of the week of the referral ; if the decision is lower , the effective date is the Monday after the new decision is received by the Local Council . This is to avoid overpayments arising as a result of the Rent Service decision . If the decision is lower , any overpayment is LA Error and may only be recovered if it is reasonable to expect that the claimant knew that the decision was going to be lower . </P> <P> The rent officer makes the following valuations . </P> <H3> Claim - related rent ( edit ) </H3> <P> This has three parts . The lowest of these three figures is called the claim - related rent and is shown on the pre-tenancy determination decision . </P> Significantly high rent ( edit ) <P> The rent officer will have decided if the rent your landlord has asked for is reasonable compared with other properties in the vicinity . If it is too high , the rent officer will set a reasonable figure . The `` vicinity '' means the immediate area around the property . If the property is in a town or city , this could mean just the street the property is in or a few adjoining streets . If the property is in the country , the `` vicinity '' could be a small village . </P> <P> The `` vicinity '' is much smaller than the Broad Market Rental Area used to decide LHA Rates . </P> Number of rooms ( size criteria ) ( edit ) <P> The rent officer will consider whether the property has more rooms than the Housing Benefit rules say are needed . If the property has too many rooms , the rent officer will decide what the eligible rent used would be for a similar property with the right number of rooms . </P> <P> The rules are strict and the rent officer is not able to alter them . If an extra room is needed ( for example if the claimant has special disability needs ) , the claimant should apply to the Council for a DHP . </P> Underoccupancy charge ( bedroom Tax ) ( edit ) <P> From April 2013 if a claimant is considered to be under - occupying their property , their payment of Housing Benefit will be reduced by 14 % for one bedroom and 25 % for two or more bedrooms considered to be additional to the claimant 's needs . DHP 's will be made available to cover the shortfall for those affected by the change . Priority will be given to claimants with disabilities . </P> Exceptionally high rent ( edit ) <P> After having made these decisions , the rent officer decides if the lowest figure is still much higher than most rents for properties in the neighbourhood with the right number of rooms . This might be because of the property is in the luxury end of the market , or because of the services or amenities provided . If it is much higher , the rent officer will decide a figure that is in keeping with the general level of rents . ' Services ' are things that the landlord does or supplies beyond providing the basic accommodation , such as doing the laundry or cleaning the property . ' Amenities ' are the physical things at the property , such as a swimming pool or tennis court . </P> <H3> Local reference rent ( edit ) </H3> <P> The rent officer will also decide how much is generally paid for property with the right number of rooms in the ' locality ' . This is called the local reference rent and will be shown if it is lower than the claim - related rent . </P> <P> The local reference rent is the midpoint of the range of rents for all types of property with a similar number of rooms in the same ' locality ' as the claimant 's home . The ' locality ' is an area with at least two neighbourhoods . Within this area there will be \n\nQuestion:\nwhen was housing benefit introduced in the uk\n", "answer": "1982"}

The answer should be a number\n\nDocument:\nnd ordinary paper outer ) , as a `` takeaway '' <P> Fried fish as a culinary trend may have begun in Lancashire or it may have come from London 's Western Sephardic Jews . Originally , Western Sephardic Jews settling in England in the 17th century would have prepared fried fish in a manner similar to Pescado frito , which is coated in a flour . Battered fish is first coated in flour then dipped into a batter consisting of flour mixed with liquid , usually water but sometimes beer . Some newer modifications to the recipe may have cornflour added , and instead of beer sometimes soda water is added . In 1860 , the first fish and chip shop was opened in London by Joseph Malin who sold `` fish fried in the Jewish fashion '' . </P> <P> Fish and chips became a stock meal among the working classes in England as a consequence of the rapid development of trawl fishing in the North Sea , and the development of railways which connected the ports to major industrial cities during the second half of the 19th century , so that fresh fish could be rapidly transported to the heavily populated areas . </P> <P> Deep - fried chips ( slices or pieces of potato ) as a dish may have first appeared in England in about the same period : the Oxford English Dictionary notes as its earliest usage of `` chips '' in this sense the mention in Charles Dickens ' A Tale of Two Cities ( 1859 ) : `` Husky chips of potatoes , fried with some reluctant drops of oil '' . </P> <P> The modern fish - and - chip shop ( `` chippy '' or `` chipper '' in modern British slang ) originated in the United Kingdom , although outlets selling fried food occurred commonly throughout Europe . Early fish - and - chip shops had only very basic facilities . Usually these consisted principally of a large cauldron of cooking fat , heated by a coal fire . The fish - and - chip shop later evolved into a fairly standard format , with the food served , in paper wrappings , to queuing customers , over a counter in front of the fryers . By 1910 , there were more than 25,000 fish and chip shops across the country , and in the 1920s there were more than 35,000 shops . As a boy Alfred Hitchcock lived above a fish and chip shop in London , which was the family business . According to Professor John Walton , author of Fish and Chips and the British Working Class , the British government made safeguarding supplies of fish and chips during World War I a priority : `` The cabinet knew it was vital to keep families on the home front in good heart , unlike the German regime that failed to keep its people well fed '' . In 1928 , Harry Ramsden opened his fish and chip shop in Guiseley , West Yorkshire . On a single day in 1952 , the shop served 10,000 portions of fish and chips , earning a place in the Guinness Book Of Records . In George Orwell 's The Road to Wigan Pier ( 1937 ) , documenting his experience of working class life in the north of England , the author considered fish and chips chief among the ' home comforts ' which acted as a panacea to the working classes . During World War II , fish and chips remained one of the few foods in the United Kingdom not subject to rationing . Prime Minister Winston Churchill referred to the combination of fish and chips as `` the good companions '' . John Lennon enjoyed his fish and chips -- a staple of the working class -- smothered in ketchup . </P> <P> British fish and chips were originally served in a wrapping of old newspapers but this practice has now largely ceased , with plain paper , cardboard , or plastic being used instead . In the United Kingdom , the Fish Labelling Regulations 2003 and in Ireland the European Communities ( Labelling of Fishery and Aquaculture Products ) Regulations 2003 respectively enact directive 2065 / 2001 / EC , and generally mean that `` fish '' must be sold with the particular commercial name or species named ; so , for example , `` cod and chips '' now appears on menus rather than the more vague `` fish and chips '' . In the United Kingdom the Food Standards Agency guidance excludes caterers from this ; but several local Trading Standards authorities and others do say it can not be sold merely as `` fish and chips '' . </P> <H3> United Kingdom ( edit ) </H3> A blue plaque in Oldham ( Greater Manchester ) in England marking the 1860s origins of the fish and chip shop and the fast food industry <P> A prominent meal in British culture , the dish became popular in wider circles in London and South East England in the middle of the 19th century : Charles Dickens mentions a `` fried fish warehouse '' in Oliver Twist , first published in 1838 , while in the north of England a trade in deep - fried chipped potatoes developed . The first chip shop stood on the present site of Oldham 's Tommyfield Market . It remains unclear exactly when and where these two trades combined to become the fish - and - chip shop industry we know . A Jewish immigrant , Joseph Malin , opened the first recorded combined fish - and - chip shop in London in 1860 or in 1865 ; a Mr Lees pioneered the concept in the North of England , in Mossley , in 1863 . </P> <P> The concept of a fish restaurant , as opposed to take - away , was introduced by Samuel Isaacs ( born 1856 in Whitechapel , London ; died 1939 in Brighton , Sussex ) who ran a thriving wholesale and retail fish business throughout London and the South of England in the latter part of the 19th century . Isaacs ' first restaurant opened in London in 1896 serving fish and chips , bread and butter , and tea for nine pence , and its popularity ensured a rapid expansion of the chain . </P> <P> The restaurants were carpeted , had table service , tablecloths , flowers , china and cutlery , and made the trappings of upmarket dining affordable to the working classes for the first time . They were located in Tottenham Court Road , St Pancras , The Strand , Hoxton , Shoreditch , Brixton and other London districts , as well as Clacton , Brighton , Ramsgate , Margate and other seaside resorts in southern England . Menus were expanded in the early 20th century to include meat dishes and other variations as their popularity grew to a total of thirty restaurants . Sam Isaacs ' trademark was the phrase `` This is the Plaice '' , combined with a picture of the punned - upon fish in question . A glimpse of the old Brighton restaurant at No. 1 Marine Parade can be seen in the background of Norman Wisdom 's 1955 film One Good Turn just as Wisdom / Pitkin runs onto the seafront ; this is now the site of a Harry Ramsden 's fish and chips restaurant . A blue plaque at Oldham 's Tommyfield Market marks the first chips fried in England in 1860 , and the origin of the fish and chip shop and fast food industries . </P> Fish and chips traditionally wrapped in white paper and newspaper <P> Dundee City Council claims that chips were first sold by a Belgian immigrant , Edward De Gernier , in the city 's Greenmarket in the 1870s . </P> <P> In Edinburgh , a combination of Gold Star brown sauce and water or malt vinegar , known as `` sauce '' , or more specifically as `` chippy sauce '' , has great popularity . </P> <H3> Fish & chips Awards ( edit ) </H3> <P> The annual National Fish & Chips Awards were set up in the UK in 1988 . The 30th Annual Fish & Chips Awards ceremony was attended by Norwegian ambassador to the UK Mona Juul . </P> <H3> Ireland ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Irish cuisine <P> In Ireland , the first fish and chips were sold by an Italian immigrant , Giuseppe Cervi , who mistakenly stepped off an North American - bound ship at Queenstown ( now Cobh ) in County Cork in the 1880s and walked all the way to Dublin . He started by selling fish and chips outside Dublin pubs from a handcart . He then found a permanent spot in Great Brunswick Street ( now Pearse Street ) . His wife Palma would ask customers `` Uno di questa , uno di quella ? '' This phrase ( meaning `` one of this , one of that '' ) entered the vernacular in Dublin as `` one and one '' , which is still a way of referring to fish and chips in the city . </P> <H3> New Zealand ( edit ) </H3> Main article : New Zealand cuisine <P> Fish and chips are the most popular takeaway food in New Zealand . Food historians have been unable to pinpoint exactly when the meal became an established part of New Zealand cuisine but all recognise that the first fish and chips shops were introduced by British settlers before World War I. During the 20th century , nearly every small town and suburb in New Zealand had at least one fish - and - chip shop . As in Britain , Friday night has been the traditional night to eat fish . </P> <P> Traditionally , fish and chips were served in wrappings of newspaper . With the decline of the newspaper industry , this has become less common . </P> <P> In 1980 , four up - and - coming Labour Party politicians , including David Lange , were nicknamed the `` Fish and Chip Brigade '' due to a picture published at the time with the group eating fish and chips . </P> <H3> United States ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Cuisine of the United States <P> In the United States , the dish is most commonly sold as `` fish and chips '' , except in Upstate New York and Wisconsin and other parts of the Northeast and Upper Midwest , where this dish would be called a fish fry . Despite the name `` fish and chips '' , and the US meaning of `` chips '' , the dish is served with French fries ( much thinner than British and Irish chips ) . In the Southern United States , a common form of cuisine is fried catfish with French fries , accompanied by coleslaw , pickles , raw onion slices and lemon slices . </P> <H2> Composition ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Cooking ( edit ) </H3> Frying range <P> Traditional frying uses beef dripping or lard ; however , vegetable oils , such as peanut oil ( used because of its relatively high smoke point ) now predominate . A minority of vendors in the North of England and Scotland , and the majority of vendors in Northern Ireland , still use dripping or lard , as it imparts a different flavour to the dish , but this makes the fried chips unsuitable for vegetarians and for adherents of certain faiths . Lard is used in some living industrial history museums , such as the Black Country Living Museum . </P> <H3> Thickness ( edit ) </H3> Fish and chips at a Hesburger fast food restaurant , advertised as particularly English <P> British and Irish chips are usually thicker than American - style French fries sold by major multinational fast food chains , resulting in a lower fat content per portion . In their homes or in some restaurants , people in or from the United States may eat a thick type of chip , more similar to the British and Irish variant , sometimes referred to as steak fries . </P> <H3> Batter ( edit ) </H3> <P> In Britain and Ireland , fish and chip shops traditionally use a simple water and flour batter , adding a little sodium bicarbonate ( baking soda ) and a little vinegar to create lightness , as they react to create bubbles in the batter . Other recipes may use beer or milk batter , where these liquids are often substitutes for water . The carbon dioxide in the beer lends a lighter texture to the batter . Beer also results in an orange - brown colour . A simple beer batter might consist of a 2 : 3 ratio of flour to beer by volume . The type of beer alters the taste of the batter ; some prefer lager whereas others use stout or bitter . </P> <H3> Choice of fish ( edit ) </H3> Cod and chips , served with a lemon wedge and tartar sauce <P> In Britain and Ireland , cod and haddock appear most commonly as the fish used for fish and chips , but vendors also sell many other kinds of fish , especially other white fish , such as pollock or coley , plaice , skate , and ray ( particularly popular in Ireland ) ; and huss or rock salmon ( a term covering several species of dogfish and similar fish ) . In Northern Ireland , cod , plaice or whiting appear most commonly in ' fish suppers ' -- ' supper ' being Scottish and Northern Irish chip - shop terminology for a food item accompanied by chips .

These include riding in Christopher Robin 's umbrella to rescue Piglet from a flood , discovering `` the North Pole '' by picking it up to help fish Roo out of the river , inventing the game of Poohsticks , and getting Eeyore out of the river by dropping a large rock on one side of him to wash him towards the bank . </P> <P> Pooh is also a talented poet , and the stories are frequently punctuated by his poems and `` hums . '' Although he is humble about his slow - wittedness , he is comfortable with his creative gifts . When Owl 's house blows down in a storm , trapping Pooh and Piglet and Owl inside , Pooh encourages Piglet ( the only one small enough to do so ) to escape and rescue them all by promising that `` a respectful Pooh song '' will be written about Piglet 's feat . Later , Pooh muses about the creative process as he composes the song . </P> <P> Pooh is very fond of food , especially `` hunny '' but also condensed milk and other items . When he visits friends , his desire to be offered a snack is in conflict with the impoliteness of asking too directly . Though intending to give Eeyore a pot of honey for his birthday , Pooh can not resist eating the honey on his way to deliver the present , and so instead gives Eeyore `` a useful pot to put things in '' . When he and Piglet are lost in the forest during Rabbit 's attempt to `` unbounce '' Tigger , Pooh finds his way home by following the `` call '' of the honeypots from his house . Pooh makes it a habit to have `` a little something '' around eleven o'clock in the morning . As the clock in his house `` stopped at five minutes to eleven some weeks ago , '' any time can be Pooh 's snack time . </P> <P> Pooh is very social . After Christopher Robin , his closest friend is Piglet , and he most often chooses to spend his time with one or both of them . But he also habitually visits the other animals , often looking for a snack or an audience for his poetry as much as for companionship . His kind - heartedness means he goes out of his way to be friendly to Eeyore , visiting him and bringing him a birthday present and building him a house , despite receiving mostly disdain from Eeyore in return . </P> <H3> Sequel </H3> <P> An authorised sequel Return to the Hundred Acre Wood was published on 5 October 2009 . The author , David Benedictus , has developed , but not changed , Milne 's characterisations . The illustrations , by Mark Burgess , are in the style of Shepard . </P> <P> Another authorised sequel , The Best Bear in All the World , was published by Egmont in 2016 . The sequel consists of four short stories by four leading children 's authors , Kate Saunders , Brian Sibley , Paul Bright , and Jeanne Willis . Illustrations are by Mark Burgess . The Best Bear in All The World sees the introduction of a new character , a Penguin , which was inspired by a long - lost photograph of Milne and his son Christopher with a toy penguin . A further special story , Winnie - the - Pooh Meets the Queen , was published in 2016 to mark the 90th anniversary of Milne 's creation and the 90th birthday of Elizabeth II . It sees Winnie the Pooh meet the Queen at Buckingham Palace . </P> <H3> Stephen Slesinger </H3> <P> On 6 January 1930 , Stephen Slesinger purchased U.S. and Canadian merchandising , television , recording and other trade rights to the `` Winnie - the - Pooh '' works from Milne for a $1000 advance and 66 % of Slesinger 's income , creating the modern licensing industry . By November 1931 , Pooh was a $50 million - a-year business . Slesinger marketed Pooh and his friends for more than 30 years , creating the first Pooh doll , record , board game , puzzle , US radio broadcast ( NBC ) , animation , and motion picture film . </P> <H3> Red shirt Pooh </H3> <P> The first time Pooh and his friends appeared in colour was 1932 , when he was drawn by Slesinger in his now - familiar red shirt and featured on an RCA Victor picture record . Parker Brothers also introduced A.A. Milne 's Winnie - the - Pooh Game in 1933 , again with Pooh in his red shirt . In the 1940s , Agnes Brush created the first plush dolls with Pooh in his red shirt . Shepard had drawn Pooh with a shirt as early as the first Winnie - The - Pooh book , which was subsequently coloured red in later coloured editions . </P> <H3> Disney ownership era ( 1966 -- present ) </H3> Main article : Winnie the Pooh ( franchise ) <P> After Slesinger 's death in 1953 , his wife , Shirley Slesinger Lasswell , continued developing the character herself . In 1961 , she licensed rights to Walt Disney Productions in exchange for royalties in the first of two agreements between Stephen Slesinger , Inc. and Disney . The same year , A.A. Milne 's widow , Daphne Milne , also licensed certain rights , including motion picture rights , to Disney . </P> <P> Since 1966 , Disney has released numerous animated productions starring Winnie the Pooh and related characters . These have included theatrical featurettes , television series , and direct - to - video films , as well as the theatrical feature - length films The Tigger Movie , Piglet 's Big Movie , Pooh 's Heffalump Movie , and Winnie the Pooh . </P> <H3> Merchandising revenue dispute </H3> <P> Pooh videos , soft toys , and other merchandise generate substantial annual revenues for Disney . The size of Pooh stuffed toys ranges from Beanie and miniature to human - sized . In addition to the stylised Disney Pooh , Disney markets Classic Pooh merchandise which more closely resembles E.H. Shepard 's illustrations . </P> <P> In 1991 , Stephen Slesinger , Inc. filed a lawsuit against Disney which alleged that Disney had breached their 1983 agreement by again failing to accurately report revenue from Winnie the Pooh sales . Under this agreement , Disney was to retain approximately 98 % of gross worldwide revenues while the remaining 2 % was to be paid to Slesinger . In addition , the suit alleged that Disney had failed to pay required royalties on all commercial exploitation of the product name . Though the Disney corporation was sanctioned by a judge for destroying forty boxes of evidential documents , the suit was later terminated by another judge when it was discovered that Slesinger 's investigator had rummaged through Disney 's garbage in order to retrieve the discarded evidence . Slesinger appealed the termination , and on 26 September 2007 , a three - judge panel upheld the lawsuit dismissal . </P> <P> After the Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998 , Clare Milne , Christopher Milne 's daughter , attempted to terminate any future U.S. copyrights for Stephen Slesinger , Inc . After a series of legal hearings , Judge Florence - Marie Cooper of the US District Court in California found in favour of Stephen Slesinger , Inc. , as did the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit . On 26 June 2006 , the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear the case , sustaining the ruling and ensuring the defeat of the suit . </P> <P> On 19 February 2007 Disney lost a court case in Los Angeles which ruled their `` misguided claims '' to dispute the licensing agreements with Slesinger , Inc. were unjustified , but a federal ruling of 28 September 2009 , again from Judge Florence - Marie Cooper , determined that the Slesinger family had granted all trademark and copyright rights to Disney , although Disney must pay royalties for all future use of the characters .

It was used on a range of mass - produced general - purpose tractors manufactured by Henry Ford & Son Inc from 1917 to 1920 , by Ford Motor Company ( U.S. ) and Ford Motor Company Ltd ( U.K. ) from 1920 to 1928 , and by Ford Motor Company Ltd ( U.K. ) from 1929 to 1964 . The latter ( Ford of Britain ) also later built trucks under the Fordson brand . </P> <P> American engineer , inventor , and businessman Henry Ford built experimental tractors from automobile components during the early 20th century , and launched a prototype known as the Model B in August 1915 . Further prototypes , with a dedicated tractor design , followed in 1916 . With World War I raging in Europe , the first regular - production Henry Ford & Son tractors were exported to the U.K. in 1917 to expand British agriculture . In 1918 , exports continued , the tractors began to be labeled as Fordsons , and U.S. domestic sales began . Sales boomed in 1918 and 1919 . </P> <P> Between 1917 and 1922 , the Fordson was for tractors somewhat like the Ford Model T was for automobiles -- it captured the public 's imagination and widely popularized the machine , with a reliable design , a low price affordable for workers and farmers , a widespread dealership network , and a production capacity for large numbers . Just as the Model T helped the public to appreciate how soon cars and trucks might replace most horses in transport , the Fordson helped people to appreciate how soon tractors might replace most horses in farming ( advancing the mechanisation of agriculture ) . As with cars , Ford never had the market to itself , but it dominated the market for a time ( for cars , roughly 1910 - 1925 ; for tractors , roughly 1917 - 1925 ) . Ford was the only automotive firm to sell cars , trucks and tractors simultaneously from 1917 to 1928 . </P> <P> For a decade between 1928 and 1939 , Ford of the U.S. left the tractor business . During that decade , Ford of Britain continued to build Fordsons and to develop new variants , which it exported widely . In 1939 Ford of the U.S. reentered the tractor market with an all - new model , this time with the Ford brand . Ford of Britain continued to use the Fordson brand until 1964 . </P> <P> Fordson production occurred in the U.S. ( 1917 -- 1928 ) ; Cork , Ireland ( 1919 -- 1923 and 1928 -- 1933 ) ; and at Dagenham , Essex , England ( 1933 -- 1964 ) . Tens of thousands of Fordsons , most from the U.S. and some from Ireland , were exported to the Soviet Union from 1920 to 1927 .

At the time , farm work was extremely arduous , because on the typical farm virtually nothing could get done without manual labour or animal labour as the motive power . As his interest in automobiles grew , he also expressed a desire to `` lift the burden of farming from flesh and blood and place it on steel and motors . '' In the early 20th century , he began to build experimental tractors from automobile components . Four years after founding the Ford Motor Company in 1903 , Ford finished his first experimental tractor in 1907 on Woodward Avenue in Detroit , referring to it as the `` Automobile Plow '' . Approximately 600 gasoline - powered tractors were in use on American farms in 1908 . Fordson tractor design was headed by Eugene Farkas and J\u00f3zsef Galamb , both involved in the design of the successful Ford Model T automobile . </P> <P> Traction engines had been around for a while , but they were large , heavy , expensive machines suited to prairie grain farming more than to small family farms in other regions . In the early 1910s , North America and Europe were hungry for small , inexpensive tractors , and many people seized on the Model T as a platform with which to create them . Clearly the idea of an auto - like tractor , made using auto - like parts and methods or by conversion from autos , was ripe . </P> <P> Henry Ford experimented with both auto - plows and heavier tractors . In August 1915 , at a plowing demonstration in Fremont , Nebraska , he introduced a newly designed tractor known as the Model B. It used a 16 horsepower , two - cylinder , horizontally opposed engine , a spur gear transmission and three wheels - two front drivers and one rear steerer . The Model B was never produced , but did gain enough publicity to let the world know Ford was interested in developing a tractor . </P> <P> Knowing there was demand for a Ford - built tractor , a group of entrepreneurs in Minneapolis organized The Ford Tractor Company , paying a company clerk surnamed Ford for the use of his name , with the intention of getting sales and attention from the confusion of this Ford with Ford Motor Company . The company built and sold some tractors , but anticipated a settlement with Henry Ford for permission to use their already - trademarked name . However , Ford thwarted them by using another name . </P> <H3> Fordson origins , Model F , and Model N ( edit ) </H3> Overview of the original Fordson tractor A cutaway view of the original Fordson tractor Disassembly of the original Fordson tractor , showing the unit - frame construction and how the tractor can be taken apart for service , with blocks of wood inserted to support the separated parts A cutaway view of the engine of the original Fordson tractor A cutaway view of the intake of the original Fordson tractor ( including the intake manifold , vaporizer , carburetor , and fuel lines ) A cutaway view of the clutch , transmission , and rear of the original Fordson tractor , including the worm drive An early Fordson discing a field in Princess Anne County , Virginia , USA , in 1925 <P> The first prototypes of the new Henry Ford & Son tractor , which would later be called the Fordson , were completed in 1916 . World War I was raging in Europe , and the United Kingdom , a net importer of food , was desperate for tractors in its attempt to expand its agriculture enough to feed Britain despite the great shipping disruption of the war . In 1917 , the British Ministry of Munitions selected the Fordson for both importation from the U.S. and domestic U.K. production . It was thought that domestic U.K. production was preferable because so much Atlantic shipping was being sunk that exporting tractors from the U.S. would be counterproductive , as many would be lost at sea . This was soon modified to exclude the London area because of concerns about its vulnerability to German attacks . Henry Ford decided to build the tractor at Cork , Ireland ( which at the time was still part of the U.K. ) , partly because he wanted to bring jobs to , and foster industriousness in , southern Ireland . But the Cork plant did not begin production until 1919 , after the war had ended . As events turned out , thousands of tractors were exported from the U.S. in 1917 and 1918 . </P> <P> The tractor used a 20 hp ( 15 kW ) , inline four - cylinder engine . The engine was similar to the Ford Model T engine in many respects . Like many engines of its day , it was multifuel - capable ; it was usually tuned for gasoline or kerosene , but alcohol could also be burned . ( Tractor vaporising oil ( TVO ) existed in 1920 but was not yet widely used . It entered broader use in the 1930s and 1940s . ) Like many other multifuel machines , the Fordson started on gasoline from a small auxiliary tank ( just a few quarts ) and then switched over to the main fuel tank once warmed up sufficiently ( no more than 5 minutes ) . To handle the kerosene ( or , rarely , TVO ) , the intake system had a vaporizer downstream of the carburetor . The mixture coming from the carburetor was intentionally rich , and the vaporizer heated it and mixed it with more air to lean it out to the final ratio before entering the intake manifold . The intake system also had a water - bath air cleaner to filter the dust out of the air inhaled by the engine ( an invention that did not originate at Ford but that was still rather novel in 1917 ) . Air cleaning is critical to engine lifespan , even for road vehicles and most especially for farming and construction vehicles ( which work in environments where dirt is frequently stirred up into the air ) . The Fordson carburetor and air cleaner were designed by Holley . In later decades , the water bath would be replaced with an oil bath for better filtering performance . </P> <P> The ignition system was similar to that of the Model T , with a flywheel - mounted low - tension magneto and trembler coils . The ignition timing was manually advanced or retarded with the spark advance lever mounted near the steering column , which rotated the timer . The cooling was by thermosiphon . ( In later decades , a high - tension magneto and a water pump would be added . ) The transmission was a three - speed spur gear ( the three forward speeds ranged from approximately 2 \u200b \u2044 to 6 \u200b \u2044 mph ) . A worm drive reduction set and a differential made up the rear . The design of the rear was patented for its ease of manufacture and service . Brakes were not provided on early Fordsons , as high - ratio worm sets generally transmitted rotation in one direction only , from the worm element to the gear element , because of the high power loss through friction . To stop the tractor , the driver depressed the clutch . </P> <P> Ford engineer Eugene Farkas successfully made the engine block , oil pan , transmission , and rear axle stressed members constituting the frame . By eliminating the need for a heavy separate frame , costs were reduced and manufacturing was simplified . Ford held a patent on a unit - frame tractor . The rear wheels were fabricated steel , spoked and cleated . The earliest ones were 12 - spoke ; a 14 - spoke version followed . Several models of front wheel were used , including 10 - spoked fabricated steel and 5 - spoke cast iron . Industrial models also used other wheels designed for specific tasks , including aftermarket wheels . </P> <P> In 1916 and 1917 , the name `` Fordson '' was not yet used as the tractor 's make or model name , nor was `` Model F '' . During this period , terms such as `` the ( real / genuine ) Ford tractor '' or `` the Henry Ford tractor '' , as well as `` the MOM tractor '' ( because almost all output was going to the British Ministry of Munitions ) , were used . In early 1918 , the name `` Fordson '' was trademarked , and within a few months it was being marked on the tractors . Published sources vary somewhat on the origin of the name . All agree that the name reflects the contemporary name of the tractor company , `` Henry Ford & Son '' , and its obvious eponyms : Henry and Edsel . Some claim that the company had been using the cable address `` Fordson '' for several years , which would mean even before the company was officially incorporated in July 1917 . Another implies that February 1918 marked the first use of `` Fordson '' in a cablegram . Regardless , by April 1918 the name `` Fordson '' was established as the brand , and its eponyms were obvious . In that month , U.S. sales began under County War Board distribution rules . The Model F designation ( for essentially the same model , with improvements ) began in 1919 .

The answer should be a number\n\nDocument:\ntem , the Republicans dominated a one - party system ( primarily under the Presidency of James Monroe ) . Under the Second Party System , the Democratic - Republican Party split during the election of 1824 into Adams ' Men and Jackson 's Men . In 1828 , the modern Democratic Party formed in support of Andrew Jackson . The National Republicans were formed in support of John Quincy Adams . After the National Republicans collapsed , the Whig Party and the Free Soil Party quickly formed and collapsed . In 1854 , the modern Republican Party formed from a loose coalition of former Whigs , Free Soilers and other anti-slavery activists . Abraham Lincoln became the first Republican president in 1860 . </P> <P> During the Third Party System , the Republican Party was the dominant political faction , but the Democrats held a strong , loyal coalition in the Solid South . During the Fourth Party System , the Republicans remained the dominant Presidential party , although Democrats Grover Cleveland and Woodrow Wilson were both elected to two terms . In 1932 , at the onset of the Fifth Party System , Democrats took firm control of national politics with the landslide victories of Franklin D. Roosevelt in four consecutive elections . Other than the two terms of Republican Dwight Eisenhower from 1953 to 1961 , Democrats retained firm control of the Presidency until the mid-1960s . Since the mid-1960s , despite a number of landslides ( such as Richard Nixon carrying 49 states and 61 % of the popular vote over George McGovern in 1972 ; Ronald Reagan carrying 49 states and 58 % of the popular vote over Walter Mondale in 1984 ) , Presidential elections have been competitive between the predominant Republican and Democratic parties and no one party has been able to hold the Presidency for more than three consecutive terms , except for the elections from 1932 through 1948 when FDR won 4 elections and Truman one , both as Democrats . In the election of 2012 , only 4 % separated the popular vote between Barack Obama ( 51 % ) and Mitt Romney ( 47 % ) , although Obama won the electoral vote by a landslide ( 332 -- 206 ) . </P> <P> Throughout every American party system , no third party has won a Presidential election or majorities in either house of Congress . Despite that , third parties and third party candidates have gained traction and support . In the election of 1912 , Theodore Roosevelt won 27 % of the popular vote and 88 electoral votes running as a Progressive . In the 1992 Presidential election , Ross Perot won 19 % of the popular vote but no electoral votes running as an Independent . </P> <H3> Commonwealth countries ( edit ) </H3> <P> In countries such as Britain , two major parties emerge which have strong influence and tend to elect most of the candidates , but a multitude of lesser parties exist with varying degrees of influence , and sometimes these lesser parties are able to elect officials who participate in the legislature . In political systems based on the Westminster system , which is a particular style of parliamentary democracy based on the British model and found in many commonwealth countries , a majority party will form the government and the minority party will form the opposition , and coalitions of lesser parties are possible ; in the rare circumstance in which neither party is the majority , a hung parliament arises . Sometimes these systems are described as two - party systems but they are usually referred to as multi-party systems . There is not always a sharp boundary between a two - party system and a multi-party system . </P> <P> Generally , a two - party system becomes a dichotomous division of the political spectrum with an ostensibly right - wing and left - wing party : the Nationalist Party vs. the Labour Party in Malta , Labor vs. Liberal / National Coalition in Australia , Republicans vs. Democrats in the United States and the Conservative Party vs. the Labour Party in the United Kingdom . </P> <P> Other parties in these countries may have seen candidates elected to local or subnational office , however . Historian John Hicks claims that the United States has never possessed for any considerable period of time the two party system in its pure and undefiled form . </P> <P> In some governments , certain chambers may resemble a two - party system and others a multi-party system . For example , the politics of Australia are largely two - party ( the Liberal / National Coalition is often considered a single party at a national level due to their long - standing alliance in forming government and additionally rarely compete for the same seat ) for the Australian House of Representatives , which is elected by instant - runoff voting , known within Australia as preferential voting . However , third parties are more common in the Australian Senate , which uses a proportional voting system more amenable to minor parties . </P> <P> In the politics of Canada , while having a multiparty system federally and in the largest provinces of Ontario , Quebec and Alberta , many of the provinces have effectively become two - party systems in which only two parties regularly get members elected . Examples include British Columbia ( where the battles are between the New Democratic Party and the BC Liberals ) , Saskatchewan ( between the Saskatchewan Party and New Democratic Party ) , New Brunswick ( between the Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives ) and Prince Edward Island ( between Liberals and Progressive Conservatives ) . </P> <H3> India ( edit ) </H3> <P> India also shows characteristics of a two party system with the United Progressive Alliance ( UPA ) and National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ) as the two main players . It is to be noted that both UPA and NDA are not two political parties but alliances of several smaller parties . Other smaller parties not aligned with either NDA or UPA exist , and overall command about 20 % of the 2009 seats in the Lok Sabha and had further increased to 28 % in 2014 general elections </P> <H3> Malta ( edit ) </H3> <P> Malta is somewhat unusual in that while the electoral system is single transferable vote ( STV ) , traditionally associated with proportional representation , minor parties have not earned much success . Politics is dominated between the centre - left Labour Party and the centre - right Nationalist Party , with no third parties winning seats in Parliament between 1962 and 2017 . </P> <H3> Other examples ( edit ) </H3> <P> The English speaking countries of the Caribbean while inheriting their basic political system from Great Britain have become two party systems . The politics of Jamaica are between the People 's National Party and the Jamaica Labour Party . The politics of Guyana are between the People 's Progressive Party and APNU which is actually a coalition of smaller parties . The politics of Trinidad and Tobago are between the People 's National Movement and the People 's Partnership which is also a coalition . The Politics of Belize are between the United Democratic Party and the People 's United Party . The Politics of the Bahamas are between the Progressive Liberal Party and the Free National Movement . The politics of Barbados are between the Democratic Labour Party and the Barbados Labour Party . </P> <P> The politics of Zimbabwe are effectively a two party system between the Robert Mugabe led Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front and the opposition coalition Movement for Democratic Change . </P> <P> South Korea has a multi-party system that has sometimes been described as having characteristics of a two - party system . </P> <P> Furthermore , the Lebanese Parliament is mainly made up of two bipartisan alliances . Although both alliances are made up of several political parties on both ends of the political spectrum the two way political situation has mainly arisen due to strong ideological differences in the electorate . Once again this can mainly be attributed to the winner takes all thesis . </P> <P> Historically , Brazil had a two - party system for most of its military dictatorship ( 1964 -- 1985 ) : the military junta banned all existing parties when it took power and created a pro-government party , the National Renewal Alliance and an official opposition party , the Brazilian Democratic Movement . The two parties were dissolved in 1979 , when the regime allowed other parties to form . </P> <P> A report in The Christian Science Monitor in 2008 suggested that Spain was moving towards a `` greater two - party system '' while acknowledging that Spain has `` many small parties '' . However a 2015 article published by WashingtonPost.com written by academic Fernando Casal B\u00e9rtoa noted the decline in support for the two main parties , the People 's Party ( PP ) and the Spanish Socialist Workers ' Party ( PSOE ) in recent years , with these two parties winning only 52 percent of the votes in that year 's regional and local elections . He explained this as being due to the Spanish economic crisis , a series of political corruption scandals and broken campaign promises . He argued that the emergence of the new Citizens and Podemos parties would mean the political system would evolve into a two - bloc system , with an alliance of the PP and Citizens on the right facing a leftist coalition of PSOE , Podemos and the United Left . </P> <H2> Comparisons with other party systems ( edit ) </H2> <P> Two - party systems can be contrasted with : </P> <Ul> <Li> Multi-party systems . In these , the effective number of parties is greater than two but usually fewer than five ; in a two - party system , the effective number of parties is two ( according to one analysis , the actual average number of parties varies between 1.7 and 2.1 . ) The parties in a multi-party system can control government separately or as a coalition ; in a two - party system , however , coalition governments rarely form . Examples of nations with multi-party systems include Brazil , Canada , Denmark , Finland , France , Germany , India , Pakistan , Indonesia , Ireland , Israel , Italy , Mexico , Nepal , the Netherlands , New Zealand , Norway , Portugal , Russia , Spain , Sweden and Taiwan . </Li> <Li> One - party systems or dominant - party systems happen in nations where no more than one party is codified in law and / or officially recognized , or where alternate parties are restricted by the dominant party which wields power . Examples include rule by the Communist Party of China and the People 's Action Party of Singapore . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Causes ( edit ) </H2> <P> There are several reasons why , in some systems , two major parties dominate the political landscape . There has been speculation that a two - party system arose in the United States from early political battling between the federalists and anti-federalists in the first few decades after the ratification of the Constitution , according to several views . In addition , there has been more speculation that the winner - takes - all electoral system as well as particular state and federal laws regarding voting procedures helped to cause a two - party system . </P> In a two - party system , voters have mostly two options ; in this sample ballot for an election in Summit , New Jersey , voters can choose between a Republican or Democrat , but there are no third party candidates . Economist Jeffrey D. Sachs . <P> Political scientists such as Maurice Duverger and William H. Riker claim that there are strong correlations between voting rules and type of party system . Jeffrey D. Sachs agreed that there was a link between voting arrangements and the effective number of parties . Sachs explained how the first - past - the - post voting arrangement tended to promote a two - party system : </P> <P> The main reason for America 's majoritarian character is the electoral system for Congress . Members of Congress are elected in single - member districts according to the `` first - past - the - post '' ( FPTP ) principle , meaning that the candidate with the plurality of votes is the winner of the congressional seat . The losing party or parties win no representation at all . The first - past - the - post election tends to produce a small number of major parties , perhaps just two , a principle known in political science as Duverger 's Law . Smaller parties are trampled in first - past - the - post elections . </P> -- Sachs , The Price of Civilization , 2011 <P> Consider a system in which voters can vote for any candidate from any one of many parties . Suppose further that if a party gets 15 % of votes , then that party will win 15 % of the seats in the legislature . This is termed proportional representation or more accurately as party - proportional representation . Political scientists speculate that proportional representation leads logically to multi-party systems , since it allows new parties to build a niche in the legislature : </P> <P> Because even a minor party may still obtain at least a few seats in the legislature , smaller parties have a greater incentive to organize under such electoral systems than they do in the United States . </P> -- Schmidt , Shelley , Bardes ( 2008 ) <P> In contrast , a voting system that allows only a single winner for each possible legislative seat is sometimes termed a plurality voting system or single - winner voting system and is usually described under the heading of a winner - takes - all arrangement . Each voter can cast a single vote for any candidate within any given legislative district , but the candidate with the most votes wins the seat , although variants , such as requiring a majority , are sometimes used . What happens is that in a general election , a party that consistently comes in third in every district is unlikely to win any legislative seats even if there is a significant proportion of the electorate favoring its positions . This arrangement strongly favors large and well -- organized political parties that are able to appeal to voters in many districts and hence win many seats , and discourages smaller or regional parties . Politically oriented people consider their only realistic way to capture political power is to run under the auspices of the two dominant parties . </P> <P> In the U.S. , forty - eight states have a standard winner - takes - all electoral system for amassing presidential votes in the Electoral College system . The winner - takes - all principle applies in presidential elections , since if a presidential candidate gets the most votes in any particular state , all of the electoral votes from that state are awarded .

( later known as Rankin / Bass Productions ) and currently distributed by Universal Television . It first aired Sunday , December 6 , 1964 , on the NBC television network in the United States , and was sponsored by General Electric under the umbrella title of The General Electric Fantasy Hour . The special was based on the Johnny Marks song `` Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer '' which was itself based on the poem of the same name written in 1939 by Marks ' brother - in - law , Robert L. May . Since 1972 , the special has aired on CBS , with the network unveiling a high - definition , digitally remastered version of the program in 2005 . As with A Charlie Brown Christmas and How the Grinch Stole Christmas , Rudolph no longer airs just once annually , but several times during the Christmas and holiday season on CBS . Unlike other holiday specials that also air on several cable channels ( including Freeform ) , Rudolph only airs on CBS . It has been telecast every year since 1964 , making it the longest continuously running Christmas TV special in history . 2014 marked the 50th anniversary of the television special and a series of postage stamps featuring Rudolph was issued by the United States Postal Service on November 6 , 2014 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Cast </Li> <Li> 3 Production <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Aftermath </Li> <Li> 3.2 Production credits </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Different versions <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Original 1964 NBC broadcast edit </Li> <Li> 4.2 1965 -- 1997 telecasts </Li> <Li> 4.3 1998 -- CBS telecasts </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Home media </Li> <Li> 6 Soundtrack </Li> <Li> 7 Merchandise </Li> <Li> 8 Reception </Li> <Li> 9 Sequels </Li> <Li> 10 In popular culture <Ul> <Li> 10.1 Films by Corky Quakenbush </Li> <Li> 10.2 Uses in advertising </Li> <Li> 10.3 Other References </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 11 Copyright issues </Li> <Li> 12 See also </Li> <Li> 13 References </Li> <Li> 14 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> Sam the Snowman welcomes the viewers to Christmastown at the North Pole and introduces Santa and Mrs. Claus who live in a castle located north of the Christmas Tree Forest . Mrs. Claus fusses over Santa as she wants him to fatten up by Christmas Eve . Sam then recalls the year Christmas was almost cancelled due to a snowstorm and tells the story of how a very special reindeer saved the day . </P> <P> Donner , Santa 's lead reindeer , and his wife have given birth to their new baby fawn , Rudolph . Upon admiring him , they are surprised to see that Rudolph has been born with a glowing red nose . When Santa arrives , he warns Donner that Rudolph will not make the sleigh team because of his nose . Donner then decides to hide the nose by covering it with mud to allow Rudolph to fit in with all the other reindeer . </P> <P> Over Rudolph 's first year of life , Donner trains him in the basics of being a reindeer , including hiding from the Abominable Snow Monster of the North . Rudolph enters the reindeer games , competing against his fellow fawns . During flight practice , Rudolph meets a doe named Clarice who tells him he is cute , and kisses him , which causes an elated Rudolph to fly higher and faster than everyone else . However , while celebrating with the other bucks , Rudolph 's nose cover pops off , and the others react with fear , then scorn and finally rejection as Rudolph is kicked out of the Reindeer Games . Walking away , Rudolph walks with Clarice , who supports him , until her father firmly tells her to never have any more contacts with a red - nosed reindeer . Then , Rudolph meets up with Hermey , an elf who ran away from Santa 's workshop because he wanted to be a dentist instead of making toys , and they decide to run away together . The pair then meet a prospector named Yukon Cornelius , who has fruitlessly searched his whole life for silver and gold . After escaping the snow monster on an ice floe , the trio crash land on the Island of Misfit Toys where unloved or unwanted toys live with their ruler , a winged lion named King Moonracer . The king allows the group to stay one night on the island in exchange for returning to Christmastown to ask Santa to find homes for the unwanted toys . However , Rudolph leaves the island in the middle of the night on his own , fearing that his nose , which attracts the snow monster , will endanger his friends . </P> <P> Time goes by and Rudolph grows into adulthood ; he tries and fails to find a place to settle where he will be accepted despite his nose and decides to return home . There , he finds that his parents and Clarice have been looking for him for months ; he sets out once again to find them , only to discover that the snow monster has captured them . Rudolph tries to save Clarice from being eaten , but the monster hits him in the head with a stalactite , dazing him . Hermey and Yukon return to Christmastown and go to save Rudolph . Hermey , posing as a pig , lures the monster out of his cave and Yukon drops rocks on his head to knock him out . Hermey then pulls out all the monster 's teeth . Realizing Yukon drives the toothless ( and now terrified ) monster back , only to follow it over the cliff with all his pack dogs . Mourning Yukon 's presumed death , Rudolph , Hermey , Clarice , and the Donners return home where everyone apologizes to them . After hearing their story , Santa welcomes the group back to Christmastown , promises that he will find homes for the Misfit Toys , Hermey opens his own dentist 's office , and Clarice 's father apologizes for being so hard on Rudolph . Yukon then returns with a reformed snow monster ( Yukon notes that they bounce ) and demonstrates the beast 's ability to trim a Christmas tree . While everybody 's celebrating , Santa interrupts , grimly informing everyone that because of the storm , he is forced to cancel the Christmas trip . Santa is soon distracted by Rudolph 's red nose and realizes that its light could cut through the storm . He asks Rudolph to lead the sleigh and Rudolph agrees . The team then flies off to the island and pick up the toys . The special ends with Santa wishing the viewers a merry Christmas as he and Rudolph fly off into the night . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> Hermey and Rudolph <Ul> <Li> Billie Mae Richards voices Rudolph , a reindeer with strong mental ( he learns to speak shortly after birth ) and physical strength who is shunned for his nonconforming red nose , but later saves Christmas . </Li> <Li> Stan Francis voices : <Ul> <Li> Santa Claus , portrayed in the special as a moody , nervous and `` skinny Santa '' whose fears are only allayed when he conjures the idea of using Rudolph 's nose to lead the sleigh . </Li> <Li> King Moonracer , a winged lion who rules the entire Island of Misfit Toys . King Moonracer 's voice uses a reverb effect to distinguish it from Santa Claus . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Paul Kligman voices : <Ul> <Li> Donner , Rudolph 's father and Santa 's most prized reindeer . While he loves and accepts Rudolph , he shows great concern that society will reject him for his nose and tries to protect him by creating a nose cover . </Li> <Li> Comet , head coach of the Reindeer Games . </Li> <Li> Clarice 's unnamed father , who forbids Clarice from shaming the family by associating with a red - nosed reindeer . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Burl Ives voices Sam the Snowman , the narrator . </Li> <Li> Paul Soles voices Hermey , an elf who dreams of pursuing a career in dentistry and `` feels different '' from the other elves .

Her misfit problem is never explained on the special ; many decades later , on NPR 's Wait Wait ... Do n't Tell Me ! news quiz show ( broadcast December 8 , 2007 ) , Rudolph 's producer , Arthur Rankin Jr. , noted that Dolly 's problem was psychological , caused by being abandoned by her owner ( named as Sue in the special ) and suffering depression from feeling uncared - for . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <P> The TV special , with the teleplay by Romeo Muller , introduced several new characters inspired by the song 's lyrics . Muller told an interviewer shortly before his death that he would have preferred to base the teleplay on May 's original book , but could not find a copy . Other than Burl Ives , all characters were portrayed by Canadian actors recorded at RCA studios in Toronto under the supervision of Bernard Cowan . </P> <P> After the script , concept designs and storyboards for Rudolph were done by Arthur Rankin , Jr. and his staff of artists at Rankin / Bass in New York City . The company 's trademark stop motion animation process , known as `` Animagic '' , was filmed at MOM Productions in Tokyo with supervision by Tadahito Mochinaga and associate direction by Kizo Nagashima . Besides Rudolph , Mochinaga and the rest of the Japanese puppet animation staff are also known for their partnership with Rankin / Bass on their other Animagic productions almost throughout the 1960s , from The New Adventures of Pinocchio , to Willy McBean and his Magic Machine , to The Daydreamer and Mad Monster Party ? . </P> <H3> Aftermath ( edit ) </H3> <P> Since those involved with the production had no idea of the future value of the stop - motion puppet figures used in the production , many were not preserved . Rankin claimed in 2007 to be in possession of an original Rudolph figure . Nine other puppets -- including Santa and young Rudolph -- were given to a secretary , who gave them to family members . Eventually seven were discarded . In 2005 , the remaining two puppets of Rudolph and Santa were appraised on Antiques Roadshow ; the episode aired in 2006 on PBS . At that time , their appraised value was between $8,000 and $10,000 . The puppets had been damaged through years of rough handling by children and storage in an attic . Toy aficionado Kevin Kriess bought Santa and Rudolph in 2005 ; in 2007 , he had both puppets restored by Screen Novelties , a Los Angeles - based collective of film directors specializing in stop motion animation with puppet fabricator Robin Walsh leading the project . The figures have been shown at conventions since then . </P> <H3> Production credits ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Directed by Larry Roemer </Li> <Li> Produced by Arthur Rankin , Jr . </Li> <Li> Co-Producer : Jules Bass </Li> <Li> Written by Romeo Muller </Li> <Li> Adapted from the Story by Robert L.

Neil suggested that by making a vehicle that is longer , wider and taller , the company had forsaken the inner logic of the brand : excellent handling in a tiny size . In a March 2011 review titled What Part of ' Mini ' Did You Not Grasp , BMW ? , Neil wrote `` with the Countryman , tiny sharks have been jumped . '' The Countryman became Mini 's second most popular model after the iconic Hardtop . The very first year of production it sold almost 50 % more units than the Clubman , Convertible , and Coupe added together . Almost 1 out of every 3 vehicles Mini sold in 2011 was a Countryman ( U.S. market ) . This trend continued through 2012 also with almost 1 in 3 MINIs sold again being a Countryman - both in the US and globally . By the end of 2013 the Countryman was 31 % of total U.S. sales for the Mini brand . </P> <H3> 2014 update ( r60 lci ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> A minor facelift to the Countryman was unveiled at the 2014 New York International Auto Show . Changes include a new structure of the hexagonal radiator grill , underride guard elements for the Cooper S Countryman ALL4 and additional body colour options . It went on sale in July 2014 . All variants carried over . US variants include Cooper , Cooper S , Cooper S ALL4 , John Cooper Works ( with ALL4 ) , with 6 - speed manual transmission or optional 6 - speed automatic transmission . </P> <Ul> <Li> <P> 2014 LCI </P> </Li> <Li> <P> 2014 LCI </P> </Li> </Ul> <H3> Powertrain ( edit ) </H3> <Table> Petrol engines hide <Tr> <Th> Model </Th> <Th> Years </Th> <Th> Type </Th> <Th> Power , torque @ rpm </Th> <Th> Transmission </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> One </Td> <Td> 2010 -- 2016 </Td> <Td> 1,598 cc ( 97.5 cu in ) I4 </Td> <Td> 98 PS ( 72 kW ; 97 hp ) @ 6000 , 153 N \u22c5 m ( 113 lb \u22c5 ft ) @ 3000 </Td> <Td> 6 - speed manual , 6 - speed automatic </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Cooper </Td> <Td> 2010 -- 2016 </Td> <Td> 1,598 cc ( 97.5 cu in ) I4 </Td> <Td> 122 PS ( 90 kW ; 120 hp ) @ 6000 , 160 N \u22c5 m (\n\nQuestion:\nwhat year did the mini cooper countryman come out\n", "answer": "2010"}

( later known as Rankin / Bass Productions ) and currently distributed by Universal Television . It first aired Sunday , December 6 , 1964 , on the NBC television network in the United States , and was sponsored by General Electric under the umbrella title of The General Electric Fantasy Hour . The special was based on the Johnny Marks song `` Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer '' which was itself based on the poem of the same name written in 1939 by Marks ' brother - in - law , Robert L. May . Since 1972 , the special has aired on CBS , with the network unveiling a high - definition , digitally remastered version of the program in 2005 . As with A Charlie Brown Christmas and How the Grinch Stole Christmas , Rudolph no longer airs just once annually , but several times during the Christmas and holiday season on CBS . Unlike other holiday specials that also air on several cable channels ( including Freeform ) , Rudolph only airs on CBS . It has been telecast every year since 1964 , making it the longest continuously running Christmas TV special in history . 2014 marked the 50th anniversary of the television special and a series of postage stamps featuring Rudolph was issued by the United States Postal Service on November 6 , 2014 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Cast </Li> <Li> 3 Production <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Aftermath </Li> <Li> 3.2 Production credits </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Different versions <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Original 1964 NBC broadcast edit </Li> <Li> 4.2 1965 -- 1997 telecasts </Li> <Li> 4.3 1998 -- CBS telecasts </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Home media </Li> <Li> 6 Soundtrack </Li> <Li> 7 Merchandise </Li> <Li> 8 Reception </Li> <Li> 9 Sequels </Li> <Li> 10 In popular culture <Ul> <Li> 10.1 Films by Corky Quakenbush </Li> <Li> 10.2 Uses in advertising </Li> <Li> 10.3 Other References </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 11 Copyright issues </Li> <Li> 12 See also </Li> <Li> 13 References </Li> <Li> 14 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> Sam the Snowman welcomes the viewers to Christmastown at the North Pole and introduces Santa and Mrs. Claus who live in a castle located north of the Christmas Tree Forest . Mrs. Claus fusses over Santa as she wants him to fatten up by Christmas Eve . Sam then recalls the year Christmas was almost cancelled due to a snowstorm and tells the story of how a very special reindeer saved the day . </P> <P> Donner , Santa 's lead reindeer , and his wife have given birth to their new baby fawn , Rudolph . Upon admiring him , they are surprised to see that Rudolph has been born with a glowing red nose . When Santa arrives , he warns Donner that Rudolph will not make the sleigh team because of his nose . Donner then decides to hide the nose by covering it with mud to allow Rudolph to fit in with all the other reindeer . </P> <P> Over Rudolph 's first year of life , Donner trains him in the basics of being a reindeer , including hiding from the Abominable Snow Monster of the North . Rudolph enters the reindeer games , competing against his fellow fawns . During flight practice , Rudolph meets a doe named Clarice who tells him he is cute , and kisses him , which causes an elated Rudolph to fly higher and faster than everyone else . However , while celebrating with the other bucks , Rudolph 's nose cover pops off , and the others react with fear , then scorn and finally rejection as Rudolph is kicked out of the Reindeer Games . Walking away , Rudolph walks with Clarice , who supports him , until her father firmly tells her to never have any more contacts with a red - nosed reindeer . Then , Rudolph meets up with Hermey , an elf who ran away from Santa 's workshop because he wanted to be a dentist instead of making toys , and they decide to run away together . The pair then meet a prospector named Yukon Cornelius , who has fruitlessly searched his whole life for silver and gold . After escaping the snow monster on an ice floe , the trio crash land on the Island of Misfit Toys where unloved or unwanted toys live with their ruler , a winged lion named King Moonracer . The king allows the group to stay one night on the island in exchange for returning to Christmastown to ask Santa to find homes for the unwanted toys . However , Rudolph leaves the island in the middle of the night on his own , fearing that his nose , which attracts the snow monster , will endanger his friends . </P> <P> Time goes by and Rudolph grows into adulthood ; he tries and fails to find a place to settle where he will be accepted despite his nose . Returning home , he finds that his parents and Clarice have been looking for him for months . He sets out once again to find them , only to discover that the snow monster has captured them . Rudolph tries to save Clarice from being eaten , but the monster hits him in the head with a stalactite , dazing him . Hermey and Yukon return to Christmastown and go to save Rudolph . Hermey , posing as a pig , lures the monster out of his cave and Yukon drops rocks on his head to knock him out . Hermey then pulls out all the monster 's teeth . Realizing Yukon drives the toothless ( and now terrified ) monster back , only to follow it over the cliff with all his pack dogs . Mourning Yukon 's presumed death , Rudolph , Hermey , Clarice , and the Donners return home where everyone apologizes to them . After hearing their story , Santa welcomes the group back to Christmastown , promises that he will find homes for the Misfit Toys , Hermey opens his own dentist 's office , and Clarice 's father apologizes for being so hard on Rudolph . Yukon then returns with a reformed snow monster ( Yukon notes that they bounce ) and demonstrates the beast 's ability to trim a Christmas tree . While everybody 's celebrating , Santa interrupts , grimly informing everyone that because of the storm , he is forced to cancel the Christmas trip . Santa is soon distracted by Rudolph 's red nose and realizes that its light could cut through the storm . He asks Rudolph to lead the sleigh and Rudolph agrees . The team then flies off to the island and pick up the toys .

It is the eighth Doctor Who Christmas special since the show 's 2005 revival and the first to be within a series . It was written by head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat and directed by Saul Metzstein . </P> <P> The episode is set in the Victorian era and sees the Doctor ( Matt Smith ) brooding with the assistance of Silurian Madame Vastra ( Neve McIntosh ) , her wife Jenny Flint ( Catrin Stewart ) and Sontaran Strax ( Dan Starkey ) , after the loss of companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams in the previous episode , `` The Angels Take Manhattan '' . He is forced out of hiding to investigate mysterious , sentient snowmen that are building themselves and meets Clara Oswald ( Jenna - Louise Coleman ) , a governess also investigating the snowmen . They discover that the snowmen are being animated by the Great Intelligence ( voice of Ian McKellen ) with the help of a man named Dr Simeon ( Richard E. Grant ) . </P> <P> Building upon the character 's surprise introduction in `` Asylum of the Daleks '' , `` The Snowmen '' introduces Clara as the Doctor 's new companion , though ultimately it would be a third version of her character that would travel with the Doctor starting with `` The Bells of Saint John '' . In addition to Clara , `` The Snowmen '' also introduces a redesigned TARDIS , revised title sequence and theme music , and sees changes to the Doctor 's costume . The special was produced in August 2012 , with location filming in Newport , Wales and Bristol . It received final ratings of 9.87 million viewers in the UK , becoming the fourth most - watched programme of Christmas Day . `` The Snowmen '' was met with mostly positive reviews from critics , most of whom received the introduction and character of Clara well . However , some felt that Grant and McKellen were underused as villains or the plot was slight because of the focus on characterisation . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Prequels </Li> <Li> 1.2 Synopsis </Li> <Li> 1.3 Continuity </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Production <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Writing and design changes </Li> <Li> 2.2 Casting </Li> <Li> 2.3 Filming and effects </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Broadcast and reception <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Critical reception </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 DVD release </Li> <Li> 5 Soundtrack </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Prequels ( edit ) </H3> <P> To promote the special , three prequels were released . The first was broadcast during the 2012 Children in Need telethon on 16 November 2012 , titled `` The Great Detective '' . The Silurian Madame Vastra , her human wife Jenny Flint , and the Sontaran Strax ( all returning from `` A Good Man Goes to War '' ) describe a number of strange phenomena to a shadowed fourth detective . The fourth detective reveals himself to be the Doctor , and tells the group that he has retired . </P> <P> A second prequel , titled `` Vastra Investigates '' , was released online on 17 December 2012 . At the end of a case , Vastra and Jenny converse with an officer from Scotland Yard and apologise for Strax 's violent wishes for the culprit 's punishment . Vastra explains Strax 's alien origin as well as her own to the officer , much to his astonishment . Vastra reveals that she was awoken by an extension to the London Underground and initially disliked humans , though that changed when she fell in love with Jenny . On the carriage ride home , Jenny notices it is beginning to snow and Vastra notes that the snow should be impossible because there are no clouds in the sky . </P> <P> A third prequel , titled `` The Battle of Demon 's Run -- Two Days Later '' was released on the United States iTunes and Amazon Video stores on 25 March 2013 . Two days after the events of `` A Good Man Goes to War '' , Vastra and Jenny convince Strax that he is not mortally wounded and invite him to accompany them back to 1800s London . The scene had been filmed as an extra due to the anticipation that fans would ask how Strax was resurrected and came to be in Vastra 's employ . </P> <H3> Synopsis ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1842 England , a young boy builds a snowman , but refuses to play with the other children . The snowman starts speaking to the boy , repeating his assertions that the other children are silly . Fifty years later , the boy has grown up to be Dr. Walter Simeon , proprietor of the Great Intelligence Institute . He hires men to collect samples of snow , which he places in a large snow - filled globe in his laboratory before feeding the men to a group of animated snowmen . The Doctor , still despondent after losing his former companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams , has parked his TARDIS above Victorian London among the clouds . He uses his allies Vastra , Jenny , and Strax to keep people away from him . They also fill their time investigating mysteries throughout the city . </P> <P> Elsewhere , barmaid Clara Oswin Oswald investigates a disturbance outside the tavern she works at and finds the Doctor walking by . He attempts to leave discreetly , but Clara follows him to a coach . Not wishing to become involved in matters , the Doctor instructs Strax to bring him a memory worm that will erase the last hour of Clara 's memories with just a touch . Before they can do so , they are surrounded by snowmen created from snow with psychic properties who attack the group . The Doctor realises that Clara 's thoughts are creating the snowmen and ends the threat by instructing her to think of them melting . Clara cautions the Doctor that if he wipes her memory , she will forget how to deal with the snowmen . The Doctor reluctantly allows her to go and ascends a staircase to the sky to return to the TARDIS . Clara follows him and knocks on the door , but she hides and flees down the staircase when the Doctor answers . Clara returns to her other job as governess for the children of Captain Latimer . She learns that Latimer 's daughter has been having horrible dreams about their previous governess returning from the dead . Clara realises that the pond that contains the old governess ' body is the only thing still frozen around them . She attempts to track down the Doctor but instead attracts the attention of Jenny , who takes her to see Vastra . Vastra tells Clara she gets only one word to impress the Doctor with if she wants his help . Clara chooses the word `` Pond '' , which shocks the Doctor and arouses his interest . </P> The Doctor welcomes his new companion Clara to his redesigned TARDIS . The idea behind the redesign was to make the TARDIS look more like a machine again . <P> Acting on a tip from Strax , the Doctor visits the Great Intelligence Institute posing as Sherlock Holmes . He confronts Dr. Simeon and find a large glass globe in Simeon 's office that contains psychic snow . The Doctor speaks to the Great Intelligence , the entity that has been speaking to Dr. Simeon since he was a boy . He learns that the Great Intelligence has been controlling the snowmen and has taken interest in Latimer 's pond . The Doctor visits the pond and deduces that the Great Intelligence is using the old governess ' body as a DNA blueprint to form an ice creature that will retain its form and not melt . While Clara is putting the children to bed , the frozen body of the governess breaks into the house . The Doctor fights her off and is joined by Vastra , Jenny and Strax . Dr. Simeon arrives with more snowmen and tells them he wants the governess ' ice body . The Doctor flees with Clara to the roof of the mansion and then to the TARDIS hovering overhead . They are pursued by the ice governess , whom the Doctor traps under a layer of frozen ice crystals . Inside the TARDIS the Doctor gives Clara a TARDIS key , but the ice governess arrives and pulls Clara down off the cloud . </P> <P> The Doctor picks up Clara and takes her back to Latimer 's mansion , placing her under medical care of Strax . He collects the ice fragments from the governess and places them in a souvenir London Underground biscuit tin . He and Vastra travel to Simeon 's lab , where the Doctor notes the Intelligence 's plan to replace humanity with ice creatures and holds up the tin with the necessary DNA . Dr Simeon grabs the tin and opens it only to find the memory worm , which latches on to him . The Doctor states that the Great Intelligence , which has been existing as a mirror of Dr Simeon 's thoughts , will vanish with the erasure of Simeon 's memories . Instead , the Intelligence reveals that it existed long enough that it can now control Simeon 's body , which it uses to attack Vastra and the Doctor . The influence of the Great Intelligence quickly wanes , and Simeon falls dead . Outside , a salt - water rain has started , and the Doctor sees that another psychic ability has taken control of the snow from the Great Intelligence : the Latimer family , crying for Clara . Strax informs the Doctor upon his return to the Latimer mansion that Clara only has moments left , and she passes away as the Doctor returns the TARDIS key to her . At her funeral , the Doctor reads Clara 's full name on her tombstone and realises she is the woman he met in `` Asylum of the Daleks '' who became a Dalek , whom he refers to as `` Souffl\u00e9 Girl '' . He gleefully announces that a person dying twice is an impossibility and , bidding farewell to his allies for now , the Doctor departs in the TARDIS to investigate and find Clara . The episode concludes in contemporary times , where a young woman resembling Clara walks through the same graveyard , pausing by Clara 's tombstone . </P> <H3> Continuity ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Second Doctor previously encountered the Great Intelligence in the serials The Abominable Snowmen ( 1967 ) , set in the 1930s , and The Web of Fear ( 1968 ) , set in the 1960s . In these stories , the Great Intelligence uses robot Yeti as its physical presence . The events of The Web of Fear are alluded to by the Doctor in `` The Snowmen '' when he presents the London Underground biscuit tin to the Great Intelligence in Dr Simeon 's laboratory ; the Intelligence states , `` I do not understand these markings '' , in reference to the 1967 London Underground map design on the tin . The Doctor remarks that the Underground is a `` key strategic we\n", "answer": "231"}

The object is moved in small increments between individually photographed frames , creating the illusion of movement when the series of frames is played as a fast sequence . Dolls with movable joints or clay figures are often used in stop motion for their ease of repositioning . Stop motion animation using plasticine is called clay animation or `` clay - mation '' . Not all stop motion requires figures or models ; many stop motion films can involve using humans , household appliances and other things for comedic effect . Stop motion can also use sequential drawing in a similar manner to traditional animation , such as a flip book . Stop motion using humans is sometimes referred to as pixilation or pixilate animation . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Terminology </Li> <Li> 2 History <Ul> <Li> 2.1 1960s and 1970s </Li> <Li> 2.2 1980s to present </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Variations of stop motion <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Stereoscopic stop motion </Li> <Li> 3.2 Go motion </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Comparison to computer - generated imagery </Li> <Li> 5 Stop motion in television and movies </Li> <Li> 6 Stop motion in other media </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Terminology ( edit ) </H2> <P> The term `` stop motion '' , related to the animation technique , is often spelled with a hyphen , `` stop - motion '' . Both orthographical variants , with and without the hyphen , are correct , but the hyphenated one has , in addition , a second meaning , not related to animation or cinema : `` a device for automatically stopping a machine or engine when something has gone wrong '' ( The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary , 1993 edition ) . </P> <P> Stop motion is often confused with the time lapse technique , where still photographs of a live surrounding are taken at regular intervals and combined into a continuous film . Time lapse is a technique whereby the frequency at which film frames are captured is much lower than that used to view the sequence . When played at normal speed , time appears to be moving faster . </P> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> Play media The Sculptor 's Nightmare Play media Segment from the 1925 film The Lost World animated by Willis O'Brien <P> Stop motion animation has a long history in film . It was often used to show objects moving as if by magic . The first instance of the stop motion technique can be credited to Albert E. Smith and J. Stuart Blackton for Vitagraph 's The Humpty Dumpty Circus ( 1897 ) , in which a toy circus of acrobats and animals comes to life . In 1902 , the film Fun in a Bakery Shop used the stop trick technique in the `` lightning sculpting '' sequence . French trick film maestro Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s used stop motion animation once to produce moving title - card letters in one of his short films , and a number of his special effects are based on stop motion photography . In 1907 , The Haunted Hotel is a new stop motion film by J. Stuart Blackton , and was a resounding success when released . Segundo de Chom\u00f3n ( 1871 -- 1929 ) , from Spain , released El Hotel El\u00e9ctrico later that same year , and used similar techniques as the Blackton film . In 1908 , A Sculptor 's Welsh Rarebit Nightmare was released , as was The Sculptor 's Nightmare , a film by Billy Bitzer . Italian animator Rom\u00e9o Bossetti impressed audiences with his object animation tour - de-force , The Automatic Moving Company in 1912 . The great European stop motion pioneer was Wladyslaw Starewicz ( 1892 -- 1965 ) , who animated The Beautiful Lukanida ( 1910 ) , The Battle of the Stag Beetles ( 1910 ) , The Ant and the Grasshopper ( 1911 ) . </P> <P> One of the earliest clay animation films was Modelling Extraordinary , which impressed audiences in 1912 . December 1916 brought the first of Willie Hopkins ' 54 episodes of `` Miracles in Mud '' to the big screen . Also in December 1916 , the first woman animator , Helena Smith Dayton , began experimenting with clay stop motion . She would release her first film in 1917 , an adaptation of William Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet . </P> <P> In the turn of the century , there was another well known animator known as Willis O ' Brien ( known by others as O'bie ) . His work on The Lost World ( 1925 ) is well known , but he is most admired for his work on King Kong ( 1933 ) , a milestone of his films made possible by stop motion animation . </P> <P> O'Brien's protege and eventual successor in Hollywood was Ray Harryhausen . After learning under O'Brien on the film Mighty Joe Young ( 1949 ) , Harryhausen would go on to create the effects for a string of successful and memorable films over the next three decades . These included The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms ( 1953 ) , It Came from Beneath the Sea ( 1955 ) , Jason and the Argonauts ( 1963 ) , The Golden Voyage of Sinbad ( 1973 ) and Clash of the Titans ( 1981 ) . </P> <P> In a 1940 promotional film , Autolite , an automotive parts supplier , featured stop motion animation of its products marching past Autolite factories to the tune of Franz Schubert 's Military March . An abbreviated version of this sequence was later used in television ads for Autolite , especially those on the 1950s CBS program Suspense , which Autolite sponsored . </P> <H3> 1960s and 1970s ( edit ) </H3> <P> In the 1960s and 1970s , independent clay animator Eliot Noyes Jr. refined the technique of `` free - form '' clay animation with his Oscar - nominated 1965 film Clay ( or the Origin of Species ) . Noyes also used stop motion to animate sand lying on glass for his musical animated film Sandman ( 1975 ) . </P> <P> Stop motion was used by Rankin / Bass Productions on some of their television programs and feature films including The New Adventures of Pinocchio ( 1960 -- 1961 ) , Willy McBean and his Magic Machine ( 1963 , 1965 ) and most notably seasonal / holiday favorites like Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer ( 1964 ) , Mad Monster Party ? ( 1966 , 1967 ) , The Little Drummer Boy ( 1968 ) , Santa Claus is Comin ' to Town ( 1970 ) and Here Comes Peter Cottontail ( 1971 ) . Under the name of `` Animagic '' , the stop motion works of Rankin / Bass were supervised by Tadahito Mochinaga at his MOM Production in Tokyo , Japan . </P> <P> In 1975 , filmmaker and clay animation experimenter Will Vinton joined with sculptor Bob Gardiner to create an experimental film called Closed Mondays which became the world 's first stop motion film to win an Oscar . Will Vinton followed with several other successful short film experiments including The Great Cognito , Creation , and Rip Van Winkle which were each nominated for Academy Awards . In 1977 , Vinton made a documentary about this process and his style of animation which he dubbed `` claymation '' ; he titled the documentary Claymation . Soon after this documentary , the term was trademarked by Vinton to differentiate his team 's work from others who had been , or were beginning to do , `` clay animation '' . While the word has stuck and is often used to describe clay animation and stop motion , it remains a trademark owned currently by Laika Entertainment , Inc . Twenty clay - animation episodes featuring the clown Mr. Bill were a feature of Saturday Night Live , starting from a first appearance in February 1976 . </P> <P> At very much the same time in the UK , Peter Lord and David Sproxton formed Aardman Animations . In 1976 they created the character Morph who appeared as an animated side - kick to the TV presenter Tony Hart on his BBC TV programme Take Hart . The five - inch - high presenter was made from a traditional British modelling clay called Plasticine . In 1977 they started on a series of animated films , again using modelling clay , but this time made for a more adult audience . The soundtrack for Down and Out was recorded in a Salvation Army Hostel and Plasticine puppets were animated to dramatise the dialogue . A second film , also for the BBC followed in 1978 . A TV series The Amazing Adventures of Morph was aired in 1980 . </P> <P> Sand - coated puppet animation was used in the Oscar - winning 1977 film The Sand Castle , produced by Dutch - Canadian animator Co Hoedeman . Hoedeman was one of dozens of animators sheltered by the National Film Board of Canada , a Canadian government film arts agency that had supported animators for decades . A pioneer of refined multiple stop motion films under the NFB banner was Norman McLaren , who brought in many other animators to create their own creatively controlled films . Notable among these are the pinscreen animation films of Jacques Drouin , made with the original pinscreen donated by Alexandre Alexeieff and Claire Parker . </P> <P> Italian stop motion films include Quaq Quao ( 1978 ) , by Francesco Misseri , which was stop motion with origami , The Red and the Blue and the clay animation kittens Mio and Mao . Other European productions included a stop motion - animated series of Tove Jansson 's The Moomins ( from 1979 , often referred to as `` The Fuzzy Felt Moomins '' ) , produced by Film Polski and Jupiter Films . </P> <P> One of the main British Animation teams , John Hardwick and Bob Bura , were the main animators in many early British TV shows , and are famous for their work on the Trumptonshire trilogy . </P> <P> Disney experimented with several stop motion techniques by hiring independent animator - director Mike Jittlov to do the first stop motion animation of Mickey Mouse toys ever produced for a short sequence called Mouse Mania , part of a TV special commemorating Mickey Mouse 's 50th Anniversary called Mickey 's 50 in 1978 . Jittlov again produced some impressive multi-technique stop motion animation a year later for a 1979 Disney special promoting their release of the feature film The Black Hole . Titled Major Effects , Jittlov 's work stood out as the best part of the special . Jittlov released his footage the following year to 16mm film collectors as a short film titled The Wizard of Speed and Time , along with four of his other short multi-technique animated films , most of which eventually evolved into his own feature - length film of the same title . Effectively demonstrating almost all animation techniques , as well as how he produced them , the film was released to theaters in 1987 and to video in 1989 . </P> <H3> 1980s to present ( edit ) </H3> Stefano Bessoni , Italian filmmaker , illustrator and stop - motion animator working on Gallows Songs ( 2014 ) <P> In the 1970s and 1980s , Industrial Light & Magic often used stop motion model animation for films such as the original Star Wars trilogy : the chess sequence in Star Wars , the Tauntauns and AT - AT walkers in The Empire Strikes Back , and the AT - ST walkers in Return of the Jedi were all stop motion animation , some of it using the Go films .

This day of nature 's equipoise was later sanctioned in a proclamation written by McConnell and signed by Secretary General U Thant at the United Nations . A month later a separate Earth Day was founded by United States Senator Gaylord Nelson as an environmental teach - in first held on April 22 , 1970 . Nelson was later awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom award in recognition of his work . While this April 22 Earth Day was focused on the United States , an organization launched by Denis Hayes , who was the original national coordinator in 1970 , took it international in 1990 and organized events in 141 nations . </P> <P> Numerous communities celebrate Earth Week , an entire week of activities focused on the environmental issues that the world faces . In 2017 , the March for Science occurred on Earth Day ( April 22 , 2017 ) and was followed by the People 's Climate Mobilization ( April 29 , 2017 ) . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Santa Barbara Oil Blowout 1969 </Li> <Li> 2 Santa Barbara 's Environmental Rights Day 1970 </Li> <Li> 3 Earth Day 1970 <Ul> <Li> 3.1 New York City </Li> <Li> 3.2 Philadelphia </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Earth Day 1990 </Li> <Li> 5 Earth Day 2000 </Li> <Li> 6 Subsequent Earth Day events </Li> <Li> 7 The Earth Day name </Li> <Li> 8 Earth Day Canada </Li> <Li> 9 History of the Equinox Earth Day ( March 20 ) </Li> <Li> 10 April 22 observances <Ul> <Li> 10.1 Growing eco-activism before Earth Day 1970 </Li> <Li> 10.2 Significance of April 22 </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 11 Earth Day songs </Li> <Li> 12 See also </Li> <Li> 13 References </Li> <Li> 14 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Santa Barbara oil blowout 1969 </H2> Main article : 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill <P> On January 28 , 1969 , a well drilled by Union Oil Platform A off the coast of Santa Barbara , California , blew out . More than three million gallons of oil spewed , killing over 10,000 seabirds , dolphins , seals , and sea lions . As a reaction to this natural disaster , activists were mobilized to create environmental regulation , environmental education , and Earth Day . Among the proponents of Earth Day were the people in the front lines of fighting this disaster , Selma Rubin , Marc McGinnes , and Bud Bottoms , founder of Get Oil Out . According to Kate Wheeling , Denis Hayes told her that Senator Gaylord Nelson from Wisconsin saw the Santa Barbara Channel 800 square - mile oil slick from an airplane , which gave him the impetus to organize Earth Day . </P> <H2> Santa Barbara 's environmental Rights Day 1970 </H2> <P> On the first anniversary of the oil blowout , January 28 , 1970 , Environmental Rights Day is celebrated , where the Declaration of Environmental Rights is read . It had been written by Rod Nash during a boat trip across the Santa Barbara Channel while carrying a copy of Thomas Jefferson 's Declaration of Independence . The organizers of Environmental Rights Day , led by Marc McGinnes , had been working closely over a period of several months with Congressman Pete McCloskey ( R - CA ) to consult on the creation of the National Environmental Policy Act , the first of many new environmental protection laws sparked by the national outcry about the blowout / oil spill and on the Declaration of Environmental Rights . Both McCloskey ( Earth Day co-chair with Senator Gaylord Nelson ) and Earth Day organizer Denis Hayes , along with Senator Alan Cranston , Paul Ehrlich , David Brower and other prominent leaders , endorsed the Declaration and spoke about it at the Environmental Rights Day conference . According to Francis Sarguis , `` the conference was sort of like the baptism for the movement . '' Nash , Garrett Hardin , McGinnes and others went on to develop the first undergraduate Environmental Studies program of its kind at the University of California at Santa Barbara . </P> <H2> Earth Day 1970 </H2> President Richard Nixon and First Lady Pat Nixon plant a tree on the White House South Lawn to recognize the first Earth Day . <P> The first Earth Day celebrations took place in two thousand colleges and universities , roughly ten thousand primary and secondary schools , and hundreds of communities across the United States . More importantly , it `` brought 20 million Americans out into the spring sunshine for peaceful demonstrations in favor of environmental reform . '' It now is observed in 192 countries , and coordinated by the nonprofit Earth Day Network , chaired by the first Earth Day 1970 organizer Denis Hayes , according to whom Earth Day is now `` the largest secular holiday in the world , celebrated by more than a billion people every year . '' Walt Kelly created an anti-pollution poster featuring his comic strip character Pogo with the quotation `` We have met the enemy and he is us '' to promote the 1970 Earth Day . Environmental groups have sought to make Earth Day into a day of action to change human behavior and provoke policy changes . </P> <H3> New York city </H3> <P> In the winter of 1969 -- 1970 , a group of students met at Columbia University to hear Denis Hayes talk about his plans for Earth Day . Among the group were Fred Kent , Pete Grannis , and Kristin and William Hubbard . This group agreed to head up the New York City activities within the national movement . Fred Kent took the lead in renting an office and recruiting volunteers . `` The big break came when Mayor Lindsay agreed to shut down Fifth Avenue for the event . A giant cheer went up in the office on that day , '' according to Kristin Hubbard ( now Kristin Alexandre ) . ' From that time on we used Mayor Lindsay 's offices and even his staff . I was Speaker Coordinator but had tremendous help from Lindsay staffer Judith Crichton . '' </P> U.S. Senator Edmund Muskie speaking at Fairmount Park , Philadelphia on Earth Day , 1970 <P> In addition to shutting down Fifth Avenue , Mayor John Lindsay made Central Park available for Earth Day . In Union Square , New York Times estimated crowds of up to 20,000 people at any given time and , perhaps , as many as over 100,000 over the course of the day . Since Manhattan was also the home of NBC , CBS , ABC , The New York Times , Time , and Newsweek , it provided the best possible anchor for national coverage from their reporters throughout the country . </P> <H3> Philadelphia </H3> <P> U.S. Senator Edmund Muskie was the keynote speaker on Earth Day in Fairmount Park in Philadelphia . Other notable attendees included consumer protection activist and presidential candidate Ralph Nader ; Landscape Architect Ian McHarg ; Nobel prize - winning Harvard Biochemist , George Wald ; U.S. Senate Minority Leader , Hugh Scott ; and poet , Allen Ginsberg . </P> <H2> Earth Day 1990 </H2> <P> Mobilizing 200 million people in 141 countries and lifting the status of environmental issues onto the world stage , Earth Day activities in 1990 gave a huge boost to recycling efforts worldwide and helped pave the way for the 1992 United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro . Unlike the first Earth Day in 1970 , this 20th Anniversary was waged with stronger marketing tools , greater access to television and radio , and multimillion - dollar budgets . </P> The official logo of the Mount Everest Earth Day 20 International Peace Climb <P> Two separate groups formed to sponsor Earth Day events in 1990 : The Earth Day 20 Foundation , assembled by Edward Furia ( Project Director of Earth Week in 1970 ) , and Earth Day 1990 , assembled by Denis Hayes ( National Coordinator for Earth Day 1970 ) . Senator Gaylord Nelson , the original founder of Earth Day , was honorary chairman for both groups . The two did not combine forces over disagreements about leadership of combined organization and incompatible structures and strategies . Among the disagreements , key Earth Day 20 Foundation organizers were critical of Earth Day 1990 for including on their board Hewlett - Packard , a company that at the time was the second - biggest emitter of chlorofluorocarbons in Silicon Valley and refused to switch to alternative solvents . In terms of marketing , Earth Day 20 had a grassroots approach to organizing and relied largely on locally based groups like the National Toxics Campaign , a Boston - based coalition of 1,000 local groups concerned with industrial pollution . Earth Day 1990 employed strategies including focus group testing , direct mail fund raising , and email marketing . </P> <P> The Earth Day 20 Foundation highlighted its April 22 activities in George , Washington , near the Columbia River with a live satellite phone call with members of the historic Earth Day 20 International Peace Climb who called from their base camp on Mount Everest to pledge their support for world peace and attention to environmental issues . The Earth Day 20 International Peace Climb was led by Jim Whittaker , the first American to summit Mt . Everest ( many years earlier ) , and marked the first time in history that mountaineers from the United States , Soviet Union , and China had roped together to climb a mountain , let alone Mt . Everest . The group also collected more than two tons of trash ( transported down the mountain by support groups along the way ) that was left behind on Mount Everest from previous climbing expeditions . The master of ceremonies for the Columbia Gorge event was the TV star , John Ratzenberger , from `` Cheers '' , and the headlining musician was the `` Father of Rock and Roll , '' Chuck Berry . </P> <P> Warner Bros. Records released an Earth Day - themed single in 1990 entitled `` Tomorrow 's World '' , written by Kix Brooks ( who would later become one - half of Brooks & Dunn ) and Pam Tillis . The song featured vocals from Lynn Anderson , Butch Baker , Shane Barmby , Billy Hill , Suzy Bogguss , Kix Brooks , T. Graham Brown , The Burch Sisters , Holly Dunn , Foster & Lloyd , Vince Gill , William Lee Golden , Highway 101 , Shelby Lynne , Johnny Rodriguez , Dan Seals , Les Taylor , Pam Tillis , Mac Wiseman , and Kevin Welch . It charted at number 74 on the Hot Country Songs chart dated May 5 , 1990 . </P> <H2> Earth Day 2000 </H2> <P> Earth Day 2000 combined the ambitious spirit of the first Earth Day with the international grassroots activism of Earth Day 1990 . This was the first year that Earth Day used the Internet as its principal organizing tool , and it proved invaluable nationally and internationally . Kelly Evans , a professional political organizer , served as executive director of the 2000 campaign . The event ultimately enlisted more than 5,000 environmental groups outside the United States , reaching hundreds of millions of people in a record 183 countries . Leonardo DiCaprio was the official host for the event , and about 400,000 participants stood in the cold rain during the course of the day . </P> <H2> Subsequent Earth Day events </H2> Earth Day 2007 at San Diego City College in San Diego , California <P> To turn Earth Day into a sustainable annual event rather than one that occurred every 10 yea\n\nQuestion:\nwhen did the first international earth day occur\n", "answer": "1990"}

The answer should be a number\n\nQuestion:\nwhen was mesh first used for hernia repair\n\nDocument:\nInguinal hernia surgery - wikipedia <H1> Inguinal hernia surgery </H1> Jump to : navigation , search Surgical repair of a right inguinal hernia <P> Inguinal hernia surgery refers to a surgical operation for the correction of an inguinal hernia . Surgery is not generally advised in most cases if the hernia produces no symptoms ; watchful waiting being the recommended option . In particular , elective surgery is no longer recommended for the treatment of minimally symptomatic hernias due to the significant risk ( > 10 % ) of chronic pain ( Post herniorraphy pain syndrome ) and the low risk of incarceration ( ca . 2 % per year ) . However , considering that the `` elective ( inguinal ) hernia surgery offers value - for - money '' and the `` symptoms will likely progress and an operation will be needed eventually '' , `` surgery might be superior to `` watchful waiting '' `` . </P> <P> As general advice in surgery , the choice of the surgeon and hospital are more important than the choice of a particular surgical technique or material . High - volume hospitals and surgeons have better outcomes . </P> <P> In particular for inguinal hernias , surgeons with more than 200 interventions per year are preferable . Regarding the surgical technique for inguinal hernias , laparoscopic is better than open repair . Anyway , an expert surgeon in open surgery is preferable to a non-expert one in laparoscopic surgery . In particular , `` recurrence rates with laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair are highly operator dependent '' . The learning curve for laparoscopic techniques has been estimated to be 50 - 100 interventions . However , at least the totally extra-peritoneal ( TEP ) hernia repair is safe when performed by supervised senior surgical trainees . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Mesh repairs <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Open repair ( Lichtenstein , Shouldice , Bassini ) </Li> <Li> 1.2 Laparoscopic repair </Li> <Li> 1.3 Meshes <Ul> <Li> 1.3. 1 Permanent mesh <Ul> <Li> 1.3. 1.1 Commercial mesh </Li> <Li> 1.3. 1.2 Mosquito - net mesh </Li> <Li> 1.3. 1.3 Complications </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 1.3. 2 Absorbable mesh </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Suture repairs <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Tension repairs <Ul> <Li> 2.1. 1 Bassini </Li> <Li> 2.1. 2 McVay / Cooper 's ligament </Li> <Li> 2.1. 3 Shouldice </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2.2 Tension - free repairs <Ul> <Li> 2.2. 1 Desarda </Li> <Li> 2.2. 2 Guarnieri </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Mesh repairs ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Open repair ( Lichtenstein , Shouldice , Bassini ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> The most commonly performed inguinal hernia repair today is the Lichtenstein repair . A flat mesh is placed on top of the defect . </P> <P> It is a `` tension - free '' repair that does not put tension on muscles , contrary to Bassini and Shouldice suture repairs ( but there are also tension - free suture repairs , like Desarda ) . It involves the placement of a mesh to strengthen the inguinal region . Patients typically go home within a few hours of surgery , often requiring no medication beyond paracetamol ( Tylenol / acetaminophen ) . Patients are encouraged to walk as soon as possible postoperatively , and they can usually resume most normal activities within a week or two of the operation . Complications include chronic pain ( varying from 6.9 to 11.7 % for expert surgeons and from 18.1 to 39.4 % for non-expert ones ) , foreign - body sensation , stiffness , ischemic orchitis , testicular atrophy , dysejaculation , anejaculation or painful ejaculation in around 12 % . They are often under - reported . Recurrence rate is low , < 2 %. . In contrast to this however , benefits for patients with pre-existing erectile dysfunction or general sexual dysfunctions have been reported . </P> <H3> Laparoscopic repair ( edit ) </H3> Intraoperative view by TEP Operation. 1 . Genital ramus of genitofemoral nerve . 2 . Preperitoneal lipom and spermatic cord . <P> There are two main methods of laparoscopic repair : transabdominal preperitoneal ( TAPP ) and totally extra-peritoneal ( TEP ) repair . When performed by a surgeon experienced in hernia repair , laparoscopic repair causes fewer complications than Lichtenstein , particularly less chronic pain . However , if the surgeon is experienced in general laparoscopic surgery but not in the specific subject of laparoscopic hernia surgery , laparoscopic repair is not advised as it causes more recurrence risk than Lichtenstein while also presenting risks of serious complications , as organ injury . Indeed , the TAPP approach needs to go through the abdomen . All that said , many surgeons are moving to laparoscopic methodologies as they cause smaller incisions , resulting in less bleeding , less infection , faster recovery , reduced hospitalization , and reduced chronic pain . </P> <Table> Laparoscopic mesh surgery , as compared to open mesh surgery <Tr> <Th> Advantages </Th> <Th> Disadvantages </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Quicker recovery </Li> <Li> Less pain during first days </Li> <Li> Fewer postoperative complications </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> such as infections , bleeding and seromas </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Less risk of chronic pain </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Needs surgeon highly experienced </Li> </Ul> <P> ( > 200 operations / year ) in inguinal hernia repairs </P> <Ul> <Li> Longer operating time </Li> <Li> Increased recurrence of primary hernias if </Li> </Ul> <P> surgeon not experienced enough </P> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> There is no difference in cost between laparoscopic and open repair as the increased costs of operation are offset by the decreased recovery period . Recurrence rates are identical when laparoscopy is performed by an experienced surgeon . When performed by a surgeon less experienced in inguinal hernia lap repair , recurrence is larger than after Lichtenstein . </P> <H3> Meshes ( edit ) </H3> Inguinal Hernia Patch . Animation in the reference . Permanent mesh ( edit ) Commercial mesh ( edit ) Polypropylene mesh used for inguinal hernia surgery <P> Commercial meshes are typically made of polypropylene or polyester . Marlex , Gore - Tex or Teflon meshes are sold by some companies . Lightweight meshes seem to cause less discomfort than heavyweight meshes . Some repair kits combine a plug and a patch . Some plug - and - patch kits combine an absorbable plug with a nonabsorbable patch , like Bio-A , manufactured by W.L. Gore & Associates . </P> Mosquito - net mesh ( edit ) <P> Meshes made of mosquito net cloth , in copolymer of polyethylene and polypropylene have been used for low - income patients in rural India and Ghana . Each piece costs $0.01 , 3700 times cheaper than an equivalent commercial mesh . They give results identical to commercial meshes in terms of infection and recurrence rate at 5 years . </P> <P> Therefore , it remains to be shown that despite their considerably higher cost , standard commercial meshes could offer any practical improvement over mosquito - net cloth in inguinal hernia surgery . </P> Complications ( edit ) See also : Post herniorraphy pain syndrome <P> Complications are frequent ( > 10 % ) . They include , but are not limited to : foreign - body sensation , chronic pain , ejaculation disorders , mesh migration , mesh folding ( meshoma ) , infection , adhesion formation , erosion into intraperitoneal organs . Such complications usually become apparent weeks to years after the initial repair , presenting as abscess , fistula , or bowel obstruction . </P> <P> In the long term , polypropylene meshes face degradation , due to heat effects . This increases the risk of stiffness and chronic pain . Persistent inflammation and increased cell turnover at the mesh - tissue interface raised the possibility of cancer transformation . </P> <P> Cases of obstructive azoospermia have been related with the use of polypropylene mesh , due to the obstruction of the vas deferens as a result of the fibroblastic reaction to the mesh . However , a recent study finds that this risk seems to be less than 1 % and therefore , it does not need to be notified in an informed consent . </P> Absorbable mesh ( edit ) Main article : Biomesh <P> Biomeshes are increasingly popular since their first use in 1999 and their subsequent introduction on the market in 2003 . Their use is an instance of regenerative medicine . Unlike synthetic non-absorbable meshes , they are absorbable , and can be used for repair in an infected environment , such as an incarcerated hernia . Moreover , they seem to improve comfort and presumably , they reduce the risk of inguinodynia . They have been tested after mesh - related inguinodynia . Some meshes have a price comparable to the high end of synthetic meshes , the cheapest ( $500 ) being Surgisis - Biodesign , manufactured by Cook Group , made from the extra cellular matrix of pig small intestinal submucosa . Currently , there exists one synthetic totally absorbable mesh , Tigr Matrix , manufactured by Novus Scientific , on the US market ( 510 ( k ) Food and Drug Administration clearance ) since 2010 and on the EU market since 2011 . It only has one 3 - year pre-clinical evidence on sheep . </P> <P> Though their benefit is not fully established yet , the market for biological meshes is exploding , and if the current trend is confirmed , they may replace synthetic meshes in the US by 2016 </P> <H2> Suture repairs ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Tension repairs ( edit ) </H3> Bassini ( edit ) Bassini technique , first suture. 1 . Aponeurosis musculi obliq . ext. ; 2 . Musculus obliquus internus ; 3 . Musculus transversalis ; 4 . Fascia transversalis ; 5 . Peritoneum ; 6 . Ligamentum inguinale . <P> The first efficient inguinal hernia repair was described by Edoardo Bassini in the 1880s . The Bassini technique is a `` tension '' repair , in which the edges of the defect are sewn back together , without any mesh . In the Bassini technique , the conjoint tendon ( formed by the distal ends of the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles ) is approximated to the inguinal ligament and closed . Today , Bassini 's main interest is historical . It remains performed in some developing countries , if surgeons do not have knowledge of the mosquito - net alternative to commercial meshes in Lichtenstein repair , or if they ignore more efficient suture - based repairs . </P> McVay / Cooper 's ligament ( edit ) <P> The floor of the canal is reinforced by approximating the transversus abdominal aponeurosis and transverse fascia to pectineal ( Cooper 's ) ligament medially from the pubic tubercle to the femoral vein . Lateral to this the floor is restored by approximating the femoral sheath to the inguinal ligament .

The 1974 television film called Wonder Woman directed by Vincent McEveety and starring Cathy Lee Crosby , was a pilot for an intended television series being considered by ABC . Ratings were described as `` respectable but not exactly wondrous , '' and ABC did not pick up the pilot . Instead , Warner Bros. and ABC developed the 1975 television series , Wonder Woman , that fit the more traditional presentation of the character as created by William Moulton Marston , turning away from the 1968 -- 72 era that had influenced the pilot . Wonder Woman , which premiered in 1975 , starred Lynda Carter and eventually led to the full series .

Keen to make a distinction from the last pilot , producers gave the pilot the rather paradoxical title The New Original Wonder Woman . Scripting duties were given to Stanley Ralph Ross , who was instructed to be more faithful to the comic book and to create a subtle `` high comedy . '' Ross set the pilot in World War II , the era in which the original comic book began . </P> <P> After an intensive talent search , Lynda Carter , who had had a handful of minor acting roles and had been the 1972 Miss World USA and a Bob Hope USO cast member , was chosen for the lead role . For the role of Steve Trevor , the producers chose Lyle Waggoner , despite his dark brown , almost - black , hair not matching the comic 's blond Trevor , who at the time was better known as a comedic actor after several years co-starring in The Carol Burnett Show . He was also known to Ross as having been one of the leading candidates to play Batman a decade earlier , but instead Adam West was signed . Waggoner was also considered a pin - up hunk , having done a semi-nude pictorial in the first issue of Playgirl . </P> <P> Although the pilot followed the original comic book closely , in particular the aspect of Wonder Woman joining the military under the name Diana Prince , a number of elements were dropped . It mainly omitted Diana 's origin , including her birth on Paradise Island . The comic book Diana obtains the credentials of a look - alike nurse . Although the pilot shows Diana briefly as a nurse at one point , Diana takes on the identity of a Navy Yeoman Petty Officer First Class . </P> <P> One change , which was later to become synonymous with the show , was the transformation of Diana Prince into Wonder Woman by spinning . During the filming of the pilot , producers were trying to figure out a way to show how Diana Prince became Wonder Woman , when Carter suggested that she do a spin . </P> <P> Unlike the earlier pilot , the comic - book origins of the character were emphasized by the retention of the character 's traditional uniform ( the design of which was interpreted and executed by Donald Lee Feld , credited as `` Donfeld '' ) with the original setting and through the use of comic book elements . The series 's title sequence was animated in the form of a series of comic book panels featuring Wonder Woman performing a variety of heroic feats . Within the show , location and exposition were handled through comic book - style text panels . Transitions between scenes and commercial breaks were marked by animated starburst sequences . </P> Synopsis ( edit ) <P> In early 1942 , during the Second World War , American pilot Major Steve Trevor ( Waggoner ) bails out during an air battle over the Bermuda Triangle , location of Paradise Island . The island is home to the Amazons : beautiful , ageless women with great strength , agility , and intelligence . Amazon princess Diana ( Carter ) rescues the handsome unconscious Trevor and helps nurse him back to health . Her mother , the Amazon queen ( Cloris Leachman ; succeeded by Carolyn Jones and Beatrice Straight in later episodes ) , decrees that Olympic - style games shall be held to select one Amazon to return Trevor back to America . But she forbids her own daughter Diana , the princess , to participate . Diana states that since she is not allowed to participate , she does not want to be present for the games and will take a retreat to the other side of the island . The games are held with participants wearing masks and numbers , shown as Roman numerals in triangles on white sleeveless short tunic - dresses . Among the contestants is a blonde Amazon . During the events , the blonde Amazon shows exceptional skills and she ties for first with another Amazon . To break the deadlock , the `` bullets and bracelets '' event is decided as the tiebreaker , wherein each of the women takes turns shooting at the other ; the one being shot at must deflect the bullets with her bulletproof bracelets . The blond woman wins the event , superficially injuring her opponent 's arm . When she is pronounced the winner , she removes her mask and wig and reveals that she is Diana . Her mother , though initially shocked , relents and allows her to go to America . </P> <P> Diana 's uniform as Wonder Woman , designed by Queen Hippolyta , features emblems of America , the land to which she will be returning Steve Trevor . A golden belt will be the source of her strength and power while away from Paradise Island . She has her bullet - deflecting bracelets and also receives a golden lasso which is unbreakable and forces people to obey and tell the truth when bound with it . As shown later in flashback , Hippolyta also teaches Diana how to transform her clothes magically into the uniform . </P> <P> Diana , as Wonder Woman , flies to Washington , D.C. in an invisible plane . After dropping Trevor off at a hospital , the heroine stumbles upon a bank robbery , which she stops . A theatrical agent who sees her in action offers to help make her bullets and bracelets act a stage attraction . Diana is hesitant , but needing money in this new society , she agrees . </P> <P> Meanwhile , Trevor 's civilian secretary Marcia ( Stella Stevens ) is a double agent for the Nazi Fifth Columnists . She seeks to aid top spies in killing Trevor and opposing this new threat , Wonder Woman . Her first attempt is arranging for an accomplice to fire a machine gun at Wonder Woman during her stage act . Later , as spy activities increase , Trevor leaves the hospital but gets in a fight and is captured , prompting his `` nurse '' Diana to come to his rescue . Wonder Woman defeats Marcia in an extended fight sequence in the War Department . Having defeated Marcia , Wonder Woman thwarts a Nazi pilot who had plans to bomb the Brooklyn Navy Yard by using her invisible plane , and she rescues Trevor . With Marcia and the spy ring defeated , the film closes as Trevor and Brigadier General Blankenship talk about Trevor 's new secretary whom Blankenship selected not only for her outstanding clerical test scores , but her decidedly plain appearance in contrast to Marcia : the bespectacled Yeoman First Class Diana Prince USNR ( WR ) , Wonder Woman in disguise . </P> <H3> Season 1 ( edit ) </H3> <P> The pilot film aired on November 7 , 1975 , was a ratings success , and ABC quickly authorized the production of two one - hour specials which aired in April 1976 . These three productions would later be considered part of the show 's first season . The episodes scored strong ratings , and ABC ordered an additional 11 episodes for the new 1976 -- 77 TV season . The network began airing the episodes every few weeks apart at the beginning of the TV season in September 1976 . After mid-December 1976 , episodes aired on a weekly basis until mid-February 1977 . </P> <P> A few cast changes were made between the specials and the series . Former Happy Days recurring actress Beatrice Colen joined the cast as Corporal Etta Candy WAAC , General Blankenship 's secretary , thereby providing YN1 Prince with a subordinate . Three episodes featured Debra Winger as Diana 's younger sister , Drusilla , a.k.a. Wonder Girl , in one of her earliest acting roles . </P> <P> One of the most memorable aspects of the show that was developed during the first season was the transformation sequence that changed Diana Prince into her superheroine alter ego . The sequence in the original specials employed a slow fade between two synchronized shots , both filmed with an overcranked camera to create a slow motion effect . A twirling Diana Prince 's hair would fall loose as the shot transitioned to a twirling Wonder Woman holding her Diana clothes , which she would stow nearby in a closet or locker . ( How she changes back to Diana is never shown , although presumably she must return to the location to retrieve her clothes . ) To ensure both segments transitioned smoothly the camera was locked off ( secured in place ) while Carter 's clothing , make - up , and hair was altered between identities , a process Carter said on a DVD commentary typically took about 45 minutes . The spinning transformation was later incorporated into the comics and into animated appearances such as Justice League Unlimited . ( Prior to the series in which Carter starred , the transformation was depicted in the comics by way of Diana spinning her magic lasso around her body , with the lasso changing her clothes , or by simply changing at super-human speed . ) </P> <P> The iconic explosion overlay most associated with the TV show was introduced after the third episode to mask the cut point between the Diana and Wonder Woman clips , meaning they no longer needed to be perfectly aligned .

The term ZIP is an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan ; it was chosen to suggest that the mail travels more efficiently and quickly ( zipping along ) when senders use the code in the postal address . The basic format consists of five digits . An extended ' ZIP + 4 ' code was introduced in 1983 which includes the five digits of the ZIP Code , followed by a hyphen and four additional digits that determine a more specific location . </P> <P> The term ZIP Code was originally registered as a servicemark by the U.S. Postal Service , but its registration has since expired . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Early history and five - digit ZIP Codes </Li> <Li> 1.2 ZIP + 4 </Li> <Li> 1.3 Postal bar code </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Structure and allocation <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Scope and international mail </Li> <Li> 2.2 By type and use </Li> <Li> 2.3 By geography <Ul> <Li> 2.3. 1 Primary state prefixes </Li> <Li> 2.3. 2 Secondary regional prefixes ( 123xx ) and local ZIP Codes ( 12345 ) </Li> <Li> 2.3. 3 ZIP Codes and previous zoning lines </Li> <Li> 2.3. 4 Division and reallocation of ZIP codes </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Other uses <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Delivery services </Li> <Li> 3.2 Statistics </Li> <Li> 3.3 Marketing </Li> <Li> 3.4 Legislative districts </Li> <Li> 3.5 Internet </Li> <Li> 3.6 Credit card security </Li> <Li> 3.7 Insurance rating </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Early History and five - digit ZIP Codes ( edit ) </H3> A 1963 U.S. Post Office sign <P> The early history and context of postal codes began with postal district / zone numbers . The United States Post Office Department ( USPOD ) implemented postal zones for numerous large cities in 1943 . For example : </P> <P> Mr. John Smith </P> <P> 3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue </P> Minneapolis 16 , Minnesota <P> The `` 16 '' was the number of the postal zone from the specific city . </P> <P> By the early 1960s , a more organized system was needed , and non-mandatory five - digit ZIP Codes were introduced nationwide on July 1 , 1963 . The USPOD issued its Publication 59 : Abbreviations for Use with ZIP Code on October 1 , 1963 , with the list of two - letter state abbreviations which are generally written with both letters capitalized . An earlier list in June had proposed capitalized abbreviations ranging from two to five letters . According to Publication 59 , the two - letter standard was `` based on a maximum 23 - position line , because this has been found to be the most universally acceptable line capacity basis for major addressing systems '' , which would be exceeded by a long city name combined with a multi-letter state abbreviation , such as `` Sacramento , Calif . '' along with the ZIP Code . The abbreviations have remained unchanged , with the exception of Nebraska , which was changed from NB to NE in 1969 at the request of the Canadian postal administration , to avoid confusion with the Canadian province of New Brunswick . </P> <P> Robert Moon is considered the father of the ZIP Code ; he submitted his proposal in 1944 while working as a postal inspector . The post office only credits Moon with the first three digits of the ZIP Code , which describe the sectional center facility ( SCF ) or `` sec center . '' An SCF is a central mail processing facility with those three digits . The SCF sorts mail to all post offices with those first three digits in their ZIP Codes . The mail is sorted according to the final two digits of the ZIP Code and sent to the corresponding post offices in the early morning . Sectional centers do not deliver mail and are not open to the public ( though the building may include a post office open to the public ) , and most of their employees work night shift . Mail picked up at post offices is sent to their own SCF in the afternoon , where the mail is sorted overnight . In the cases of large cities , the last two digits coincide with the older postal zone number thus : </P> <P> Mr. John Smith </P> <P> 3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue </P> Minneapolis , MN 55416 <P> In 1967 , these became mandatory for second and third - class bulk mailers , and the system was soon adopted generally . The United States Post Office used a cartoon character which it called Mr. ZIP to promote the use of the ZIP Code . He was often depicted with a legend such as `` USE ZIP CODE '' in the selvage of panes of postage stamps or on the covers of booklet panes of stamps . </P> <P> In 1971 Elmira ( NY ) Star Gazette reporter Dick Baumbach found out the White House was not using a zip code on its envelopes . Herb Klein , special assistant to President Nixon , responded by saying the next printing of envelopes would include the zip code . That did occur . </P> <H3> ZIP + 4 ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1983 , the U.S. Postal Service introduced an expanded ZIP Code system that it called ZIP + 4 , often called `` plus - four codes '' , `` add - on codes '' , or `` add - ons '' . A ZIP + 4 Code uses the basic five - digit code plus four additional digits to identify a geographic segment within the five - digit delivery area , such as a city block , a group of apartments , an individual high - volume receiver of mail , a post office box , or any other unit that could use an extra identifier to aid in efficient mail sorting and delivery . However , initial attempts to promote universal use of the new format met with public resistance and today the plus - four code is not required . In general , mail is read by a multiline optical character reader ( MLOCR ) that almost instantly determines the correct ZIP + 4 Code from the address -- along with the even more specific delivery point -- and sprays an Intelligent Mail barcode ( IM ) on the face of the mail piece that corresponds to 11 digits -- nine for the ZIP + 4 Code and two for the delivery point . </P> <P> For Post Office Boxes , the general ( but not invariable ) rule is that each box has its own ZIP + 4 code . The add - on code is often one of the following : the last four digits of the box number ( e.g. PO Box 107050 , Albany , NY 12201 - 7050 ) , zero plus the last three digits of the box number ( e.g. , PO Box 17727 , Eagle River , AK 99577 - 0727 ) , or , if the box number consists of fewer than four digits , enough zeros are attached to the front of the box number to produce a four - digit number ( e.g. , PO Box 77 , Juneau , AK 99750 - 0077 ) . However , there is no uniform rule , so the ZIP + 4 Code must be looked up individually for each box . </P> <H3> Postal bar Code ( edit ) </H3> <P> The ZIP Code is often translated into an Intelligent Mail barcode that is printed on the mailpiece to make it easier for automated machines to sort . A barcode can be printed by the sender ( some word - processing programs such as WordPerfect and Microsoft Word include the feature - but is not recommended as the address to ZIP lookup tables can be significantly out of date ) . It is better to let the post office put one on when it processes the piece . In general , the post office uses OCR technology , though in some cases a human might have to read and enter the address . </P> <P> Customers who send bulk mail can get a discount on postage if they have printed the barcode themselves and have presorted the mail . This requires more than just a simple font ; mailing lists must be standardized with up - to - date Coding Accuracy Support System ( CASS ) - certified software that adds and verifies a full , correct ZIP + 4 Code and an additional two digits representing the exact delivery point . Furthermore , mail must be sorted in a specific manner to an 11 digit zip with at least 150 mailpieces for each qualifying ZIP code and must be accompanied by documentation confirming this . These steps are usually done with PAVE - certified software that also prints the barcoded address labels and the barcoded sack or tray tags . </P> <P> This means that every single mailable point in the country has its own 12 - digit number ( at least in theory ) . The delivery - point digits ( the 10th and 11th digits ) are calculated based on the primary or secondary number of the address . The USPS publishes the rules for calculating the delivery point in a document called the CASS Technical Guide . However , when confronted with two addresses like 18 and 18C , often CASS will assign the same 12 - digit number to two distinct mail delivery points . The last digit is always a check digit , which is obtained by summing all 5 , 9 or 11 digits , taking the residue modulo 10 of this sum ( i.e. , the remainder after dividing by 10 ) and finally subtracting this from 10 . ( Thus , the check digit for 10001 - 0001 00 would be 7 , since 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 , 3 \u2261 3 ( mod 10 ) and 10 -- 3 = 7 . ) </P> <H2> Structure and allocation ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Scope and international mail ( edit ) </H3> <P> ZIP Codes designate delivery points within the United States ( including territories ) , and overseas stations of its armed forces . There are also ZIP Codes for independent countries of the Federated States of Micronesia , the Republic of the Marshall Islands , and the Republic of Palau , each of which is integrated into the U.S. postal system under a Compact of Free Association . </P> <P> Mail to U.S. diplomatic missions overseas is addressed as if it were addressed to a street address in Washington , D.C. The four - digit diplomatic pouch number is used as a building number , while the city in which the embassy or consulate is located is combined with the word `` Place '' to form a street name . Each mission uses a ZIP + 4 Code consisting of 20521 and the diplomatic pouch number . For example , the mailing address of the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi , India would be : </P> <P> Embassy of the United States of America </P> <P> 9000 New Delhi Place </P> Washington , DC 20521 - 9000 <H3> By type and use ( edit ) </H3> U.S. postage stamp , 1973 : `` It all depends on ZIP Code '' <P> There are four types of ZIP Codes : </P> <Ul> <Li> Unique : assigned to a single high - volume address </Li> <Li> Post Office Box only : used only for PO Boxes at a given facility , not for any other type of delivery </Li> <Li> Military : used to route mail for the U.S. military </Li> <Li> Standard : all other ZIP Codes . </Li> </Ul> <P> Unique ZIP Codes are used for governmental agencies , universities , businesses , or buildings that receive such extremely high volumes of mail that they need their own ZIP Codes . Government examples include 20505 for the Central Intelligence Agency in Washington , D.C. ; 81009 for the Federal Citizen Information Center of the U.S. General Services Administration ( GSA ) in Pueblo , Colorado . Examples of private address unique ZIP Codes include the headquarters of Wal - Mart ( 72716 ) . </P> <P> An example of a PO Box only ZIP Code is 22313 , which is used for PO Boxes at the main post office in Alexandria , Virginia , such as those used by the United States Patent and Trademark Office . In the area surrounding that post office , home and business mail delivery addresses use ZIP Code 22314 , which is thus a Standard ZIP Code . </P> <P> In certain exceptional cases , a nominally Standard - type ZIP Code may , in practice , be used as one of the three other types . For example , the ZIP Code 43210 in Columbus , Ohio is listed as a Standard - type ZIP Code . However , since its geographic boundaries are essentially coterminous with those of The Ohio State University 's main campus , it is effectively exclusive to the university even though it is not officially a `` Unique '' - type ZIP code . </P> <H3> By geography ( edit ) </H3> Primary state prefixes ( edit ) <P> ZIP Codes are numbered with the first digit representing a certain group of U.S. states , the second and third digits together representing a region in that group ( or perhaps a large city ) and the fourth and fifth digits representing a group of delivery addresses within that region . The main town in a region ( if applicable ) often gets the first ZIP Codes for that region ; afterward , the numerical order often follows the alphabetical order . Because ZIP Codes are intended for efficient postal delivery , there are unusual cases where a ZIP Code crosses state boundaries , such as a military facility spanning multiple states or remote areas of one state most easily serviced from a bordering state . For example , ZIP Code 42223 serves Fort Campbell , which spans Christian County , Kentucky and Montgomery County , Tennessee , and ZIP Code 97635 includes portions of Lake County , Oregon and Modoc County , California . </P> <P> In general , the first three digits designate a sectional center facility , the mail sorting and distribution center for an area . A sectional center facility may have more than one three - digit code assigned to it . For example , the Northern Virginia sectional center facility in Merrifield is assigned codes 220 , 221 , 222 and 223 . In some cases , a sectional center facility may serve an area in an adjacent state , usually due to the lack of a proper location for a center in that region . For example , 739 in Oklahoma is assigned to Liberal , Kansas ; 865 in Arizona is assigned to Gallup , New Mexico ; and 961 in California to Reno , Nevada . </P> <P> In terms of geographic location , many of the lowest ZIP Codes , which begin with ' 0 ' , are in the New England region . Also in the ' 0 ' region are New Jersey ( non-contiguous with the remainder of the ' 0 ' area ) , Puerto Rico , the \n", "answer": "1963"}

One of the two parties typically holds a majority in the legislature and is usually referred to as the majority or governing party while the other is the minority or opposition party . Around the world , the term has different senses . For example , in the United States , Jamaica , and Malta , the sense of two party system describes an arrangement in which all or nearly all elected officials belong to one of the only two major parties , and third parties rarely win any seats in the legislature . In such arrangements , two - party systems are thought to result from various factors like winner takes all election rules . In such systems , while chances for third party candidates winning election to major national office are remote , it is possible for groups within the larger parties , or in opposition to one or both of them , to exert influence on the two major parties . In contrast , in the United Kingdom and Australia and in other parliamentary systems and elsewhere , the term two - party system is sometimes used to indicate an arrangement in which two major parties dominate elections but in which there are viable third parties which do win seats in the legislature , and in which the two major parties exert proportionately greater influence than their percentage of votes would suggest . </P> <P> Explanations for why a country with free elections may evolve into a two - party system have been debated . A leading theory , referred to as Duverger 's law , states that two parties are a natural result of a winner - take - all voting system . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Examples <Ul> <Li> 1.1 United States </Li> <Li> 1.2 Commonwealth countries </Li> <Li> 1.3 India </Li> <Li> 1.4 Malta </Li> <Li> 1.5 Other examples </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Comparisons with other party systems </Li> <Li> 3 Causes </Li> <Li> 4 Third parties </Li> <Li> 5 Advantages </Li> <Li> 6 Disadvantages </Li> <Li> 7 History <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Beginnings of parties in Britain </Li> <Li> 7.2 Emergence of the two - party system in Britain </Li> <Li> 7.3 History of American political parties </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 See also </Li> <Li> 9 References </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Examples ( edit ) </H2> <H3> United States ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

( November 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> There is general agreement that the United States has a two - party system ; historically , there have been few instances in which third party candidates won an election . In the First Party System , only Alexander Hamilton 's Federalist Party and Thomas Jefferson 's Democratic - Republican Party were significant political parties . Toward the end of the First Party System , the Republicans dominated a one - party system ( primarily under the Presidency of James Monroe ) . Under the Second Party System , the Democratic - Republican Party split during the election of 1824 into Adams ' Men and Jackson 's Men . In 1828 , the modern Democratic Party formed in support of Andrew Jackson . The National Republicans were formed in support of John Quincy Adams . After the National Republicans collapsed , the Whig Party and the Free Soil Party quickly formed and collapsed . In 1854 , the modern Republican Party formed from a loose coalition of former Whigs , Free Soilers and other anti-slavery activists . Abraham Lincoln became the first Republican president in 1860 . </P> <P> During the Third Party System , the Republican Party was the dominant political faction , but the Democrats held a strong , loyal coalition in the Solid South . During the Fourth Party System , the Republicans remained the dominant Presidential party , although Democrats Grover Cleveland and Woodrow Wilson were both elected to two terms . In 1932 , at the onset of the Fifth Party System , Democrats took firm control of national politics with the landslide victories of Franklin D. Roosevelt in four consecutive elections . Other than the two terms of Republican Dwight Eisenhower from 1953 to 1961 , Democrats retained firm control of the Presidency until the mid-1960s . Since the mid-1960s , despite a number of landslides ( such as Richard Nixon carrying 49 states and 61 % of the popular vote over George McGovern in 1972 ; Ronald Reagan carrying 49 states and 58 % of the popular vote over Walter Mondale in 1984 ) , Presidential elections have been competitive between the predominant Republican and Democratic parties and no one party has been able to hold the Presidency for more than three consecutive terms , except for the elections from 1932 through 1948 when FDR won 4 elections and Truman one , both as Democrats . In the election of 2012 , only 4 % separated the popular vote between Barack Obama ( 51 % ) and Mitt Romney ( 47 % ) , although Obama won the electoral vote by a landslide ( 332 -- 206 ) . </P> <P> Throughout every American party system , no third party has won a Presidential election or majorities in either house of Congress . Despite that , third parties and third party candidates have gained traction and support . In the election of 1912 , Theodore Roosevelt won 27 % of the popular vote and 88 electoral votes running as a Progressive . In the 1992 Presidential election , Ross Perot won 19 % of the popular vote but no electoral votes running as an Independent . </P> <H3> Commonwealth countries ( edit ) </H3> <P> In countries such as Britain , two major parties emerge which have strong influence and tend to elect most of the candidates , but a multitude of lesser parties exist with varying degrees of influence , and sometimes these lesser parties are able to elect officials who participate in the legislature . In political systems based on the Westminster system , which is a particular style of parliamentary democracy based on the British model and found in many commonwealth countries , a majority party will form the government and the minority party will form the opposition , and coalitions of lesser parties are possible ; in the rare circumstance in which neither party is the majority , a hung parliament arises . Sometimes these systems are described as two - party systems but they are usually referred to as multi-party systems . There is not always a sharp boundary between a two - party system and a multi-party system . </P> <P> Generally , a two - party system becomes a dichotomous division of the political spectrum with an ostensibly right - wing and left - wing party : the Nationalist Party vs. the Labour Party in Malta , Labor vs. Liberal / National Coalition in Australia , Republicans vs. Democrats in the United States and the Conservative Party vs. the Labour Party in the United Kingdom . </P> <P> Other parties in these countries may have seen candidates elected to local or subnational office , however . Historian John Hicks claims that the United States has never possessed for any considerable period of time the two party system in its pure and undefiled form . </P> <P> In some governments , certain chambers may resemble a two - party system and others a multi-party system . For example , the politics of Australia are largely two - party ( the Liberal / National Coalition is often considered a single party at a national level due to their long - standing alliance in forming government and additionally rarely compete for the same seat ) for the Australian House of Representatives , which is elected by instant - runoff voting , known within Australia as preferential voting . However , third parties are more common in the Australian Senate , which uses a proportional voting system more amenable to minor parties . </P> <P> In the politics of Canada , while having a multiparty system federally and in the largest provinces of Ontario , Quebec and Alberta , many of the provinces have effectively become two - party systems in which only two parties regularly get members elected . Examples include British Columbia ( where the battles are between the New Democratic Party and the BC Liberals ) , Saskatchewan ( between the Saskatchewan Party and New Democratic Party ) , New Brunswick ( between the Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives ) and Prince Edward Island ( between Liberals and Progressive Conservatives ) . </P> <H3> India ( edit ) </H3> <P> India also shows characteristics of a two party system with the United Progressive Alliance ( UPA ) and National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ) as the two main players . It is to be noted that both UPA and NDA are not two political parties but alliances of several smaller parties . Other smaller parties not aligned with either NDA or UPA exist , and overall command about 20 % of the 2009 seats in the Lok Sabha and had further increased to 28 % in 2014 general elections </P> <H3> Malta ( edit ) </H3> <P> Malta is somewhat unusual in that while the electoral system is single transferable vote ( STV ) , traditionally associated with proportional representation , minor parties have not earned much success . Politics is dominated between the centre - left Labour Party and the centre - right Nationalist Party , with no third parties winning seats in Parliament between 1962 and 2017 . </P> <H3> Other examples ( edit ) </H3> <P> The English speaking countries of the Caribbean while inheriting their basic political system from Great Britain have become two party systems . The politics of Jamaica are between the People 's National Party and the Jamaica Labour Party . The politics of Guyana are between the People 's Progressive Party and APNU which is actually a coalition of smaller parties . The politics of Trinidad and Tobago are between the People 's National Movement and the People 's Partnership which is also a coalition . The Politics of Belize are between the United Democratic Party and the People 's United Party . The Politics of the Bahamas are between the Progressive Liberal Party and the Free National Movement . The politics of Barbados are between the Democratic Labour Party and the Barbados Labour Party . </P> <P> The politics of Zimbabwe are effec\n", "answer": "1824"}

She has flashbacks to her troubled childhood in the small town of Wind Gap , Missouri . Her editor , Frank Curry , orders her to return to Wind Gap , where a 13 - year old girl , Ann Nash , was murdered the previous summer , and another , 14 - year - old Natalie Keene , is missing . Camille 's flashbacks intensify when she returns and after a couple days , she goes to live with her socialite mother , Adora Crellin , stepfather , and half - sister , teenager Amma . She meets Detective Richard Willis during a search party . She then talks with Bob Nash about the disappearance of his daughter . Later that day Natalie Keene 's body is discovered in the alley behind the police station . Amma and Camille talk about their middle sister Marian , who had died when Camille was younger , and Amma secretly admits to disliking her mother 's treatment of her and behaves like a child to hide her rebellious side .

Camille sees Richard taking soil samples from Bob Nash 's tires . Adora , who has kept Marian 's room like a shrine , continues to belittle Camille , whom she accuses of embarrassing the family through her investigation . Camille thinks Natalie 's older brother , high school senior John , stands out in Wind Gap , and is told by neighborhood kids that `` The Woman in White '' took Natalie . Police Chief Bill Vickery implies that the boy who saw this is `` trash '' and ca n't be trusted . Camille says they used to scare each other with stories about the Woman in White abducting children but Vickery and Richard insist that Natalie and Ann were murdered by a man .

In the present , Camille interviews Bob Nash , who thinks John Keene was involved . Vickery calls Adora , who arrives and rebukes Camille while comforting Bob . Later , John Keene accuses Bob Nash of being involved . John 's girlfriend , Ashley Wheeler , is one of the few people friendly to Camille . After a conversation between Adora and Vickery , Adora warns Amma about Camille and that she is dangerous . Richard is frustrated by lack of cooperation from the public in Wind Gap and by Vickery belittling his belief that the murderer is from within the town . He tells Camille to stay out of his way .

A flashback shows Camille as a cheerleader being chased by a group of boys before seemingly being raped ; but in the present day asks Richard to sexually please her which he does and the two kiss afterwards . Amma is revealed to have created nasty posters of John Keene who is soon fired from his job at Adora 's hog factory because of his reputation . As Calhoun Day approaches , Amma practices for a play and flirts with her teacher privately . Alan snaps at Adora who soon talks with Camille about her disappointment that Camille went against her mother as a teenager before finally informing her that she smells `` ripe '' .

Created by Thom Racina and Leah Laiman , he is most notably played by Daytime Emmy Award - winning actor Steve Burton , who joined the cast in 1991 and vacated the role in 2012 . Burton reprised the role in 2017 . Jason was born offscreen in September 1981 and the character made his onscreen debut in November 1981 as the son of Dr. Alan Quartermaine ( Stuart Damon ) and his mistress , Susan Moore ( Gail Ramsey ) , later adopted by Alan 's wife Dr. Monica Quartermaine ( Leslie Charleson ) . As one of the longest - running characters on the show , the role was played by various child actors from 1982 to 1986 . In 2014 , Billy Miller was cast in the role ; Miller 's casting was later retconned as Jason 's twin - brother , Andrew Cain . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Development <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Casting </Li> <Li> 1.2 Characterization </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Storylines <Ul> <Li> 2.1 1980s </Li> <Li> 2.2 1990s </Li> <Li> 2.3 2000s </Li> <Li> 2.4 2010s </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Reception </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Development ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Casting ( edit ) </H3> <P> The role was originated on November 11 , 1981 , by Quinn Carlson until June 3 , 1982 . Child actor Bryan Beck stepped into the role on September 8 , 1982 to 1986 . </P> <P> On December 19 , 1991 , Burton stepped into the role on a contractual basis as a SORASed Jason Quartermaine . In November 1999 , ABC confirmed that Burton had decided not to renew his contract which expired in December to pursue other opportunities . Burton last appeared on contract on January 27 , 2000 . In June 2000 , ABC confirmed that Burton would reprise his role for a six - week stint starting on August 25 , 2000 until he last appeared on October 10 , 2000 . In December 2000 , it was announced that Burton would return to the series once again and began airing on January 29 , 2001 . In January 2001 , Burton announced that his return was only temporary due to his commitment to film a pilot for his DreamWorks Television development deal . Whether he returned to the role full - time would depend on whether the series was picked up . The pilot was not picked up , Burton landed a role in a major motion picture leading to his departure on April 29 , 2001 . Burton returned to the series on contract in 2002 during May Sweeps . </P> <P> In late 2008 , Burton 's contract expired and forcing to make a decision on re-signing with the show . After months of speculation , he announced in a public appearance that he re-signed with the show . Burton stated that he would be willing to take a pay cut because he understands that money is a lot tighter now than it has been in recent years and stated that he is blessed to have a job right now . In 2011 , rumors began circulating that Burton could depart from the series due to contract negotiations . However , in May 2011 Burton announced via Twitter that he had re-signed with the series again . On August 23 , 2012 , Jamey Giddens of the website Daytime Confidential reported that contract negotiations were not going well and Burton was close to walking away from the series . On August 28 , 2012 , Burton confirmed in an interview with TV Guide 's Michael Logan that he would exit the series and agreed to stay long enough for the producers to write his character out properly . Following the announcement that Sean Kanan ( A.J. Quartermaine ) was returning to the series in an undisclosed role , rumors began circulating that Kanan might be a recast of Jason . Kanan 's resemblance to Burton fed into the rumors . </P> <P> On September 2 , 2014 , executive producer Frank Valentini announced on Twitter that former All My Children and The Young and the Restless actor Billy Miller would join the cast as Jason . On September 30 , 2014 , Miller 's air date as Jason was revealed to be on October 1 . </P> <P> In June 2017 , it was announced that Burton would return to the series in an undisclosed role , later referred to as `` Patient 6 . '' In November 2017 , it was announced that Burton had reprised the role of Jason , while Miller 's casting was retconned to the character of Andrew Cain . </P> <H3> Characterization ( edit ) </H3> `` I guess the writers started seeing something that was happening and they had the idea of making me a new character and basically starting from scratch . It has been a great journey for me as an actor and for me , personally . '' -- Burton on Jason Morgan <P> Steve Burton 's early years on the soap as the `` rich , wholesome preppy '' Jason Quartermaine would come to a shocking , and dramatic end in 1995 after a car accident caused by his brother , A.J. leaves the character as a brain damaged amnesiac . Following Jason 's split from the Quartermaines , except for his sister Emily and grandmother Lila Morgan Quartermaine ( Anna Lee ) , and a change of his surname to Morgan , he would become the right - hand man for mob boss , Sonny Corinthos ( Maurice Benard ) . At the time , Burton was considering leaving the show and joked that a producer noted that he played every scene , the same way , as if someone was about to die . Burton 's decision to stay stemmed from a conversation with Benard who gave him advice on how to improve . While still portraying Jason Quartermaine , the writers saw the chemistry between him and Benard and decided to create Jason Morgan . </P> `` Am I a villain ? I guess . If I kill people , then I guess I 'm a villain . The audience knows that it 's been done . But they do n't care . '' -- Burton on his character 's change in direction <P> With a new personality shift , Burton 's Jason went from `` preppy and wholesome '' to `` angry , stoic and emotionless . '' In the early stages of his transformation into Jason Morgan , he would experience fits of rage and was even given the nickname `` anger boy . '' Post accident , as Jason matured the fits of rage subsided , Jason was very light and fun during his relationship with Robin Scorpio . It was n't until after he was hurt multiple times that Jason grew darker and more intense . Jason was seen as `` stone cold , '' and he did n't show much personality , unless it was with his closest loved ones . Despite the drastic change , Burton described his character as `` vulnerable , caring , honest , and honorable '' around those that he loves . Burton welcomed the change in story for his character , noting that it can sometimes become annoying playing `` just plain nice '' all the time . Within the mob and despite constant conflicts with law enforcement , Jason operated as a vigilante often taking down criminals who targeted the Corinthos family and tried to bring illegal substances and weapons into Port Charles , New York . Jason was known to show loyalty and compassion to those he held closest to him . His acts of extreme loyalty and compassion could be seen through his friendships with Sonny and Carly , his romantic relationships and his relationship with his nephew Michael , who he raised for the first year of Michael 's life . The passing years also saw a thaw in Jason 's relationship with the Quartermaines . The death of his father Alan and a shooting that left Michael in a year - long coma opened his eyes to what the Quartermaines suffered after his own accident . For that point on , Jason was shown to be more open to a relationship with his mother Monica , and eventually his grandfather Edward Quartermaine ( John Ingle ) . The extent of the thaw with his family could also be seen through Jason 's decision to name his son , Daniel Edward , after his grandfather . </P> <H2> Storylines ( edit ) </H2> <H3> 1980s ( edit ) </H3> <P> Jason was conceived out of his father , Alan Quartermaine 's ( Stuart Damon ) , affair with Susan Moore ( Gail Ramsey ) . Jason was born on September 14 , 1981 at Our Lady of Mercy Hospital in New York City . When Jason was born , Alan supported him financially , but was fighting for custody of his other son , A.J. . Jason lived with his mother and Scott Baldwin ( Kin Shriner ) up until her death , upon which he lived with Susan 's aunt , Alice Grant ( Lieux Dressler ) . Then he moved into the Quartermaine mansion with Alan . Alan 's wife , Monica ( Leslie Charleson ) , initially rejected Jason , but eventually grew to love him and later adopted him . Jason and A.J. were sent off to boarding school as children . In December 1991 , Jason was aged several years , re-establishing his birth year as 1974 then to 1976 in 2016 . </P> <H3> 1990s ( edit ) </H3> <P> When a newly SORASed Jason and older brother A.J. return to town , Jason , who is a successful student and athlete , is treated as the family favorite while A.J. is failing and dealing with alcoholism . Jason has relationships with Karen Wexler ( Cari Shayne ) , Brenda Barrett ( Vanessa Marcil ) , Robin Scorpio ( Kimberly McCullough ) and Keesha Ward ( Senait Ashenafi ) . Jason supports Monica through her health crisis with breast cancer and adores his adoptive sister , Emily Quartermaine ( then Amber Tamblyn ) . In December 1995 , an intoxicated A.J. runs his car into a tree . Jason , who was attempting to stop A.J. from driving , is in the passenger seat and hits his head on a large boulder after being ejected from the car . Jason suffers brain injuries that result in total memory loss . Upon waking up from his coma , Jason had no recollection of his past and resented all of the Quartermaines except his grandmother Lila Quartermaine ( Anna Lee ) and sister Emily . His personality drastically changes . Jason eventually turns his back on his family , and changes his surname to Morgan , Lila 's maiden name . Jason meets Robin again on a bridge and they begin a friendship which turns into a romantic relationship . Robin encouraged Jason to develop relationships with Lila , Emily , and Monica , and he stood by Robin at the Nurses Ball , where she shares with Port Charles for the first time that she is HIV positive . Robin leaves for college at Yale University and Jason asks her friend Sonny Corinthos ( Maurice Benard ) for a job . His loyalty and hard work impress Sonny . Jason becomes Sonny 's personal enforcer in his mob business . Robin returns in 1997 and was with Jason when he was shot for the first time by the Tin Man . Jason was operated on and saved . Robin begged Jason to leave his dangerous life behind . When Jason refused Robin begged Sonny to fire Jason . Initially hesitant , Sonny finally relented . Jason was infuriated when Sonny told him he was fired , and knew Robin was to blame . He and Robin broke up , and Robin made plans to leave town again . Jason met Robin on the bridge , and they said a last goodbye . </P> <P> To help Carly Benson ( then Sarah Joy Brown ) , Jason pretends to be the father of her baby . Carly develops postpartum depression after giving birth to her son , Michael , and leaves town . Robin returns to Port Charles and Jason confesses that the child is A.J. 's . Jason and Michael bond with Robin during Carly 's absence . Dr. Tony Jones ( Brad Maule ) kidnaps Michael and Robin . Jason eventually rescues them both . At trial , Carly shoots Tony in a moment of temporary insanity and is remanded to a mental facility . In Carly 's absence , Jason and Robin reunite . After Robin is almost killed in an explosion , Jason leaves the mob . Carly is released from the hospital , which puts a strain on Jason and Robin 's relationship .

Il Duomo di Firenze , as it is ordinarily called , was begun in 1296 in the Gothic style with the design of Arnolfo di Cambio and completed structurally in 1436 with the dome engineered by Filippo Brunelleschi . The exterior of the basilica is faced with polychrome marble panels in various shades of green and pink bordered by white and has an elaborate 19th - century Gothic Revival fa\u00e7ade by Emilio De Fabris . </P> <P> The cathedral complex , located in Piazza del Duomo , includes the Baptistery and Giotto 's Campanile . These three buildings are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site covering the historic centre of Florence and are a major attraction to tourists visiting Tuscany . The basilica is one of Italy 's largest churches , and until development of new structural materials in the modern era , the dome was the largest in the world . It remains the largest brick dome ever constructed . </P> <P> The cathedral is the mother church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Florence , whose archbishop is currently Giuseppe Betori . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Exterior <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Plan and structure </Li> <Li> 2.2 Dome </Li> <Li> 2.3 Fa\u00e7ade </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Main Portal </Li> <Li> 4 Interior </Li> <Li> 5 Crypt </Li> <Li> 6 Other burials </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 Notes </Li> <Li> 9 References </Li> <Li> 10 Further reading </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> Florence Cathedral <P> Santa Maria del Fiore was built on the site of Florence 's second cathedral dedicated to Saint Reparata ; the first was the Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze whose first building was consecrated as a church in 393 by St. Ambrose of Milan . The ancient structure , founded in the early 5th century and having undergone many repairs , was crumbling with age , according to the 14th - century Nuova Cronica of Giovanni Villani , and was no longer large enough to serve the growing population of the city . Other major Tuscan cities had undertaken ambitious reconstructions of their cathedrals during the Late Medieval period , such as Pisa and particularly Siena where the enormous proposed extensions were never completed . </P> Giotto 's bell tower ( campanile ) <P> The new church was designed by Arnolfo di Cambio and approved by city council in 1294 . Di Cambio was also architect of the church of Santa Croce and the Palazzo Vecchio . He designed three wide naves ending under the octagonal dome , with the middle nave covering the area of Santa Reparata . The first stone was laid on September 9 , 1296 , by Cardinal Valeriana , the first papal legate ever sent to Florence . The building of this vast project was to last 140 years ; Arnolfo 's plan for the eastern end , although maintained in concept , was greatly expanded in size . </P> The Duomo , as if completed , in a fresco by Andrea di Bonaiuto , painted in the 1360s , before the commencement of the dome <P> After Arnolfo died in 1310 , work on the cathedral slowed for thirty years . When the relics of Saint Zenobius were discovered in 1330 in Santa Reparata , the project gained a new impetus . In 1331 , the Arte della Lana , the guild of wool merchants , took over patronage for the construction of the cathedral and in 1334 appointed Giotto to oversee the work . Assisted by Andrea Pisano , Giotto continued di Cambio 's design . His major accomplishment was the building of the campanile . When Giotto died the January 8th of 1337 , Andrea Pisano continued the building until work was halted due to the Black Death in 1348 . </P> <P> In 1349 , work resumed on the cathedral under a series of architects , starting with Francesco Talenti , who finished the campanile and enlarged the overall project to include the apse and the side chapels . In 1359 , Talenti was succeeded by Giovanni di Lapo Ghini ( 1360 -- 1369 ) who divided the center nave in four square bays . Other architects were Alberto Arnoldi , Giovanni d'Ambrogio , Neri di Fioravante and Andrea Orcagna . By 1375 , the old church Santa Reparata was pulled down . The nave was finished by 1380 , and by 1418 , only the dome remained incomplete . </P> Procession outside the cathedral during the 18th century <P> On 18 August 1418 , the Arte della Lana announced an architectural design competition for erecting Neri 's dome . The two main competitors were two master goldsmiths , Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi , the latter of whom was supported by Cosimo de Medici . Ghiberti had been the winner of a competition for a pair of bronze doors for the Baptistery in 1401 and lifelong competition between the two remained sharp . Brunelleschi won and received the commission . </P> <P> Ghiberti , appointed coadjutator , drew a salary equal to Brunelleschi 's and , though neither was awarded the announced prize of 200 florins , was promised equal credit , although he spent most of his time on other projects . When Brunelleschi became ill , or feigned illness , the project was briefly in the hands of Ghiberti . But Ghiberti soon had to admit that the whole project was beyond him . In 1423 , Brunelleschi was back in charge and took over sole responsibility . </P> <P> Work started on the dome in 1420 and was completed in 1436 . The cathedral was consecrated by Pope Eugene IV on March 25 , 1436 , ( the first day of the year according to the Florentine calendar ) . It was the first ' octagonal ' dome in history to be built without a temporary wooden supporting frame . It was one of the most impressive projects of the Renaissance . During the consecration in 1436 , Guillaume Dufay 's motet Nuper rosarum flores was performed . The structure of this motet was strongly influenced by the structure of the dome . </P> The Duomo and Baptistery of St. John from Piazza del Duomo <P> The decoration of the exterior of the cathedral , begun in the 14th century , was not completed until 1887 , when the polychrome marble fa\u00e7ade was completed with the design of Emilio De Fabris . The floor of the church was relaid in marble tiles in the 16th century . </P> <P> The exterior walls are faced in alternate vertical and horizontal bands of polychrome marble from Carrara ( white ) , Prato ( green ) , Siena ( red ) , Lavenza and a few other places . These marble bands had to repeat the already existing bands on the walls of the earlier adjacent baptistery the Battistero di San Giovanni and Giotto 's Bell Tower . There are two side doors : the Doors of the Canonici ( south side ) and the Door of the Mandorla ( north side ) with sculptures by Nanni di Banco , Donatello , and Jacopo della Quercia . The six side windows , notable for their delicate tracery and ornaments , are separated by pilasters . Only the four windows closest to the transept admit light ; the other two are merely ornamental . The clerestory windows are round , a common feature in Italian Gothic . </P> <P> During its long history , this cathedral has been the seat of the Council of Florence ( 1439 ) , heard the preachings of Girolamo Savonarola and witnessed the murder of Giuliano di Piero de ' Medici on Sunday , 26 April 1478 ( with Lorenzo Il Magnifico barely escaping death ) , in the Pazzi conspiracy . </P> <H2> Exterior ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Plan and structure ( edit ) </H3> Plan of the church with various extension phases <P> The cathedral of Florence is built as a basilica , having a wide central nave of four square bays , with an aisle on either side . The chancel and transepts are of identical polygonal plan , separated by two smaller polygonal chapels . The whole plan forms a Latin cross . The nave and aisles are separated by wide pointed Gothic arches resting on composite piers . </P> <P> The dimensions of the building are enormous : building area 8,300 square metres ( 89,340 square feet ) , length 153 metres ( 502 feet ) , width 38 metres ( 125 feet ) , width at the crossing 90 metres ( 300 feet ) . The height of the arches in the aisles is 23 metres ( 75 feet ) . The height of the dome is 114.5 metres ( 375.7 feet ) . </P> <H3> Dome ( edit ) </H3> <P> By the beginning of the 15th century , after a hundred years of construction , the structure was still missing its dome . The basic features of the dome had been designed by Arnolfo di Cambio in 1296 . His brick model , 4.6 metres ( 15.1 ft ) high , 9.2 metres ( 30.2 feet ) long , was standing in a side aisle of the unfinished building , and had long been sacrosanct . It called for an octagonal dome higher and wider than any that had ever been built , with no external buttresses to keep it from spreading and falling under its own weight . </P> <Table> External video <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> Smarthistory - Brunelleschi 's Dome </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The commitment to reject traditional Gothic buttresses had been made when Neri di Fioravanti 's model was chosen over a competing one by Giovanni di Lapo Ghini . That architectural choice , in 1367 , was one of the first events of the Italian Renaissance , marking a break with the Medieval Gothic style and a return to the classic Mediterranean dome . Italian architects regarded Gothic flying buttresses as ugly makeshifts . Furthermore , the use of buttresses was forbidden in Florence , as the style was favored by central Italy 's traditional enemies to the north . Neri 's model depicted a massive inner dome , open at the top to admit light , like Rome 's Pantheon , but enclosed in a thinner outer shell , partly supported by the inner dome , to keep out the weather . It was to stand on an unbuttressed octagonal drum . Neri 's dome would need an internal defense against spreading ( hoop stress ) , but none had yet been designed . </P> Dome seen from the Giotto 's Campanile <P> The building of such a masonry dome posed many technical problems . Brunelleschi looked to the great dome of the Pantheon in Rome for solutions . The dome of the Pantheon is a single shell of concrete , the formula for which had long since been forgotten . Soil filled with silver coins had held the Pantheon dome aloft while its concrete set . This could not be the solution in the case of a dome this size and would put the church out of use . For the height and breadth of the dome designed by Neri , starting 52 metres ( 171 ft ) above the floor and spanning 44 meters ( 144 ft ) , there was not enough timber in Tuscany to build the scaffolding and forms .

The first $500 note was issued by the Province of North Carolina , authorized by legislation dated May 10 , 1780 . Virginia quickly followed suit and authorized the printing of $500 and $1,000 notes on October 16 , 1780 and $2,000 notes on May 7 , 1781 . High - denomination treasury notes were issued , for example during the War of 1812 ( $1,000 notes authorized by an act dated June 30 , 1812 ) . During the American Civil War Confederate currency included $500 and $1,000 notes . During the Federal banknote issuing period ( 1861 to present ) , the earliest high - denomination notes included three - year Interest - bearing notes of $500 , $1,000 , and $5,000 , authorized by Congress on July 17 , 1861 . In total , 11 different types of U.S. currency were issued in high - denomination notes across nearly 20 different series dates . The obverse of United States banknotes generally depict either historical figures , allegorical figures symbolizing significant concepts ( e.g. , liberty , justice ) , or a combination of both . The reverse designs range from abstract scroll - work with ornate denomination identifiers to reproductions of historical art works . </P> <H2> Public versus institutional use ( edit ) </H2> <P> Series 1934 gold certificates ( $100 , $1,000 , $10,000 and $100,000 ) were issued after the gold standard was repealed and gold was compulsorily confiscated by order of President Franklin Roosevelt on March 9 , 1933 ( see United States Executive Order 6102 ) . Thus the series 1934 notes were used only for intragovernmental ( i.e. , Federal Reserve Bank ) transactions and were not issued to the public . This series was discontinued in 1940 . The series 1928 gold certificate reverse was printed in black and green . See history of the United States dollar . </P> <H2> Passive retirement ( edit ) </H2> <P> Although they are still technically legal tender in the United States , high - denomination bills were last printed on December 27 , 1945 , and officially discontinued on July 14 , 1969 , by the Federal Reserve System , due to ' lack of use ' . The $5,000 and $10,000 effectively disappeared well before then . </P> <P> The Federal Reserve began taking high - denomination currency out of circulation ( destroying large bills received by banks ) in 1969 . As of May 30 , 2009 , only 336 $10,000 bills were known to exist ; 342 remaining $5,000 bills ; and 165,372 remaining $1,000 bills . Due to their rarity , collectors often pay considerably more than the face value of the bills to acquire them . Some are in museums in other parts of the world . </P> <P> For the most part , these bills were used by banks and the Federal government for large financial transactions . This was especially true for gold certificates from 1865 to 1934 . However , for the most part , the introduction of an electronic money system has made large - scale cash transactions obsolete . When combined with concerns about counterfeiting and the use of cash in unlawful activities such as the illegal drug trade and money laundering , it is unlikely that the U.S. government will re-issue large denomination currency in the near future , despite the amount of inflation that has occurred since 1969 ( a $100 bill is now worth less , in real terms , than a $20 bill was worth in 1969 ) . According to the U.S. Department of Treasury website , `` The present denominations of our currency in production are $1 , $2 , $5 , $10 , $20 , $50 and $100 . The purpose of the United States currency system is to serve the needs of the public and these denominations meet that goal . Neither the Department of the Treasury nor the Federal Reserve System has any plans to change the denominations in use today .

Like Australia , it first became accessible to university students in the country in 1989 . As of October 2015 , there are 1,926,000 broadband connections and 53,000 dialup connections in New Zealand , of which 1,661,000 are residential and 316,000 are business or government . ( For reference , there are 1,679,800 households in New Zealand as of September 2013 . ) </P> <P> Digital subscriber line ( DSL ) over phone lines provides two - thirds of broadband access in New Zealand . ADSL2+ is available in most parts of the country , with VDSL2 available in some areas . Fibre to the home cover over half of the main towns and cities . The phone and fibre networks are mostly owned by network company Chorus Limited , which wholesale services to retail ISPs . Parts of Wellington , Kapiti and Christchurch have cable internet access . Nearly all of the population is covered by 3G mobile broadband , with 4G available to the majority . Satellite internet is available throughout the country . </P> <P> As of July 2017 , Ookla reports the average download speed for fixed broadband as 61.21 Mbit / s and the average upload speed as 30.32 Mbit / s ( ranked 16th in the world ) . As of Q1 2017 , Akamai reports an average peak download speed of 70.8 Mbit / s ( 35th ) . For mobile broadband , as of July 2017 , Ookla reports the average speed as 35.19 Mbit / s , ranking it 14th in the world . Broadband pricing is at , or above the OECD average , and most connections have an unlimited data cap . There are more than 80 ISPs , with two of them having three - quarters of the market . The New Zealand Government is funding two broadband expansion initiatives , with the aim of providing fibre to the home of 80 % of the population and bringing broadband to 97.8 % of the population by 2019 .

Chorus provides ADSL ( up to 8 / 1 Mbit / s ) , ADSL2+ ( up to 24 / 1 Mbit / s ) and VDSL2 ( up to 100 / 50 Mbit / s or 70 / 30 Mbit / s ) services over the copper phone network . </P> <P> Contrary to the usual practice overseas , most connections are at full speed , instead plans differ in the amount of data included . As DSL is sensitive to distance , the closer the customer is to the equipment , the faster the connections . Chorus has implemented a fibre - to - the - node ( also known as `` cabinetisation '' ) project to bring the equipment closer to the user , so 91 % of the population is able to access a DSL connection of 10Mbit / s or more . As of January 2014 , 97.3 % of phone lines are capable of accessing ADSL and 62.4 % are capable of VDSL2 . </P> <P> As of December 2014 , Chorus has about 1.717 million copper connections , of which 1.133 million ( 66 % ) has broadband service provided using Chorus equipment . 1.040 million ( 92 % ) are using ADSL1 / 2 + and 93,000 ( 8 % ) are using VDSL2 . DSL is usually sold with a phoneline service ( called `` clothed DSL '' ) , but is also available without the phoneline ( called `` naked DSL '' ) . 113,000 ( 11 % ) of the ADSL ( 2 + ) connections , and 23,000 ( 25 % ) of the VDSL2 connections are naked . </P> <P> Chorus can not sell services directly to customers , instead , they wholesale services to internet retailers at regulated prices . The copper loop is unbundled , so operators like Vodafone , Compass and CallPlus ( Slingshot / Orcon ) can install their own equipment at telephone exchanges and rent just the copper line from Chorus . As of December 2013 , 131,000 ( 8 % ) lines are unbundled . </P> <H3> Fibre ( edit ) </H3> See also : Fiber to the premises by country \u00a7 New Zealand <P> Fibre to the home is being rolled out to the urban areas of the country via the Ultra-Fast Broadband scheme ( see below ) . The network is being constructed using Gigabit - capable Passive Optical Networks ( GPON ) technology , which is reliable , comparatively low - cost and has been used in projects such as Google Fiber . </P> <P> As of March 2017 , the project is 74 % complete , with fibre available to 1,103,874 users , of which 367,788 have signed up . Residential plans are between 30 / 10 Mbit / s and 1000 / 500 Mbit / s , with 1000 Mbit / s ( gigabit ) services available in many areas . As of March 2017 , there are 92 retailers of UFB services . </P> <P> P2P fibre is available in business areas of the cities from several companies , including Chorus , Vodafone , CityLink and Vector . </P> <H3> Cable ( edit ) </H3> <P> Vodafone has a DOCSIS 3.1 hybrid fibre - coaxial network covering parts of Kapiti , 85 % of Wellington and almost two - thirds of Christchurch , a total of 145,000 homes .

It provides plans of 200 / 20Mbit / s and 1000 / 100Mbit / s . </P> <H3> Mobile ( edit ) </H3> <P> There are three physical cellphone networks in the country . Vodafone provides 2G and 3G coverage to 97.5 % of the population and LTE to 84 % . Spark provides 3G coverage to 97 % and LTE to `` over two - thirds '' . 2degrees has a 2G / 3G network covering 96 % of the population , with users roaming to Vodafone outside that area . 2degrees also has 4G LTE coverage to 86 % of the population . </P> <H3> Fixed wireless ( edit ) </H3> <P> There are a total of about 50,000 fixed wireless connections using a variety of providers . </P> <P> Vodafone offers a fixed wireless service provided over LTE / HSPA+ in rural areas under the government - subsidized Rural Broadband Initiative scheme ( see below ) . As a condition of the subsidy , Vodafone also wholesales this service to other retailers . Spark also offers a fixed wireless service over LTE in rural areas . </P> <P> Woosh offered a fixed wireless service in Southland until 1 July 2016 . It used a proprietary TDD - CDMA technology by IP Wireless that was no longer supported by vendors . The maximum speed was 1.6 Mbit / s . </P> <P> There are smaller regional providers covering rural areas . They typically use the unlicensed 2.4 and 5.8 GHz bands . </P> <H3> Satellite ( edit ) </H3> <P> Satellite is available throughout the country from Farmside ( using IPSTAR ) and Wireless Nation ( using Optus D2 ) for people in areas unserviced by broadband . </P> <H3> Dial - up ( edit ) </H3> <P> Almost every household is able to access dial - up , thanks to Chorus inheriting the formerly state - owned copper phone network . For the ten thousand most remote households , their phone lines are connected back to the exchange via a radio system called customer multi-access radio ( CMAR ) . These households can only access 14.4 kbit / s speeds . As of October 2015 , there were 53,000 dial - up connections ( 3 % of all connections ) , down from 99,000 ( 5 % ) in 2013 , and 127,000 ( 7 % ) in 2012 . </P> <H2> Government broadband upgrade plan ( edit ) </H2> <P> The government has two plans to bring fast broadband to 97.8 % of the population by 2019 . </P> <H3> Ultra-Fast broadband Initiative ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Ultra-Fast Broadband <P> The Government is spending NZ $1.35 billion on public - private partnerships with Chorus and three local electricity network companies to roll out fibre - to - the - home connection in all main towns and cities with population over 10,000 . The programme aims to deliver ultra-fast broadband capable of at least 100 Mbit / s download and 50Mbit / s upload to 75 % of New Zealanders by 2019 . In total , 1,340,000 households will be connected . </P> <P> In 2015 , the Government launched a $152 million to $210 million extension of the original UFB programme , with the aim of extending UFB programme coverage from 75 per cent to 80 per cent of New Zealanders . </P> <H3> Rural broadband Initiative ( edit ) </H3> <P> The government has awarded a $300 million Rural Broadband Initiative ( RBI ) contract to Vodafone and Chorus to bring broadband of at least 5Mbit / s to 86 % of rural customers by 2016 . Vodafone will install 154 new cell towers and upgrade 387 towers , adding 250,000 addresses to its 3G coverage . As of June 2015 , 116 new towers have been installed and 314 towers upgraded , covering approximately 242,814 addresses . As of June 2014 , there are 6064 customers on the RBI wireless network . By January 2016 , Vodafone was actively extending its 4G network , and on track to deliver speeds as high as 100Mbit / s . Chorus will provide fibre to the new Vodafone towers , 1040 schools , 183 libraries and 50 health providers . Chorus will also be upgrading or installing 1215 new cabinets to increase GPON , VDSL and ADSL coverage to 100,969 lines . As of June 2015 , 93,348 lines have been upgraded , with a 80 % uptake rate . </P> <P> In 2015 , in addition to expanding the coverage of the UFB programme , the government also launched a further $100 million investment to expand the RBI , and $50 million to improve mobile coverage in black spot areas . </P> <H2> Data caps ( edit ) </H2> <Table> Data caps ( as of October 2014 ) <Tr> <Th> Data cap ( GB / month ) </Th> <Th> Connections </Th> <Th> Percentage </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> < 5 </Td> <Td> 204,000 </Td> <Td> 11 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5 - 20 </Td> <Td> 64,000 </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 20 - 50 </Td> <Td> 492,000 </Td> <Td> 26 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 50 - 100 </Td> <Td> 411,000 </Td> <Td> 21 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> > 100 </Td> <Td> 125,000 </Td> <Td> 6 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> None </Td> <Td> 628,000 </Td> <Td> 33 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> As of October 2015 , 67 % of internet connections have a fixed data cap .

In February 2013 , NBC offered Kiefer Sutherland the lead role of Raymond Reddington . After considering other actors for the role , Eisendrath and Bokenkamp called James Spader to see if he would be interested in it . Feeling confident in Spader 's understanding of the character , they cast him three days before filming began . </P> <P> Megan Boone took a week to prepare for her audition as FBI profiler Elizabeth Keen . Feeling like her initial audition was one of the better auditions of her career , Boone later was called back for multiple auditions . In March 2013 , Deadline Hollywood reported that Boone accepted the role as the female lead in the series . </P> <H3> Filming locations and technique ( edit ) </H3> <P> Despite being set in Washington , D.C. , the series is mainly filmed in the same Manhattan studio where Law & Order was filmed for 20 years . Producer Richard Heus said they chose to film specific Washington , D.C. locations for the series , including the Lincoln Memorial , the Washington Monument , and the National Mall , because they were `` iconic American locations '' . </P> <P> The series is filmed in 4K using Sony PMW - F55 cameras that are adapted to use Panavision lenses . It is edited using Avid Media Composer , and editor Christopher Brookshire says the show has `` a very distinctive look and pace '' . An average of three cameras are used at one time , but as many as six cameras are sometimes rolling . </P> <H2> Broadcast ( edit ) </H2> <P> The series is broadcast simultaneously on Global in Canada . In New Zealand , the show premiered on TV3 on February 2 , 2014 . The second season premiered on September 23 . In the United Kingdom and Ireland , the show premiered on Sky Living on October 4 , 2013 . The second season premiered on October 3 , 2014 . Netflix has streaming rights to seasons 1 -- 5 in the United States , 1 -- 4 in Australia , Latin America , Finland , Switzerland , Germany , Sweden , The Netherlands , and Canada . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Critical response ( edit ) </H3> <P> The first season of The Blacklist received strong reviews from television critics . On Metacritic , the first season has a score of 74 out of 100 , based on 31 critics , indicating `` generally favorable reviews '' . The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an 85 % approval rating , based on 52 reviews , with an average score of 7.18 / 10 . The consensus reads , `` James Spader is riveting as a criminal - turned - informant , and his presence goes a long way toward making this twisty but occasionally implausible crime procedural compelling '' . The second season received a rating of 80 % , based on 15 reviews , with an average score of 7.77 / 10 . The consensus reads , `` Though The Blacklist flirts with narrative overload , it 's held together by James Spader 's scenery - eating performance and wildly entertaining action . '' The third season received a rating of 93 % , based on 14 reviews , with an average score of 7.41 / 10 . The consensus reads , `` The Blacklist is back in top form with fresh dangers that put Red on the ropes while giving James Spader room to shine . '' The fourth season received a rating of 88 % , based on eight reviews , with an average score of 7 / 10 . The fifth season received a rating of 100 % , based on five reviews , with an average score of 8.5 / 10 . </P> <P> David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle said about the pilot , `` You think you know this situation and how it will turn out , but there are surprising , yet entirely credible , twists throughout Monday 's episode '' . Robert Bianco of USA Today said , `` The Blacklist is a solid weekly crime show built around a genuine TV star . That 's the kind of series the networks have to be able to pull off to survive . And with Spader in command , odds are NBC will '' . Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter praised both Spader 's performance and the procedural elements of the show , writing `` there 's an overarching element to the premise as well that makes it intriguing without making it overly complicated .

The production model was first unveiled at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show . UK models went on sale on 18 September 2010 . The availability of models varies between markets , with the United States and Russia not taking the One versions or any diesel - powered models . The All4 all - wheel - drive option is available on variable models , again depending on the country . </P> <P> The ALL4 all - wheel - drive powertrain includes electro - hydraulic differential , positioned directly on the transmission 's final drive , to vary the power distribution from front to rear . Under normal driving conditions , up to 50 percent of the engine 's power goes to the rear wheels . Under `` extreme '' conditions ( `` extreme '' being undefined ) up to 100 percent heads to the back wheels . </P> <P> Early models included Cooper S , Cooper S ALL4 , Cooper , One , Cooper D , Cooper D ALL4 , and One D. Cooper SD , Cooper SD ALL4 , Cooper D Automatic , Cooper D ALL4 Automatic were added from spring 2011 . </P> <P> In 2012 the Countryman received some minor amendments , including an EU6 exhaust emissions standard compliance for the One and Cooper models , and using a different clutch material and improved software to reduce stalling problems . They went on sale from November 2012 . </P> <P> A Cooper ALL4 model was added in July 2013 . </P> <P> Changes to US 2014 model year range included the omission of the interior `` Centre Rail '' feature from the back seats . The rail is still present in the front . </P> <H3> Countryman WRC ( 2010 -- ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> This is a race car version of Mini Cooper S ALL4 developed with Prodrive beginning in early 2009 , with a 1.6 - litre , four - cylinder turbo - charged engine from BMW Motorsport . The first test drive for the Mini Countryman WRC , which would also be available to customer teams , was planned for autumn 2010 . It was unveiled at the Paris Show in 2010 . </P> <H3> Countryman John Cooper Works ( 2012 -- 2016 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> The John Cooper Works is a derivative of the Cooper S ALL4 version of the Countryman , with increased engine power to 218 PS ( 160 kW ; 215 hp ) and 280 N \u22c5 m ( 207 lb \u22c5 ft ) with over boost : 300 N \u22c5 m ( 221 lb \u22c5 ft ) . Steering , suspension , wheels and appearance have also been modified . It was unveiled at the 2012 International Geneva Motor Show , and went on sale in autumn 2012 . </P> <P> US models receive reduced engine power to 211 PS ( 155 kW ; 208 hp ) and 260 N \u22c5 m ( 192 lb \u22c5 ft ) ( overboost : 280 N \u22c5 m ( 207 lb \u22c5 ft ) ) , and went on sale in July 2012 as a 2013 model year vehicle . </P> <H3> Kiss edition ( 2011 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> In June 2011 , Mini USA collaborated with rock band Kiss to create a quartet of one - off Countryman crossovers themed after the band . The cars were placed on auction on eBay , with proceeds going to UNICEF to help children affected by the T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami . The auction was able to raise US $129,000 . Mini USA also sold replica vehicle wraps for Countryman owners through their website and dealerships . </P> <H3> Safety ( edit ) </H3> <P> In November 2010 , Euro NCAP awarded the Countryman a 5 - star crash rating . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"3\"> Euro NCAP test results </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"3\"> Mini Countryman ( 2011 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Test </Th> <Th> Points </Th> <Th> % </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Overall : </Td> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Adult occupant : </Td> <Td> 30 </Td> <Td> 84 % </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Child occupant : </Td> <Td> 41 </Td> <Td> 83 % </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Pedestrian : </Td> <Td> 23 </Td> <Td> 63 % </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Safety assist : </Td> <Td> 5 </Td> <Td> 71 % </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Reception ( edit ) </H3> <P> Pulitzer Prize winning automotive journalist Dan Neil suggested the Countryman had jumped the shark -- that is to say the car pushed the Mini ethos beyond relevance , marking the zenith of popularity and the start of decline . Neil suggested that by making a vehicle that is longer , wider and taller , the company had forsaken the inner logic of the brand : excellent handling in a tiny size . In a March 2011 review titled What Part of ' Mini ' Did You Not Grasp , BMW ? , Neil wrote `` with the Countryman , tiny sharks have been jumped . '' The Countryman became Mini 's second most popular model after the iconic Hardtop . The very first year of production it sold almost 50 % more units than the Clubman , Convertible , and Coupe added together . Almost 1 out of every 3 vehicles Mini sold in 2011 was a Countryman ( U.S. market ) . This trend continued through 2012 also with almost 1 in 3 MINIs sold again being a Countryman - both in the US and globally . By the end of 2013 the Countryman was 31 % of total U.S. sales for the Mini brand . </P> <H3> 2014 update ( r60 lci ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> A minor facelift to the Countryman was unveiled at the 2014 New York International Auto Show . Changes include a new structure of the hexagonal radiator grill , underride guard elements for the Cooper S Countryman ALL4 and additional body colour options . It went on sale in July 2014 . All variants carried over . US variants include Cooper , Cooper S , Cooper S ALL4 , John Cooper Works ( with ALL4 ) , with 6 - speed manual transmission or optional 6 - speed automatic transmission . </P> <Ul> <Li> <P> 2014 LCI </P> </Li> <Li> <P> 2014 LCI </P> </Li> </Ul> <H3> Powertrain ( edit ) </H3> <Table> Petrol engines hide <Tr> <Th> Model </Th> <Th> Years </Th> <Th> Type </Th> <Th> Power , torque @ rpm </Th> <Th> Transmission </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> On\n", "answer": "2010"}

The first $500 note was issued by the Province of North Carolina , authorized by legislation dated May 10 , 1780 . Virginia quickly followed suit and authorized the printing of $500 and $1,000 notes on October 16 , 1780 and $2,000 notes on May 7 , 1781 . High - denomination treasury notes were issued , for example during the War of 1812 ( $1,000 notes authorized by an act dated June 30 , 1812 ) . During the American Civil War Confederate currency included $500 and $1,000 notes . During the Federal banknote issuing period ( 1861 to present ) , the earliest high - denomination notes included three - year Interest - bearing notes of $500 , $1,000 , and $5,000 , authorized by Congress on July 17 , 1861 . In total , 11 different types of U.S. currency were issued in high - denomination notes across nearly 20 different series dates . The obverse of United States banknotes generally depict either historical figures , allegorical figures symbolizing significant concepts ( e.g. , liberty , justice ) , or a combination of both . The reverse designs range from abstract scroll - work with ornate denomination identifiers to reproductions of historical art works . </P> <H2> Public versus institutional use ( edit ) </H2> <P> Series 1934 gold certificates ( $100 , $1,000 , $10,000 and $100,000 ) were issued after the gold standard was repealed and gold was compulsorily confiscated by order of President Franklin Roosevelt on March 9 , 1933 ( see United States Executive Order 6102 ) . Thus the series 1934 notes were used only for intragovernmental ( i.e. , Federal Reserve Bank ) transactions and were not issued to the public . This series was discontinued in 1940 . The series 1928 gold certificate reverse was printed in black and green . See history of the United States dollar . </P> <H2> Passive retirement ( edit ) </H2> <P> Although they are still technically legal tender in the United States , high - denomination bills were last printed on December 27 , 1945 , and officially discontinued on July 14 , 1969 , by the Federal Reserve System , due to ' lack of use ' . The $5,000 and $10,000 effectively disappeared well before then . </P> <P> The Federal Reserve began taking high - denomination currency out of circulation ( destroying large bills received by banks ) in 1969 . As of May 30 , 2009 , only 336 $10,000 bills were known to exist ; 342 remaining $5,000 bills ; and 165,372 remaining $1,000 bills . Due to their rarity , collectors often pay considerably more than the face value of the bills to acquire them . Some are in museums in other parts of the world . </P> <P> For the most part , these bills were used by banks and the Federal government for large financial transactions . This was especially true for gold certificates from 1865 to 1934 . However , for the most part , the introduction of an electronic money system has made large - scale cash transactions obsolete . When combined with concerns about counterfeiting and the use of cash in unlawful activities such as the illegal drug trade and money laundering , it is unlikely that the U.S. government will re-issue large denomination currency in the near future , despite the amount of inflation that has occurred since 1969 ( a $100 bill is now worth less , in real terms , than a $20 bill was worth in 1969 ) . According to the U.S. Department of Treasury website , `` The present denominations of our currency in production are $1 , $2 , $5 , $10 , $20 , $50 and $100 . The purpose of the United States currency system is to serve the needs of the public and these denominations meet that goal . Neither the Department of the Treasury nor the Federal Reserve System has any plans to change the denominations in use today .

{"content": "Answer the question based on the information provided in the document given below. The answer should be a number\n\nQuestion:\nwhen did wizards of the coast stop making pokemon\n\nDocument:\n On August 2 , 1997 , Wizards of the Coast was granted U.S. Patent 5,662,332 on collectible card games . In January 1999 , Wizards of the Coast began publishing the highly successful Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game . The game proved to be very popular , selling nearly 400,000 copies in less than six weeks , and selling 10 times better than Wizards ' initial projections . There was such a high demand for Pok\u00e9mon cards that some sports card series were discontinued in 1999 because so many printers were producing Pok\u00e9mon cards . The game won the 1999 National Parenting Center 's Seal of Approval . </P> <P> Within a year , Wizards had sold millions of copies of the Pok\u00e9mon game , and the company released a new set that included an instructional CD - ROM . Wizards continued to publish the game until 2003 . One of Nintendo 's affiliates , Pok\u00e9mon USA , had begun producing a new edition for the game before the last of its agreements with Wizards expired September 30 , and Wizards filed suit against Nintendo the following day , October 1 , 2003 . The two companies resolved their differences in December 2003 without going to court . </P> <H3> Acquisition by Hasbro ( edit ) </H3> <P> Seeing the continued success of Pok\u00e9mon and Magic : The Gathering , the game and toy giant Hasbro bought Wizards of the Coast in September 1999 , for about US $325 million . Hasbro had expressed interest in purchasing Wizards of the Coast as early as 1994 , and had been further impressed after the success of its Pok\u00e9mon game . Avalon Hill was made a division of Wizards of the Coast , in late 1999 ; the company had been purchased by Hasbro in the summer of 1998 . </P> <P> Vince Caluori became President of Wizards of the Coast in November 1999 . As of January 1 , 2001 , Peter Adkison resigned from Wizards . Chuck Huebner became President and CEO of Wizards of the Coast in June 2002 , and Loren Greenwood succeeded Huebner in these positions in April 2004 . Greg Leeds succeeded Loren Greenwood as President and CEO of Wizards of the Coast in March 2008 . </P> <P> In November 1999 , Wizards announced that Gen Con would leave Milwaukee after the 2002 convention . Hasbro sold Origins to GAMA , and in May 2002 sold Gen Con to Peter Adkison . Wizards also outsourced its magazines by licensing Dungeon , Dragon , Polyhedron , and Amazing Stories to Paizo Publishing . Wizards released the Dungeons & Dragons miniatures collectible pre-painted plastic miniatures games in 2003 , and added a licensed Star Wars line in 2004 , and through its Avalon Hill brand an Axis & Allies World War II miniatures game in 2005 . Wizards of the Coast 's book publishing division has produced hundreds of titles that have sold millions of copies in over 16 languages . </P> <P> After the company 's great success in 1999 with Pok\u00e9mon , Wizards of the Coast acquired and expanded The Game Keeper , a US chain of retail gaming stores , eventually changing its name to Wizards of the Coast , including the company 's flagship gaming center on The Ave in Seattle for several years , and its retail stores , which were mostly in shopping malls in the US . The gaming center was closed by March 2001 and eventually Wizards announced in December 2003 that it would close all of its stores in order to concentrate on game design . The stores were closed in the spring of 2004 . </P> <H3> 2000s - 2010s ( edit ) </H3> <P> In early 2006 , Wizards of the Coast filed a lawsuit against Daron Rutter , then administrator of the MTGSalvation website ( on which he is known as `` Rancored Elf '' ) . The charges stemmed from Rutter publicly posting confidential prototypes for upcoming Magic : The Gathering card sets to the MTGSalvation forums , ten months before the cards were to be released . Mark Rosewater explained the outcome : `` I can say that we ( Wizards of the Coast ) settled the lawsuit with Rancored Elf out of court to both parties ' satisfaction . '' </P> <P> Paizo Publishing 's license to produce Dragon and Dungeon magazines , which Paizo had been publishing since it spun off from Wizards of the Coast 's periodicals department in 2002 , expired in September 2007 . Wizards then moved the magazines to an online model . On June 6 , 2008 , Wizards released the 4th Edition of Dungeons & Dragons , with the retail availability of a new set of core rulebooks . Wizards began introducing 4th Edition online content in Dragon and Dungeon magazines . 4th Edition is designed to offer more streamlined game play , while the new rules framework intended to reduce the preparation time needed to run a game and make the game more accessible to new players . </P> <P> As of 2008 , the company employs over 300 people . On April 6 , 2009 , Wizards of the Coast suspended all sales of its products for the Dungeons & Dragons games in PDF format from places such as ONEBOOKSHELF.com and its subsidiaries RPGNow.com and DRIVETHRURPG.com . This coincides with a lawsuit brought against eight people in an attempt to prevent future copyright infringement of their books , and includes the recent 4th edition Dungeons & Dragons products that were made available through these places as well as all older editions PDFs of the game . </P> <P> A 5th edition of D&D was released on July 15 , 2014 featuring a set of pre-generated characters , a set of instructions for basic play , and the adventure module Lost Mine of Phandelver . In 2016 , Chris Cocks was announced as a replacement for Greg Leeds . </P> <H2> Games and products ( edit ) </H2> Main article : List of Wizards of the Coast products <P> In addition to Dungeons & Dragons , Magic : The Gathering , and Pok\u00e9mon , Wizards has produced numerous other games , including board , card , miniature , and role - playing games . They also publish novels based on games such as Dungeons & Dragons , Magic : The Gathering and Legend of the Five Rings . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` Contact Us '' .

It is the eighth Doctor Who Christmas special since the show 's 2005 revival and the first to be within a series . It was written by head writer and executive producer Steven Moffat and directed by Saul Metzstein . </P> <P> The episode is set in the Victorian era and sees the Doctor ( Matt Smith ) brooding with the assistance of Silurian Madame Vastra ( Neve McIntosh ) , her wife Jenny Flint ( Catrin Stewart ) and Sontaran Strax ( Dan Starkey ) , after the loss of companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams in the previous episode , `` The Angels Take Manhattan '' . He is forced out of hiding to investigate mysterious , sentient snowmen that are building themselves and meets Clara Oswald ( Jenna - Louise Coleman ) , a governess also investigating the snowmen . They discover that the snowmen are being animated by the Great Intelligence ( voice of Ian McKellen ) with the help of a man named Dr Simeon ( Richard E. Grant ) . </P> <P> Building upon the character 's surprise introduction in `` Asylum of the Daleks '' , `` The Snowmen '' introduces Clara as the Doctor 's new companion , though ultimately it would be a third version of her character that would travel with the Doctor starting with `` The Bells of Saint John '' . In addition to Clara , `` The Snowmen '' also introduces a redesigned TARDIS , revised title sequence and theme music , and sees changes to the Doctor 's costume . The special was produced in August 2012 , with location filming in Newport , Wales and Bristol . It received final ratings of 9.87 million viewers in the UK , becoming the fourth most - watched programme of Christmas Day . `` The Snowmen '' was met with mostly positive reviews from critics , most of whom received the introduction and character of Clara well . However , some felt that Grant and McKellen were underused as villains or the plot was slight because of the focus on characterisation . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Prequels </Li> <Li> 1.2 Synopsis </Li> <Li> 1.3 Continuity </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Production <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Writing and design changes </Li> <Li> 2.2 Casting </Li> <Li> 2.3 Filming and effects </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Broadcast and reception <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Critical reception </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 DVD release </Li> <Li> 5 Soundtrack </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Prequels ( edit ) </H3> <P> To promote the special , three prequels were released . The first was broadcast during the 2012 Children in Need telethon on 16 November 2012 , titled `` The Great Detective '' . The Silurian Madame Vastra , her human wife Jenny Flint , and the Sontaran Strax ( all returning from `` A Good Man Goes to War '' ) describe a number of strange phenomena to a shadowed fourth detective . The fourth detective reveals himself to be the Doctor , and tells the group that he has retired . </P> <P> A second prequel , titled `` Vastra Investigates '' , was released online on 17 December 2012 . At the end of a case , Vastra and Jenny converse with an officer from Scotland Yard and apologise for Strax 's violent wishes for the culprit 's punishment . Vastra explains Strax 's alien origin as well as her own to the officer , much to his astonishment . Vastra reveals that she was awoken by an extension to the London Underground and initially disliked humans , though that changed when she fell in love with Jenny . On the carriage ride home , Jenny notices it is beginning to snow and Vastra notes that the snow should be impossible because there are no clouds in the sky . </P> <P> A third prequel , titled `` The Battle of Demon 's Run -- Two Days Later '' was released on the United States iTunes and Amazon Video stores on 25 March 2013 . Two days after the events of `` A Good Man Goes to War '' , Vastra and Jenny convince Strax that he is not mortally wounded and invite him to accompany them back to 1800s London . The scene had been filmed as an extra due to the anticipation that fans would ask how Strax was resurrected and came to be in Vastra 's employ . </P> <H3> Synopsis ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1842 England , a young boy builds a snowman , but refuses to play with the other children . The snowman starts speaking to the boy , repeating his assertions that the other children are silly . Fifty years later , the boy has grown up to be Dr. Walter Simeon , proprietor of the Great Intelligence Institute . He hires men to collect samples of snow , which he places in a large snow - filled globe in his laboratory before feeding the men to a group of animated snowmen . The Doctor , still despondent after losing his former companions Amy Pond and Rory Williams , has parked his TARDIS above Victorian London among the clouds . He uses his allies Vastra , Jenny , and Strax to keep people away from him . They also fill their time investigating mysteries throughout the city . </P> <P> Elsewhere , barmaid Clara Oswin Oswald investigates a disturbance outside the tavern she works at and finds the Doctor walking by . He attempts to leave discreetly , but Clara follows him to a coach . Not wishing to become involved in matters , the Doctor instructs Strax to bring him a memory worm that will erase the last hour of Clara 's memories with just a touch . Before they can do so , they are surrounded by snowmen created from snow with psychic properties who attack the group . The Doctor realises that Clara 's thoughts are creating the snowmen and ends the threat by instructing her to think of them melting . Clara cautions the Doctor that if he wipes her memory , she will forget how to deal with the snowmen . The Doctor reluctantly allows her to go and ascends a staircase to the sky to return to the TARDIS . Clara follows him and knocks on the door , but she hides and flees down the staircase when the Doctor answers . Clara returns to her other job as governess for the children of Captain Latimer . She learns that Latimer 's daughter has been having horrible dreams about their previous governess returning from the dead . Clara realises that the pond that contains the old governess ' body is the only thing still frozen around them . She attempts to track down the Doctor but instead attracts the attention of Jenny , who takes her to see Vastra . Vastra tells Clara she gets only one word to impress the Doctor with if she wants his help . Clara chooses the word `` Pond '' , which shocks the Doctor and arouses his interest . </P> The Doctor welcomes his new companion Clara to his redesigned TARDIS . The idea behind the redesign was to make the TARDIS look more like a machine again . <P> Acting on a tip from Strax , the Doctor visits the Great Intelligence Institute posing as Sherlock Holmes . He confronts Dr. Simeon and find a large glass globe in Simeon 's office that contains psychic snow . The Doctor speaks to the Great Intelligence , the entity that has been speaking to Dr. Simeon since he was a boy . He learns that the Great Intelligence has been controlling the snowmen and has taken interest in Latimer 's pond . The Doctor visits the pond and deduces that the Great Intelligence is using the old governess ' body as a DNA blueprint to form an ice creature that will retain its form and not melt . While Clara is putting the children to bed , the frozen body of the governess breaks into the house . The Doctor fights her off and is joined by Vastra , Jenny and Strax . Dr. Simeon arrives with more snowmen and tells them he wants the governess ' ice body . The Doctor flees with Clara to the roof of the mansion and then to the TARDIS hovering overhead . They are pursued by the ice governess , whom the Doctor traps under a layer of frozen ice crystals . Inside the TARDIS the Doctor gives Clara a TARDIS key , but the ice governess arrives and pulls Clara down off the cloud . </P> <P> The Doctor picks up Clara and takes her back to Latimer 's mansion , placing her under medical care of Strax . He collects the ice fragments from the governess and places them in a souvenir London Underground biscuit tin . He and Vastra travel to Simeon 's lab , where the Doctor notes the Intelligence 's plan to replace humanity with ice creatures and holds up the tin with the necessary DNA . Dr Simeon grabs the tin and opens it only to find the memory worm , which latches on to him . The Doctor states that the Great Intelligence , which has been existing as a mirror of Dr Simeon 's thoughts , will vanish with the erasure of Simeon 's memories . Instead , the Intelligence reveals that it existed long enough that it can now control Simeon 's body , which it uses to attack Vastra and the Doctor . The influence of the Great Intelligence quickly wanes , and Simeon falls dead . Outside , a salt - water rain has started , and the Doctor sees that another psychic ability has taken control of the snow from the Great Intelligence : the Latimer family , crying for Clara . Strax informs the Doctor upon his return to the Latimer mansion that Clara only has moments left , and she passes away as the Doctor returns the TARDIS key to her . At her funeral , the Doctor reads Clara 's full name on her tombstone and realises she is the woman he met in `` Asylum of the Daleks '' who became a Dalek , whom he refers to as `` Souffl\u00e9 Girl '' . He gleefully announces that a person dying twice is an impossibility and , bidding farewell to his allies for now , the Doctor departs in the TARDIS to investigate and find Clara . The episode concludes in contemporary times , where a young woman resembling Clara walks through the same graveyard , pausing by Clara 's tombstone . </P> <H3> Continuity ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Second Doctor previously encountered the Great Intelligence in the serials The Abominable Snowmen ( 1967 ) , set in the 1930s , and The Web of Fear ( 1968 ) , set in the 1960s . In these stories , the Great Intelligence uses robot Yeti as its physical presence . The events of The Web of Fear are alluded to by the Doctor in `` The Snowmen '' when he presents the London Underground biscuit tin to the Great Intelligence in Dr Simeon 's laboratory ; the Intelligence states , `` I do not understand these markings '' , in reference to the 1967 London Underground map design on the tin .

These groups of culturally and linguistically identical Native Americans traditionally spoke an Algonquian language now referred to as Unami . Early European settlers called bands of Lenape by the Unami place name for where they lived , such as `` Raritan '' in Staten Island and New Jersey , `` Canarsee '' in Brooklyn , and `` Hackensack '' in New Jersey across the Hudson River from Lower Manhattan . Eastern Long Island neighbors were culturally and linguistically more closely related to the Mohegan - Pequot peoples of New England who spoke the Mohegan - Montauk - Narragansett language . </P> <P> These peoples all made use of the abundant waterways in the New York City region for fishing , hunting trips , trade , and occasionally war . place names such as Raritan Bay and Canarsie are derived from Lenape names . Many paths created by the indigenous peoples are now main thoroughfares , such as Broadway in Manhattan , the Bronx , and Westchester . The Lenape developed sophisticated techniques of hunting and managing their resources . By the time of the arrival of Europeans , they were cultivating fields of vegetation through the slash and burn technique , which extended the productive life of planted fields . They also harvested vast quantities of fish and shellfish from the bay . Historians estimate that at the time of European settlement , approximately 5,000 Lenape lived in 80 settlements around the region . </P> <H2> European settlement ( edit ) </H2> <P> The first European visitor to the area was Italian Giovanni da Verrazzano , in command of the French ship La Dauphine in 1524 . It is believed he sailed into Upper New York Bay , where he encountered native Lenape , returned through the Narrows , where he anchored the night of April 17 , and left to continue his voyage . He named the area Nouvelle - Angoul\u00eame ( New Angoul\u00eame ) in honor of Francis I , King of France of the royal house of Valois - Angoul\u00eame . </P> <P> European exploration continued on September 2 , 1609 , when the Englishman Henry Hudson , in the employ of the Dutch East India Company , sailed the Half Moon through the Narrows into Upper New York Bay . Like Christopher Columbus , Hudson was looking for a westerly passage to Asia . He never found one , but he did take note of the abundant beaver population . Beaver pelts were in fashion in Europe , fueling a lucrative business . Hudson 's report on the regional beaver population served as the impetus for the founding of Dutch trading colonies in the New World . The beaver 's importance in New York City 's history is reflected by its use on the city 's official seal . </P> <P> European settlement began with the founding of a Dutch fur trading post in Lower Manhattan at the southern tip of Manhattan in 1624 - 1625 . Soon thereafter , most likely in 1626 , construction of Fort Amsterdam began . Later , the Dutch West Indies Company imported African slaves to serve as laborers ; they helped to build the wall that defended the town against English and Indian attacks . Early directors included Willem Verhulst and Peter Minuit . Willem Kieft became director in 1638 but five years later was embroiled in Kieft 's War against the Native Americans . The Pavonia Massacre , across the Hudson River in present - day Jersey City , resulted in the death of 80 natives in February 1643 . Following the massacre , Algonquian tribes joined forces and nearly defeated the Dutch . Holland sent additional forces to the aid of Kieft , leading to the overwhelming defeat of the Native Americans and a peace treaty on August 29 , 1645 . </P> <P> On May 27 , 1647 , Peter Stuyvesant was inaugurated as director general upon his arrival and ruled as a member of the Dutch Reformed Church . The colony was granted self - government in 1652 , and New Amsterdam was incorporated as a city on February 2 , 1653 . The first mayors ( burgemeesters ) of New Amsterdam , Arent van Hattem and Martin Cregier , were appointed in that year . </P> <H3> British rule and Revolution : 1664 -- 1783 ( edit ) </H3> New Amsterdam in 1664 <P> In 1664 , the English conquered the area and renamed it `` New York '' after the Duke of York , ending the brief 40 - year period of Dutch rule for 120 years of English and British administration as a colony of the Kingdom of England and later of Great Britain . At that time , people of African descent made up 20 % of the population of the city , with European settlers a large proportion of remaining Dutch citizens among the English , Scots , Welsh , and Irish numbering in total approximately 1,500 and people of African descent numbering 375 ( with 300 enslaved and 75 free ) . ( Although it has been claimed that African slaves comprised 40 % of the small population of the city at that time , this claim has not been substantiated . ) During the mid 17th century , farms of free blacks covered 130 acres ( 53 ha ) where Washington Square Park later developed . The Dutch briefly regained the city in 1673 , renaming the city `` New Orange '' , before permanently ceding the colony of New Netherland to the English for what is now Suriname in November 1674 . Some place names originated in the Dutch period and were named after places in the Netherlands , most notably Flushing ( Dutch town of Vlissingen ) , Harlem ( Dutch town of Haarlem ) , and Brooklyn ( Dutch town of Breukelen ) . Few buildings , however , remain from the 17th century . The oldest recorded house still in existence in New York City , the Pieter Claesen Wyckoff House in Brooklyn , dates from 1652 . </P> <P> The new British rulers of the formerly Dutch New Amsterdam and New Netherland renamed the settlement New York . The colony benefited enormously within the burgeoning global British Empire and its population grew exponentially and prospered . The Bolting Act of 1678 , whereby no mill outside the city was permitted to grind wheat or corn , boosted growth until its repeal in 1694 , increasing the number of houses over the period from 384 to 983 . </P> <P> In the context of the Glorious Revolution in England , Jacob Leisler led Leisler 's Rebellion and effectively controlled the city and surrounding areas from 1689 -- 1691 , before being arrested and executed . </P> View of New York Harbor , c. 1770 <P> By 1700 , the Lenape population of New York had diminished to 200 . The Dutch West Indies Company transported African slaves to the post as trading laborers used to build the fort and stockade , and some gained freedom under the Dutch . After the British took over the colony and city in 1664 , they continued to import slaves from Africa and the Caribbean . In 1703 , 42 % of the New York households had slaves ; they served as domestic servants and laborers but also became involved in skilled trades , shipping and other fields . Yet following reform in ethics according to British Enlightenment thought this had diminished to less than 25 % by the 1770s slaves made up less than 25 % of the population </P> <P> By the 1740s , 20 % of the residents of New York were slaves , totaling about 2,500 people . </P> <P> After a series of fires in 1741 , the city became panicked that blacks planned to burn the city in conspiracy with some poor whites . Historians believe their alarm was mostly fabrication and fear , but officials rounded up 31 blacks and 4 whites , who over a period of months were convicted of arson . Of these , the city executed 13 blacks by burning them alive and hanged 4 whites and 18 blacks . </P> <P> In 1754 , Columbia University was founded under charter by George II of Great Britain as King 's College in Lower Manhattan . </P> <H3> American Revolution ( edit ) </H3> George Washington enters New York in triumph following the British evacuation of America . <P> The Stamp Act and other British measures fomented dissent , particularly among Sons of Liberty who maintained a long - running skirmish with locally stationed British troops over Liberty Poles from 1766 to 1776 . The Stamp Act Congress met in New York City in 1765 in the first organized resistance to British authority across the colonies . After the major defeat of the Continental Army in the Battle of Long Island in late 1776 , General George Washington withdrew to Manhattan Island , but with the subsequent defeat at the Battle of Fort Washington the island was effectively left to the British . The city became a haven for loyalist refugees , becoming a British stronghold for the entire war . Consequently , the area also became the focal point for Washington 's espionage and intelligence - gathering throughout the war . </P> <P> New York City was greatly damaged twice by fires of suspicious origin during British military rule . The city became the political and military center of operations for the British in North America for the remainder of the war and a haven for Loyalist refugees . Continental Army officer Nathan Hale was hanged in Manhattan for espionage . In addition , the British began to hold the majority of captured American prisoners of war aboard prison ships in Wallabout Bay , across the East River in Brooklyn . More Americans lost their lives from neglect aboard these ships than died in all the battles of the war . British occupation lasted until November 25 , 1783 . George Washington triumphantly returned to the city that day , as the last British forces left the city . </P> <H3> Federal and early America : 1784 -- 1854 ( edit ) </H3> Main article : History of New York City ( 1784 -- 1854 ) Norman Friend .

In 1789 , New York City became the first national capital of the United States under the new United States Constitution . The Constitution also created the current Congress of the United States , and its first sitting was at Federal Hall on Wall Street . The first United States Supreme Court sat there . The United States Bill of Rights was drafted and ratified there . George Washington was inaugurated at Federal Hall . New York City remained the capital of the U.S. until 1790 , when the role was transferred to Philadelphia . </P> <P> During the 19th century , the city was transformed by immigration , a visionary development proposal called the Commissioners ' Plan of 1811 which expanded the city street grid to encompass all of Manhattan , and the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 , which connected the Atlantic port to the vast agricultural markets of the Midwestern United States and Canada . By 1835 , New York City had surpassed Philadelphia as the largest city in the United States . New York grew as an economic center , first as a result of Alexander Hamilton 's policies and practices as the first Secretary of the Treasury . </P> <P> In 1842 , water was piped from a reservoir to supply the city for the first time . </P> <P> The Great Irish Famine ( 1845 -- 1850 ) brought a large influx of Irish immigrants , and by 1850 the Irish comprised one quarter of the city 's population .

Surgery is not generally advised in most cases if the hernia produces no symptoms ; watchful waiting being the recommended option . In particular , elective surgery is no longer recommended for the treatment of minimally symptomatic hernias due to the significant risk ( > 10 % ) of chronic pain ( Post herniorraphy pain syndrome ) and the low risk of incarceration ( ca . 2 % per year ) . However , considering that the `` elective ( inguinal ) hernia surgery offers value - for - money '' and the `` symptoms will likely progress and an operation will be needed eventually '' , `` surgery might be superior to `` watchful waiting '' `` . </P> <P> As general advice in surgery , the choice of the surgeon and hospital are more important than the choice of a particular surgical technique or material . High - volume hospitals and surgeons have better outcomes . </P> <P> In particular for inguinal hernias , surgeons with more than 200 interventions per year are preferable . Regarding the surgical technique for inguinal hernias , laparoscopic is better than open repair . Anyway , an expert surgeon in open surgery is preferable to a non-expert one in laparoscopic surgery . In particular , `` recurrence rates with laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair are highly operator dependent '' . The learning curve for laparoscopic techniques has been estimated to be 50 - 100 interventions . However , at least the totally extra-peritoneal ( TEP ) hernia repair is safe when performed by supervised senior surgical trainees . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Mesh repairs <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Open repair ( Lichtenstein , Shouldice , Bassini ) </Li> <Li> 1.2 Laparoscopic repair </Li> <Li> 1.3 Meshes <Ul> <Li> 1.3. 1 Permanent mesh <Ul> <Li> 1.3. 1.1 Commercial mesh </Li> <Li> 1.3. 1.2 Mosquito - net mesh </Li> <Li> 1.3. 1.3 Complications </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 1.3. 2 Absorbable mesh </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Suture repairs <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Tension repairs <Ul> <Li> 2.1. 1 Bassini </Li> <Li> 2.1. 2 McVay / Cooper 's ligament </Li> <Li> 2.1. 3 Shouldice </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2.2 Tension - free repairs <Ul> <Li> 2.2. 1 Desarda </Li> <Li> 2.2. 2 Guarnieri </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Mesh repairs ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Open repair ( Lichtenstein , Shouldice , Bassini ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> The most commonly performed inguinal hernia repair today is the Lichtenstein repair .

It involves the placement of a mesh to strengthen the inguinal region . Patients typically go home within a few hours of surgery , often requiring no medication beyond paracetamol ( Tylenol / acetaminophen ) . Patients are encouraged to walk as soon as possible postoperatively , and they can usually resume most normal activities within a week or two of the operation . Complications include chronic pain ( varying from 6.9 to 11.7 % for expert surgeons and from 18.1 to 39.4 % for non-expert ones ) , foreign - body sensation , stiffness , ischemic orchitis , testicular atrophy , dysejaculation , anejaculation or painful ejaculation in around 12 % .

When performed by a surgeon experienced in hernia repair , laparoscopic repair causes fewer complications than Lichtenstein , particularly less chronic pain . However , if the surgeon is experienced in general laparoscopic surgery but not in the specific subject of laparoscopic hernia surgery , laparoscopic repair is not advised as it causes more recurrence risk than Lichtenstein while also presenting risks of serious complications , as organ injury . Indeed , the TAPP approach needs to go through the abdomen . All that said , many surgeons are moving to laparoscopic methodologies as they cause smaller incisions , resulting in less bleeding , less infection , faster recovery , reduced hospitalization , and reduced chronic pain . </P> <Table> Laparoscopic mesh surgery , as compared to open mesh surgery <Tr> <Th> Advantages </Th> <Th> Disadvantages </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Quicker recovery </Li> <Li> Less pain during first days </Li> <Li> Fewer postoperative complications </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> such as infections , bleeding and seromas </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Less risk of chronic pain </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Needs surgeon highly experienced </Li> </Ul> <P> ( > 200 operations / year ) in inguinal hernia repairs </P> <Ul> <Li> Longer operating time </Li> <Li> Increased recurrence of primary hernias if </Li> </Ul> <P> surgeon not experienced enough </P> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> There is no difference in cost between laparoscopic and open repair as the increased costs of operation are offset by the decreased recovery period .

Permanent mesh ( edit ) Commercial mesh ( edit ) Polypropylene mesh used for inguinal hernia surgery <P> Commercial meshes are typically made of polypropylene or polyester . Marlex , Gore - Tex or Teflon meshes are sold by some companies . Lightweight meshes seem to cause less discomfort than heavyweight meshes . Some repair kits combine a plug and a patch . Some plug - and - patch kits combine an absorbable plug with a nonabsorbable patch , like Bio-A , manufactured by W.L. Gore & Associates . </P> Mosquito - net mesh ( edit ) <P> Meshes made of mosquito net cloth , in copolymer of polyethylene and polypropylene have been used for low - income patients in rural India and Ghana . Each piece costs $0.01 , 3700 times cheaper than an equivalent commercial mesh . They give results identical to commercial meshes in terms of infection and recurrence rate at 5 years . </P> <P> Therefore , it remains to be shown that despite their considerably higher cost , standard commercial meshes could offer any practical improvement over mosquito - net cloth in inguinal hernia surgery . </P> Complications ( edit ) See also : Post herniorraphy pain syndrome <P> Complications are frequent ( > 10 % ) . They include , but are not limited to : foreign - body sensation , chronic pain , ejaculation disorders , mesh migration , mesh folding ( meshoma ) , infection , adhesion formation , erosion into intraperitoneal organs . Such complications usually become apparent weeks to years after the initial repair , presenting as abscess , fistula , or bowel obstruction . </P> <P> In the long term , polypropylene meshes face degradation , due to heat effects . This increases the risk of stiffness and chronic pain . Persistent inflammation and increased cell turnover at the mesh - tissue interface raised the possibility of cancer transformation . </P> <P> Cases of obstructive azoospermia have been related with the use of polypropylene mesh , due to the obstruction of the vas deferens as a result of the fibroblastic reaction to the mesh . However , a recent study finds that this risk seems to be less than 1 % and therefore , it does not need to be notified in an informed consent . </P> Absorbable mesh ( edit ) Main article : Biomesh <P> Biomeshes are increasingly popular since their first use in 1999 and their subsequent introduction on the market in 2003 . Their use is an instance of regenerative medicine . Unlike synthetic non-absorbable meshes , they are absorbable , and can be used for repair in an infected environment , such as an incarcerated hernia . Moreover , they seem to improve comfort and presumably , they reduce the risk of inguinodynia . They have been tested after mesh - related inguinodynia . Some meshes have a price comparable to the high end of synthetic meshes , the cheapest ( $500 ) being Surgisis - Biodesign , manufactured by Cook Group , made from the extra cellular matrix of pig small intestinal submucosa . Currently , there exists one synthetic totally absorbable mesh , Tigr Matrix , manufactured by Novus Scientific , on the US market ( 510 ( k ) Food and Drug Administration clearance ) since 2010 and on the EU market since 2011 . It only has one 3 - year pre-clinical evidence on sheep . </P> <P> Though their benefit is not fully established yet , the market for biological meshes is exploding , and if the current trend is confirmed , they may replace synthetic meshes in the US by 2016 </P> <H2> Suture repairs ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Tension repairs ( edit ) </H3> Bassini ( edit ) Bassini technique , first suture. 1 . Aponeurosis musculi obliq . ext. ; 2 . Musculus obliquus internus ; 3 . Musculus transversalis ; 4 . Fascia transversalis ; 5 . Peritoneum ; 6 . Ligamentum inguinale . <P> The first efficient inguinal hernia repair was described by Edoardo Bassini in the 1880s . The Bassini technique is a `` tension '' repair , in which the edges of the defect are sewn back together , without any mesh . In the Bassini technique , the conjoint tendon ( formed by the distal ends of the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles ) is approximated to the inguinal ligament and closed . Today , Bassini 's main interest is historical . It remains performed in some developing countries , if surgeons do not have knowledge of the mosquito - net alternative to commercial meshes in Lichtenstein repair , or if they ignore more efficient suture - based repairs . </P> McVay / Cooper 's ligament ( edit ) <P> The floor of the canal is reinforced by approximating the transversus abdominal aponeurosis and transverse fascia to pectineal ( Cooper 's ) ligament medially from the pubic tubercle to the femoral vein . Lateral to this the floor is restored by approximating the femoral sheath to the inguinal ligament . It is also used in femoral hernia repairs . </P> Shouldice ( edit ) <P> The Shouldice techn\n\nQuestion:\nwhen was mesh first used for hernia repair\n", "answer": "1999"}

Since 2016 , it has been implemented in China . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 China </Li> <Li> 2 Hong Kong </Li> <Li> 3 Iran </Li> <Li> 4 Singapore </Li> <Li> 5 United Kingdom </Li> <Li> 6 Vietnam <Ul> <Li> 6.1 History </Li> <Li> 6.2 Administration </Li> <Li> 6.3 Current status </Li> <Li> 6.4 Effects of this policy <Ul> <Li> 6.4. 1 Reduction of the birthrate </Li> <Li> 6.4. 2 Sex - based differences </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6.5 Criticism <Ul> <Li> 6.5. 1 Inadequate contraceptives </Li> <Li> 6.5. 2 Increased abortion </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 Further reading </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> China ( edit ) </H2> <P> During the 1970s , Chinese citizens were encouraged to have only one child . The ongoing Cultural Revolution and the strain it placed on the nation were large factors . During this time , the birth rate dropped from nearly 6 children per woman to just under 3 . ( The colloquial term `` births per woman '' is usually formalized as the Total Fertility Rate ( TFR ) , a technical term in demographic analysis meaning the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime if she were to experience the exact current age - specific fertility rates through her lifetime . ) </P> <P> As China 's youngest generation ( born under the one - child policy , which first became a requirement for most couples in 1979 ) came of age for formation of the next generation , a single child would be left with having to provide support for his or her two parents and four grandparents . In response to this issue , by 2009 all provinces allowed couples to have two children if both parents were only children themselves . After a policy change of the Chinese government in late 2013 , most Chinese provinces further relaxed the policy in 2014 by allowing families to have two children if one of the parents is an only child . </P> <P> Han Chinese living in rural areas were often permitted to have two children , as exceptions existed if the first child was a daughter . Because of cases such as these , as well as urban couples who simply paid a fine ( or `` social maintenance fee '' ) to have more children , the overall fertility rate of mainland China is , in fact , closer to two children per family than to one child per family ( 1.8 ) . In addition , since 2012 , Han Chinese in southern Xinjiang were allowed to have two children . This , along with incentives and restrictions against higher Muslim Uyghur fertility , was seen as attempt to counter the threat of Uyghur separatism . </P> <P> On October 29 , 2015 , Xinhua reported the change in the existing law to a two - child policy citing a statement from the Communist Party of China . The new policy allowing Chinese couples to have two children was proposed in order to help address the aging issue in China . On December 27 , 2015 , the new law was passed in the session of the National People 's Congress Standing Committee , which governs country 's laws , effective from January 1 , 2016 . </P> <H2> Hong Kong ( edit ) </H2> In Hong Kong , the Two is Enough campaign in the 1970s encouraged people to have two or fewer children in each family , contributing to the reduced birth rate in the following decades ( poster with actress Fung Bo Bo ) See also : Demographics of Hong Kong <P> In British Hong Kong , the Eugenics League was founded in 1936 , which became The Family Planning Association of Hong Kong in 1950 . The organization provides family planning advice , sex education , and birth control services to the general public of Hong Kong . In the 1970s due to the rapidly rising population , it launched the `` Two is Enough '' campaign , which reduced the general birth rate through educational means . The organization founded the International Planned Parenthood Federation , with its counterparts in seven other countries . The total fertility rate in Hong Kong is currently 1.04 children per woman , one of the lowest in the world . Although the `` Two is Enough '' campaign found widespread approval , it does not reflect current government policy in supporting families . Tax allowances of 100,000 HK $ per child can be claimed for up to 9 children . Furthermore , parents who have fallen into hardship can apply for special assistance from the state . This is a means - tested financial benefit , which is not limited to a particular number of children either . </P> <H2> Iran ( edit ) </H2> <P> Iranian authorities encouraged families in Iran not to have more than two children when conducting Family planning in Iran from early 1990s to late 2006 . Iran 's government `` declared that Islam favored families with only two children '' , as one historian put it . when the family planning program initiated where Iran 's Health Ministry launched a nationwide campaign and introduced contraceptives - pills , condoms , IUDs , implants , tubal ligations , and vasectomies . Starting in 2006 , the government 's population control policy changed when Ahmadinejad called for reversal of Iran 's existing policy of `` two children is enough '' and later in 2012 Ayatollah Khamenei also stated that Iran 's contraceptive policy made sense 20 years ago , `` but its continuation in later years was wrong ... Scientific and experts studies show that we will face population aging and reduction ( in population ) if the birth - control policy continues . '' </P> <H2> Singapore ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Population control in Singapore <P> In Singapore , the two - child policy until the 1980s was called `` Stop at Two '' . </P> <H2> United Kingdom ( edit ) </H2> <P> In July 2007 , the think tank Optimum Population Trust ( now Population Matters ) advocated what the Daily Mail described as a `` ' two - child ' policy '' to combat population increases and climate change in the United Kingdom . The article stated : </P> <P> `` According to the report , published by the Optimum Population Trust , Britain 's high birth rate is a major factor in the current level of climate change , which can only be combated if families voluntarily limit the number of children they have . '' </P> <P> In October 2012 , the Conservative Party 's proposed policy of only paying child benefit for the first two children of unemployed parents has been described as a ' two - child policy ' , and has been fronted by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and former leader of the Conservative Party Iain Duncan Smith . </P> <P> In April 2015 , David Cameron denied any such plans to cut child benefits or tax credits . However , three months later , George Osborne , the then Finance Minister , announced that child tax credits would be limited to the first two children only . This was to come into force from the 2017 / 2018 financial year and apply to children born after that date only . </P> <P> The two - child policy took effect on 5 April 2017 . One particular aspect of the new rules , termed the `` rape clause '' , has caused controversy . Although the policy excludes all but the first two children from all available benefits , an exemption can be applied for if the conception of the third and any further children occurred as a result of the rape of the claimant . A woman wishing to claim this exemption must fill in an eight - page form : </P> <P> `` The form requires women wanting to be eligible for the exemption to sign a declaration saying they were raped or otherwise coerced into sex -- and giving the child 's name . They must sign a declaration reading : ' I believe the non-consensual conception exemption applies to my child . ' They must also sign another declaration that says : ' I confirm that I am not living with the other parent of this child . ' '' </P> <P> That the woman must thereby identify the child in question ( which is thought to be assigned a tax code created for this exemption ) , that first or second children conceived by rape do not count towards this exemption and that women who are still living with their abusers are not eligible are just some of the aspects of the rape clause that caused widespread condemnation . Ruth Graham , writing for Slate , summarises the issues surrounding this new policy thus : </P> <P> `` The policy and the exemption have received harsh criticism from a wide variety of sources since they were announced in 2015 . One member of parliament called the exemption implementation ' inhumane and barbaric . ' Feminists have pointed out the cuts disproportionately affect women . A coalition of the U.K. 's largest Christian denominations and Jewish groups pointed out that the policy discriminates against people whose religion compels them to have larger families . A United Nations committee on children 's rights asked the British government to explain the policy last year , because of concerns about women having to somehow prove they were raped . '' </P> <H2> Vietnam ( edit ) </H2> <P> Vietnam has had a population policy for over 50 years . It was launched by the Vietnamese government in the early 1960s in North Vietnam and continues in a modified form today throughout united Vietnam . The policy emphasizes the official family - size goal to be m\u1ed9t ho\u1eb7c hai con , which means `` one or two children . '' </P> <P> In 2014 Vietnam had an estimated population of 92.5 million people , which represented 1.28 % of the total world population . Currently , the total fertility rate of Vietnam is 1.8 ( births per woman ) , which is below the replacement - level fertility of 2.1 , the rate `` at which a population exactly replaces itself from one generation to the next '' according to the World Resources Institute . </P> <H3> History ( edit ) </H3> <P> From 1954 to 1975 , Vietnam was split into North and South Vietnam along the 17th parallel with separate governments and policies in each region . North Vietnam became the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and had a communist government , whereas South Vietnam became the Republic of Vietnam and was more aligned with the United States and other Western nations . In 1963 , North Vietnam began a policy advocating a two - or - three - child norm due to the sharp population increase of the largely poor and rural population . Vietnam 's family planning policy was developed before those of other countries , such as China and India , the government used a system of information , education , communication ( IEC ) campaign and publicly accessible contraceptives to curb the population . After the reunification of North and South Vietnam in 1975 under the Communist Party , there was a governmental effort to extend the policies of the North to the rest of Vietnam , which extended into the next decade . Though the government of the Republic of Vietnam adopted family planning in general as the official state policy , inadequate medical facilities prevented the policy from being effectively implemented . </P> <P> In 1982 , the Vietnam government practiced various family planning measures , including the allowance of use of abortion and the creation of the National Committee for Population and Family Planning . After 1983 , each family was required to limit the number of children to two . In 1985 , the government increased incentives , such as contraceptives and abortion acceptors , and disincentives , such as penalties for violations in family planning . </P> <P> In 1986 , the Party implemented the Renovation ( \u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi ) Policy , which completely reversed the Communist Party economy to implement capitalistic market ideals . The aims of the Renovation Policy were to end Vietnam 's economic isolation , increase competitiveness , and raise living standards . In an attempt to effectively develop the population socioeconomically and increase the standard of living within the population , the Vietnam government emphasized the need to contain birth rates . In 1988 , Council of Ministers issued an in - depth family planning policy , adding additional restrictions beyond the previous restriction of keeping the maximum number of children per household to two . The detailed one - or - two - child policy of Vietnam was established nine years after China 's one - child policy was implemented , and elements of China 's policy are reflected in Vietnam 's , such as the emphasis on marrying later , postponing childbearing age ( 22 - years of age or older for women and 24 - years of age or older for men ) , and spacing out birth of children ( 3 -- 5 years apart ) . The state was required to supply free birth control devices ( such as intrauterine loops , condoms , and birth control pills ) and to provide facilities for individuals who are eligible for abortions . Furthermore , if families did not comply with the two - child policy , they were required to pay high fees and were unable to move into urban centers . </P> <P> In 1993 , the Vietnamese government issued the first formalization for the unified Vietnam of the one - to - two child policy as a mandatory national policy .

The 1974 television film called Wonder Woman directed by Vincent McEveety and starring Cathy Lee Crosby , was a pilot for an intended television series being considered by ABC . Ratings were described as `` respectable but not exactly wondrous , '' and ABC did not pick up the pilot . Instead , Warner Bros. and ABC developed the 1975 television series , Wonder Woman , that fit the more traditional presentation of the character as created by William Moulton Marston , turning away from the 1968 -- 72 era that had influenced the pilot . Wonder Woman , which premiered in 1975 , starred Lynda Carter and eventually led to the full series .

Keen to make a distinction from the last pilot , producers gave the pilot the rather paradoxical title The New Original Wonder Woman . Scripting duties were given to Stanley Ralph Ross , who was instructed to be more faithful to the comic book and to create a subtle `` high comedy . '' Ross set the pilot in World War II , the era in which the original comic book began . </P> <P> After an intensive talent search , Lynda Carter , who had had a handful of minor acting roles and had been the 1972 Miss World USA and a Bob Hope USO cast member , was chosen for the lead role . For the role of Steve Trevor , the producers chose Lyle Waggoner , despite his dark brown , almost - black , hair not matching the comic 's blond Trevor , who at the time was better known as a comedic actor after several years co-starring in The Carol Burnett Show . He was also known to Ross as having been one of the leading candidates to play Batman a decade earlier , but instead Adam West was signed . Waggoner was also considered a pin - up hunk , having done a semi-nude pictorial in the first issue of Playgirl . </P> <P> Although the pilot followed the original comic book closely , in particular the aspect of Wonder Woman joining the military under the name Diana Prince , a number of elements were dropped . It mainly omitted Diana 's origin , including her birth on Paradise Island . The comic book Diana obtains the credentials of a look - alike nurse . Although the pilot shows Diana briefly as a nurse at one point , Diana takes on the identity of a Navy Yeoman Petty Officer First Class . </P> <P> One change , which was later to become synonymous with the show , was the transformation of Diana Prince into Wonder Woman by spinning . During the filming of the pilot , producers were trying to figure out a way to show how Diana Prince became Wonder Woman , when Carter suggested that she do a spin . </P> <P> Unlike the earlier pilot , the comic - book origins of the character were emphasized by the retention of the character 's traditional uniform ( the design of which was interpreted and executed by Donald Lee Feld , credited as `` Donfeld '' ) with the original setting and through the use of comic book elements . The series 's title sequence was animated in the form of a series of comic book panels featuring Wonder Woman performing a variety of heroic feats . Within the show , location and exposition were handled through comic book - style text panels . Transitions between scenes and commercial breaks were marked by animated starburst sequences . </P> Synopsis ( edit ) <P> In early 1942 , during the Second World War , American pilot Major Steve Trevor ( Waggoner ) bails out during an air battle over the Bermuda Triangle , location of Paradise Island . The island is home to the Amazons : beautiful , ageless women with great strength , agility , and intelligence . Amazon princess Diana ( Carter ) rescues the handsome unconscious Trevor and helps nurse him back to health . Her mother , the Amazon queen ( Cloris Leachman ; succeeded by Carolyn Jones and Beatrice Straight in later episodes ) , decrees that Olympic - style games shall be held to select one Amazon to return Trevor back to America . But she forbids her own daughter Diana , the princess , to participate . Diana states that since she is not allowed to participate , she does not want to be present for the games and will take a retreat to the other side of the island . The games are held with participants wearing masks and numbers , shown as Roman numerals in triangles on white sleeveless short tunic - dresses . Among the contestants is a blonde Amazon . During the events , the blonde Amazon shows exceptional skills and she ties for first with another Amazon . To break the deadlock , the `` bullets and bracelets '' event is decided as the tiebreaker , wherein each of the women takes turns shooting at the other ; the one being shot at must deflect the bullets with her bulletproof bracelets . The blond woman wins the event , superficially injuring her opponent 's arm . When she is pronounced the winner , she removes her mask and wig and reveals that she is Diana . Her mother , though initially shocked , relents and allows her to go to America . </P> <P> Diana 's uniform as Wonder Woman , designed by Queen Hippolyta , features emblems of America , the land to which she will be returning Steve Trevor . A golden belt will be the source of her strength and power while away from Paradise Island . She has her bullet - deflecting bracelets and also receives a golden lasso which is unbreakable and forces people to obey and tell the truth when bound with it . As shown later in flashback , Hippolyta also teaches Diana how to transform her clothes magically into the uniform . </P> <P> Diana , as Wonder Woman , flies to Washington , D.C. in an invisible plane . After dropping Trevor off at a hospital , the heroine stumbles upon a bank robbery , which she stops . A theatrical agent who sees her in action offers to help make her bullets and bracelets act a stage attraction . Diana is hesitant , but needing money in this new society , she agrees . </P> <P> Meanwhile , Trevor 's civilian secretary Marcia ( Stella Stevens ) is a double agent for the Nazi Fifth Columnists . She seeks to aid top spies in killing Trevor and opposing this new threat , Wonder Woman . Her first attempt is arranging for an accomplice to fire a machine gun at Wonder Woman during her stage act . Later , as spy activities increase , Trevor leaves the hospital but gets in a fight and is captured , prompting his `` nurse '' Diana to come to his rescue . Wonder Woman defeats Marcia in an extended fight sequence in the War Department . Having defeated Marcia , Wonder Woman thwarts a Nazi pilot who had plans to bomb the Brooklyn Navy Yard by using her invisible plane , and she rescues Trevor . With Marcia and the spy ring defeated , the film closes as Trevor and Brigadier General Blankenship talk about Trevor 's new secretary whom Blankenship selected not only for her outstanding clerical test scores , but her decidedly plain appearance in contrast to Marcia : the bespectacled Yeoman First Class Diana Prince USNR ( WR ) , Wonder Woman in disguise . </P> <H3> Season 1 ( edit ) </H3> <P> The pilot film aired on November 7 , 1975 , was a ratings success , and ABC quickly authorized the production of two one - hour specials which aired in April 1976 . These three productions would later be considered part of the show 's first season . The episodes scored strong ratings , and ABC ordered an additional 11 episodes for the new 1976 -- 77 TV season . The network began airing the episodes every few weeks apart at the beginning of the TV season in September 1976 . After mid-December 1976 , episodes aired on a weekly basis until mid-February 1977 . </P> <P> A few cast changes were made between the specials and the series . Former Happy Days recurring actress Beatrice Colen joined the cast as Corporal Etta Candy WAAC , General Blankenship 's secretary , thereby providing YN1 Prince with a subordinate . Three episodes featured Debra Winger as Diana 's younger sister , Drusilla , a.k.a. Wonder Girl , in one of her earliest acting roles . </P> <P> One of the most memorable aspects of the show that was developed during the first season was the transformation sequence that changed Diana Prince into her superheroine alter ego . The sequence in the original specials employed a slow fade between two synchronized shots , both filmed with an overcranked camera to create a slow motion effect . A twirling Diana Prince 's hair would fall loose as the shot transitioned to a twirling Wonder Woman holding her Diana clothes , which she would stow nearby in a closet or locker . ( How she changes back to Diana is never shown , although presumably she must return to the location to retrieve her clothes . ) To ensure both segments transitioned smoothly the camera was locked off ( secured in place ) while Carter 's clothing , make - up , and hair was altered between identities , a process Carter said on a DVD commentary typically took about 45 minutes . The spinning transformation was later incorporated into the comics and into animated appearances such as Justice League Unlimited . ( Prior to the series in which Carter starred , the transformation was depicted in the comics by way of Diana spinning her magic lasso around her body , with the lasso changing her clothes , or by simply changing at super-human speed . ) </P> <P> The iconic explosion overlay most associated with the TV show was introduced after the third episode to mask the cut point between the Diana and Wonder Woman clips , meaning they no longer needed to be perfectly aligned .

I have some rules that I want you to follow , but if you follow them I will give you the names of people that I have worked with , during the 20 years that I have been a fugitive . '' ' So , there was a real world influence that affected the shaping of the show that was already being thought about . How can you put someone that you do n't trust in the center of a show about trying to find criminals ? And here was an example in the real world of just such a person . It was a fortuitous turn of events , where the idea for a show was being considered , and then here comes a real life story that helped give it some shape . </Td> <Td> '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> NBC bought the rights to The Blacklist from Sony Pictures Television in August 2012 and greenlighted the show in January 2013 . During an NBC upfront presentation in May 2013 , it was announced that The Blacklist was NBC 's highest - testing drama in 10 years . </P> <H3> Casting ( edit ) </H3> <P> Eisendrath said the casting process was difficult . In February 2013 , NBC offered Kiefer Sutherland the lead role of Raymond Reddington . After considering other actors for the role , Eisendrath and Bokenkamp called James Spader to see if he would be interested in it . Feeling confident in Spader 's understanding of the character , they cast him three days before filming began . </P> <P> Megan Boone took a week to prepare for her audition as FBI profiler Elizabeth Keen . Feeling like her initial audition was one of the better auditions of her career , Boone later was called back for multiple auditions . In March 2013 , Deadline Hollywood reported that Boone accepted the role as the female lead in the series . </P> <H3> Filming locations and technique ( edit ) </H3> <P> Despite being set in Washington , D.C. , the series is mainly filmed in the same Manhattan studio where Law & Order was filmed for 20 years . Producer Richard Heus said they chose to film specific Washington , D.C. locations for the series , including the Lincoln Memorial , the Washington Monument , and the National Mall , because they were `` iconic American locations '' . </P> <P> The series is filmed in 4K using Sony PMW - F55 cameras that are adapted to use Panavision lenses . It is edited using Avid Media Composer , and editor Christopher Brookshire says the show has `` a very distinctive look and pace '' . An average of three cameras are used at one time , but as many as six cameras are sometimes rolling . </P> <H2> Broadcast ( edit ) </H2> <P> The series is broadcast simultaneously on Global in Canada . In New Zealand , the show premiered on TV3 on February 2 , 2014 . The second season premiered on September 23 .

On Metacritic , the first season has a score of 74 out of 100 , based on 31 critics , indicating `` generally favorable reviews '' . The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an 85 % approval rating , based on 52 reviews , with an average score of 7.18 / 10 . The consensus reads , `` James Spader is riveting as a criminal - turned - informant , and his presence goes a long way toward making this twisty but occasionally implausible crime procedural compelling '' . The second season received a rating of 80 % , based on 15 reviews , with an average score of 7.77 / 10 . The consensus reads , `` Though The Blacklist flirts with narrative overload , it 's held together by James Spader 's scenery - eating performance and wildly entertaining action . '' The third season received a rating of 93 % , based on 14 reviews , with an average score of 7.41 / 10 . The consensus reads , `` The Blacklist is back in top form with fresh dangers that put Red on the ropes while giving James Spader room to shine . '' The fourth season received a rating of 88 % , based on eight reviews , with an average score of 7 / 10 . The fifth season received a rating of 100 % , based on five reviews , with an average score of 8.5 / 10 . </P> <P> David Wiegand of the San Francisco Chronicle said about the pilot , `` You think you know this situation and how it will turn out , but there are surprising , yet entirely credible , twists throughout Monday 's episode '' . Robert Bianco of USA Today said , `` The Blacklist is a solid weekly crime show built around a genuine TV star . That 's the kind of series the networks have to be able to pull off to survive . And with Spader in command , odds are NBC will '' . Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter praised both Spader 's performance and the procedural elements of the show , writing `` there 's an overarching element to the premise as well that makes it intriguing without making it overly complicated .

The aim of such efforts is to eradicate cancer as a major cause of death . The signing of the National Cancer Act of 1971 by United States president Richard Nixon is generally viewed as the beginning of this effort , though it was not described as a `` war '' in the legislation itself . </P> <P> Despite significant progress in the treatment of certain forms of cancer ( such as childhood leukemia ) , cancer in general remains a major cause of death 40 + years after this war on cancer began , leading to a perceived lack of progress and to new legislation aimed at augmenting the original National Cancer Act of 1971 . New research directions , in part based on the results of the Human Genome Project , hold promise for a better understanding of the genetic factors underlying cancer , and the development of new diagnostics , therapies , preventive measures , and early detection ability . However , targeting cancer proteins can be difficult , as a protein can be undruggable . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History <Ul> <Li> 1.1 National Cancer Act of 1971 </Li> <Li> 1.2 NCI Director 's Challenge </Li> <Li> 1.3 Renewed focus on cancer </Li> <Li> 1.4 Livestrong Foundation </Li> <Li> 1.5 21st Century Cancer Access to Life - Saving Early detection , Research and Treatment ( ALERT ) Act </Li> <Li> 1.6 Obama - Biden Plan to Combat Cancer </Li> <Li> 1.7 World Cancer Campaign </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Progress <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Challenges </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Modern cancer research <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Genome - based cancer research projects <Ul> <Li> 3.1. 1 The Cancer Genome Atlas </Li> <Li> 3.1. 2 Cancer Genome Project </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3.2 Cancer research supportive infrastructure </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Modern cancer treatment <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Cancer clinical trials </Li> <Li> 4.2 Targeted tumor treatment </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Public education and support </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> Main article : History of Cancer <H3> National cancer Act of 1971 ( edit ) </H3> <Table> External video <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> The Long War on Cancer , Retro Report </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The war on cancer began with the National Cancer Act of 1971 , a United States federal law . The act was intended `` to amend the Public Health Service Act so as to strengthen the National Cancer Institute in order to more effectively carry out the national effort against cancer '' . It was signed into law by President Nixon on December 23 , 1971 . </P> <P> Health activist and philanthropist Mary Lasker was instrumental in persuading the United States Congress to pass the National Cancer Act . She and her husband Albert Lasker were strong supporters of medical research . They established the Lasker Foundation which awarded people for their research . In the year of 1943 , Mary Lasker began changing the American Cancer Society to get more funding for research . Five years later she contributed to getting federal funding for the National Cancer Institute and the National Heart Institute . In 1946 the funding was around $2.8 million and had grown to over $1.4 billion by 1972 . In addition to all of these accomplishments , Mary became the president of the Lasker Foundation due to the death of her husband in 1952 . Lasker 's devotion to medical research and experience in the field eventually contributed to the passing of the National Cancer Act . </P> <P> The improved funding for cancer research has been quite beneficial over the last 40 years . In 1971 , the number of survivors in the U.S. was 3 million and as of 2007 has increased to more than 12 million . </P> <H3> NCI director 's challenge ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 2003 , Andrew von Eschenbach , the director of the National Cancer Institute ( who served as FDA Commissioner from 2006 - 2009 and is now a Director at biotechnology company BioTime ) issued a challenge `` to eliminate the suffering and death from cancer , and to do so by 2015 '' . This was supported by the American Association for Cancer Research in 2005 though some scientists felt this goal was impossible to reach and undermined von Eschenbach 's credibility . </P> <P> John E. Niederhuber , who succeeded Andrew von Eschenbach as NCI director , noted that cancer is a global health crisis , with 12.9 million new cases diagnosed in 2009 worldwide and that by 2030 , this number could rise to 27 million including 17 million deaths `` unless we take more pressing action . '' </P> <P> Harold Varmus , former director of the NIH and current director of the NCI , held a town hall meeting in 2010 in which he outlined his priorities for improving the cancer research program , including the following : </P> <Ol> <Li> reforming the clinical trials system , </Li> <Li> improving utilization of the NIH clinical center ( Mark O. Hatfield Clinical Research Center ) , </Li> <Li> readjusting the drug approval and regulation processes , </Li> <Li> improving cancer treatment and prevention , and </Li> <Li> formulating new , more specific and science - based questions . </Li> </Ol> <H3> Renewed focus on cancer ( edit ) </H3> <P> Recent years have seen an increased perception of a lack of progress in the war on cancer , and renewed motivation to confront the disease . On July 15 , 2008 , the United States Senate Committee on Health , Education , Labor , and Pensions convened a panel discussion titled , Cancer : Challenges and Opportunities in the 21st Century . It included interviews with noted cancer survivors such as Arlen Specter , Elizabeth Edwards and Lance Armstrong , who came out of retirement in 2008 , returning to competitive cycling `` to raise awareness of the global cancer burden . '' </P> <H3> Livestrong Foundation ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Livestrong Foundation created the Livestrong Global Cancer Campaign to address the burden of cancer worldwide and encourage nations to make commitments to battle the disease and provide better access to care . In April 2009 , the foundation announced that the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan pledged $300 million to fund three important cancer control initiatives -- building a cutting - edge cancer treatment and research facility , developing a national cancer control plan and creating an Office of Advocacy and Survivorship . The Livestrong Foundation encourages similar commitments from other nations to combat the disease . </P> <P> Livestrong Day is an annual event established by the LAF to serve as `` a global day of action to raise awareness about the fight against cancer . '' Individuals from around the world are encouraged to host cancer - oriented events in their local communities and then register their events with the Livestrong website . </P> <H3> 21st Century cancer access to Life - Saving early detection , research and treatment ( ALERT ) Act ( edit ) </H3> <P> The US Senate on 26 March 2009 issued a new bill ( S. 717 ) , the 21st Century Cancer Access to Life - Saving Early detection , Research and Treatment ( ALERT ) Act intended to `` overhaul the 1971 National Cancer Act . '' The bill aims to improve patient access to prevention and early detection by : </P> <Ol> <Li> providing funding for research in early detection , </Li> <Li> supplying grants for screening and referrals for treatment , and </Li> <Li> increasing access to clinical trials and information . </Li> </Ol> <H3> Obama - Biden plan to combat cancer ( edit ) </H3> <P> During their 2008 U.S. presidential campaign then Senators Barack Obama and Joe Biden published a plan to combat cancer that entailed doubling `` federal funding for cancer research within 5 years , focusing on NIH and NCI '' as well as working `` with Congress to increase funding for the Food and Drug Administration . '' Their plan would provide additional funding for : </P> <Ul> <Li> research on rare cancers and those without effective treatment options , </Li> <Li> the study of health disparities and evaluation of possible interventions , </Li> <Li> and efforts to better understand genetic factors that can impact cancer onset and outcomes . </Li> </Ul> <P> President Obama 's 2009 economic stimulus package includes $10 billion for the NIH , which funds much of the cancer research in the U.S. , and he has pledged to increase federal funding for cancer research by a third for the next two years as part of a drive to find `` a cure for cancer in our time . '' In a message published in the July 2009 issue of Harper 's Bazaar , President Obama described his mother 's battle with ovarian cancer and , noting the additional funding his administration has slated for cancer research , stated : `` Now is the time to commit ourselves to waging a war against cancer as aggressive as the war cancer wages against us . '' On 30 September 2009 , Obama announced that $1 billion of a $5 billion medical research spending plan would be earmarked for research into the genetic causes of cancer and targeted cancer treatments . </P> <P> Cancer - related federal spending of money from the 2009 Recovery Act can be tracked online . </P> <P> Prostate cancer funding has been removed from the proposed 2016 CDC budget . </P> <H3> World cancer campaign ( edit ) </H3> <P> The International Union Against Cancer ( UICC ) has organized a World Cancer campaign in 2009 with the theme , `` I love my healthy active childhood , '' to promote healthy habits in children and thereby reduce their lifestyle - based cancer risk as adults . The World Health Organization is also promoting this campaign and joins with the UICC in annually promoting World Cancer Day on 4 February . </P> <H2> Progress ( edit ) </H2> <P> Though there has been significant progress in the understanding of cancer biology , risk factors , treatments , and prognosis of some types of cancer ( such as childhood leukemia ) since the inception of the National Cancer Act of 1971 , progress in reducing the overall cancer mortality rate has been disappointing . Many types of cancer remain largely incurable ( such as pancreatic cancer ) and the overall death rate from cancer has not decreased appreciably since the 1970s . The death rate for cancer in the U.S. , adjusted for population size and age , dropped only 5 percent from 1950 to 2005 . Cancer was expected to surpass cardiovascular disease as the leading cause of death in the world by 2010 , according to the World Health Organization 's World Cancer Report 2008 . As of 2012 , WHO reported 8.2 million annual deaths from cancer Heart disease ( including both Ischaemic and hypertensive ) accounted for 8.5 million annual deaths . Stroke accounted for 6.7 million annual deaths . </P> <P> There is evidence for progress in reducing cancer mortality . Age - specific analysis of cancer mortality rates has had progress in reducing cancer mortality in the United States since 1955 . An August 2009 study found that age - specific cancer mortality rates have been steadily declining since the early 1950s for individuals born since 1925 , with the youngest age groups experiencing the steepest decline in mortality rate at 25.9 percent per decade , and the oldest age groups experiencing a 6.8 percent per decade decline . Dr. Eric Kort , the lead author of this study , claims that public reports often focus on cancer incidence rates and underappreciate the progress that has been achieved in reduced cancer mortality rates . </P> <P> The effectiveness and expansion of available therapies has seen significant improvements since the 1970s . For example , lumpectomy replaced more invasive mastectomy surgery for the treatment of breast cancer . Treatment of childhood leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia ( CML ) have undergone major advances since the war on cancer began . The drug Gleevec now cures most CML patients , compared to previous therapy with interferon , which extend\n", "answer": "1971"}

The United States and the Soviet Union each occupied a portion of the country , with the boundary between their zones of control along the 38th parallel . </P> <P> With the onset of the Cold War , negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union failed to lead to an independent and unified Korea . In 1948 , UN-supervised elections were held in the US - occupied south only . The anti-communist Syngman Rhee won the election while Kim Il - sung was appointed as the leader of North Korea by Joseph Stalin . This led to the establishment of the Republic of Korea in South Korea , which was promptly followed by the establishment of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea in North Korea . The United States supported the South , the Soviet Union supported the North , and each government claimed sovereignty over the whole Korean peninsula . </P> <P> The subsequent Korean War , which lasted from 1950 to 1953 , ended with a stalemate and has left the two Koreas separated by the Korean Demilitarized Zone ( DMZ ) up to the present day . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Historical background <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Korea under Japanese rule ( 1910 -- 1945 ) </Li> <Li> 1.2 End of World War II </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Post -- World War II <Ul> <Li> 2.1 US occupation of South Korea </Li> <Li> 2.2 Soviet occupation of North Korea </Li> <Li> 2.3 UN intervention and the formation of separate governments </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Korean War </Li> <Li> 4 Armistice </Li> <Li> 5 Post-armistice relations </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 Notes </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Historical background ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Korea under Japanese rule ( 1910 -- 1945 ) ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Korea under Japanese rule <P> When the Russo - Japanese War ended in 1905 Korea became a nominal protectorate of Japan , and was annexed by Japan in 1910 . The Korean Emperor Gojong was removed . In the following decades , nationalist and radical groups emerged , mostly in exile , to struggle for independence . Divergent in their outlooks and approaches , these groups failed to unite in one national movement . The Korean Provisional Government in China failed to obtain widespread recognition . </P> <H3> End of World War II ( edit ) </H3> Main article : World War II <P> In November 1943 , Franklin Roosevelt , Winston Churchill and Chiang Kai - shek met at the Cairo Conference to discuss what should happen to Japan 's colonies , and agreed that Japan should lose all the territories it had conquered by force . In the declaration after this conference , Korea was mentioned for the first time . The three powers declared that they were , `` mindful of the enslavement of the people of Korea , ... determined that in due course Korea shall become free and independent . '' Roosevelt floated the idea of a trusteeship over Korea , but did not obtain agreement from the other powers . Roosevelt raised the idea with Joseph Stalin at the Tehran Conference in November 1943 and the Yalta Conference in February 1945 . Stalin did not disagree , but advocated that the period of trusteeship be short . </P> <P> At the Tehran Conference and the Yalta Conference , the Soviet Union promised to join its allies in the Pacific War in two to three months after victory in Europe . On August 8 , 1945 , three months to the day after the end of hostilities in Europe , and two days after the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima , the Soviet Union declared war on Japan . Soviet troops advanced rapidly , and the US government became anxious that they would occupy the whole of Korea . On August 10 , 1945 two young officers -- Dean Rusk and Charles Bonesteel -- were assigned to define an American occupation zone . Working on extremely short notice and completely unprepared , they used a National Geographic map to decide on the 38th parallel . They chose it because it divided the country approximately in half but would place the capital Seoul under American control . No experts on Korea were consulted . The two men were unaware that forty years before , Japan and pre-revolutionary Russia had discussed sharing Korea along the same parallel . Rusk later said that had he known , he `` almost surely '' would have chosen a different line . The division placed sixteen million Koreans in the American zone and nine million in the Soviet zone . To the surprise of the Americans , the Soviet Union immediately accepted the division . The agreement was incorporated into General Order No. 1 ( approved on 17 August 1945 ) for the surrender of Japan . </P> <P> Soviet forces began amphibious landings in Korea by August 14 and rapidly took over the north - east of the country , and on August 16 they landed at Wonsan . On August 24 , the Red Army reached Pyongyang . </P> <P> General Abe Nobuyuki , the last Japanese Governor - General of Korea , had established contact with a number of influential Koreans since the beginning of August 1945 to prepare the hand - over of power . Throughout August , Koreans organized people 's committee branches for the `` Committee for the Preparation of Korean Independence '' ( CPKI , \uc870\uc120 \uac74\uad6d \uc900\ube44 \uc704\uc6d0\ud68c ) , headed by Lyuh Woon - hyung , a left - wing politician . On September 6 , 1945 , a congress of representatives was convened in Seoul and founded the short - lived People 's Republic of Korea . </P> <H2> Post -- World War II ( edit ) </H2> South Korean citizens protest Allied trusteeship in December 1945 <P> In December 1945 , at the Moscow Conference , the Allies agreed that the Soviet Union , the US , the Republic of China , and Britain would take part in a trusteeship over Korea for up to five years in the lead - up to independence . Many Koreans demanded independence immediately ; however , the Korean Communist Party , which was closely aligned with the Soviet Communist party , supported the trusteeship . </P> <P> A Soviet - US Joint Commission met in 1946 and 1947 to work towards a unified administration , but failed to make progress due to increasing Cold War antagonism and to Korean opposition to the trusteeship . Meanwhile , the division between the two zones deepened . The difference in policy between the occupying powers led to a polarization of politics , and a transfer of population between North and South . In May 1946 it was made illegal to cross the 38th parallel without a permit . At the final meeting of the Joint Commission in September 1947 , Soviet delegate Terentii Shtykov proposed that both Soviet and US troops withdraw and give the Korean people the opportunity to form their own government . This was rejected by the US . </P> <H3> US occupation of South Korea ( edit ) </H3> Main article : United States Army Military Government in Korea Lyuh Woon - hyung giving a speech in the Committee for Preparation of Korean Independence in Seoul on August 16 , 1945 <P> With the American government fearing Soviet expansion , and the Japanese authorities in Korea warning of a power vacuum , the embarkation date of the US occupation force was brought forward three times . </P> <P> On September 7 , 1945 , General Douglas MacArthur announced that Lieutenant General John R. Hodge was to administer Korean affairs , and Hodge landed in Incheon with his troops the next day . The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea , which had operated from China , sent a delegation with three interpreters to Hodge , but he refused to meet with them . Likewise , Hodge refused to recognize the newly formed People 's Republic of Korea and its People 's Committees , and outlawed it on 12 December . </P> <P> In September 1946 , thousands of laborers and peasants rose up against the military government . This uprising was quickly defeated , and failed to prevent scheduled October elections for the South Korean Interim Legislative Assembly . </P> <P> The ardent anti-communist Syngman Rhee , who had been the first president of the Provisional Government and later worked as a pro-Korean lobbyist in the US , became the most prominent politician in the South . Rhee pressured the American government to abandon negotiations for a trusteeship and create an independent Republic of Korea in the south . On July 19 , 1947 , Lyuh Woon - hyung , the last senior politician committed to left - right dialogue , was assassinated by a right - winger . </P> <P> The occupation government conducted a number of military campaigns against left - wing insurgents . Over the course of the next few years , between 30,000 and 100,000 people were killed . </P> <H3> Soviet occupation of North Korea ( edit ) </H3> Further information : Soviet Civil Administration and Provisional People 's Committee for North Korea Welcome celebration for the Red Army in Pyongyang on 14 October 1945 <P> When Soviet troops entered Pyongyang , they found a local branch of the Committee for the Preparation of Korean Independence operating under the leadership of veteran nationalist Cho Man - sik . The Soviet Army allowed these `` People 's Committees '' ( which were friendly to the Soviet Union ) to function . Colonel - General Terentii Shtykov set up the Soviet Civil Administration , taking control of the committees and placing communists in key positions . </P> <P> In February 1946 a provisional government called the Provisional People 's Committee was formed under Kim Il - sung , who had spent the last years of the war training with Soviet troops in Manchuria . Conflicts and power struggles ensued at the top levels of government in Pyongyang as different aspirants maneuvered to gain positions of power in the new government . In March 1946 the provisional government instituted a sweeping land - reform program : land belonging to Japanese and collaborator landowners was divided and redistributed to poor farmers . Organizing the many poor civilians and agricultural laborers under the people 's committees , a nationwide mass campaign broke the control of the old landed classes . Landlords were allowed to keep only the same amount of land as poor civilians who had once rented their land , thereby making for a far more equal distribution of la\n\nQuestion:\nwhen was south korea and north korea divided\n", "answer": "1945"}

ECW closed when then - owner Paul Heyman declared bankruptcy in April 2001 . The promotion showcased various international styles of professional wrestling , ranging from lucha libre to puroresu and hardcore wrestling , and became known for having an intelligent , often rowdy and vocal fanbase that rejected the more cartoonish programming of ECW 's competitors . </P> <P> After purchasing the assets of ECW in 2003 , World Wrestling Entertainment relaunched the Extreme Championship Wrestling franchise as a third brand with their existing Raw and SmackDown brands .

ECW would , in fact , continue to use the former Tri-State Heavyweight championship belt to represent its own Championship , although the ECW title was not considered a continuation of that title . In 1992 , Goodhart sold his share of the company to his partner , Tod Gordon , who in return renamed the promotion Eastern Championship Wrestling . When Eastern Championship Wrestling was founded , it was a member of the National Wrestling Alliance ( NWA ) . At the time , `` Hot Stuff '' Eddie Gilbert was the lead booker of Eastern Championship Wrestling . Gilbert , after a falling out with Tod Gordon , was replaced in September 1993 by Paul Heyman . Heyman , known on television as Paul E. Dangerously , had just left World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) and was looking for a new challenge . </P> Eastern Championship Wrestling logo . <H3> Secession from the NWA ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1994 , Jim Crockett 's non-compete agreement with Ted Turner , who purchased World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) from Crockett in November 1988 , was up and he decided to start promoting with the NWA again . Crockett went to Tod Gordon and asked him to hold a tournament for the NWA 's top prize , the NWA World Heavyweight Championship , in ECW 's home area of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania on August 27 , 1994 . NWA President Dennis Coralluzzo alleged that Crockett and Gordon were going to try to monopolize the title ( akin to Crockett 's actions in the 1980s ) and stated Crockett did not have the NWA board 's approval , which resulted in Coralluzzo personally overseeing the tournament . Gordon took offense at Coralluzzo for his power plays and began contemplating a plan to secede ECW from the NWA through a controversial and public manner that would attract attention to ECW and insult the NWA organization . Gordon planned to have Shane Douglas , who was scheduled to face 2 Cold Scorpio in the tournament finals , throw down the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt upon winning as an act of defiance . </P> <P> Tod Gordon and Paul Heyman originally planned the idea of throwing down the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt . Heyman persuaded Douglas by noting that the negative would only be that NWA traditionalists would just see them as traitors to tradition . Adding to Douglas ' decision was the animosity between Douglas and NWA President Dennis Coralluzzo , who at the time publicly criticized Douglas and told NWA affiliated bookers not to book Douglas for shows . Coralluzzo believed that Douglas was a `` bad risk '' and had the tendency to no - show events . Douglas ultimately decided to go through with Gordon and Heyman 's plan , inspired by his father 's motto of `` doing right by the people that do right by you . '' After looking up and saying , `` This is it tonight , Dad , '' Douglas threw down the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt , stating that he did not want to be champion of a `` dead promotion '' that `` died seven years ago . '' He then raised the Eastern Championship Wrestling title belt and declared it to be a World Heavyweight Championship -- calling it the only real world title left in professional wrestling . When recalling this event years later , Paul Heyman stated the following in a 1998 chat : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` </Td> <Td> The National Wrestling Alliance was old - school when old - school was n't hip anymore . We wanted to set our mark , we wanted to breakaway from the pack , we wanted to let the world know that we were n't just some independent promotion . </Td> <Td> '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Coralluzzo was interviewed after the event and declared that Douglas would be the world champion of the NWA `` whether he likes it or not '' , calling Douglas ' actions a `` disgrace '' and said he would move to have Douglas stripped of both the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and the Eastern Championship Wrestling Heavyweight Championship , calling him `` undeserving '' of both titles . Gordon made the following announcement on the next edition of NWA - ECW programming : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` </Td> <Td> I listened with great interest as the representative of the NWA board of directors took it upon himself to inform you that they have the power to force NWA - Eastern Championship Wrestling not to recognize The Franchise , Shane Douglas , as a world heavyweight champion . Well , as of noon today , I have folded NWA - Eastern Championship Wrestling . In its place will be ECW - Extreme Championship Wrestling - and we recognize The Franchise , Shane Douglas , as our World Heavyweight Champion . And we encourage any wrestler in the world today to come to the ECW to challenge for that belt . This is the ECW , Extreme Championship Wrestling , changing the face of professional wrestling . </Td> <Td> '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The promotion showcased many different styles of professional wrestling , including hardcore wrestling matches as well as lucha libre and Japanese wrestling styles . </P> <H3> ECW Arena and television syndication ( edit ) </H3> See also : ECW Hardcore TV <P> The bulk of ECW 's shows remained at the ECW Arena , a former warehouse secluded under a section of Interstate 95 . Seating comprised simple folding chairs and four sets of portable bleachers , and the whole sort of unconventional set up reflected the gritty style of the wrestling itself . Shows were actually broadcast on a Philadelphia local cable sports station ( SportsChannel America 's local affiliate , SportsChannel Philadelphia ) on Tuesday evenings . After Sports Channel Philadelphia went off the air in 1997 , the show moved to WPPX - TV 61 . It later moved to a former independent broadcast station ( WGTW 48 ) in Philadelphia on either Friday or Saturday night at 1 or 2 a.m. Shows were also aired on the MSG Network in NYC on Friday nights ( Early Saturday morning ) at 2 a.m. Due to the obscurity of the stations and ECW itself , as well as the lack of FCC oversight at that late hour , many times expletives and violence were not edited out of these showings , along with extensive use of copyrighted music and music videos . </P> <H3> Paul Heyman and cross promotion ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1995 , Tod Gordon sold ECW to his head booker , Paul Heyman . Afterward , Gordon remained in ECW as a figurehead commissioner . Years after being the ECW `` Commissioner '' , Gordon left ECW , his absence was explained on - air that he retired from wrestling due to family . Rumors circulate , however , that Gordon was fired by Heyman after he was suspected as a `` locker room mole '' for a rival wrestling promotion , helping to lure talent to World Championship Wrestling . Many years later , in an interview , Gordon claims that the `` WCW mole '' situation was nothing more than a work . </P> <P> Storyline-wise , Vince McMahon first became `` aware '' of ECW while at the 1995 King of the Ring event in ECW 's home base of Philadelphia . During the match between Mabel and Savio Vega , the crowd suddenly started to angrily chant , `` ECW ECW ECW ! '' . On September 22 , 1996 , at the In Your House : Mind Games event in Philadelphia , ECW stars The Sandman , Tommy Dreamer , Paul Heyman , and Tazz were in the front row with Sandman even interfering in one match ( when he threw beer on Savio Vega during his strap match with Bradshaw ) . McMahon acknowledged ECW 's status as a local , up and coming promotion on the air . The following night on WWF Monday Night RAW , broadcast on September 23 , 1996 , at the onset of a match between The Bodydonnas vs. The British Bulldog and Owen Hart , Bill Alfonso , and Tazz could be seen invading the program . Both Tazz and Alfonso were able to successfully jump the security rails , and Tazz was able to prominently display a bright orange sign with black lettering that read `` Sabu Fears Tazz - ECW '' . On February 24 , 1997 , ECW `` invaded '' Raw from the Manhattan Center . They advanced a storyline , plugged their first ever pay - per - view and worked three matches in front of the WWF audience while McMahon called the action with both Jerry `` The King '' Lawler and Paul Heyman . The Manhattan Center in New York was peppered with a large number of ECW fans , who gave the WWF wrestlers `` Boring ! '' chants when they felt it was warranted . Likewise , when the ECW performers arrived , they popped and introduced the WWF Monday night audience to some trademark ECW group chants . This invasion sparked an inter-promotional feud between ECW and Lawler 's United States Wrestling Association . Lawler disparaged ECW on - camera and convinced wrestlers such as Rob Van Dam and Sabu to join him in an anti-ECW crusade . Throughout 1997 , ECW wrestlers appeared on USWA television programs , and vice versa . As part of the working relationship between ECW and the WWF , a number of WWF - contracted wrestlers were sent to ECW for seasoning in 1997 , including Droz and Brakkus . </P> <P> On April 13 , 1997 ECW broadcast their first pay - per - view ( PPV ) wrestling card Barely Legal , highlighted by Terry Funk defeating Raven to win the ECW World Heavyweight Championship . In June 1997 , the company 's Wrestlepalooza ' 97 event featured Raven 's final ECW match before leaving for WCW . In this match , Tommy Dreamer finally beat Raven , his longtime nemesis . Dreamer 's celebration was short - lived , though , as Jerry Lawler , along with Sabu and Rob Van Dam showed up to attack Dreamer . This set up a match between Dreamer and Lawler at the pay - per - view , 1997 Hardcore Heaven , on August 1\n\nQuestion:\nwhen did ecw change to extreme championship wrestling\n", "answer": "1992"}

The third U.S. President ( 1801 -- 09 ) , Thomas Jefferson , is featured on the obverse of the note . The reverse features an engraving of the painting The Declaration of Independence by John Trumbull . Throughout the $2 bill 's pre-1929 life as a large - sized note , it was issued as a United States Note , National Bank Note , silver certificate , Treasury or `` Coin '' Note and Federal Reserve Bank Note . When U.S. currency was changed to its current size , the $2 bill was issued only as a United States Note . Production went on until 1966 , when the series was discontinued . Ten years passed before the $2 bill was reissued as a Federal Reserve Note with a new reverse design . Two - dollar bills are seldom seen in circulation as a result of banking policies with businesses which has resulted in low production numbers due to lack of demand . This comparative scarcity in circulation , coupled with a lack of public knowledge that the bill is still in production and circulation , has also inspired urban legends about its authenticity and value and has occasionally created problems for those trying to use the bill to make purchases . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Denomination overview </Li> <Li> 2 Rarity </Li> <Li> 3 History <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Large - sized notes </Li> <Li> 3.2 Small size notes <Ul> <Li> 3.2. 1 1928 -- 1966 </Li> <Li> 3.2. 2 1976 -- present </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3.3 Series dates <Ul> <Li> 3.3. 1 Large size </Li> <Li> 3.3. 2 Small size </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Visual snapshot </Li> <Li> 5 Usage <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Incidents </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Uncut currency sheets </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Denomination overview ( edit ) </H2> <P> The denomination of two dollars was authorized under a congressional act , and first used in March 1862 . The denomination was continuously used until the 1960s ; by this time the United States Note was the only remaining class of U.S. currency the two - dollar bill was assigned to . In 1966 it was decided to discontinue production of all United States Notes , which included the two - dollar bill . The two - dollar denomination was not immediately reassigned to the Federal Reserve Note class of United States currency and was thus fully discontinued ; the Treasury Department cited the two - dollar bill 's low use and unpopularity as the reason for not immediately resuming use of the denomination . In 1976 , production of the two - dollar denomination was resumed and the two - dollar bill was finally assigned as a Federal Reserve Note , with a new reverse design featuring John Trumbull 's depiction of the drafting of the United States Declaration of Independence replacing the previous design of Monticello . It has remained a current denomination since then . It was estimated that if the two - dollar bill replaced approximately half of the one - dollar bills in circulation , the federal government would be able to save about $26 million in 1976 dollars ( $112 million adjusted for inflation ) over the period from 1976 to 1981 , due to reduced production , storage , and shipping costs . </P> <P> However , due to their limited use , two - dollar bills are not printed as frequently in a new series as other denominations , which are produced according to demand . Some bill acceptors found in vending machines , self checkout lanes , and other automated kiosks are configured to accommodate two - dollar bills , even if the fact is not stated on the label . Although they are generally available at most banks , two - dollar bills are usually not handed out except upon specific request by the customer , and may cause a delay with a trip to the vault . </P> <H2> Rarity ( edit ) </H2> <P> Printing $2 bills is twice as cost - effective for the government as printing $1 bills , since they both cost the same amount ( about $0.05 ) to make , but the public has not circulated them as widely . During the Great Depression , few Americans had enough money to require $2 bills . In the middle of the 20th century , $2 bills were commonly used at strip clubs , for betting on horse racing , and for bribery when politicians wanted votes ( though this may be an urban legend ) and so acquired a negative reputation . The unusual reverse design of the 1976 note contributed to hoarding , and combined with the earlier discontinuation to give the impression these notes might be valuable as collector 's items , above their face value . The public at large continues to be unfamiliar with the notes because they are not being circulated widely . </P> <P> Today , there is a common misconception by the general public that the $2 bill is no longer being produced , though bills have been printed in 1996 , 1997 , 2004 , 2006 , 2012 , and 2013 . The U.S. treasury reports that $1,549,052,714 worth of $2 bills were in circulation worldwide as of April 30 , 2007 . </P> <P> Things such as unusual serial numbers ( example : A11111111A ) , and replacement notes designated by a star in the serial number can raise the collector value . `` Collectible '' two - dollar bills have been made and sold by coin dealers and others in recent years merely by adding colors and special graphics to regular issue bills by using computer printers . However , these bills are not authorized by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing ( BEP ) and are not worth anything more than face value on the collectors ' market . </P> <P> Certain conventions and tourism / convention bureaus capitalize on the scarcity of $2 bills in circulation , encouraging convention attendees and tourists to spend $2 bills in order to illustrate to the host communities the economic impact that the conventions and tourism bring . Sometimes known as `` SpendTom '' campaigns , the $2 bills linger in the community as a constant reminder . Some campaigns encourage people to participate in a hunt for the bills in order to win prizes . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Large - sized notes ( edit ) </H3> First $2 bill issued in 1862 as a Legal Tender Note . Series 1886 $2 Silver Certificate depicting Winfield Scott Hancock Series 1890 featuring James McPherson . This `` Coin Note '' was used for government purchases of silver bullion from the mining industry . <P> ( approximately 7.4218 \u00d7 3.125 in \u2245 189 \u00d7 79 mm ) </P> <P> In March 1862 , the first $2 bill was issued as a Legal Tender Note ( United States Note ) with a portrait of Alexander Hamilton ; the portrait of Hamilton used was a profile view and is not the same portrait used currently for the $10 bill . The continental congress based on defending the United States , released on June 25 , 1776 , began to authorize $2 credit , the circulation of 49,000 copies . Pass two - dollar bill was first used in March 1862 . Between 1966 and 1976 , two - dollar notes were not printed . </P> <P> By 1869 , the $2 United States Note was redesigned with the now familiar portrait of Thomas Jefferson to the left and a vignette of the United States Capitol in the center of the obverse . This note also featured green tinting on the top and left side of the obverse . Although this note is technically a United States Note , TREASURY NOTE appeared on it instead of UNITED STATES NOTE . The reverse was completely redesigned . This series was again revised in 1874 ; changes on the obverse included removing the green tinting , adding a red floral design around WASHINGTON D.C. , and changing the term TREASURY NOTE to UNITED STATES NOTE . The 1874 design was also issued as Series of 1875 and 1878 , and by 1880 , the red floral design around WASHINGTON D.C. on the United States Note was removed and the serial numbers were changed to blue . This note with the red floral design was also issued as Series of 1917 but with red serial numbers by that time . </P> <P> National Bank Notes were issued in 1875 and feature a woman unfurling a flag and a big 2 ( Lazy Duce ) on the obverse . The reverse has the king of England smoking tobacco and an eagle with a shield . </P> The second two - dollar denomination in the silver certificate series printed in 1891 . This note features United States Secretary of the Treasury William Windom . <P> In 1886 , the first $2 silver certificate with a portrait of United States Civil War General Winfield Scott Hancock on the left of the obverse was issued . This design continued until 1891 , when a new $2 Silver Certificate was issued with a portrait of U.S. Treasury Secretary William Windom in the center of the obverse . </P> <P> Two - dollar Treasury , or `` Coin '' , Notes were first issued for government purchases of silver bullion in 1890 from the silver mining industry . The reverse featured large wording of TWO in the center and a numeral 2 to the right surrounded by an ornate design that occupied almost the entire note . In 1891 , the reverse of the Series of 1890 Treasury Note was redesigned because the treasury felt that it was too `` busy '' , making it too easy to counterfeit . More open space was incorporated into the new design . </P> <P> In 1896 , the `` Educational Series '' Silver Certificate was issued . The entire obverse of the note was covered in artwork with an allegorical figure of science presenting steam and electricity to commerce and manufacture . The reverse of the note featured portraits of Robert Fulton and Samuel F.B. Morse surrounded by an ornate design that occupied almost the entire note . By 1899 , however , The $2 Silver Certificate was redesigned with a small portrait of George Washington surrounded by allegorical figures representing agriculture and mechanics . </P> Robert Fulton and Samuel Morse depicted on the reverse of the 1896 $2 ' Educational Series '' Silver Certificate . The final design of the United States ' silver certificate series featuring George Washington , printed in 1899 . <P> Large - sized Federal Reserve Bank Notes were issued in 1918 . Each note was an obligation of the issuing Federal Reserve Bank and could only be redeemed at the corresponding bank . The obverse of the note featured a borderless portrait of Thomas Jefferson to left and wording in the entire center . The reverse featured a World War I battleship . </P> <P> Beginning in the 1950s , production of $2 bills began to decrease . The relative scarcity of the bills led some to start saving any they found , with the inevitable result that the notes became rarer in circulation . Currently , the circulation of $2 bills accounts for around 1 % of the U.S. currency in circulation . </P> <H3> Small size notes ( edit ) </H3> <P> ( 6.14 \u00d7 2.61 in \u2245 156 \u00d7 66 mm ) </P> 1928 -- 1966 ( edit ) <P> In 1928 , when all U.S. currency was changed to its curren\n\nQuestion:\nwhen was the two dollar bill first printed\n", "answer": "1862"}

Camille 's flashbacks intensify when she returns and after a couple days , she goes to live with her socialite mother , Adora Crellin , stepfather , and half - sister , teenager Amma . She meets Detective Richard Willis during a search party . She then talks with Bob Nash about the disappearance of his daughter . Later that day Natalie Keene 's body is discovered in the alley behind the police station . Amma and Camille talk about their middle sister Marian , who had died when Camille was younger , and Amma secretly admits to disliking her mother 's treatment of her and behaves like a child to hide her rebellious side .

Adora , who has kept Marian 's room like a shrine , continues to belittle Camille , whom she accuses of embarrassing the family through her investigation . Camille thinks Natalie 's older brother , high school senior John , stands out in Wind Gap , and is told by neighborhood kids that `` The Woman in White '' took Natalie . Police Chief Bill Vickery implies that the boy who saw this is `` trash '' and ca n't be trusted . Camille says they used to scare each other with stories about the Woman in White abducting children but Vickery and Richard insist that Natalie and Ann were murdered by a man .

In the present , Camille interviews Bob Nash , who thinks John Keene was involved . Vickery calls Adora , who arrives and rebukes Camille while comforting Bob . Later , John Keene accuses Bob Nash of being involved . John 's girlfriend , Ashley Wheeler , is one of the few people friendly to Camille . After a conversation between Adora and Vickery , Adora warns Amma about Camille and that she is dangerous .

Between 1941 and 1947 , the Government recognized the need to maintain essential health and welfare services . The Federal Security Administrator also served as coordinator of the Office of Health , Welfare , and related Defense Activities , renamed the Office of Defense , Health , and Welfare Services in September 1941 , which provided health care , education , and related services necessitated by the war effort . It was responsible for adjusting the distribution of remaining professional personnel to meet the requirements of the population . In 1943 , the Office 's title was again changed to the Office of Community War Services , which was abolished on June 30 , 1947 . </Li> <Li> The FDA during the war was charged with maintaining food standards to insure delivery of properly tested foods and drugs to the military establishment . </Li> <Li> The Public Health Service was in charge of protecting both the general population and military personnel against epidemics and carrying out medical research . DHHS history </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> Post-wwii ( edit ) <P> Organizational Changes </P> <P> When the war ended , President Truman moved to `` strengthen the arm of the federal government for better integration of services in the fields of health , education , and welfare . '' </P> <Ul> <Li> 1946 <Ul> <Li> Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1946 , effective July 16 , 1946 , abolished the three - member Social Security Board , creating in its place , the Social Security Administration , headed by a Commissioner of Social Security . The plan transferred the Children 's Bureau ( created in 1912 ) , exclusive of its Industrial Division , from the Department of Labor to FSA , where it became part of the Social Security Administration ( SSA ) ; the US Employees Compensation Commission , formerly an independent organization , to the Office of the Administrator of FSA ; functions of the Department of Commerce regarding vital statistics to the FSA Administrator , who delegated them to the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service . </Li> <Li> Legislation of major importance to the Agency also was passed in 1946 : the National Mental Health Act ; the Vocational Education Act ; the Federal Employees Health Act ; the 1946 Amendments to the Social Security Act ; and the Hospital Survey and Construction Act . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 1947 . In 1947 , the Administrator directed the establishment of a central library , consolidating the resources of three independent libraries at the SSA , the Office of Education , and the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation . This library eventually became the central library of the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare . </Li> <Li> 1948 <Ul> <Li> By 1948 , the retail price of food had risen 114 percent over the 1935 - 39 base , yet the monthly benefits under Social Security had not changed since the 1939 amendments had established a base level . On October 1 , 1948 , increases in Social Security benefits were authorized . </Li> <Li> Other key pieces of legislation passed in 1948 included bills creating the National Heart Institute and the National Institute of Dental Research . On June 16 , 1948 , the name of the National Institute of Health was changed to the National Institutes of Health . </Li> <Li> On June 30 , 1948 , the President signed the Water Pollution Bill , delegating national water pollution responsibilities to the Public Health Service . </Li> <Li> Also in 1948 , legislation authorized the transfer of the Federal Credit Union program from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the SSA . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 1949 <Ul> <Li> The Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 gave the Federal Security Administrator authority to dispose of surplus federal propel property to tax - supported or nonprofit educational institutions for health or educational purposes . </Li> <Li> During 1949 , the Federal Security Agency began the establishment of 10 FSA regional offices to replace the 11 previously operated by the SSA and consolidated those being operated by other FSA constituents into one common regional office structure . Previous to the consolidation , constituent agencies were maintaining five and , in some cases , six independent regional offices in a single city . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 1950 <Ul> <Li> On May 24 , 1950 , Reorganization Plan No. 19 of 1950 transferred from FSA to the Department of Labor the Bureau of Employees Compensation and the Employees Compensation Appeals Board . Then , the FSA abolished the Office of Special Services that had administered the two transferred units plus the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation ( OVR ) and the Food and Drug Administration . The effect of this action was to elevate OVR and FDA to agency status . </Li> <Li> In 1950 , two important national conferences required months of staff work by FSA personnel . The Mid-century White House Conference on Children and Youth was held in Washington , D.C. in December 1950 . Nearly 6,000 representatives of 100,000 local and community groups throughout the country met to discuss the `` spiritual values , democractic practice , and the dignity and worth of the individual . '' In August of that year , a Conference on Aging was called by the FSA Administrator to study the needs and problems of the older segment of the population . </Li> <Li> In September 1950 , Congress authorized the impacted aid program - to relieve the impact on local school facilities of a heavy influx of federal civilian and military personnel - and in FY 1951 appropriated $96.5 million for school construction under P.L. 81 - 815 , September 23 , 1950 , and $23 million for school operating expenses under P.L. 81 - 874 , September 30 , 1950 . </Li> <Li> The Social Security Act Amendments of 1950 added to the social security rolls about 10 million persons who previously had been ineligible . These persons included agricultural workers and selfemployed small shop owners . Others who benefitted from the changes were the elderly and those who had job - related disabilities . This expansion of beneficiaries was made possible by revisions to the oldage and survivors insurance and long - term disability insurance sections of the original Act . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 1951 . In May 1951 , a citizens committee , the National Mid-century Committee for Children and Youth , was established to provide national follow - up to the problems discussed at the White House Conference . Staff of the Children 's Bureau worked closely with the Committee until it was dissolved in 1953 . </Li> <Li> 1952 . The year 1952 was a period of transition for FSA . Despite the contributions made by the Agency during and before the Korean War , most of the defense - related activities in FSA were being phased out . The FDA continued to study chemical and bacteriological warfare agents but other FSA components were mobilized to provide disaster relief and health care assistance to a number of foreign countries . Technical assistance , under the federal `` Point IV '' and Mutual Security Agency programs , provided needed help to many underdeveloped countries . The Agency also furnished guidance for foreign representatives sent to this country to study American programs and methods in the fields of health and education . Later in the year , FSA accelerated its response to the Nation 's social needs . </Li> <Li> 1953 . FSA Becomes DHEW <Ul> <Li> By 1953 , the Federal Security Agency 's programs in health , education , and social security had grown to such importance that its annual budget exceeded the combined budgets of the Departments of Commerce , Justice , Labor and Interior and affected the lives of millions of people . </Li> <Li> Consequently , in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949 , President Eisenhower submitted to the Congress on March 12 , 1953 , Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953 , which called for the dissolution of the Federal Security Agency and elevation of the agency to Cabinet status as the Department of Health , Education , and Welfare . All of the responsibilities of the Federal Security Administrator would be transferred to the Secretary of Health , Education , end Welfare and the components of FSA would be transferred to the Department . A major objective of the reorganization was to improve administration of the functions of the Federal Security Agency . The plan was approved April 1 , 1953 , and became effective on April 11 , 1953 . </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <P> Unlike statutes authorizing the creation of other executive departments , the contents of Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1953 were never properly codified within the United States Code , although Congress did codify a later statute ratifying the Plan . Today , the Plan is included as an appendix to Title 5 of the United States Code . The result is that HHS is the only executive department whose statutory foundation today rests on a confusing combination of several codified and uncodified statutes . </P> List of Federal Security Agency Administrators ( edit ) <Table> <Tr> <Th> Name </Th> <Th> Dates of service </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Paul V.

The Reorganization Plan abolished the FSA and transferred all of its functions to the Secretary of HEW and all components of the Agency to the Department . The first Secretary of HEW was Oveta Culp Hobby , a native of Texas , who had served as Commander of the Women 's Army Corps in World War II and was editor and publisher of the Houston Post .

L'Engle wrote repeatedly about the writing of the story and the long struggle to get it published . In A Circle of Quiet ( 1972 ) , she explains that the book was conceived `` during a time of transition . '' After years of living in rural Goshen , Connecticut , and running a general store , L'Engle's family , the Franklins , moved back to New York City , first taking a ten - week camping trip across the country and back again . L'Engle writes that `` we drove through a world of deserts and buttes and leafless mountains , wholly new and alien to me . And suddenly into my mind came the names , Mrs Whatsit . Mrs Who . Mrs Which . '' This was in the spring of 1959 . L'Engle was reading about quantum physics at the time , which also made its way into the story . When she completed the book in early 1960 , however , it was rejected by at least 26 publishers , because it was , in L'Engle's words , `` too different , '' and `` because it deals overtly with the problem of evil , and it was really difficult for children , and was it a children 's or an adults ' book , anyhow ? '' </P> <P> In `` A Special Message from Madeleine L'Engle '' on the Random House website , L'Engle explains another possible reason for the rejections : `` A Wrinkle in Time had a female protagonist in a science fiction book , '' which at the time was uncommon . After trying `` forty - odd '' publishers ( L'Engle later said `` twenty - six rejections '' ) , L'Engle's agent returned the manuscript to her . Then at Christmas , L'Engle threw a tea party for her mother . One of the guests happened to know John C. Farrar of Farrar , Straus and Giroux , and insisted that L'Engle should meet with him . Although the publisher did not , at the time , publish a line of children 's books , Farrar met L'Engle , liked the novel , and ultimately published it . </P> <P> In 1963 the book won the Newbery Medal which awarded annually by the Association for Library Service to Children , a division of the American Library Association , to the author of the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children . The book has been continuously in print since its first publication . The hardback edition is still published by Farrar , Straus & Giroux . The original blue dust jacket by Ellen Raskin was replaced with new art by Leo and Diane Dillon , with the publication of A Swiftly Tilting Planet in 1978 . The book has also been published in a 25th anniversary collectors ' edition ( limited to 500 signed and numbered copies ) , at least two book club editions ( one hardback , one Scholastic Book Services paperback ) , as a trade paperback under the Dell Yearling imprint , and as a mass market paperback under the Dell Laurel - Leaf imprint . The cover art on the paperback editions has changed several times since first publication . </P> <P> The book was reissued by Square Fish in trade and mass market paperback formats in May 2007 , along with the rest of the Time Quintet . This new edition includes a previously unpublished interview with L'Engle as well as the text of her Newbery Medal acceptance speech . </P> <H2> Plot summary ( edit ) </H2> <P> Thirteen - year - old Meg Murry 's classmates and teachers see her as a troublesome and stubborn student . Her family knows that she is emotionally immature but also sees her capable of doing great things . The family includes her scientist mother Katherine , her missing scientist father Alexander , the twins Sandy and Dennys , and her five - year - old brother Charles Wallace Murry , a child genius who can sometimes read Meg 's mind . </P> <P> The book begins with the line `` It was a dark and stormy night , '' an allusion to the opening words in Edward Bulwer - Lytton 's 1830 novel Paul Clifford . Unable to sleep during a thunderstorm , Meg descends from her attic room to find Charles Wallace sitting at the table drinking milk and eating bread and jam . They are then joined by their mother , and are visited by their new eccentric neighbor , Mrs Whatsit . In the course of conversation , Mrs Whatsit casually mentions there is such a thing as a tesseract , which causes Katherine to almost faint . </P> <P> The next morning , Meg discovers that the term refers to a scientific concept her father was working on before his mysterious disappearance . The following afternoon , Meg and Charles Wallace encounter Meg 's schoolmate , Calvin O'Keefe , a high - school junior who , although he is a `` big man on campus '' , considers himself a misfit as well . They then go to visit an old haunted house near town which Charles Wallace already knows is the home of Mrs Whatsit . There they encounter two companions of Mrs Whatsit 's , the equally strange Mrs Who and the unseen voice of Mrs Which . She promises that she and her friends will help Meg find and rescue her father . A budding love interest develops between Meg and Calvin . In the evening , Charles Wallace declares it is time for them to go on their mission to save their father . This is accompanied by the appearance of the third member of the `` Mrs Ws '' , Mrs Which , who appears to materialize out of nothing . </P> <P> Mrs Whatsit , Mrs Who , and Mrs Which turn out to be supernatural beings who transport Meg , Charles Wallace , and Calvin O'Keefe through the universe by means of tesseract , a fifth - dimensional phenomenon explained as being similar to folding the fabric of space and time . Their first stop is the planet Uriel , a Utopian world filled with Centaur - like beings who live in a state of light and love . Mrs Whatsit herself shows that she , Mrs Who , and Mrs Which are all these centaur - like creatures in disguise as humans . There the `` Mrs Ws '' reveal to the children that the universe is under attack from an evil being who appears as a large dark cloud called The Black Thing , which is essentially the personification of evil . The children are then taken to visit the `` Happy Medium '' , a woman with a crystal ball through which they see that Earth is partially covered by the darkness , although great religious figures , philosophers , and artists have been fighting against it . Mrs Whatsit is revealed to be a former star who exploded in an act of self - sacrifice to fight the darkness . </P> <P> The children then travel to the dark planet of Camazotz , which has `` given in '' to the Black Thing . Meg 's father is trapped there . They find that all the inhabitants behave in a mechanistic way and seem to be under the control of a single mind . At the planet 's central headquarters ( described as CENTRAL Central Intelligence ) , they discover a telepathic red - eyed man who can cast a hypnotic spell and claims to know their father 's whereabouts . Charles Wallace deliberately looks into the man 's red eyes , allowing himself to be hypnotized in order to find their father . Under its influence , he takes Meg and Calvin to the place where Alexander is being held prisoner because he would not succumb to the group mind . </P> <P> The planet turns out to be controlled by an evil disembodied brain with powerful abilities , which the inhabitants of Camazotz call `` IT . '' Charles Wallace takes them to the place where IT is held . In such proximity to IT , the children are threatened by a possible telepathic takeover of their minds . With special powers from Mrs Who 's glasses , Alexander is able to `` tesser '' Calvin , Meg and himself away from Camazotz , but Charles Wallace is left behind , still under the influence of IT . Dr. Murry , inexperienced at tessering , does not know how to protect Meg from the Black Thing which surrounds the planet as they tesser through it , nearly killing her . When they arrive on the neighboring planet of Ixchel , Meg is nearly frozen , and paralyzed . Calvin and the Murrys are discovered by the planet 's inhabitants - large , eyeless `` beasts '' with featureless faces , tentacles and four arms , who prove both wise and gentle . Meg 's paralysis is cured under the care of one inhabitant , whom Meg nicknames `` Aunt Beast . '' Meg overcomes her anger at her father for leaving Charles Wallace on Camazotz , realizing that parents ca n't fix everything , and sometimes children can solve problems themselves . </P> <P> Then the trio of Mrs Whatsit , Mrs Who , and Mrs Which arrive . They charge Meg with rescuing Charles Wallace from IT , because only Meg has a strong enough bond with him . Their father had last seen Charles Wallace when he was a baby and Calvin had only just met him . They each give her a gift . Mrs Whatsit gives Meg her love . Mrs Who quotes to Meg a passage from the Bible about God choosing the foolish of the world to confound the wise , and the weak to defeat the strong ( 1 Corinthians 1 : 27 - 29 ) . Mrs Which tells Meg that she has one thing that IT does not have but does n't specify what it is . Upon arriving at the building where IT is housed , Charles Wallace is still there under IT 's influence . Meg realizes that the one thing she has that IT does not is love . She focuses all her love at Charles Wallace and is able to free him from IT 's control . Mrs Who , Mrs Which and Mrs Whatsit tesser the Murrys and Calvin back to Earth . In the vegetable garden they are all reunited with Katherine and the twins . Mrs Whatsit says that although she and the others like the spectacle of the family reuniting , they have to go somewhere . Before Mrs Whatsit finishes her sentence , she and the others disappear . </P> <H2> Major themes ( edit ) </H2> <P> Madeleine L'Engle's fantasy works are in part highly expressive of her Christian viewpoint in a manner somewhat similar to that of Christian fantasy writer C.S. Lewis . She was herself the official writer - in - residence at New York City 's Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine , which is known for its prominent position in the liberal wing of the Episcopal Church . L'Engle's liberal Christianity has been the target of criticism from more conservative Christians , especially with respect to certain elements of A Wrinkle in Time . </P> <P> The theme of picturing the fight of good against evil as a battle of light and darkness is a recurring one . Its manner is reminiscent of the prologue to the Gospel of John , which is quoted within the book . When the `` Mrs Ws '' reveal their secret roles in the cosmic fight against `` the darkness '' they ask the children to name some figures on Earth ( a partially dark planet ) who fight the darkness . They name Jesus , and later in the discussion Buddha is named as well , along with various creative artists and philanthropists . The three women are described as ancient star - beings who act as guardian angels . </P> <P> Further , the themes of `` conformity '' and the `` status quo '' are present . It is a generic theme that is within every society there is a powerful dominant group that challenges the minority group . Very few of the powerless members of this group are resilient . In this case , IT is the powerful dominant group that manipulates the planet of Camazotz into conformity ( i.e. , they all have the sam\n", "answer": "1962"}

L'Engle wrote repeatedly about the writing of the story and the long struggle to get it published . In A Circle of Quiet ( 1972 ) , she explains that the book was conceived `` during a time of transition . '' After years of living in rural Goshen , Connecticut , and running a general store , L'Engle's family , the Franklins , moved back to New York City , first taking a ten - week camping trip across the country and back again . L'Engle writes that `` we drove through a world of deserts and buttes and leafless mountains , wholly new and alien to me . And suddenly into my mind came the names , Mrs Whatsit . Mrs Who . Mrs Which . '' This was in the spring of 1959 . L'Engle was reading about quantum physics at the time , which also made its way into the story . When she completed the book in early 1960 , however , it was rejected by at least 26 publishers , because it was , in L'Engle's words , `` too different , '' and `` because it deals overtly with the problem of evil , and it was really difficult for children , and was it a children 's or an adults ' book , anyhow ? '' </P> <P> In `` A Special Message from Madeleine L'Engle '' on the Random House website , L'Engle explains another possible reason for the rejections : `` A Wrinkle in Time had a female protagonist in a science fiction book , '' which at the time was uncommon . After trying `` forty - odd '' publishers ( L'Engle later said `` twenty - six rejections '' ) , L'Engle's agent returned the manuscript to her . Then at Christmas , L'Engle threw a tea party for her mother . One of the guests happened to know John C. Farrar of Farrar , Straus and Giroux , and insisted that L'Engle should meet with him . Although the publisher did not , at the time , publish a line of children 's books , Farrar met L'Engle , liked the novel , and ultimately published it . </P> <P> In 1963 the book won the Newbery Medal which awarded annually by the Association for Library Service to Children , a division of the American Library Association , to the author of the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children . The book has been continuously in print since its first publication . The hardback edition is still published by Farrar , Straus & Giroux . The original blue dust jacket by Ellen Raskin was replaced with new art by Leo and Diane Dillon , with the publication of A Swiftly Tilting Planet in 1978 . The book has also been published in a 25th anniversary collectors ' edition ( limited to 500 signed and numbered copies ) , at least two book club editions ( one hardback , one Scholastic Book Services paperback ) , as a trade paperback under the Dell Yearling imprint , and as a mass market paperback under the Dell Laurel - Leaf imprint . The cover art on the paperback editions has changed several times since first publication . </P> <P> The book was reissued by Square Fish in trade and mass market paperback formats in May 2007 , along with the rest of the Time Quintet . This new edition includes a previously unpublished interview with L'Engle as well as the text of her Newbery Medal acceptance speech . </P> <H2> Plot summary ( edit ) </H2> <P> Thirteen - year - old Meg Murry 's classmates and teachers see her as a troublesome and stubborn student . Her family knows that she is emotionally immature but also sees her capable of doing great things . The family includes her scientist mother Katherine , her missing scientist father Alexander , the twins Sandy and Dennys , and her five - year - old brother Charles Wallace Murry , a child genius who can sometimes read Meg 's mind . </P> <P> The book begins with the line `` It was a dark and stormy night , '' an allusion to the opening words in Edward Bulwer - Lytton 's 1830 novel Paul Clifford . Unable to sleep during a thunderstorm , Meg descends from her attic room to find Charles Wallace sitting at the table drinking milk and eating bread and jam . They are then joined by their mother , and are visited by their new eccentric neighbor , Mrs Whatsit . In the course of conversation , Mrs Whatsit casually mentions there is such a thing as a tesseract , which causes Katherine to almost faint . </P> <P> The next morning , Meg discovers that the term refers to a scientific concept her father was working on before his mysterious disappearance . The following afternoon , Meg and Charles Wallace encounter Meg 's schoolmate , Calvin O'Keefe , a high - school junior who , although he is a `` big man on campus '' , considers himself a misfit as well . They then go to visit an old haunted house near town which Charles Wallace already knows is the home of Mrs Whatsit . There they encounter two companions of Mrs Whatsit 's , the equally strange Mrs Who and the unseen voice of Mrs Which . She promises that she and her friends will help Meg find and rescue her father . A budding love interest develops between Meg and Calvin . In the evening , Charles Wallace declares it is time for them to go on their mission to save their father . This is accompanied by the appearance of the third member of the `` Mrs Ws '' , Mrs Which , who appears to materialize out of nothing . </P> <P> Mrs Whatsit , Mrs Who , and Mrs Which turn out to be supernatural beings who transport Meg , Charles Wallace , and Calvin O'Keefe through the universe by means of tesseract , a fifth - dimensional phenomenon explained as being similar to folding the fabric of space and time . Their first stop is the planet Uriel , a Utopian world filled with Centaur - like beings who live in a state of light and love . Mrs Whatsit herself shows that she , Mrs Who , and Mrs Which are all these centaur - like creatures in disguise as humans . There the `` Mrs Ws '' reveal to the children that the universe is under attack from an evil being who appears as a large dark cloud called The Black Thing , which is essentially the personification of evil . The children are then taken to visit the `` Happy Medium '' , a woman with a crystal ball through which they see that Earth is partially covered by the darkness , although great religious figures , philosophers , and artists have been fighting against it . Mrs Whatsit is revealed to be a former star who exploded in an act of self - sacrifice to fight the darkness . </P> <P> The children then travel to the dark planet of Camazotz , which has `` given in '' to the Black Thing . Meg 's father is trapped there . They find that all the inhabitants behave in a mechanistic way and seem to be under the control of a single mind . At the planet 's central headquarters ( described as CENTRAL Central Intelligence ) , they discover a telepathic red - eyed man who can cast a hypnotic spell and claims to know their father 's whereabouts . Charles Wallace deliberately looks into the man 's red eyes , allowing himself to be hypnotized in order to find their father . Under its influence , he takes Meg and Calvin to the place where Alexander is being held prisoner because he would not succumb to the group mind . </P> <P> The planet turns out to be controlled by an evil disembodied brain with powerful abilities , which the inhabitants of Camazotz call `` IT . '' Charles Wallace takes them to the place where IT is held . In such proximity to IT , the children are threatened by a possible telepathic takeover of their minds . With special powers from Mrs Who 's glasses , Alexander is able to `` tesser '' Calvin , Meg and himself away from Camazotz , but Charles Wallace is left behind , still under the influence of IT . Dr. Murry , inexperienced at tessering , does not know how to protect Meg from the Black Thing which surrounds the planet as they tesser through it , nearly killing her . When they arrive on the neighboring planet of Ixchel , Meg is nearly frozen , and paralyzed . Calvin and the Murrys are discovered by the planet 's inhabitants - large , eyeless `` beasts '' with featureless faces , tentacles and four arms , who prove both wise and gentle . Meg 's paralysis is cured under the care of one inhabitant , whom Meg nicknames `` Aunt Beast . '' Meg overcomes her anger at her father for leaving Charles Wallace on Camazotz , realizing that parents ca n't fix everything , and sometimes children can solve problems themselves . </P> <P> Then the trio of Mrs Whatsit , Mrs Who , and Mrs Which arrive . They charge Meg with rescuing Charles Wallace from IT , because only Meg has a strong enough bond with him . Their father had last seen Charles Wallace when he was a baby and Calvin had only just met him . They each give her a gift . Mrs Whatsit gives Meg her love . Mrs Who quotes to Meg a passage from the Bible about God choosing the foolish of the world to confound the wise , and the weak to defeat the strong ( 1 Corinthians 1 : 27 - 29 ) . Mrs Which tells Meg that she has one thing that IT does not have but does n't specify what it is . Upon arriving at the building where IT is housed , Charles Wallace is still there under IT 's influence . Meg realizes that the one thing she has that IT does not is love . She focuses all her love at Charles Wallace and is able to free him from IT 's control . Mrs Who , Mrs Which and Mrs Whatsit tesser the Murrys and Calvin back to Earth . In the vegetable garden they are all reunited with Katherine and the twins . Mrs Whatsit says that although she and the others like the spectacle of the family reuniting , they have to go somewhere . Before Mrs Whatsit finishes her sentence , she and the others disappear . </P> <H2> Major themes ( edit ) </H2> <P> Madeleine L'Engle's fantasy works are in part highly expressive of her Christian viewpoint in a manner somewhat similar to that of Christian fantasy writer C.S. Lewis . She was herself the official writer - in - residence at New York City 's Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine , which is known for its prominent position in the liberal wing of the Episcopal Church . L'Engle's liberal Christianity has been the target of criticism from more conservative Christians , especially with respect to certain elements of A Wrinkle in Time . </P> <P> The theme of picturing the fight of good against evil as a battle of light and darkness is a recurring one . Its manner is reminiscent of the prologue to the Gospel of John , which is quoted within the book . When the `` Mrs Ws '' reveal their secret roles in the cosmic fight against `` the darkness '' they ask the children to name some figures on Earth ( a partially dark planet ) who fight the darkness . They name Jesus , and later in the discussion Buddha is named as well , along with various creative artists an\n", "answer": "1962"}

The Lee Clayton - penned song `` Silver Stallion '' was the first single and made the country Top 40 . The album was nominated for a Grammy for Best Country Vocal Collaboration . Highwayman 2 was produced , once again , by Moman . Six of the songs were written or co-written by members of the group . </P> <H3> The Road Goes on Forever ( edit ) </H3> <P> The group 's final release prior to Jennings 's death in 2002 was the 1995 Don Was - produced album The Road Goes on Forever , ( a Robert Earl Keen cover ) , with the single , `` It Is What It Is '' . A tenth - anniversary edition of The Road Goes on Forever appeared in 2005 , with several bonus tracks added as well as , in some versions , a DVD containing the music video for `` It Is What It Is '' and a documentary entitled Live Forever -- In the Studio with the Highwaymen . </P> <P> The band continued to tour into the late 1990s , before Jennings and Cash both started to decline in health , which prevented them from maintaining a full touring schedule . All four continued to perform as solo artists , with Jennings briefly joining Old Dogs ; Jennings died in 2002 and Cash died in 2003 . </P> <H2> Discography ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Studio albums ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Title </Th> <Th> Album details </Th> <Th_colspan=\"6\"> Peak chart positions </Th> <Th> Certifications ( sales threshold ) </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> US Country </Th> <Th> US </Th> <Th> CAN Country </Th> <Th> AUS </Th> <Th> DEN </Th> <Th> NOR </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Highwayman </Th> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Release date : May 1985 </Li> <Li> Label : Columbia Records </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 92 </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> 20 </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> AUS : Platinum </Li> <Li> US : Platinum </Li> <Li> CAN : Gold </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Highwayman 2 </Th> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Release date : February 9 , 1990 </Li> <Li> Label : Columbia Records </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 79 </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> 9 </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> AUS : Gold </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> The Road Goes On Forever </Th> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Release date : April 4 , 1995 </Li> <Li> Label : Liberty Records </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> 42 </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> 10 </Td> <Td> 46 </Td> <Td> 8 </Td> <Td> 11 </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"9\"> `` -- '' denotes releases that did not chart </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Compilation albums ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Title </Th> <Th> Album details </Th> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Peak positions </Th> <Th> Sales </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> US Country </Th> <Th> AUS </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> The Highwaymen Ride Again ( Import Only - Greece & Netherlands ) </Th> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Release date : June 11 , 1995 </Li> <Li> Label : Columbia Records </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Highwayman Super Hits </Th> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Release date : March 2 , 1999 </Li> <Li> Label : Columbia Records </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Country Legends </Th> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Release date : 2005 </Li> <Li> Label : DeLuxe Holland </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> The Essential Highwaymen </Th> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Release date : October 26 , 2010 </Li> <Li> Label : Columbia Records </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Live : American Outlaws </Th> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Release date : May 20 , 2016 </Li> <Li> Label : Legacy Recordings </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> 16 </Td> <Td> 89 </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> US : 12,500 </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> The Very Best of the Highwaymen </Th> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Release date : May 20 , 2016 </Li> <Li> Label : Legacy Recordings </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> 22 </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> US : 20,800 </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"5\"> `` -- '' denotes releases that did not chart </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Singles ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Year </Th> <Th> Single </Th> <Th_colspan=\"4\"> Peak chart positions </Th> <Th> Album </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> US Country </Th> <Th> CAN Country </Th> <Th> CAN AC </Th> <Th> AUS </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1985 </Td> <Th> `` Highwayman '' </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 19 </Td> <Td> 98 </Td> <Td> Highwayman </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> `` Desperados Waiting for a Train '' </Th> <Td> 15 </Td> <Td> 20 </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> -- </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1990 </Td> <Th> `` Silver Stallion '' </Th> <Td> 25 </Td> <Td> 21 </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> Highwayman 2 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> `` Born and Raised In Black and White '' </Th> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> -- </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> `` American Remains '' </Th> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> -- </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1995 </Td> <Th> `` It Is What It Is '' </Th> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> The Road Goes on Forever </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2005 </Td> <Th> `` If He Came Back Again '' </Th> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> -- </Td> <Td> The Road Goes on Forever ( re-issue ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"7\"> `` -- '' denotes releases that did not chart </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Videography ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Music videos ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Year </Th> <Th> Title </Th> <Th> Director </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1985 </Td> <Td> `` Highwayman '' </Td> <Td> Peter Israelson </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1990 </Td> <Td> `` Silver Stallion '' </Td> <Td> Jon Small </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 1995 </Td> <Td> `` It Is What It Is '' </Td> <Td> Lowe / Don Was </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2016 </Td> <Td> `` Good Hearted Woman '' </Td> <Td> Jon Small </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Video albums ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Highwaymen Live !

Some of the conditions included in newborn screening programs are only detectable after irreversible damage has been done ; in some cases sudden death is the first manifestation of a disease . Screening programs are often run by state or national governing bodies with the goal of screening all infants born in the jurisdiction . The number of diseases screened for is set by each jurisdiction , and can vary greatly . Most newborn screening tests are done by measuring metabolites and enzyme activity in whole blood samples collected on specialized filter paper . Many areas are starting to screen infants for hearing loss using automated auditory brainstem response and congenital heart defects using pulse oximetry . Infants who screen positive undergo further testing to determine if they are truly affected with a disease or if the test result was a false positive . Follow - up testing is typically coordinated between geneticists and the infant 's pediatrician or primary care physician . </P> <P> Newborn screening debuted as a public health program in the United States in the early 1960s , and has expanded to countries around the world , with different testing menus in each country . Both prenatal screening ( screening before birth ) and newborn screening ( screening soon after birth ) have improved health care . The first disorder detected by modern newborn screening programs was phenylketonuria , a metabolic condition in which the inability to degrade the essential amino acid phenylalanine can cause irreversible mental retardation unless detected early . With early detection and dietary management , the negative effects of the disease can be largely eliminated . Robert Guthrie developed a simple method using a bacterial inhibition assay that could detect high levels of phenylalanine in blood shortly after a baby was born . Guthrie also pioneered the collection of blood on filter paper which could be easily transported , recognizing the need for a simple system if the screening was going to be done on a large scale . Newborn screening around the world is still done using similar filter paper . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Targeted disorders <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Amino acid disorders </Li> <Li> 1.2 Fatty acid oxidation disorders </Li> <Li> 1.3 Endocrinopathies </Li> <Li> 1.4 Hemoglobinopathies </Li> <Li> 1.5 Organic acidemias </Li> <Li> 1.6 Cystic fibrosis </Li> <Li> 1.7 Urea cycle disorders </Li> <Li> 1.8 Lysosomal storage disorders </Li> <Li> 1.9 Hearing loss </Li> <Li> 1.10 Congenital heart defects </Li> <Li> 1.11 Severe combined immunodeficiency </Li> <Li> 1.12 Other conditions </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Disease qualification </Li> <Li> 3 Techniques <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Sample collection </Li> <Li> 3.2 Laboratory testing </Li> <Li> 3.3 Reporting results </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Laboratory performance </Li> <Li> 5 History </Li> <Li> 6 Society and culture <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Controversies </Li> <Li> 6.2 Bioethics </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Targeted disorders ( edit ) </H2> See also : List of disorders included in newborn screening programs <P> Newborn screening is intended as a public health program to identify infants with treatable conditions before they present clinically , or suffer irreversible damage . Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) was the first disorder targeted for newborn screening , being implemented in a small number of hospitals and quickly expanding across the United States and the rest of the world . After the success of newborn screening for PKU ( 39 infants were identified and treated in the first two years of screening , with no false negative results ) , Guthrie and others looked for other disorders that could be identified and treated in infants , eventually developing bacterial inhibition assays to identify classic galactosemia and maple syrup urine disease . </P> <P> Newborn screening has expanded since the introduction of PKU testing in the 1960s , but can vary greatly between countries . In 2011 , the United States screened for 54 conditions , Germany for 12 , the United Kingdom for 2 ( PKU and medium chain acyl - CoA dehydrogenase deficiency ( MCADD ) ) , while France and Hong Kong only screened for one condition ( PKU and congenital hypothyroidism , respectively ) . The conditions included in newborn screening programs around the world vary greatly , based on the legal requirements for screening programs , prevalence of certain diseases within a population , political pressure , and the availability of resources for both testing and follow - up of identified patients . </P> <H3> Amino acid disorders ( edit ) </H3> <P> Newborn screening originated with an amino acid disorder , phenylketonuria ( PKU ) , which can be easily treated by dietary modifications , but causes severe mental retardation if not identified and treated early . Robert Guthrie introduced the newborn screening test for PKU in the early 1960s . With the knowledge that PKU could be detected before symptoms were evident , and treatment initiated , screening was quickly adopted around the world . Austria started screening for PKU in 1966 and England in 1968 . </P> <H3> Fatty acid oxidation disorders ( edit ) </H3> <P> With the advent of tandem mass spectrometry as a screening tool , several fatty acid oxidation disorders were targeted for inclusion in newborn screening programs . Medium chain acyl - CoA dehydrogenase deficiency ( MCADD ) , which had been implicated in several cases of sudden infant death syndrome was one of the first conditions targeted for inclusion . MCADD was the first condition added when the United Kingdom expanded their screening program from PKU only . Population based studies in Germany , the United States and Australia put the combined incidence of fatty acid oxidation disorders at 1 : 9300 among Caucasians . The United States screens for all known fatty acid oxidation disorders , either as primary or secondary targets , while other countries screen for a subset of these . </P> <P> The introduction of screening for fatty acid oxidation disorders has been shown to have reduced morbidity and mortality associated with the conditions , particularly MCADD . An Australian study found a 74 % reduction in episodes of severe metabolic decompensation or death among individuals identified by newborn screening as having MCADD versus those who presented clinically prior to screening . Studies in the Netherlands and United Kingdom found improvements in outcome at a reduced cost when infants were identified before presenting clinically . </P> <P> Newborn screening programs have also expanded the information base available about some rare conditions . Prior to its inclusion in newborn screening , short - chain acyl - CoA dehydrogenase deficiency ( SCADD ) was thought to be life - threatening . Most patients identified via newborn screening as having this enzyme deficiency were asymptomatic , to the extent that SCADD was removed from screening panels in a number of regions . Without the cohort of patients identified by newborn screening , this clinical phenotype would likely not have been identified . </P> <H3> Endocrinopathies ( edit ) </H3> <P> The most commonly included disorders of the endocrine system are congenital hypothyroidism ( CH ) and congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( CAH ) . Testing for both disorders can be done using blood samples collected on the standard newborn screening card . Screening for CH is done by measuring thyroxin ( T4 ) , thyrotropin ( TSH ) or a combination of both analytes . Elevated 17\u03b1 - hydroxyprogesterone ( 17\u03b1 - OHP ) is the primary marker used when screening for CAH , most commonly done using enzyme - linked immunosorbant assays , with many programs using a second tier tandem mass spectrometry test to reduce the number of false positive results . Careful analysis of screening results for CAH may also identify cases of congenital adrenal hypoplasia , which presents with extremely low levels of 17\u03b1 - OHP . </P> <P> CH was added to many newborn screening programs in the 1970s , often as the second condition included after PKU . The most common cause of CH is dysgenesis of the thyroid gland After many years of newborn screening , the incidence of CH worldwide had been estimated at 1 : 3600 births , with no obvious increases in specific ethnic groups . Recent data from certain regions have showed an increase , with New York reporting an incidence of 1 : 1700 . Reasons for the apparent increase in incidence have been studied , but no explanation has been found . </P> <P> Classic CAH , the disorder targeted by newborn screening programs , is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme steroid 21 - hydroxylase , and comes in two forms - simple virilizing and a salt - wasting form . Incidence of CAH can vary greatly between populations . The highest reported incidence rates are among the Yupic Eskimos of Alaska ( 1 : 280 ) and on the French island of R\u00e9union ( 1 : 2100 ) . </P> <H3> Hemoglobinopathies ( edit ) </H3> Sickle cells in human blood : both normal red blood cells and sickle - shaped cells are present <P> Any condition that results in the production of abnormal hemoglobin is included under the broad category of hemoglobinopathies . Worldwide , it is estimated that 7 % of the population may carry a hemoglobinopathy with clinical significance . The most well known condition in this group is sickle cell disease . Newborn screening for a large number of hemoglobinopathies is done by detecting abnormal patterns using isoelectric focusing , which can detect many different types of abnormal hemoglobins . In the United States , newborn screening for sickle cell disease was recommended for all infants in 1987 , however it was not implemented in all 50 states until 2006 . </P> <P> Early identification of individuals with sickle cell disease and other hemoglobinopathies allows treatment to be initiated in a timely fashion . Penicillin has been used in children with sickle cell disease , and blood transfusions are used for patients identified with severe thalassemia . </P> <H3> Organic acidemias ( edit ) </H3> <P> Most jurisdictions did not start screening for any of the organic acidemias before tandem mass spectrometry significantly expanded the list of disorders detectable by newborn screening . Quebec has run a voluntary second - tier screening program since 1971 using urine samples collected at three weeks of age to screen for an expanded list of organic acidemias using a thin layer chromatography method . Newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry can detect several organic acidemias , including propionic acidemia , methylmalonic acidemia and isovaleric acidemia . </P> <H3> Cystic fibrosis ( edit ) </H3> <P> Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) was first added to newborn screening programs in New Zealand and regions of Australia in 1981 , by measuring immunoreactive trypsinogen ( IRT ) in dried blood spots . After the CFTR gene was identified , Australia introduced a two tier testing program to reduce the number of false positives . Samples with an elevated IRT value were then analyzed with molecular methods to identify the presence of disease causing mutations before being reported back to parents and health care providers . CF is included in the core panel of conditions recommended for inclusion in all 50 states , Texas was the last state to implement their screening program for CF in 2010 . Alberta was the first Canadian province to implement CF screening in 2007 . Quebec , New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island do not include CF in their screening programs . The United Kingdom as well as many European Union countries screen for CF as well . Switzerland is one of the latest countries to add CF to their newborn screening menu , doing so in January 2011 . </P> <H3> Urea cycle disorders ( edit ) </H3> <P> Disorders of the distal urea cycle , such as citrullinemia , argininosuccinic aciduria and argininemia are included in newborn screening programs in many jurisdictions that using tandem mass spectrometry to identify key amino acids . Proximal urea cycle defects , such as ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiency are not included in newborn screening panels because they are not reliably detected using current technology , and also because severely affected infants will present with clinical symptoms before newborn screening results are available . Some regions claim to screen for HHH syndrome ( hyperammonemia , hyperornithinemia , homocitrullinuria ) based on the detection of elevated ornithine levels in the newborn screening dried blood spot , but other sources have shown that affected individuals do not have elevated ornithine at birth . </P> <H3> Lysosomal storage disorders ( edit ) </H3> <P> Lysosomal storage disorders are not included in newborn screening programs with high frequency . As a group , they are heterogenous , with screening only being feasible for a small fraction of the approximately 40 identified disorders .

The song was originally written and intended for the Supremes to record ; however Motown decided the song would be better for the Jackson 5 . Released as a single in 1971 , it was one of the group 's most successful songs . The song has been covered numerous times , most notably in 1974 by disco diva Gloria Gaynor and in 1987 by British pop group The Communards . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 The Jackson 5 </Li> <Li> 2 Chart performance <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Weekly charts </Li> <Li> 2.2 Year - end charts </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Gloria Gaynor version </Li> <Li> 4 Chart performance <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Weekly charts </Li> <Li> 4.2 Year - end charts </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 The Communards version </Li> <Li> 6 Other covers </Li> <Li> 7 In popular culture </Li> <Li> 8 Personnel <Ul> <Li> 8.1 The Jackson 5 </Li> <Li> 8.2 Gloria Gaynor </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 9 References </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> The Jackson 5 ( edit ) </H2> <P> The recording features 12 - year - old Michael Jackson singing a serious song about a love , with accompaniment from his brothers . Although such a record was unusual for a teenage group , `` Never Can Say Goodbye '' was a # 2 hit for three consecutive weeks on the Billboard Pop Singles chart , stuck behind Three Dog Night 's `` Joy to the World '' ( May 8 - May 22 , 1971 ) , and a # 1 hit on the Billboard Black Singles chart in the United States . In the United Kingdom , it reached # 33 on the UK Singles Chart . An alternate version ( live performance on Flip Wilson Show from 1971 with an extra part added to it ) appears on the Jackson 5 CD `` I Want You Back ! Unreleased Masters '' released in 2009 . The song was performed on the Flip Wilson Show ( 4 November 1971 ) , The Jackson 5 Show ( 5th November , 1972 ) , TUPI ( 1974 ) , One More Time ( 10 January 1974 ) , Johnny Carson Show ( 4th April , 1974 ) , Cher Show ( 16 March 1975 ) and The Jacksons TV Series ( 7th July , 1976 ) . </P> <H2> Chart performance ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Td> <H3> Weekly charts ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Chart ( 1971 ) </Th> <Th> Peak position </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> US Billboard Hot 100 </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> US Cash Box Top 100 </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Canada </Td> <Td> 14 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> UK </Td> <Td> 33 </Td> </Tr> </Table> </Td> <Td> <H3> Year - end charts ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Chart ( 1971 ) </Th> <Th> Rank </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> US Billboard Hot 100 </Td> <Td> 40 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> US Cash Box </Td> <Td> 11 </Td> </Tr> </Table> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Gloria Gaynor version ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> `` Never Can Say Goodbye '' </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Single by Gloria Gaynor </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> from the album Never Can Say Goodbye </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> B - side </Th> <Td> `` We Just Ca n't Make It '' </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Released </Th> <Td> October 27 , 1974 ( U.S. ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Format </Th> <Td> Vinyl record ( 7 '' 45 RPM ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Recorded </Th> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Genre </Th> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Disco </Li> <Li> soul </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Length </Th> <Td> 6 : 19 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Label </Th> <Td> MGM </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Songwriter ( s ) </Th> <Td> Clifton Davis </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Producer ( s ) </Th> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Jay Ellis </Li> <Li> Meco Monardo </Li> <Li> Tony Bongiovi </Li> <Li> Harold Wheeler </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th_colspan=\"2\"> Gloria Gaynor singles chronology </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` Honey Bee '' ( 1974 ) </Td> <Td> `` Never Can Say Goodbye '' ( 1974 ) </Td> <Td> `` ' Reach Out , I 'll Be There '' ( 1975 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` Honey Bee '' ( 1974 ) </Td> <Td> `` Never Can Say Goodbye '' ( 1974 ) </Td> <Td> Reach Out , I 'll Be There '' ( 1975 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> A second major version , reimagined as a disco record by Gloria Gaynor in 1974 , was a number - nine hit on the U.S. Pop Singles chart and went to number thirty - four on the Soul Singles chart .

Indeed , her version peaked at # 2 in the UK during January 1975 , and # 3 in Canada , surpassing the Jackson Five 's original recording in those nations . </P> <P> Gaynor 's cover , released on MGM records , was produced by the Disco Corporation of America , a production company newly formed by Meco Monardo and Tony Bongiovi to which Gaynor was signed .

Greece has hosted the Games twice , both in Athens . As the home of the Ancient Olympic Games it was a natural choice as host nation for the revival of the modern Olympic Games in 1896 , while Greece has also hosted the 2004 Summer Olympics . During the parade of nations at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games , Greece always enters the stadium first and leads the parade to honor its status as the birthplace of the Olympics except 2004 when Greece enters last as the host nation . Before the Games the Olympic Flame is lit in Olympia , the site of the Ancient Olympic Games , in a ceremony that reflects ancient Greek rituals and initiates the Olympic torch relay . The flag of Greece is always hoisted in the closing ceremony , along with the flags of the current and the next host country . </P> <P> Greek athletes have won a total of 116 medals in 15 different sports and the country currently ranks 33rd in the all - time Summer Olympics medal count .

Gymnastics , shooting and wrestling are the other sports that have produced ten or more medals for Greece . In the inaugural 1896 Olympics , Greece finished second in the medal counts , but won the most medals in total , in their best Olympic performance .

It was used on a range of mass - produced general - purpose tractors manufactured by Henry Ford & Son Inc from 1917 to 1920 , by Ford Motor Company ( U.S. ) and Ford Motor Company Ltd ( U.K. ) from 1920 to 1928 , and by Ford Motor Company Ltd ( U.K. ) from 1929 to 1964 . The latter ( Ford of Britain ) also later built trucks under the Fordson brand . </P> <P> American engineer , inventor , and businessman Henry Ford built experimental tractors from automobile components during the early 20th century , and launched a prototype known as the Model B in August 1915 . Further prototypes , with a dedicated tractor design , followed in 1916 . With World War I raging in Europe , the first regular - production Henry Ford & Son tractors were exported to the U.K. in 1917 to expand British agriculture . In 1918 , exports continued , the tractors began to be labeled as Fordsons , and U.S. domestic sales began . Sales boomed in 1918 and 1919 . </P> <P> Between 1917 and 1922 , the Fordson was for tractors somewhat like the Ford Model T was for automobiles -- it captured the public 's imagination and widely popularized the machine , with a reliable design , a low price affordable for workers and farmers , a widespread dealership network , and a production capacity for large numbers . Just as the Model T helped the public to appreciate how soon cars and trucks might replace most horses in transport , the Fordson helped people to appreciate how soon tractors might replace most horses in farming ( advancing the mechanisation of agriculture ) . As with cars , Ford never had the market to itself , but it dominated the market for a time ( for cars , roughly 1910 - 1925 ; for tractors , roughly 1917 - 1925 ) . Ford was the only automotive firm to sell cars , trucks and tractors simultaneously from 1917 to 1928 . </P> <P> For a decade between 1928 and 1939 , Ford of the U.S. left the tractor business . During that decade , Ford of Britain continued to build Fordsons and to develop new variants , which it exported widely . In 1939 Ford of the U.S. reentered the tractor market with an all - new model , this time with the Ford brand . Ford of Britain continued to use the Fordson brand until 1964 . </P> <P> Fordson production occurred in the U.S. ( 1917 -- 1928 ) ; Cork , Ireland ( 1919 -- 1923 and 1928 -- 1933 ) ; and at Dagenham , Essex , England ( 1933 -- 1964 ) . Tens of thousands of Fordsons , most from the U.S. and some from Ireland , were exported to the Soviet Union from 1920 to 1927 . Soviet Fordson clones were also built at Leningrad from 1924 and at Stalingrad from 1930 . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Tractors <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Ford experimental tractor development , 1907 - 1916 </Li> <Li> 1.2 Fordson origins , Model F , and Model N <Ul> <Li> 1.2. 1 Operation </Li> <Li> 1.2. 2 Reliability </Li> <Li> 1.2. 3 Importation and production in Ireland , England , and the Soviet Union </Li> <Li> 1.2. 4 Fordson Model N Standard </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 1.3 Later Fordson tractors ( made in England ) <Ul> <Li> 1.3. 1 1930s experimentation at Dearborn </Li> <Li> 1.3. 2 E27N </Li> <Li> 1.3. 3 E1A </Li> <Li> 1.3. 4 Dexta </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 1.4 Ford tractors after 1964 </Li> <Li> 1.5 Aftermarket accessories and conversions <Ul> <Li> 1.5. 1 Rail conversions </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 1.6 Tractor models </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Trucks </Li> <Li> 3 Notes </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 Further reading </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Tractors ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Ford experimental tractor development , 1907 - 1916 ( edit ) </H3> <P> Henry Ford grew up in an extended family of farmers in Wayne County a few miles from Detroit , Michigan in the late 19th century . At the time , farm work was extremely arduous , because on the typical farm virtually nothing could get done without manual labour or animal labour as the motive power . As his interest in automobiles grew , he also expressed a desire to `` lift the burden of farming from flesh and blood and place it on steel and motors . '' In the early 20th century , he began to build experimental tractors from automobile components . Four years after founding the Ford Motor Company in 1903 , Ford finished his first experimental tractor in 1907 on Woodward Avenue in Detroit , referring to it as the `` Automobile Plow '' . Approximately 600 gasoline - powered tractors were in use on American farms in 1908 . Fordson tractor design was headed by Eugene Farkas and J\u00f3zsef Galamb , both involved in the design of the successful Ford Model T automobile . </P> <P> Traction engines had been around for a while , but they were large , heavy , expensive machines suited to prairie grain farming more than to small family farms in other regions . In the early 1910s , North America and Europe were hungry for small , inexpensive tractors , and many people seized on the Model T as a platform with which to create them . Clearly the idea of an auto - like tractor , made using auto - like parts and methods or by conversion from autos , was ripe . </P> <P> Henry Ford experimented with both auto - plows and heavier tractors . In August 1915 , at a plowing demonstration in Fremont , Nebraska , he introduced a newly designed tractor known as the Model B. It used a 16 horsepower , two - cylinder , horizontally opposed engine , a spur gear transmission and three wheels - two front drivers and one rear steerer . The Model B was never produced , but did gain enough publicity to let the world know Ford was interested in developing a tractor . </P> <P> Knowing there was demand for a Ford - built tractor , a group of entrepreneurs in Minneapolis organized The Ford Tractor Company , paying a company clerk surnamed Ford for the use of his name , with the intention of getting sales and attention from the confusion of this Ford with Ford Motor Company . The company built and sold some tractors , but anticipated a settlement with Henry Ford for permission to use their already - trademarked name . However , Ford thwarted them by using another name . </P> <H3> Fordson origins , Model F , and Model N ( edit ) </H3> Overview of the original Fordson tractor A cutaway view of the original Fordson tractor Disassembly of the original Fordson tractor , showing the unit - frame construction and how the tractor can be taken apart for service , with blocks of wood inserted to support the separated parts A cutaway view of the engine of the original Fordson tractor A cutaway view of the intake of the original Fordson tractor ( including the intake manifold , vaporizer , carburetor , and fuel lines ) A cutaway view of the clutch , transmission , and rear of the original Fordson tractor , including the worm drive An early Fordson discing a field in Princess Anne County , Virginia , USA , in 1925 <P> The first prototypes of the new Henry Ford & Son tractor , which would later be called the Fordson , were completed in 1916 . World War I was raging in Europe , and the United Kingdom , a net importer of food , was desperate for tractors in its attempt to expand its agriculture enough to feed Britain despite the great shipping disruption of the war . In 1917 , the British Ministry of Munitions selected the Fordson for both importation from the U.S. and domestic U.K. production . It was thought that domestic U.K. production was preferable because so much Atlantic shipping was being sunk that exporting tractors from the U.S. would be counterproductive , as many would be lost at sea . This was soon modified to exclude the London area because of concerns about its vulnerability to German attacks . Henry Ford decided to build the tractor at Cork , Ireland ( which at the time was still part of the U.K. ) , partly because he wanted to bring jobs to , and foster industriousness in , southern Ireland . But the Cork plant did not begin production until 1919 , after the war had ended . As events turned out , thousands of tractors were exported from the U.S. in 1917 and 1918 . </P> <P> The tractor used a 20 hp ( 15 kW ) , inline four - cylinder engine . The engine was similar to the Ford Model T engine in many respects . Like many engines of its day , it was multifuel - capable ; it was usually tuned for gasoline or kerosene , but alcohol could also be burned . ( Tractor vaporising oil ( TVO ) existed in 1920 but was not yet widely used . It entered broader use in the 1930s and 1940s . ) Like many other multifuel machines , the Fordson started on gasoline from a small auxiliary tank ( just a few quarts ) and then switched over to the main fuel tank once warmed up sufficiently ( no more than 5 minutes ) . To handle the kerosene ( or , rarely , TVO ) , the intake system had a vaporizer downstream of the carburetor . The mixture coming from the carburetor was intentionally rich , and the vaporizer heated it and mixed it with more air to lean it out to the final ratio before entering the intake manifold . The intake system also had a water - bath air cleaner to filter the dust out of the air inhaled by the engine ( an invention that did not originate at Ford but that was still rather novel in 1917 ) . Air cleaning is critical to engine lifespan , even for road vehicles and most especially for farming and construction vehicles ( which work in environments where dirt is frequently stirred up into the air ) . The Fordson carburetor and air cleaner were designed by Holley . In later decades , the water bath would be replaced with an oil bath for better filtering performance . </P> <P> The ignition system was similar to that of the Model T , with a flywheel - mounted low - tension magneto and trembler coils . The ignition timing was manually advanced or retarded with the spark advance lever mounted near the steering column , which rotated the timer . The cooling was by thermosiphon . ( In later decades , a high - tension magneto and a water pump would be added . ) The transmission was a three - speed spur gear ( the three forward speeds ranged from approximately 2 \u200b \u2044 to 6 \u200b \u2044 mph ) . A worm drive reduction set and a differential made up the rear . The design of the rear was patented for its ease of manufacture and service . Brakes were not provided on early Fordsons , as high - ratio worm sets generally transmitted rotation in one direction only , from the worm element to the gear element , because of the high power loss through friction . To stop the tractor , the driver depressed the clutch . </P> <P> Ford engineer Eugene Farkas successfully made the engine block , oil pan , transmission , and rear axle stressed members constituting the frame . By eliminating the need for a heavy separate frame , costs were reduced and manufacturing was simplified . Ford held a patent on a unit - frame tractor . The rear wheels were fabricated steel , spoked and cleated . The earliest ones were 12 - spoke ; a 14 - spoke version followed . Several models of front wheel were used , including 10 - spoked fabricated steel and 5 - spoke cast iron . Industrial models also used other wheels designed for specific tasks , including aftermarket wheels . </P> <P> In 1916 and 1917 , the name `` Fordson '' was not yet used as the tractor 's make or model name , nor was `` Model F '' . During this period , terms such as `` the ( real / genuine ) Ford tractor '' or `` the Henry Ford tractor '' , as well as `` the MOM tractor '' ( because almost all output was going to the British Ministry of Munitions ) , were used . In early 1918 , the name `` Fordson '' was trademarked , and within a few months it was being marked on the tractors . Published sources vary somewhat on the origin of the name . All agree that the name reflects the contemporary name of the tractor company , `` Henry Ford & Son '' , and its obvious eponyms : Henry and Edsel . Some claim that the company had been using the cable address `` Fordson '' for several years , which would mean even before the company was officially incorporated in July 1917 . Another implies that February 1918 marked the first use of `` Fordson '' in a cablegram . Regardless , by April 1918 the name `` Fordson '' was established as the brand , and its eponyms were obvious . In that month , U.S. sales began under County War Board distribution rules . The Model F designation ( for essentially the same model , with improvements ) began in 1919 . Sales boomed in 1918 and 1919 . </P> <P> There was nothing about the Fordson 's design or farming capabilities that was a `` first ever '' among tractors ( Ford 's version of a unit f\n\nQuestion:\nwhat was the last year ford made tractors\n", "answer": "1964"}

The answer should be a number\n\nQuestion:\nwhen did canada sign the un declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples\n\nDocument:\nainful histories and are resolved to move forward together on the path of human rights , justice and development for all . '' Louise Arbour , a former justice of the Supreme Court of Canada then serving as the UN 's High Commissioner for Human Rights , expressed satisfaction at the hard work and perseverance that had finally `` borne fruit in the most comprehensive statement to date of indigenous peoples ' rights . '' Similarly , news of the Declaration 's adoption was greeted with jubilation in Africa and , present at the General Assembly session in New York , Bolivian foreign minister David Choquehuanca said that he hoped the member states that had voted against or abstained would reconsider their refusal to support a document he described as being as important as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . Bolivia has become the first country to approve the U.N. declaration of indigenous rights . Evo Morales , President of Bolivia , stated , `` We are the first country to turn this declaration into a law and that is important , brothers and sisters . We recognize and salute the work of our representatives . But if we were to remember the indigenous fight clearly , many of us who are sensitive would end up crying in remembering the discrimination , the scorn . '' </P> <P> Stephen Corry , Director of the international indigenous rights organization Survival International , said , `` The declaration has been debated for nearly a quarter century . Years which have seen many tribal peoples , such as the Akuntsu and Kano\u00ea in Brazil , decimated and others , such as the Innu in Canada , brought to the edge . Governments that oppose it are shamefully fighting against the human rights of their most vulnerable peoples . Claims they make to support human rights in other areas will be seen as hypocritical . '' </P> Australia ( edit ) <P> The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies formally acknowledges and upholds the principles of the Declaration in both their Collection Access and Use Policy and their Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies . </P> <H3> Criticism , defiance and `` aspirational '' nullification ( edit ) </H3> <P> Prior to the adoption of the Declaration , and throughout the 62nd session of the General Assembly , a number of countries expressed concern about some key issues , such as self - determination , access to lands , territories and resources and the lack of a clear definition of the term `` indigenous '' . In addition to those intending to vote against the adoption of the declaration , a group of African countries represented by Namibia proposed to defer action , to hold further consultations , and to conclude consideration of the declaration by September 2007 . Ultimately , after agreeing on some adjustments to the Draft Declaration , a vast majority of states recognized that these issues could be addressed by each country at the national level . </P> <P> The four states that voted against continued to express serious reservations about the final text of the Declaration as placed before the General Assembly . As mentioned above , all four opposing countries have since then changed their vote in favour of the Declaration . </P> Australia ( edit ) <P> Australia 's government opposed the Declaration in the General Assembly vote of 2007 , but has since endorsed the Declaration . Australia 's Mal Brough , Minister for Families , Community Services and Indigenous Affairs , referring to the provision regarding the upholding of indigenous peoples ' customary legal systems , said that `` There should only be one law for all Australians and we should not enshrine in law practices that are not acceptable in the modern world . '' </P> <P> Marise Payne , Liberal Party Senator for New South Wales , further elaborated on the Australian government 's objections to the Declaration in a speech to the Australian Senate : </P> <Ul> <Li> Concerns about references to self - determination and their potential to be misconstrued . </Li> <Li> Ignorance of contemporary realities concerning land and resources . `` They seem , to many readers , to require the recognition of Indigenous rights to lands which are now lawfully owned by other citizens , both Indigenous and non-Indigenous , and therefore to have some quite significant potential to impact on the rights of third parties . '' </Li> <Li> Concerns over the extension of Indigenous intellectual property rights under the declaration as unnecessary under current international and Australian law . </Li> <Li> The potential abuse of the right under the Declaration for indigenous peoples to unqualified consent on matters affecting them , `` which implies to some readers that they may then be able to exercise a right of veto over all matters of state , which would include national laws and other administrative measures . '' </Li> <Li> The exclusivity of indigenous rights over intellectual , real and cultural property , that `` does not acknowledge the rights of third parties -- in particular , their rights to access Indigenous land and heritage and cultural objects where appropriate under national law . '' Furthermore , that the Declaration `` fails to consider the different types of ownership and use that can be accorded to Indigenous people and the rights of third parties to property in that regard . '' </Li> <Li> Concerns that the Declaration places indigenous customary law in a superior position to national law , and that this may `` permit the exercise of practices which would not be acceptable across the board '' , such as customary corporal and capital punishments . </Li> </Ul> <P> In October 2007 former Australian Prime Minister John Howard pledged to hold a referendum on changing the constitution to recognise indigenous Australians if re-elected . He said that the distinctiveness of people 's identity and their rights to preserve their heritage should be acknowledged . </P> <P> On 3 April 2009 , the Rudd Government formally endorsed the Declaration . </P> Canada ( edit ) <P> The Canadian government said that while it supported the `` spirit '' of the declaration , it contained elements that were `` fundamentally incompatible with Canada 's constitutional framework '' , which includes both the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and Section 35 , which enshrines aboriginal and treaty rights . In particular , the Canadian government had problems with Article 19 ( which appears to require governments to secure the consent of indigenous peoples regarding matters of general public policy ) , and Articles 26 and 28 ( which could allow for the re-opening or repudiation of historically settled land claims ) . </P> <P> Former Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Chuck Strahl described the document as `` unworkable in a Western democracy under a constitutional government . '' Strahl elaborated , saying `` In Canada , you are balancing individual rights vs. collective rights , and ( this ) document ... has none of that . By signing on , you default to this document by saying that the only rights in play here are the rights of the First Nations . And , of course , in Canada , that 's inconsistent with our constitution . '' He gave an example : `` In Canada ... you negotiate on this ... because ( native rights ) do n't trump all other rights in the country . You need also to consider the people who have sometimes also lived on those lands for two or three hundred years , and have hunted and fished alongside the First Nations . '' </P> <P> The Assembly of First Nations passed a resolution in December 2007 to invite Presidents Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Evo Morales to Canada to put pressure on the government to sign the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples , calling the two heads of state `` visionary leaders '' and demanding Canada resign its membership on the United Nations Human Rights Council . </P> <P> On 3 March 2010 , in the Speech From the Throne , the Governor General of Canada announced that the government was moving to endorse the declaration . `` We are a country with an Aboriginal heritage . A growing number of states have given qualified recognition to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples . Our Government will take steps to endorse this aspirational document in a manner fully consistent with Canada 's Constitution and laws . '' </P> <P> On 12 November 2010 , Canada officially endorsed the declaration but without changing its position that it was ' aspirational ' . </P> <P> Anishinabek spiritual leader , Chief William Commanda ( 1908 - 3 August 2011 ) was honoured at the 21st annual week - long First Peoples ' Festival held in Montreal from 2 -- 9 August 2011 , celebrating Canada 's 2010 adoption of the U.N. declaration . AFN Innu representative , Ghislain Picard 's tribute praised Grandfather Commanda for his work that was `` key not only in the adoption of the U.N. declaration , but in all the work leading up to it throughout the last 25 years . '' </P> <P> In 2015 , Romeo Saganash ( a Cree Member of Parliament for Abitibi -- Baie - James -- Nunavik -- Eeyou ) sponsored Private Member 's Bill C - 641 , the `` United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act '' , which would have required the Canadian government to ensure that the laws of Canada are in harmony with UNDRIP but it was defeated on May 6 , 2015 . </P> <P> In 2016 , Canada officially adopted and promised to implement the declaration fully . Speaking at the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues , Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada minister Carolyn Bennett announced , `` We are now a full supporter of the declaration , without qualification . We intend nothing less than to adopt and implement the declaration in accordance with the Canadian Constitution . '' Bennett described the Declaration as `` breathing life into Section 35 ( of the Canadian Constitution ) and recognizing it as a full box of rights for Indigenous Peoples in Canada . '' In July 2016 , Kwakwaka'wakw Justice Minister Jody Wilson - Raybould gave a speech that stated that `` adopting the UNDRIP as being Canadian law are unworkable '' , due to its incompatibility with the Indian Act , the current governing statute . </P> <P> The federal government pledged on 21 June 2017 to rename its National Aboriginal Day to be consistent with the terminology used by the Declaration . </P> <P> In September 2017 , British Columbia provincial government announced that it will govern in accordance with the principles outlined in the Declaration . </P> New Zealand ( edit ) New Zealand delegation at the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues . New Zealand endorsed the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in April 2010 . <P> In 2007 New Zealand 's Minister of M\u0101ori Affairs Parekura Horomia described the Declaration as `` toothless '' , and said , `` There are four provisions we have problems with , which make the declaration fundamentally incompatible with New Zealand 's constitutional and legal arrangements . '' Article 26 in particular , he said , `` appears to require recognition of rights to lands now lawfully owned by other citizens , both indigenous and non-indigenous . This ignores contemporary reality and would be impossible to implement . '' </P> <P> In response , M\u0101ori Party leader Pita Sharples said it was `` shameful to the extreme that New Zealand voted against the outlawing of discrimination against indigenous people ; voted against justice , dignity and fundamental freedoms for all '' . </P> <P> On 7 July 2009 , the New Zealand government announced that it would support the Declaration ; this , however , appeared to be a premature announcement by Pita Sharples , the current Minister of M\u0101ori Affairs , as the New Zealand government cautiously backtracked on Sharples ' July announcement . However , on 19 April 2010 , Sharples announced New Zealand 's support of the declaration at a speech in New York . </P> United states ( edit ) <P> Speaking for the United States mission to the UN , spokesman Benjamin Chang said , `` What was done today is not clear . The way it stands now is subject to multiple interpretations and does n't establish a clear universal principle . '' The U.S. mission also issued a floor document , `` Observations of the United States with respect to the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples '' , setting out its objections to the Declaration . Most of these are based on the same points as the three other countries ' rejections but , in addition , the United States drew attention to the Declaration 's failure to provide a clear definition of exactly whom the term `` indigenous peoples '' is intended to cover . </P> <P> On 16 December 2010 , President Obama declared that the United States would `` lend its support '' to the Declaration . The decision was announced during the second White House Tribal Nations Conference , where he said he is `` working hard to live up to '' the name that was given to him by the Crow Nation : `` One Who Helps People Throughout the Land . '' Obama has told Native American leaders that he wants to improve the `` nation - to - nation '' relationship between the United States and the tribes and repair broken promises . Today , there are more than 560 Indian tribes in the United States that are recognized at the federal level , with some sixty - plus tribes recognized at the state level . Many had representatives at the White House conference and applauded Obama 's announcement . </P> <P> The Obama administration 's decision came after three consultation meetings with Native Americans and more than 3,000 written comments on the subject . The support of the government also included several interpretations of the meaning of the Declaration . In the view of the United States government , the Declaration advances `` a new and distinct international concept of self - determination specific to indigenous peoples , '' which is not the same as the existing concept in intern\n", "answer": "2016"}

In 1947 , he became the first pilot confirmed to have exceeded the speed of sound in level flight . </P> <P> Yeager 's career began in World War II as a private in the United States Army Air Forces . After serving as an aircraft mechanic , in September 1942 he entered enlisted pilot training and upon graduation was promoted to the rank of flight officer ( the World War II USAAF equivalent to warrant officer ) and became a P - 51 fighter pilot . </P> <P> After the war , Yeager became a test pilot of many types of aircraft , including experimental rocket - powered aircraft . As the first human to officially break the sound barrier , on October 14 , 1947 , he flew the experimental Bell X-1 at Mach 1 at an altitude of 45,000 ft ( 13,700 m ) . He then went on to break several other speed and altitude records . </P> <P> Yeager later commanded fighter squadrons and wings in Germany , and in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War , and in recognition of the outstanding performance ratings of those units he was promoted to brigadier general .

He had two brothers , Roy and Hal Jr. , and two sisters , Doris Ann ( accidentally killed at age 2 by 6 - year - old Roy playing with a shotgun ) and Pansy Lee . His first experience with the military was as a teen at the Citizens Military Training Camp at Fort Benjamin Harrison , Indianapolis , Indiana , during the summers of 1939 and 1940 . On February 26 , 1945 , Yeager married Glennis Dickhouse , and the couple had four children . Glennis died in 1990 . </P> <P> The name `` Yeager '' ( / \u02c8je\u026a\u0261\u0259r / ) is an Anglicized form of the German name J\u00e4ger or Jaeger ( German : `` hunter '' ) . He is the cousin of former baseball catcher Steve Yeager . </P> <H2> Career ( edit ) </H2> <H3> World War II ( edit ) </H3> <P> Yeager enlisted as a private in the U.S. Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) on September 12 , 1941 , and became an aircraft mechanic at George Air Force Base , Victorville , California . At enlistment , Yeager was not eligible for flight training because of his age and educational background , but the entry of the U.S. into World War II less than three months later prompted the USAAF to alter its recruiting standards . Having unusually sharp vision ( a visual acuity rated 20 / 10 ) , which once enabled him to shoot a deer at 600 yards ( 550 m ) , Yeager displayed natural talent as a pilot and was accepted for flight training . </P> <P> He received his wings and a promotion to flight officer at Luke Field , Arizona , where he graduated from class 43C on March 10 , 1943 . Assigned to the 357th Fighter Group at Tonopah , Nevada , he initially trained as a fighter pilot , flying Bell P - 39 Airacobras ( being grounded for seven days for clipping a farmer 's tree during a training flight ) , and shipped overseas with the group on November 23 , 1943 . </P> P - 51D - 20NA , Glamorous Glen III , is the aircraft in which Yeager achieved most of his aerial victories . <P> Stationed in the United Kingdom at RAF Leiston , Yeager flew P - 51 Mustangs in combat with the 363d Fighter Squadron . He named his aircraft Glamorous Glen after his girlfriend , Glennis Faye Dickhouse , who became his wife in February 1945 . Yeager had gained one victory before he was shot down over France in his first aircraft ( P - 51B - 5 - NA s / n 43 - 6763 ) on March 5 , 1944 during his eighth mission . He escaped to Spain on March 30 with the help of the Maquis ( French Resistance ) and returned to England on May 15 , 1944 . During his stay with the Maquis , Yeager assisted the guerrillas in duties that did not involve direct combat ; he helped to construct bombs for the group , a skill that he had learned from his father . He was awarded the Bronze Star for helping a B - 24 navigator , `` Pat '' Patterson , who was shot in the knee during the escape attempt , to cross the Pyrenees . Yeager cut off the tendon by which Patterson 's leg was hanging below the knee , then tied off the leg with a spare shirt made of parachute silk . </P> <P> Despite a regulation prohibiting `` evaders '' ( escaped pilots ) from flying over enemy territory again , the purpose of which was to prevent a second capture from compromising resistance groups , Yeager was reinstated to flying combat . He had joined another evader , fellow P - 51 pilot 1st Lt Fred Glover , in speaking directly to the Supreme Allied Commander , General Dwight D. Eisenhower , on June 12 , 1944 . With Glover pleading their case , they argued that because the Allies had invaded France and the Maquis were by then openly fighting the Nazis alongside Allied troops , if Yeager or Glover were shot down again , there was little about those who had previously helped them evade capture that could be revealed to the enemy . </P> <P> Eisenhower , after gaining permission from the War Department to decide the requests , concurred with Yeager and Glover . Yeager later credited his postwar success in the Air Force to this decision , saying that his test pilot career followed naturally from his having been a decorated combat pilot , along with having been an aircraft mechanic before attending pilot school . In part , because of his maintenance background , he also frequently served as a maintenance officer in his flying units . </P> <P> Yeager demonstrated outstanding flying skills and combat leadership . On October 12 , 1944 , he became the first pilot in his group to make `` ace in a day , '' downing five enemy aircraft in a single mission . Two of these kills were scored without firing a single shot : when he flew into firing position against a Messerschmitt Bf 109 , the pilot of the aircraft panicked , breaking to starboard and colliding with his wingman . Yeager said both pilots bailed out . He finished the war with 11.5 official victories , including one of the first air - to - air victories over a jet fighter , a German Messerschmitt Me 262 that he shot down on final approach for landing . </P> <P> In his 1986 memoirs , Yeager recalled with disgust that `` atrocities were committed by both sides '' said he went on a mission with orders from the Eighth Air Force to `` strafe anything that moved . '' During the mission briefing , he whispered to Major Donald H. Bochkay , `` If we are going to do things like this , we sure as hell better make sure we are on the winning side . '' Yeager said , `` I 'm certainly not proud of that particular strafing mission against civilians . But it is there , on the record and in my memory . '' He has also expressed bitterness at his treatment in Britain during WWII , describing the British as `` arrogant '' and `` nasty '' . </P> <P> Yeager was commissioned a second lieutenant while at Leiston , and was promoted to captain before the end of his tour . He flew his 61st and final mission on January 15 , 1945 , and returned to the United States in early February . As an evader , he received his choice of assignments and , because his new wife was pregnant , chose Wright Field to be near his home in West Virginia .

After Bell Aircraft test pilot Chalmers `` Slick '' Goodlin demanded $150,000 ( $1.6 million in 2015 dollars ) to break the sound `` barrier , '' the USAAF selected Yeager to fly the rocket - powered Bell XS - 1 in a NACA program to research high - speed flight . </P> Yeager in front of the Bell X-1 , which , as with all of the aircraft assigned to him , he named Glamorous Glennis ( or some variation thereof ) , after his wife . Yeager in the Bell X-1 cockpit <P> Such was the difficulty in this task that the answer to many of the inherent challenges was along the lines of `` Yeager better have paid - up insurance . '' Two nights before the scheduled date for the flight , Yeager broke two ribs when he fell from a horse . He was worried that the injury would remove him from the mission and reported that he went to a civilian doctor in nearby Rosamond , who taped his ribs . Yeager told only his wife , as well as friend and fellow project pilot Jack Ridley , about the accident . On the day of the flight , Yeager was in such pain that he could not seal the X-1's hatch by himself . Ridley rigged up a device , using the end of a broom handle as an extra lever , to allow Yeager to seal the hatch . </P> <P> Yeager broke the sound barrier on October 14 , 1947 , flying the X-1 at Mach 1.07 at an altitude of 45,000 ft ( 13,700 m ) . over the Rogers Dry Lake in the Mojave Desert . Yeager was awarded the MacKay and Collier Trophies in 1948 for his mach - transcending flight , and the Harmon International Trophy in 1954 . The X-1 he flew that day was later put on permanent display at the Smithsonian Institution 's National Air and Space Museum . </P> <P> Yeager went on to break many other speed and altitude records .

The answer should be a number\n\nDocument:\nch : Loi sur les Indiens ) , ( the Act ) is a Canadian Act of Parliament that concerns registered Indians , their bands , and the system of Indian reserves . First passed in 1876 and still in force with amendments , it is the primary document which defines how the Government of Canada interacts with the 614 First Nation bands in Canada and their members . Throughout its long history the Act has been an ongoing subject of controversy and has been interpreted in different ways by both Aboriginal Canadians and non-Aboriginal Canadians . The legislation has been amended many times , including `` over twenty major changes '' made by 2002 . </P> <P> The Act is very wide - ranging in scope , covering governance , land use , healthcare , education , and more on Indian reserves . Notably , the original Indian Act does two things affecting all indigenous peoples in Canada : </P> <Ul> <Li> It says how reserves and bands can operate . The Act sets out rules for governing Indian reserves , defines how bands can be created and spells out the powers of `` band councils '' . Bands do not have to have reserve lands to operate under the act . </Li> <Li> It defines who is , and who is not recognized as an `` Indian '' . The Act defines a number of types of Indian people who are not recognized as `` registered '' or `` status '' Indians and who are therefore denied membership in bands . </Li> </Ul> <P> The Act 's existence is necessitated by the fact that First Nations ( historically called `` Indians '' ) relate differently to the state because of inherited legal arrangements such as the Royal Proclamation of 1763 and various treaties , and because Canada 's constitution specifically assigns Native issues to the federal , rather than provincial governments , by the terms of Section 91 ( 24 ) of the Constitution Act , 1867 . The Indian Act replaces any laws on the topic passed by a local legislature before a province joined Canadian Confederation , creating a definitive national policy on the subject . The Act is not a treaty ; it is Canada 's legal response to the treaties . Nevertheless , its unilateral nature , imposed on indigenous peoples by the Canadian government in contrast to the treaties , is itself a source of discontent among Native peoples in Canada . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Original rationale and purpose </Li> <Li> 2 Definitions <Ul> <Li> 2.1 `` Reserve '' </Li> <Li> 2.2 `` Band '' </Li> <Li> 2.3 `` Indian '' <Ul> <Li> 2.3. 1 Loss of status prior to 1985 amendments <Ul> <Li> 2.3. 1.1 Discriminatory definition issues </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Policies enacted via the Indian Act <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Gender discrimination </Li> <Li> 3.2 Residential schools </Li> <Li> 3.3 Bans on religious ceremonies ( `` Potlatch Law '' ) </Li> <Li> 3.4 Restriction on access to the courts </Li> <Li> 3.5 Tax exemption </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Relation to the Constitution <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Section 88 </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 History of proposed and actual changes <Ul> <Li> 5.1 List of precursors and amendments <Ul> <Li> 5.1. 1 Pre-Confederation </Li> <Li> 5.1. 2 Post-Confederation </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5.2 Attempts to repeal or replace <Ul> <Li> 5.2. 1 Failed major changes </Li> <Li> 5.2. 2 Opt - outs </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Case law </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 Further reading </Li> <Li> 9 References <Ul> <Li> 9.1 Citations </Li> <Li> 9.2 Bibliography </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Original rationale and purpose ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Indian enfranchisement in Canada `` The great aim of our legislation has been to do away with the tribal system and assimilate the Indian people in all respects with the other inhabitants of the Dominion as speedily as they are fit to change . '' <P> John A Macdonald , 1887 </P> <P> The Indian Act was first passed in 1876 as a consolidation of various laws concerning indigenous peoples enacted by the separate colonies of British North America prior to Canadian Confederation , most notably the Gradual Civilization Act passed by the Parliament of the Province of Canada in 1857 and the Gradual Enfranchisement Act of 1869 . The Indian Act was passed by the Parliament of Canada under the provisions of Section 91 ( 24 ) of the Constitution Act , 1867 , which provides Canada 's federal government exclusive authority to govern in relation to `` Indians and Lands Reserved for Indians '' . It was an attempt to codify rights promised to Native peoples by British King George III in the Royal Proclamation of 1763 , while at the same time enforcing Euro - Canadian standards of `` civilization '' . The purpose of the act , as stated by its drafters , was to administer Indian affairs in such a way that Indian people would feel compelled to renounce their Indian status and join Canadian civilization as full members : a process called enfranchisement . </P> <P> The idea of enfranchisement predated the 1876 version of Indian Act and survived in some form until 1985 . Upon the introduction in 1857 by the Tach\u00e9 - Macdonald administration of the Gradual Civilization Act and until 1961 , the enfranchisement process was compulsory for men of age 21 able to read and write English . </P> <P> Reserves , under this legislation , were islands within Canada to which were attached a different set of rights . `` Enfranchisement '' derives from the idea of `` franchise '' , which has gradually been degraded as `` vote '' . Indigenous people with the franchise were allowed to vote for representatives , were expected to pay taxes and lived `` off - reserve '' . By contrast , groups of people who lived on a reserve were subject to a different set of rights and obligations . One needed to descend from an Indian to be allowed to live on a reserve . </P> <P> The tenure of land in a reserve was limited to the collective , or tribe , by virtue of a Crown protectorate . Interactions between enfranchised citizens and Indians were subject to strict controls ; for example , the enfranchised were forbidden by the Royal Proclamation of 1763 to traffic in alcohol or land with Indians . It was hoped through means of fiduciary duty voluntarily taken up by the Crown to preserve the Indian identity , but this was later vitiated by the compulsory enfranchisement scheme of the Gradual Civilization Act . The 1985 amendment to the Indian Act extinguished the idea of enfranchisement . </P> <H2> Definitions ( edit ) </H2> <H3> `` Reserve '' ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Indian reserve <P> Under the section entitled `` Reserves '' in the Indian Act , it is stated that reserves are `` to be held for use and benefit of Indians . </P> <P> 18 . ( 1 ) `` Subject to this Act , reserves are held by Her Majesty for the use and benefit of the respective bands for which they were set apart , and subject to this Act and to the terms of any treaty or surrender , the Governor in Council may determine whether any purpose for which lands in a reserve are used or are to be used is for the use and benefit of the band . Marginal note : Use of reserves for schools , etc . '' </P> -- R.S. , c . I - 6 , s . 18 . Indian Act <P> 18 .

Indian Act <H3> `` Band '' ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Band government <P> In the Indian Act , updated to April 2013 , the term `` band '' , </P> <P> `` means a body of Indians ( a ) for whose use and benefit in common , lands , the legal title to which is vested in Her Majesty , have been set apart before , on or after September 4 , 1951 , ( b ) for whose use and benefit in common , moneys are held by Her Majesty , or ( c ) declared by the Governor in Council to be a band for the purposes of this Act . '' </P> -- Indian Act <H3> `` Indian '' ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Indian Register <P> Fundamental to Canada 's ability to interact with First Nations peoples is the question of defining who they are ( e.g. who are the `` Indians '' of the Indian Act ? ) , and this aspect of the legislation has been an ongoing source of controversy throughout its history . Not all people who self - identify as `` Aboriginal '' are considered `` Indians '' under the terms of the act . Only those on the official Indian Register maintained by the federal government ( or a local `` band list '' in some cases ) are Status Indians , subject to the full legal benefits and restrictions of the Indian Act . Notably this excludes M\u00e9tis people , Inuit people , and so - called Non-Status Indians . Various amendments and court decisions have repeatedly altered the rules regarding who is eligible for Indian Status . Many bands now maintain their own band lists . </P> Loss of status prior to 1985 amendments ( edit ) <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section may contain too much repetition or redundant language . Please help improve it by merging similar text or removing repeated statements . ( August 2014 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Though people accepted into band membership under band rules may not be status Indians , Bill C - 31 clarified that various sections of the Indian Act would apply to such members . The sections in question are those relating to community life ( e.g. , land holdings ) . Sections relating to Indians ( Aboriginal people ) as individuals ( in this case , wills and taxation of personal property ) were not included . Prior to 1985 , Indians could lose status in a variety of ways including the following : </P> <Ul> <Li> marrying a man who was not a status Indian </Li> <Li> enfranchisement ( until 1960 , an Indian could vote in federal elections only by renouncing Indian status ) </Li> <Li> having at the age of 21 a mother and paternal grandmother who did not have status before marriage </Li> <Li> being born out of wedlock to a mother with status and a father without . </Li> </Ul> <P> These provisions interfered with the matrilineal cultures of many First Nations , whereby children were born to the mother 's clan and people , and gained their status in the tribe from her family . Often property and hereditary leadership passed through the maternal line . </P> <P> In Attorney General of Canada v. Lavell ( 1974 ) , these laws were upheld despite arguments made under the Canadian Bill of Rights . The Indian Act was amended in 1985 ( Bill C - 31 ) to restore status to people who had lost it in one of these ways , and to their children . </P> Discriminatory definition issues ( edit ) <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section relies largely or entirely on a single source .

( August 2014 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Bonita Lawrence ( 2003 ) discusses a feminist position on the relationship between federal definition and Indian identity in Canada . Until 1985 , subsection 12 ( 1 ) ( b ) of the act `` discriminated against Indian women by stripping them and their descendants of their Indian status if they married a man without Indian status . '' Under subsection 12 ( 2 ) of the act , `` ' illegitimate ' children of status Indian women could also lose status if the alleged father was known not to be a status Indian and if the child 's status as an Indian was `` protested '' by the Indian agent . '' Further , subparagraph 12 ( 1 ) ( a ) ( iv ) , which Lawrence calls the `` double mother '' clause , `` removed status from children when they reached the age of 21 if their mother and paternal grandmother did not have status before marriage . '' Much of the discrimination stems from the Indian Act amendments and modifications in 1951 . </P> <P> She discusses the struggles of Jeannette Corbiere Lavell and Yvonne B\u00e9dard in the early 1970s , two women who had both lost their Indian status for marrying white men . The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the Indian Act was not discriminatory , as the pair gained the legal rights of white women at the same time they lost the status of Indian women , in a parallel to R. v. Drybones ( supra ) . In 1981 , Sandra Lovelace , a Maliseet woman from western New Brunswick forced the issue by taking her case to the United Nations Human Rights Committee , contending that she should not have to lose her own status by her marriage .

Originally , Western Sephardic Jews settling in England in the 17th century would have prepared fried fish in a manner similar to Pescado frito , which is coated in a flour . Battered fish is first coated in flour then dipped into a batter consisting of flour mixed with liquid , usually water but sometimes beer . Some newer modifications to the recipe may have cornflour added , and instead of beer sometimes soda water is added . In 1860 , the first fish and chip shop was opened in London by Joseph Malin who sold `` fish fried in the Jewish fashion '' . </P> <P> Fish and chips became a stock meal among the working classes in England as a consequence of the rapid development of trawl fishing in the North Sea , and the development of railways which connected the ports to major industrial cities during the second half of the 19th century , so that fresh fish could be rapidly transported to the heavily populated areas . </P> <P> Deep - fried chips ( slices or pieces of potato ) as a dish may have first appeared in England in about the same period : the Oxford English Dictionary notes as its earliest usage of `` chips '' in this sense the mention in Charles Dickens ' A Tale of Two Cities ( 1859 ) : `` Husky chips of potatoes , fried with some reluctant drops of oil '' . </P> <P> The modern fish - and - chip shop ( `` chippy '' or `` chipper '' in modern British slang ) originated in the United Kingdom , although outlets selling fried food occurred commonly throughout Europe . Early fish - and - chip shops had only very basic facilities . Usually these consisted principally of a large cauldron of cooking fat , heated by a coal fire . The fish - and - chip shop later evolved into a fairly standard format , with the food served , in paper wrappings , to queuing customers , over a counter in front of the fryers . By 1910 , there were more than 25,000 fish and chip shops across the country , and in the 1920s there were more than 35,000 shops . As a boy Alfred Hitchcock lived above a fish and chip shop in London , which was the family business . According to Professor John Walton , author of Fish and Chips and the British Working Class , the British government made safeguarding supplies of fish and chips during World War I a priority : `` The cabinet knew it was vital to keep families on the home front in good heart , unlike the German regime that failed to keep its people well fed '' . In 1928 , Harry Ramsden opened his fish and chip shop in Guiseley , West Yorkshire . On a single day in 1952 , the shop served 10,000 portions of fish and chips , earning a place in the Guinness Book Of Records . In George Orwell 's The Road to Wigan Pier ( 1937 ) , documenting his experience of working class life in the north of England , the author considered fish and chips chief among the ' home comforts ' which acted as a panacea to the working classes . During World War II , fish and chips remained one of the few foods in the United Kingdom not subject to rationing . Prime Minister Winston Churchill referred to the combination of fish and chips as `` the good companions '' . John Lennon enjoyed his fish and chips -- a staple of the working class -- smothered in ketchup . </P> <P> British fish and chips were originally served in a wrapping of old newspapers but this practice has now largely ceased , with plain paper , cardboard , or plastic being used instead . In the United Kingdom , the Fish Labelling Regulations 2003 and in Ireland the European Communities ( Labelling of Fishery and Aquaculture Products ) Regulations 2003 respectively enact directive 2065 / 2001 / EC , and generally mean that `` fish '' must be sold with the particular commercial name or species named ; so , for example , `` cod and chips '' now appears on menus rather than the more vague `` fish and chips '' . In the United Kingdom the Food Standards Agency guidance excludes caterers from this ; but several local Trading Standards authorities and others do say it can not be sold merely as `` fish and chips '' . </P> <H3> United Kingdom ( edit ) </H3> A blue plaque in Oldham ( Greater Manchester ) in England marking the 1860s origins of the fish and chip shop and the fast food industry <P> A prominent meal in British culture , the dish became popular in wider circles in London and South East England in the middle of the 19th century : Charles Dickens mentions a `` fried fish warehouse '' in Oliver Twist , first published in 1838 , while in the north of England a trade in deep - fried chipped potatoes developed . The first chip shop stood on the present site of Oldham 's Tommyfield Market . It remains unclear exactly when and where these two trades combined to become the fish - and - chip shop industry we know . A Jewish immigrant , Joseph Malin , opened the first recorded combined fish - and - chip shop in London in 1860 or in 1865 ; a Mr Lees pioneered the concept in the North of England , in Mossley , in 1863 . </P> <P> The concept of a fish restaurant , as opposed to take - away , was introduced by Samuel Isaacs ( born 1856 in Whitechapel , London ; died 1939 in Brighton , Sussex ) who ran a thriving wholesale and retail fish business throughout London and the South of England in the latter part of the 19th century . Isaacs ' first restaurant opened in London in 1896 serving fish and chips , bread and butter , and tea for nine pence , and its popularity ensured a rapid expansion of the chain . </P> <P> The restaurants were carpeted , had table service , tablecloths , flowers , china and cutlery , and made the trappings of upmarket dining affordable to the working classes for the first time . They were located in Tottenham Court Road , St Pancras , The Strand , Hoxton , Shoreditch , Brixton and other London districts , as well as Clacton , Brighton , Ramsgate , Margate and other seaside resorts in southern England . Menus were expanded in the early 20th century to include meat dishes and other variations as their popularity grew to a total of thirty restaurants . Sam Isaacs ' trademark was the phrase `` This is the Plaice '' , combined with a picture of the punned - upon fish in question . A glimpse of the old Brighton restaurant at No. 1 Marine Parade can be seen in the background of Norman Wisdom 's 1955 film One Good Turn just as Wisdom / Pitkin runs onto the seafront ; this is now the site of a Harry Ramsden 's fish and chips restaurant . A blue plaque at Oldham 's Tommyfield Market marks the first chips fried in England in 1860 , and the origin of the fish and chip shop and fast food industries . </P> Fish and chips traditionally wrapped in white paper and newspaper <P> Dundee City Council claims that chips were first sold by a Belgian immigrant , Edward De Gernier , in the city 's Greenmarket in the 1870s . </P> <P> In Edinburgh , a combination of Gold Star brown sauce and water or malt vinegar , known as `` sauce '' , or more specifically as `` chippy sauce '' , has great popularity . </P> <H3> Fish & chips Awards ( edit ) </H3> <P> The annual National Fish & Chips Awards were set up in the UK in 1988 . The 30th Annual Fish & Chips Awards ceremony was attended by Norwegian ambassador to the UK Mona Juul . </P> <H3> Ireland ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Irish cuisine <P> In Ireland , the first fish and chips were sold by an Italian immigrant , Giuseppe Cervi , who mistakenly stepped off an North American - bound ship at Queenstown ( now Cobh ) in County Cork in the 1880s and walked all the way to Dublin . He started by selling fish and chips outside Dublin pubs from a handcart . He then found a permanent spot in Great Brunswick Street ( now Pearse Street ) . His wife Palma would ask customers `` Uno di questa , uno di quella ? '' This phrase ( meaning `` one of this , one of that '' ) entered the vernacular in Dublin as `` one and one '' , which is still a way of referring to fish and chips in the city . </P> <H3> New Zealand ( edit ) </H3> Main article : New Zealand cuisine <P> Fish and chips are the most popular takeaway food in New Zealand . Food historians have been unable to pinpoint exactly when the meal became an established part of New Zealand cuisine but all recognise that the first fish and chips shops were introduced by British settlers before World War I. During the 20th century , nearly every small town and suburb in New Zealand had at least one fish - and - chip shop . As in Britain , Friday night has been the traditional night to eat fish . </P> <P> Traditionally , fish and chips were served in wrappings of newspaper . With the decline of the newspaper industry , this has become less common . </P> <P> In 1980 , four up - and - coming Labour Party politicians , including David Lange , were nicknamed the `` Fish and Chip Brigade '' due to a picture published at the time with the group eating fish and chips . </P> <H3> United States ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Cuisine of the United States <P> In the United States , the dish is most commonly sold as `` fish and chips '' , except in Upstate New York and Wisconsin and other parts of the Northeast and Upper Midwest , where this dish would be called a fish fry . Despite the name `` fish and chips '' , and the US meaning of `` chips '' , the dish is served with French fries ( much thinner than British and Irish chips ) . In the Southern United States , a common form of cuisine is fried catfish with French fries , accompanied by coleslaw , pickles , raw onion slices and lemon slices . </P> <H2> Composition ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Cooking ( edit ) </H3> Frying range <P> Traditional frying uses beef dripping or lard ; however , vegetable oils , such as peanut oil ( used because of its relatively high smoke point ) now predominate . A minority of vendors in the North of England and Scotland , and the majority of vendors in Northern Ireland , still use dripping or lard , as it imparts a different flavour to the dish , but this makes the fried chips unsuitable for vegetarians and for adherents of certain faiths . Lard is used in some living industrial history museums , such as the Black Country Living Museum . </P> <H3> Thickness ( edit ) </H3> Fish and chips at a Hesburger fast food restaurant , advertised as particularly English <P> British and Irish chips are usually thicker than American - style French fries sold by major multinational fast food chains , resulting in a lower fat content per portion . In their homes or in some restaurants , people in or from the United States may eat a thick type of chip , more similar to the British and Irish variant , sometimes referred to as steak fries . </P> <H3> Batter ( edit ) </H3> <P> In Britain and Ireland , fish and chip shops traditionally use a simple water and flour batter , adding a little sodium bicarbonate ( baking soda ) and a little vinegar to create lightness , as they react to create bubbles in the batter .

A national invalid diasbility pension was started in 1910 , and a national maternity allowance was introduced in 1912 . </P> <P> During the Second World War , Australia under a labor government created a welfare state by enacting national schemes for : child endowment in 1941 ( superseding the 1927 New South Wales scheme ) ; a widows ' pension in 1942 ( superseding the New South Wales 1926 scheme ) ; a wife 's allowance in 1943 ; additional allowances for the children of pensioners in 1943 ; and unemployment , sickness , and special benefits in 1945 ( superseding the Queensland 1923 scheme ) . </P> <P> The Social Services Legislation Amendment ( Welfare Reform ) Bill 2017 has changed several aspects of social security in Australia , and has been given assent to as of 11 April 2018 . It includes a demerit - point system for not meeting welfare obligations . </P> <H2> Contemporary welfare attitudes ( edit ) </H2> <P> Current attitudes toward welfare in Australia can be separated into support for the welfare system and support for welfare recipients . A multivariate analysis using canonical correlation analysis identified five distinct profiles of welfare attitudes and socio - demographic characteristics . The main attitude cluster was one toward support for the welfare system and welfare recipients . Having receiving government welfare in the past strongly predicted a person supporting the welfare system and its beneficiaries . The next most prominent attitude profile was summarized as ' the welfare system is good but the people on it are lazy and dependent ' . This attitude profile was found among people receiving welfare payments that were either normative ( e.g. the age pension ) or where there is little expectation that a person will return to work ( e.g. disability support pension ) . Overall , Australian 's hold more negative attitudes toward welfare recipients than they do the welfare system . People with a history of receiving unemployment benefits tend to have more negative welfare attitudes if they live in areas where other community members have more negative attitudes . </P> <H2> Legal framework ( edit ) </H2> <P> Social security payments and other benefits are currently made available under the following acts of parliament : </P> <Ul> <Li> Social Security Act 1991 </Li> <Li> A New Tax System ( Family Assistance ) Act 1999 </Li> <Li> Student Assistance Act 1973 </Li> <Li> Paid Parental Leave Act 2010 </Li> </Ul> <H2> Payments under the Social Security Act and the student Assistance Act ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> ABSTUDY -- offers a range of allowances to assist Indigenous students and New Apprentices . </Li> <Li> Age Pension -- for people planning for retirement or who are already retired aged 65 years and over . </Li> <Li> Assistance for Isolated Children -- for families with a child who can not attend school locally because of distance or special needs . </Li> <Li> Austudy Payment -- for full - time students and New Apprentices aged 25 years or over . </Li> <Li> Carer Allowance -- for people who care for minors 16 -- 17 and adults over 18 years with a disability . </Li> <Li> Carer Allowance ( Child ) -- for people who care for a child under 16 years with a disability . </Li> <Li> Carer Payment -- for people who provide full - time care for someone with a disability </Li> <Li> Disability Support Pension -- for people unable to work for 2 years due to illness , injury or disability . </Li> <Li> Double Orphan Pension -- for people who are raising children who have lost both parents . </Li> <Li> Maternity Payment -- for help with those extra costs after the birth of a new baby . </Li> <Li> Newstart Allowance -- for people who are looking for employment . </Li> <Li> Parenting Payment -- for parents or guardians to help with the cost of raising children under 6 for partnered parents and under 8 for sole parents . </Li> <Li> Pensioner Education Supplement -- for people on pensions with education expenses . </Li> <Li> Special Benefit -- for people who are in financial hardship , have no way of supporting themselves and are not entitled to another payment ( normally due to residency requirements ) </Li> <Li> Youth Allowance -- for full - time students or New Apprentices aged 15 ( under some circumstances ) 16 to 24 and people aged under 21 who are undertaking job search or a combination of approved activities . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Income support ( edit ) </H3> <P> All Centrelink income support payments are payable fortnightly , usually by direct deposit required into the recipient 's bank account . They are also subject to a means test which calculates the recipient ( and their partner 's ) fortnightly income and assets and affects the rate of their payment accordingly . As such , people on lower incomes may be entitled to part - payment of their allowance ( subject to other qualification requirements ) . The assessment of income and assets varies greatly between different social security payments and the effect that income and assets have on each payment differs in that they have different income thresholds ( i.e. how much income one can earn before it affects their payment ) and different taper rates ( the amount the payment drops by per dollar above these thresholds ) . </P> <P> An individual may be precluded from claiming any of income support payments listed below for a certain number of weeks following receipt of a lump sum compensation payment , made wholly or partly in respect of lost earnings or lost capacity to earn resulting from personal injury ( often received in settlement of a Workers ' Compensation claim ) . The number of weeks for which the preclusion period applies to an individual is proportional the size of the lump sum payment they received . Centrelink has a discretion to reduce the duration of the preclusion period if it is satisfied that there exist special circumstances that make an individual 's case out of the ordinary : for example , extreme financial hardship . </P> Age pension ( edit ) <P> The Age Pension was the first payment made by the Commonwealth Government , dating back to 1909 . It is available to persons aged 65 years and over . The eligibility age is currently being progressively increased to a cap of 67 years old . Except for the mandatory superannuation scheme , workers do not contribute to a pension or insurance scheme in Australia , unlike pension schemes in many other countries . Taxpayer - funded pensions are means tested . </P> Newstart Allowance ( edit ) <P> Newstart Allowance is an unemployment benefit paid to unemployed people aged 22 to 64 . To be eligible , a person must apply for the benefit and be actively seeking work . On 1 July 1991 , it replaced the Unemployment Benefit ( UB ) which had been unchanged since 1945 . It was part of a government reform called Newstart - the Active Employment Strategy . </P> <P> It is paid on the basis of a ' mutual agreement ' between the customer and Centrelink , where Centrelink will continue to pay fortnightly payments to the customer for so long as the customer attempts to find employment and fulfills the mutual obligation requirements . These mutual agreements are negotiated between Centrelink , the job seeker and their Job Services Australia provider or Disability Employment Services provider , and are recorded into an Employment Pathway Plan or `` EPP '' . Activities to which a job seeker may have to agree , in order to continue receiving the Newstart Allowance , include applying for a specific number of jobs ( usually ten ) per fortnight and recording these applications in a Centrelink issued diary , undertaking vocational education or training , paid work experience , participation in a labour market program or Work for the Dole project , and other activities , such as voluntary work if considered appropriate by Centrelink . For example , more elderly customers who have been made redundant and are approaching the age pension age , and who may face considerable difficulties re-entering the labour market , are often permitted to fulfil their plan by engaging in voluntary activities alone . A job seeker has to nominate and engage in one activity ( for example , either a vocational education activity or Work for the Dole activity ) in any one mutual obligation period ( lasting six months at a time ) . </P> <P> Clients are not expected to engage in the more intensive of these activities as soon as their receipt of the allowance commences . The amount of activity required on behalf of the client in order to continue receiving his / her benefit is usually staggered as follows : </P> <Ul> <Li> Ordinarily , during the first three months of unemployment , a job seeker has no other obligations but to submit a fortnightly Application For Payment form at the local office . The form asks the applicant a number of questions about his / her circumstances and for the basic details of four positions for which the job seeker applied in the last fortnight . Customers may also be required to make up to 10 ' Job Search Contacts ' per fortnight ( dependent on the local labour market and their personal circumstances ) and record the details of these jobs within a specifically issued Job Seeker Diary for a given period of time . The job seeker then takes the Application For Payment form personally to the local Centrelink Office . He will then attend a short one - on - one interview with a Centrelink officer . The interview is usually for the purposes of checking that the application form is in order and that the applicant is aware of any appointments that may need to be attended , and obligations that may need to be met . The client at this stage also has the opportunity to talk to a Centrelink officer about any problems the client may be encountering without having to make a prior appointment first . </Li> <Li> If after an initial three months of unemployment , during which the job seeker has only to hand in the fortnightly application form and record the Job Seeker Diary , the client remains unemployed ; the client will be required to attend appointments with a Job Services Australia provider whose responsibility it is to assist the client to re-enter the work force . The job seeker also has to attend a two - week training course which focusses on job searching skills such as writing resumes and attending interviews . </Li> <Li> If the customer remains unemployed for twelve months , they are then subject to the Work Experience Phase of their Employment Pathway Plan , which consists of more intensive assistance involving the activities listed above , such as , Work for the Dole , accredited study , part - time work , volunteer work or a combination of these .

The third U.S. President ( 1801 -- 09 ) , Thomas Jefferson , is featured on the obverse of the note . The reverse features an engraving of the painting The Declaration of Independence by John Trumbull . Throughout the $2 bill 's pre-1929 life as a large - sized note , it was issued as a United States Note , National Bank Note , silver certificate , Treasury or `` Coin '' Note and Federal Reserve Bank Note . When U.S. currency was changed to its current size , the $2 bill was issued only as a United States Note . Production went on until 1966 , when the series was discontinued . Ten years passed before the $2 bill was reissued as a Federal Reserve Note with a new reverse design . Two - dollar bills are seldom seen in circulation as a result of banking policies with businesses which has resulted in low production numbers due to lack of demand . This comparative scarcity in circulation , coupled with a lack of public knowledge that the bill is still in production and circulation , has also inspired urban legends about its authenticity and value and has occasionally created problems for those trying to use the bill to make purchases . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Denomination overview </Li> <Li> 2 Rarity </Li> <Li> 3 History <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Large - sized notes </Li> <Li> 3.2 Small size notes <Ul> <Li> 3.2. 1 1928 -- 1966 </Li> <Li> 3.2. 2 1976 -- present </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3.3 Series dates <Ul> <Li> 3.3. 1 Large size </Li> <Li> 3.3. 2 Small size </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Visual snapshot </Li> <Li> 5 Usage <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Incidents </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Uncut currency sheets </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Denomination overview ( edit ) </H2> <P> The denomination of two dollars was authorized under a congressional act , and first used in March 1862 . The denomination was continuously used until the 1960s ; by this time the United States Note was the only remaining class of U.S. currency the two - dollar bill was assigned to . In 1966 it was decided to discontinue production of all United States Notes , which included the two - dollar bill . The two - dollar denomination was not immediately reassigned to the Federal Reserve Note class of United States currency and was thus fully discontinued ; the Treasury Department cited the two - dollar bill 's low use and unpopularity as the reason for not immediately resuming use of the denomination . In 1976 , production of the two - dollar denomination was resumed and the two - dollar bill was finally assigned as a Federal Reserve Note , with a new reverse design featuring John Trumbull 's depiction of the drafting of the United States Declaration of Independence replacing the previous design of Monticello . It has remained a current denomination since then . It was estimated that if the two - dollar bill replaced approximately half of the one - dollar bills in circulation , the federal government would be able to save about $26 million in 1976 dollars ( $112 million adjusted for inflation ) over the period from 1976 to 1981 , due to reduced production , storage , and shipping costs . </P> <P> However , due to their limited use , two - dollar bills are not printed as frequently in a new series as other denominations , which are produced according to demand . Some bill acceptors found in vending machines , self checkout lanes , and other automated kiosks are configured to accommodate two - dollar bills , even if the fact is not stated on the label . Although they are generally available at most banks , two - dollar bills are usually not handed out except upon specific request by the customer , and may cause a delay with a trip to the vault . </P> <H2> Rarity ( edit ) </H2> <P> Printing $2 bills is twice as cost - effective for the government as printing $1 bills , since they both cost the same amount ( about $0.05 ) to make , but the public has not circulated them as widely . During the Great Depression , few Americans had enough money to require $2 bills . In the middle of the 20th century , $2 bills were commonly used at strip clubs , for betting on horse racing , and for bribery when politicians wanted votes ( though this may be an urban legend ) and so acquired a negative reputation . The unusual reverse design of the 1976 note contributed to hoarding , and combined with the earlier discontinuation to give the impression these notes might be valuable as collector 's items , above their face value . The public at large continues to be unfamiliar with the notes because they are not being circulated widely . </P> <P> Today , there is a common misconception by the general public that the $2 bill is no longer being produced , though bills have been printed in 1996 , 1997 , 2004 , 2006 , 2012 , and 2013 . The U.S. treasury reports that $1,549,052,714 worth of $2 bills were in circulation worldwide as of April 30 , 2007 . </P> <P> Things such as unusual serial numbers ( example : A11111111A ) , and replacement notes designated by a star in the serial number can raise the collector value . `` Collectible '' two - dollar bills have been made and sold by coin dealers and others in recent years merely by adding colors and special graphics to regular issue bills by using computer printers . However , these bills are not authorized by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing ( BEP ) and are not worth anything more than face value on the collectors ' market . </P> <P> Certain conventions and tourism / convention bureaus capitalize on the scarcity of $2 bills in circulation , encouraging convention attendees and tourists to spend $2 bills in order to illustrate to the host communities the economic impact that the conventions and tourism bring . Sometimes known as `` SpendTom '' campaigns , the $2 bills linger in the community as a constant reminder . Some campaigns encourage people to participate in a hunt for the bills in order to win prizes . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Large - sized notes ( edit ) </H3> First $2 bill issued in 1862 as a Legal Tender Note . Series 1886 $2 Silver Certificate depicting Winfield Scott Hancock Series 1890 featuring James McPherson . This `` Coin Note '' was used for government purchases of silver bullion from the mining industry . <P> ( approximately 7.4218 \u00d7 3.125 in \u2245 189 \u00d7 79 mm ) </P> <P> In March 1862 , the first $2 bill was issued as a Legal Tender Note ( United States Note ) with a portrait of Alexander Hamilton ; the portrait of Hamilton used was a profile view and is not the same portrait used currently for the $10 bill . The continental congress based on defending the United States , released on June 25 , 1776 , began to authorize $2 credit , the circulation of 49,000 copies . Pass two - dollar bill was first used in March 1862 . Between 1966 and 1976 , two - dollar notes were not printed . </P> <P> By 1869 , the $2 United States Note was redesigned with the now familiar portrait of Thomas Jefferson to the left and a vignette of the United States Capitol in the center of the obverse . This note also featured green tinting on the top and left side of the obverse . Although this note is technically a United States Note , TREASURY NOTE appeared on it instead of UNITED STATES NOTE . The reverse was completely redesigned . This series was again revised in 1874 ; changes on the obverse included removing the green tinting , adding a red floral design around WASHINGTON D.C. , and changing the term TREASURY NOTE to UNITED STATES NOTE . The 1874 design was also issued as Series of 1875 and 1878 , and by 1880 , the red floral design around WASHINGTON D.C. on the United States Note was removed and the serial numbers were changed to blue . This note with the red floral design was also issued as Series of 1917 but with red serial numbers by that time . </P> <P> National Bank Notes were issued in 1875 and feature a woman unfurling a flag and a big 2 ( Lazy Duce ) on the obverse . The reverse has the king of England smoking tobacco and an eagle with a shield . </P> The second two - dollar denomination in the silver certificate series printed in 1891 . This note features United States Secretary of the Treasury William Windom . <P> In 1886 , the first $2 silver certificate with a portrait of United States Civil War General Winfield Scott Hancock on the left of the obverse was issued . This design continued until 1891 , when a new $2 Silver Certificate was issued with a portrait of U.S. Treasury Secretary William Windom in the center of the obverse . </P> <P> Two - dollar Treasury , or `` Coin '' , Notes were first issued for government purchases of silver bullion in 1890 from the silver mining industry . The reverse featured large wording of TWO in the center and a numeral 2 to the right surrounded by an ornate design that occupied almost the entire note . In 1891 , the reverse of the Series of 1890 Treasury Note was redesigned because the treasury felt that it was too `` busy '' , making it too easy to counterfeit . More open space was incorporated into the new design . </P> <P> In 1896 , the `` Educational Series '' Silver Certificate was issued . The entire obverse of the note was covered in artwork with an allegorical figure of science presenting steam and electricity to commerce and manufacture . The reverse of the note featured portraits of Robert Fulton and Samuel F.B. Morse surrounded by an ornate design that occupied almost the entire note . By 1899 , however , The $2 Silver Certificate was redesigned with a small portrait of George Washington surrounded by allegorical figures representing agriculture and mechanics . </P> Robert Fulton and Samuel Morse depicted on the reverse of the 1896 $2 ' Educational Series '' Silver Certificate . The final design of the United States ' silver certificate series featuring George Washington , printed in 1899 . <P> Large - sized Federal Reserve Bank Notes were issued in 1918 . Each note was an obligation of the issuing Federal Reserve Bank and could only be redeemed at the corresponding bank . The obverse of the note featured a borderless portrait of Thomas Jefferson to left and wording in the entire center . The reverse featured a World War I battleship . </P> <P> Beginning in the 1950s , production of $2 bills began to decrease . The relative scarcity of the bills led some to start saving any they found , with the inevitable result that the notes became rarer in circulation . Currently , the circulation of $2 bills accounts for around 1 % of the U.S. currency in circulation . </P> <H3> Small size notes ( edit ) </H3> <P> ( 6.14 \u00d7 2.61 in \u2245 156 \u00d7 66 mm ) </P> 1928 -- 1966 ( edit ) <P> In 1928 , when all U.S. currency was changed to its curren\n\nQuestion:\nwhen was the two dollar bill first printed\n", "answer": "1862"}

The commission was assisted by a committee consisting of seven diocesan bishops , experts in theology and catechesis . </P> <P> The text was approved by John Paul II on 25 June 1992 , and promulgated by him on 11 October 1992 , the 30th anniversary of the opening of the Second Vatican Council , with his apostolic constitution , Fidei depositum . Cardinal Georges Cottier , Theologian emeritus of the Pontifical Household and now Cardinal - Deacon of Santi Domenico e Sisto the University Church of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas , Angelicum was influential in drafting the encyclical . </P> <P> It was published in the French language in 1992 . Later it was then translated into many other languages . In the United States , the English translation was published in 1994 and had been pre-ordered more than 250,000 copies before its release , with a note that it was `` subject to revision according to the Latin typical edition ( editio typica ) when it is published . '' </P> <P> On August 15 , 1997 -- the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary -- John Paul II promulgated the Latin typical edition , with his apostolic letter , Laetamur Magnopere . The Latin text , which became the official text of reference ( editio typica ) , amended the contents of the provisional French text at a few points . One of the changes consisted in the inclusion of the position on death penalty that is defended in John Paul II 's encyclical Evangelium Vitae of 1995 . </P> <P> As a result , the earlier translations from the French into other languages ( including English ) had to be amended and re-published as `` second editions '' . </P> <H2> Doctrinal value ( edit ) </H2> <P> In the apostolic constitution Fidei depositum , John Paul II declared that the Catechism of the Catholic Church is `` a valid and legitimate instrument for ecclesial communion and a sure norm for teaching the faith '' , and stressed that it `` is not intended to replace the local catechisms duly approved by the ecclesiastical authorities , the diocesan Bishops and the Episcopal Conferences '' . </P> <H2> Contents ( edit ) </H2> <P> A catechism has been defined as `` a book that explains the beliefs of the Christian religion by using a list of questions and answers '' . Documents of religious instruction have been written since the beginning of Christianity and a catechism is typically an assemblage of these smaller documents into one large compilation of Church doctrine and teachings . </P> <P> The Catechism itself is not in question - and - answer format . Rather , it is instead a source on which to base such catechisms ( e.g. Youcat and the United States Catholic Catechism for Adults ) and other expositions of Catholic doctrine , called a `` major catechism . '' As stated in the apostolic constitution Fidei depositum , with which its publication was ordered , it was given so `` that it may be a sure and authentic reference text for teaching Catholic doctrine and particularly for preparing local catechisms . '' </P> <P> The Catechism is arranged in four principal parts : </P> <Ul> <Li> The Profession of Faith ( the Apostle 's Creed ) </Li> <Li> The Celebration of the Christian Mystery ( the Sacred Liturgy , and especially the sacraments ) </Li> <Li> Life in Christ ( including the Ten Commandments ) </Li> <Li> Christian Prayer ( including the Lord 's Prayer ) </Li> </Ul> <P> This scheme is often referred to as the `` Four Pillars '' of the Faith . The contents are abundantly footnoted with references to sources of the teaching , in particular the Scriptures , the Church Fathers , and the Ecumenical Councils and other authoritative Catholic statements , principally those issued by recent popes . </P> <P> The section on Scripture in the Catechism recovers the Patristic tradition of `` spiritual exegesis '' as further developed through the scholastic doctrine of the `` four senses . '' This return to spiritual exegesis is based on the Second Vatican Council 's 1965 dogmatic constitution Dei verbum , which taught that Scripture should be `` read and interpreted in light of the same Spirit by whom it was written '' . The Catechism amplifies Dei verbum by specifying that the necessary spiritual interpretation should be sought through the four senses of Scripture , which encompass the literal sense and the three spiritual senses ( allegorical , moral , and anagogical ) . </P> <P> The literal sense pertains to the meaning of the words themselves , including any figurative meanings . The spiritual senses pertain to the significance of the things ( persons , places , objects or events ) denoted by the words . Of the three spiritual senses , the allegorical sense is foundational . It relates persons , events , and institutions of earlier covenants to those of later covenants , and especially to the New Covenant . Building on the allegorical sense , the moral sense instructs in regard to action , and the anagogical sense points to man 's final destiny . The teaching of the Catechism on Scripture has encouraged the pursuit of covenantal theology , an approach that employs the four senses to structure salvation history via the biblical covenants . </P> <H2> Comments ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 1992 , Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger ( later Pope Benedict XVI ) noted : </P> <P> It clearly show ( s ) that the problem of what we must do as human beings , of how we should live our lives so that we and the world may become just , is the essential problem of our day , and basically of all ages . After the fall of ideologies , the problem of man -- the moral problem -- is presented to today 's context in a totally new way : What should we do ? How does life become just ? What can give us and the whole world a future which is worth living ? Since the catechism treats these questions , it is a book which interests many people , far beyond purely theological or ecclesial circles . </P> <P> Ulf Ekman , former Charismatic pastor and the founder of Livets Ord , says that the Catechism is `` the best book he has ever read '' . </P> <H2> Derived works ( edit ) </H2> <P> It was expected that the universal Catechism would serve as a source and template for inculturated national catechisms . In the United States , for example , the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops published the United States Catholic Catechism for Adults , officially replacing their previous version , the Baltimore Catechism , though it had already been out of use for nearly forty years . </P> <P> The Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church was published in 2005 , and the first edition in English in 2006 . It is a more concise and dialogic version of the Catechism . The text of the Compendium is available in fourteen languages on the Vatican website , which also gives the text of the Catechism itself in nine languages . </P> <P> Youcat , a catechism for youth , based on the Catechism and its Compendium , was published in 2011 . The Vatican has acknowledged that some translations of Youcat contain errors regarding Church teaching on the status of other religions , contraception and euthanasia , whether due to simple error or poor translations . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Catholicism portal </Li> <Li> Christianity portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Catholic Catechist </Li> <Li> Catholic Directory </Li> <Li> Catholic spirituality </Li> <Li> Glossary of the Catholic Church </Li> <Li> History of the Catholic Church since 1962 </Li> <Li> Index of Catholic Church articles </Li> <Li> Outline of Catholicism </Li> <Li> Pastoral care </Li> <Li> Catholic theology </Li> <Li> Second Vatican Council </Li> <Li> The Common Catechism </Li> <Li> Timeline of the Catholic Church </Li> <Li> Universal call to holiness </Li> <Li> Vocational Discernment in the Catholic Church </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ In an interview in 30Days , 3 - 2004 Cottier remarked : `` Going back to the early years , the first ' big ' text I worked on was the social encyclical Centesimus annus .

The answer should be a number\n\nDocument:\nainful histories and are resolved to move forward together on the path of human rights , justice and development for all . '' Louise Arbour , a former justice of the Supreme Court of Canada then serving as the UN 's High Commissioner for Human Rights , expressed satisfaction at the hard work and perseverance that had finally `` borne fruit in the most comprehensive statement to date of indigenous peoples ' rights . '' Similarly , news of the Declaration 's adoption was greeted with jubilation in Africa and , present at the General Assembly session in New York , Bolivian foreign minister David Choquehuanca said that he hoped the member states that had voted against or abstained would reconsider their refusal to support a document he described as being as important as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . Bolivia has become the first country to approve the U.N. declaration of indigenous rights . Evo Morales , President of Bolivia , stated , `` We are the first country to turn this declaration into a law and that is important , brothers and sisters . We recognize and salute the work of our representatives . But if we were to remember the indigenous fight clearly , many of us who are sensitive would end up crying in remembering the discrimination , the scorn . '' </P> <P> Stephen Corry , Director of the international indigenous rights organization Survival International , said , `` The declaration has been debated for nearly a quarter century . Years which have seen many tribal peoples , such as the Akuntsu and Kano\u00ea in Brazil , decimated and others , such as the Innu in Canada , brought to the edge . Governments that oppose it are shamefully fighting against the human rights of their most vulnerable peoples . Claims they make to support human rights in other areas will be seen as hypocritical . '' </P> Australia ( edit ) <P> The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies formally acknowledges and upholds the principles of the Declaration in both their Collection Access and Use Policy and their Guidelines for Ethical Research in Australian Indigenous Studies . </P> <H3> Criticism , defiance and `` aspirational '' nullification ( edit ) </H3> <P> Prior to the adoption of the Declaration , and throughout the 62nd session of the General Assembly , a number of countries expressed concern about some key issues , such as self - determination , access to lands , territories and resources and the lack of a clear definition of the term `` indigenous '' . In addition to those intending to vote against the adoption of the declaration , a group of African countries represented by Namibia proposed to defer action , to hold further consultations , and to conclude consideration of the declaration by September 2007 . Ultimately , after agreeing on some adjustments to the Draft Declaration , a vast majority of states recognized that these issues could be addressed by each country at the national level . </P> <P> The four states that voted against continued to express serious reservations about the final text of the Declaration as placed before the General Assembly . As mentioned above , all four opposing countries have since then changed their vote in favour of the Declaration . </P> Australia ( edit ) <P> Australia 's government opposed the Declaration in the General Assembly vote of 2007 , but has since endorsed the Declaration . Australia 's Mal Brough , Minister for Families , Community Services and Indigenous Affairs , referring to the provision regarding the upholding of indigenous peoples ' customary legal systems , said that `` There should only be one law for all Australians and we should not enshrine in law practices that are not acceptable in the modern world . '' </P> <P> Marise Payne , Liberal Party Senator for New South Wales , further elaborated on the Australian government 's objections to the Declaration in a speech to the Australian Senate : </P> <Ul> <Li> Concerns about references to self - determination and their potential to be misconstrued . </Li> <Li> Ignorance of contemporary realities concerning land and resources . `` They seem , to many readers , to require the recognition of Indigenous rights to lands which are now lawfully owned by other citizens , both Indigenous and non-Indigenous , and therefore to have some quite significant potential to impact on the rights of third parties . '' </Li> <Li> Concerns over the extension of Indigenous intellectual property rights under the declaration as unnecessary under current international and Australian law . </Li> <Li> The potential abuse of the right under the Declaration for indigenous peoples to unqualified consent on matters affecting them , `` which implies to some readers that they may then be able to exercise a right of veto over all matters of state , which would include national laws and other administrative measures . '' </Li> <Li> The exclusivity of indigenous rights over intellectual , real and cultural property , that `` does not acknowledge the rights of third parties -- in particular , their rights to access Indigenous land and heritage and cultural objects where appropriate under national law . '' Furthermore , that the Declaration `` fails to consider the different types of ownership and use that can be accorded to Indigenous people and the rights of third parties to property in that regard . '' </Li> <Li> Concerns that the Declaration places indigenous customary law in a superior position to national law , and that this may `` permit the exercise of practices which would not be acceptable across the board '' , such as customary corporal and capital punishments . </Li> </Ul> <P> In October 2007 former Australian Prime Minister John Howard pledged to hold a referendum on changing the constitution to recognise indigenous Australians if re-elected . He said that the distinctiveness of people 's identity and their rights to preserve their heritage should be acknowledged . </P> <P> On 3 April 2009 , the Rudd Government formally endorsed the Declaration . </P> Canada ( edit ) <P> The Canadian government said that while it supported the `` spirit '' of the declaration , it contained elements that were `` fundamentally incompatible with Canada 's constitutional framework '' , which includes both the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and Section 35 , which enshrines aboriginal and treaty rights . In particular , the Canadian government had problems with Article 19 ( which appears to require governments to secure the consent of indigenous peoples regarding matters of general public policy ) , and Articles 26 and 28 ( which could allow for the re-opening or repudiation of historically settled land claims ) . </P> <P> Former Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development Chuck Strahl described the document as `` unworkable in a Western democracy under a constitutional government . '' Strahl elaborated , saying `` In Canada , you are balancing individual rights vs. collective rights , and ( this ) document ... has none of that . By signing on , you default to this document by saying that the only rights in play here are the rights of the First Nations . And , of course , in Canada , that 's inconsistent with our constitution . '' He gave an example : `` In Canada ... you negotiate on this ... because ( native rights ) do n't trump all other rights in the country . You need also to consider the people who have sometimes also lived on those lands for two or three hundred years , and have hunted and fished alongside the First Nations . '' </P> <P> The Assembly of First Nations passed a resolution in December 2007 to invite Presidents Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Evo Morales to Canada to put pressure on the government to sign the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples , calling the two heads of state `` visionary leaders '' and demanding Canada resign its membership on the United Nations Human Rights Council . </P> <P> On 3 March 2010 , in the Speech From the Throne , the Governor General of Canada announced that the government was moving to endorse the declaration . `` We are a country with an Aboriginal heritage . A growing number of states have given qualified recognition to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples . Our Government will take steps to endorse this aspirational document in a manner fully consistent with Canada 's Constitution and laws . '' </P> <P> On 12 November 2010 , Canada officially endorsed the declaration but without changing its position that it was ' aspirational ' . </P> <P> Anishinabek spiritual leader , Chief William Commanda ( 1908 - 3 August 2011 ) was honoured at the 21st annual week - long First Peoples ' Festival held in Montreal from 2 -- 9 August 2011 , celebrating Canada 's 2010 adoption of the U.N. declaration . AFN Innu representative , Ghislain Picard 's tribute praised Grandfather Commanda for his work that was `` key not only in the adoption of the U.N. declaration , but in all the work leading up to it throughout the last 25 years . '' </P> <P> In 2015 , Romeo Saganash ( a Cree Member of Parliament for Abitibi -- Baie - James -- Nunavik -- Eeyou ) sponsored Private Member 's Bill C - 641 , the `` United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act '' , which would have required the Canadian government to ensure that the laws of Canada are in harmony with UNDRIP but it was defeated on May 6 , 2015 . </P> <P> In 2016 , Canada officially adopted and promised to implement the declaration fully . Speaking at the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues , Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada minister Carolyn Bennett announced , `` We are now a full supporter of the declaration , without qualification . We intend nothing less than to adopt and implement the declaration in accordance with the Canadian Constitution . '' Bennett described the Declaration as `` breathing life into Section 35 ( of the Canadian Constitution ) and recognizing it as a full box of rights for Indigenous Peoples in Canada . '' In July 2016 , Kwakwaka'wakw Justice Minister Jody Wilson - Raybould gave a speech that stated that `` adopting the UNDRIP as being Canadian law are unworkable '' , due to its incompatibility with the Indian Act , the current governing statute . </P> <P> The federal government pledged on 21 June 2017 to rename its National Aboriginal Day to be consistent with the terminology used by the Declaration . </P> <P> In September 2017 , British Columbia provincial government announced that it will govern in accordance with the principles outlined in the Declaration . </P> New Zealand ( edit ) New Zealand delegation at the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues . New Zealand endorsed the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in April 2010 . <P> In 2007 New Zealand 's Minister of M\u0101ori Affairs Parekura Horomia described the Declaration as `` toothless '' , and said , `` There are four provisions we have problems with , which make the declaration fundamentally incompatible with New Zealand 's constitutional and legal arrangements . '' Article 26 in particular , he said , `` appears to require recognition of rights to lands now lawfully owned by other citizens , both indigenous and non-indigenous . This ignores contemporary reality and would be impossible to implement . '' </P> <P> In response , M\u0101ori Party leader Pita Sharples said it was `` shameful to the extreme that New Zealand voted against the outlawing of discrimination against indigenous people ; voted against justice , dignity and fundamental freedoms for all '' . </P> <P> On 7 July 2009 , the New Zealand government announced that it would support the Declaration ; this , however , appeared to be a premature announcement by Pita Sharples , the current Minister of M\u0101ori Affairs , as the New Zealand government cautiously backtracked on Sharples ' July announcement . However , on 19 April 2010 , Sharples announced New Zealand 's support of the declaration at a speech in New York . </P> United states ( edit ) <P> Speaking for the United States mission to the UN , spokesman Benjamin Chang said , `` What was done today is not clear . The way it stands now is subject to multiple interpretations and does n't establish a clear universal principle . '' The U.S. mission also issued a floor document , `` Observations of the United States with respect to the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples '' , setting out its objections to the Declaration . Most of these are based on the same points as the three other countries ' rejections but , in addition , the United States drew attention to the Declaration 's failure to provide a clear definition of exactly whom the term `` indigenous peoples '' is intended to cover . </P> <P> On 16 December 2010 , President Obama declared that the United States would `` lend its support '' to the Declaration . The decision was announced during the second White House Tribal Nations Conference , where he said he is `` working hard to live up to '' the name that was given to him by the Crow Nation : `` One Who Helps People Throughout the Land . '' Obama has told Native American leaders that he wants to improve the `` nation - to - nation '' relationship between the United States and the tribes and repair broken promises . Today , there are more than 560 Indian tribes in the United States that are recognized at the federal level , with some sixty - plus tribes recognized at the state level . Many had representatives at the White House conference and applauded Obama 's announcement . </P> <P> The Obama administration 's decision came after three consultation meetings with Native Americans and more than 3,000 written comments on the subject . The support of the government also included several interpretations of the meaning of the Declaration . In the view of the United States government , the Declaration advances `` a new and distinct international concept of self - determination specific to indigenous peoples , '' which is not the same as the existing concept in intern\n\nQuestion:\nwhen did canada sign the un declaration on the rights of indigenous peoples\n", "answer": "2016"}

Some of the conditions included in newborn screening programs are only detectable after irreversible damage has been done ; in some cases sudden death is the first manifestation of a disease . Screening programs are often run by state or national governing bodies with the goal of screening all infants born in the jurisdiction . The number of diseases screened for is set by each jurisdiction , and can vary greatly . Most newborn screening tests are done by measuring metabolites and enzyme activity in whole blood samples collected on specialized filter paper . Many areas are starting to screen infants for hearing loss using automated auditory brainstem response and congenital heart defects using pulse oximetry . Infants who screen positive undergo further testing to determine if they are truly affected with a disease or if the test result was a false positive . Follow - up testing is typically coordinated between geneticists and the infant 's pediatrician or primary care physician . </P> <P> Newborn screening debuted as a public health program in the United States in the early 1960s , and has expanded to countries around the world , with different testing menus in each country . Both prenatal screening ( screening before birth ) and newborn screening ( screening soon after birth ) have improved health care . The first disorder detected by modern newborn screening programs was phenylketonuria , a metabolic condition in which the inability to degrade the essential amino acid phenylalanine can cause irreversible mental retardation unless detected early . With early detection and dietary management , the negative effects of the disease can be largely eliminated . Robert Guthrie developed a simple method using a bacterial inhibition assay that could detect high levels of phenylalanine in blood shortly after a baby was born . Guthrie also pioneered the collection of blood on filter paper which could be easily transported , recognizing the need for a simple system if the screening was going to be done on a large scale . Newborn screening around the world is still done using similar filter paper . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Targeted disorders <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Amino acid disorders </Li> <Li> 1.2 Fatty acid oxidation disorders </Li> <Li> 1.3 Endocrinopathies </Li> <Li> 1.4 Hemoglobinopathies </Li> <Li> 1.5 Organic acidemias </Li> <Li> 1.6 Cystic fibrosis </Li> <Li> 1.7 Urea cycle disorders </Li> <Li> 1.8 Lysosomal storage disorders </Li> <Li> 1.9 Hearing loss </Li> <Li> 1.10 Congenital heart defects </Li> <Li> 1.11 Severe combined immunodeficiency </Li> <Li> 1.12 Other conditions </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Disease qualification </Li> <Li> 3 Techniques <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Sample collection </Li> <Li> 3.2 Laboratory testing </Li> <Li> 3.3 Reporting results </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Laboratory performance </Li> <Li> 5 History </Li> <Li> 6 Society and culture <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Controversies </Li> <Li> 6.2 Bioethics </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Targeted disorders ( edit ) </H2> See also : List of disorders included in newborn screening programs <P> Newborn screening is intended as a public health program to identify infants with treatable conditions before they present clinically , or suffer irreversible damage . Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) was the first disorder targeted for newborn screening , being implemented in a small number of hospitals and quickly expanding across the United States and the rest of the world . After the success of newborn screening for PKU ( 39 infants were identified and treated in the first two years of screening , with no false negative results ) , Guthrie and others looked for other disorders that could be identified and treated in infants , eventually developing bacterial inhibition assays to identify classic galactosemia and maple syrup urine disease . </P> <P> Newborn screening has expanded since the introduction of PKU testing in the 1960s , but can vary greatly between countries . In 2011 , the United States screened for 54 conditions , Germany for 12 , the United Kingdom for 2 ( PKU and medium chain acyl - CoA dehydrogenase deficiency ( MCADD ) ) , while France and Hong Kong only screened for one condition ( PKU and congenital hypothyroidism , respectively ) . The conditions included in newborn screening programs around the world vary greatly , based on the legal requirements for screening programs , prevalence of certain diseases within a population , political pressure , and the availability of resources for both testing and follow - up of identified patients . </P> <H3> Amino acid disorders ( edit ) </H3> <P> Newborn screening originated with an amino acid disorder , phenylketonuria ( PKU ) , which can be easily treated by dietary modifications , but causes severe mental retardation if not identified and treated early . Robert Guthrie introduced the newborn screening test for PKU in the early 1960s . With the knowledge that PKU could be detected before symptoms were evident , and treatment initiated , screening was quickly adopted around the world . Austria started screening for PKU in 1966 and England in 1968 . </P> <H3> Fatty acid oxidation disorders ( edit ) </H3> <P> With the advent of tandem mass spectrometry as a screening tool , several fatty acid oxidation disorders were targeted for inclusion in newborn screening programs . Medium chain acyl - CoA dehydrogenase deficiency ( MCADD ) , which had been implicated in several cases of sudden infant death syndrome was one of the first conditions targeted for inclusion . MCADD was the first condition added when the United Kingdom expanded their screening program from PKU only . Population based studies in Germany , the United States and Australia put the combined incidence of fatty acid oxidation disorders at 1 : 9300 among Caucasians . The United States screens for all known fatty acid oxidation disorders , either as primary or secondary targets , while other countries screen for a subset of these . </P> <P> The introduction of screening for fatty acid oxidation disorders has been shown to have reduced morbidity and mortality associated with the conditions , particularly MCADD . An Australian study found a 74 % reduction in episodes of severe metabolic decompensation or death among individuals identified by newborn screening as having MCADD versus those who presented clinically prior to screening . Studies in the Netherlands and United Kingdom found improvements in outcome at a reduced cost when infants were identified before presenting clinically . </P> <P> Newborn screening programs have also expanded the information base available about some rare conditions . Prior to its inclusion in newborn screening , short - chain acyl - CoA dehydrogenase deficiency ( SCADD ) was thought to be life - threatening . Most patients identified via newborn screening as having this enzyme deficiency were asymptomatic , to the extent that SCADD was removed from screening panels in a number of regions . Without the cohort of patients identified by newborn screening , this clinical phenotype would likely not have been identified . </P> <H3> Endocrinopathies ( edit ) </H3> <P> The most commonly included disorders of the endocrine system are congenital hypothyroidism ( CH ) and congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( CAH ) . Testing for both disorders can be done using blood samples collected on the standard newborn screening card . Screening for CH is done by measuring thyroxin ( T4 ) , thyrotropin ( TSH ) or a combination of both analytes . Elevated 17\u03b1 - hydroxyprogesterone ( 17\u03b1 - OHP ) is the primary marker used when screening for CAH , most commonly done using enzyme - linked immunosorbant assays , with many programs using a second tier tandem mass spectrometry test to reduce the number of false positive results . Careful analysis of screening results for CAH may also identify cases of congenital adrenal hypoplasia , which presents with extremely low levels of 17\u03b1 - OHP . </P> <P> CH was added to many newborn screening programs in the 1970s , often as the second condition included after PKU . The most common cause of CH is dysgenesis of the thyroid gland After many years of newborn screening , the incidence of CH worldwide had been estimated at 1 : 3600 births , with no obvious increases in specific ethnic groups . Recent data from certain regions have showed an increase , with New York reporting an incidence of 1 : 1700 . Reasons for the apparent increase in incidence have been studied , but no explanation has been found . </P> <P> Classic CAH , the disorder targeted by newborn screening programs , is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme steroid 21 - hydroxylase , and comes in two forms - simple virilizing and a salt - wasting form . Incidence of CAH can vary greatly between populations . The highest reported incidence rates are among the Yupic Eskimos of Alaska ( 1 : 280 ) and on the French island of R\u00e9union ( 1 : 2100 ) . </P> <H3> Hemoglobinopathies ( edit ) </H3> Sickle cells in human blood : both normal red blood cells and sickle - shaped cells are present <P> Any condition that results in the production of abnormal hemoglobin is included under the broad category of hemoglobinopathies . Worldwide , it is estimated that 7 % of the population may carry a hemoglobinopathy with clinical significance . The most well known condition in this group is sickle cell disease . Newborn screening for a large number of hemoglobinopathies is done by detecting abnormal patterns using isoelectric focusing , which can detect many different types of abnormal hemoglobins . In the United States , newborn screening for sickle cell disease was recommended for all infants in 1987 , however it was not implemented in all 50 states until 2006 . </P> <P> Early identification of individuals with sickle cell disease and other hemoglobinopathies allows treatment to be initiated in a timely fashion . Penicillin has been used in children with sickle cell disease , and blood transfusions are used for patients identified with severe thalassemia . </P> <H3> Organic acidemias ( edit ) </H3> <P> Most jurisdictions did not start screening for any of the organic acidemias before tandem mass spectrometry significantly expanded the list of disorders detectable by newborn screening . Quebec has run a voluntary second - tier screening program since 1971 using urine samples collected at three weeks of age to screen for an expanded list of organic acidemias using a thin layer chromatography method . Newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry can detect several organic acidemias , including propionic acidemia , methylmalonic acidemia and isovaleric acidemia . </P> <H3> Cystic fibrosis ( edit ) </H3> <P> Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) was first added to newborn screening programs in New Zealand and regions of Australia in 1981 , by measuring immunoreactive trypsinogen ( IRT ) in dried blood spots . After the CFTR gene was identified , Australia introduced a two tier testing program to reduce the number of false positives . Samples with an elevated IRT value were then analyzed with molecular methods to identify the presence of disease causing mutations before being reported back to parents and health care providers . CF is included in the core panel of conditions recommended for inclusion in all 50 states , Texas was the last state to implement their screening program for CF in 2010 . Alberta was the first Canadian province to implement CF screening in 2007 . Quebec , New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island do not include CF in their screening programs . The United Kingdom as well as many European Union countries screen for CF as well . Switzerland is one of the latest countries to add CF to their newborn screening menu , doing so in January 2011 . </P> <H3> Urea cycle disorders ( edit ) </H3> <P> Disorders of the distal urea cycle , such as citrullinemia , argininosuccinic aciduria and argininemia are included in newborn screening programs in many jurisdictions that using tandem mass spectrometry to identify key amino acids . Proximal urea cycle defects , such as ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiency are not included in newborn screening panels because they are not reliably detected using current technology , and also because severely affected infants will present with clinical symptoms before newborn screening results are available . Some regions claim to screen for HHH syndrome ( hyperammonemia , hyperornithinemia , homocitrullinuria ) based on the detection of elevated ornithine levels in the newborn screening dried blood spot , but other sources have shown that affected individuals do not have elevated ornithine at birth . </P> <H3> Lysosomal storage disorders ( edit ) </H3> <P> Lysosomal storage disorders are not included in newborn screening programs with high frequency . As a group , they are heterogenous , with screening only being feasible for a small fraction of the approximately 40 identified disorders . The arguments for th\n", "answer": "1981"}

It sums up , in book form , the beliefs of the Catholic faithful . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Publication history </Li> <Li> 2 Doctrinal value </Li> <Li> 3 Contents </Li> <Li> 4 Comments </Li> <Li> 5 Derived works </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 Notes </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 Further reading </Li> <Li> 10 External links <Ul> <Li> 10.1 Text of the Catechism </Li> <Li> 10.2 Comments on the Catechism </Li> <Li> 10.3 Text of the Compendium </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Publication history ( edit ) </H2> <P> The decision to publish a catechism was taken at the Second Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops that was convened by Pope John Paul II on 25 January 1985 for the 20th anniversary of the close of the Second Vatican Council , and in 1986 , put a commission composed of 12 bishops and cardinals in charge of the project . The commission was assisted by a committee consisting of seven diocesan bishops , experts in theology and catechesis . </P> <P> The text was approved by John Paul II on 25 June 1992 , and promulgated by him on 11 October 1992 , the 30th anniversary of the opening of the Second Vatican Council , with his apostolic constitution , Fidei depositum . Cardinal Georges Cottier , Theologian emeritus of the Pontifical Household and now Cardinal - Deacon of Santi Domenico e Sisto the University Church of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas , Angelicum was influential in drafting the encyclical . </P> <P> It was published in the French language in 1992 . Later it was then translated into many other languages . In the United States , the English translation was published in 1994 and had been pre-ordered more than 250,000 copies before its release , with a note that it was `` subject to revision according to the Latin typical edition ( editio typica ) when it is published . '' </P> <P> On August 15 , 1997 -- the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary -- John Paul II promulgated the Latin typical edition , with his apostolic letter , Laetamur Magnopere . The Latin text , which became the official text of reference ( editio typica ) , amended the contents of the provisional French text at a few points . One of the changes consisted in the inclusion of the position on death penalty that is defended in John Paul II 's encyclical Evangelium Vitae of 1995 . </P> <P> As a result , the earlier translations from the French into other languages ( including English ) had to be amended and re-published as `` second editions '' . </P> <H2> Doctrinal value ( edit ) </H2> <P> In the apostolic constitution Fidei depositum , John Paul II declared that the Catechism of the Catholic Church is `` a valid and legitimate instrument for ecclesial communion and a sure norm for teaching the faith '' , and stressed that it `` is not intended to replace the local catechisms duly approved by the ecclesiastical authorities , the diocesan Bishops and the Episcopal Conferences '' . </P> <H2> Contents ( edit ) </H2> <P> A catechism has been defined as `` a book that explains the beliefs of the Christian religion by using a list of questions and answers '' . Documents of religious instruction have been written since the beginning of Christianity and a catechism is typically an assemblage of these smaller documents into one large compilation of Church doctrine and teachings . </P> <P> The Catechism itself is not in question - and - answer format . Rather , it is instead a source on which to base such catechisms ( e.g. Youcat and the United States Catholic Catechism for Adults ) and other expositions of Catholic doctrine , called a `` major catechism . '' As stated in the apostolic constitution Fidei depositum , with which its publication was ordered , it was given so `` that it may be a sure and authentic reference text for teaching Catholic doctrine and particularly for preparing local catechisms . '' </P> <P> The Catechism is arranged in four principal parts : </P> <Ul> <Li> The Profession of Faith ( the Apostle 's Creed ) </Li> <Li> The Celebration of the Christian Mystery ( the Sacred Liturgy , and especially the sacraments ) </Li> <Li> Life in Christ ( including the Ten Commandments ) </Li> <Li> Christian Prayer ( including the Lord 's Prayer ) </Li> </Ul> <P> This scheme is often referred to as the `` Four Pillars '' of the Faith . The contents are abundantly footnoted with references to sources of the teaching , in particular the Scriptures , the Church Fathers , and the Ecumenical Councils and other authoritative Catholic statements , principally those issued by recent popes . </P> <P> The section on Scripture in the Catechism recovers the Patristic tradition of `` spiritual exegesis '' as further developed through the scholastic doctrine of the `` four senses . '' This return to spiritual exegesis is based on the Second Vatican Council 's 1965 dogmatic constitution Dei verbum , which taught that Scripture should be `` read and interpreted in light of the same Spirit by whom it was written '' . The Catechism amplifies Dei verbum by specifying that the necessary spiritual interpretation should be sought through the four senses of Scripture , which encompass the literal sense and the three spiritual senses ( allegorical , moral , and anagogical ) . </P> <P> The literal sense pertains to the meaning of the words themselves , including any figurative meanings . The spiritual senses pertain to the significance of the things ( persons , places , objects or events ) denoted by the words . Of the three spiritual senses , the allegorical sense is foundational . It relates persons , events , and institutions of earlier covenants to those of later covenants , and especially to the New Covenant . Building on the allegorical sense , the moral sense instructs in regard to action , and the anagogical sense points to man 's final destiny . The teaching of the Catechism on Scripture has encouraged the pursuit of covenantal theology , an approach that employs the four senses to structure salvation history via the biblical covenants . </P> <H2> Comments ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 1992 , Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger ( later Pope Benedict XVI ) noted : </P> <P> It clearly show ( s ) that the problem of what we must do as human beings , of how we should live our lives so that we and the world may become just , is the essential problem of our day , and basically of all ages . After the fall of ideologies , the problem of man -- the moral problem -- is presented to today 's context in a totally new way : What should we do ? How does life become just ? What can give us and the whole world a future which is worth living ? Since the catechism treats these questions , it is a book which interests many people , far beyond purely theological or ecclesial circles . </P> <P> Ulf Ekman , former Charismatic pastor and the founder of Livets Ord , says that the Catechism is `` the best book he has ever read '' . </P> <H2> Derived works ( edit ) </H2> <P> It was expected that the universal Catechism would serve as a source and template for inculturated national catechisms . In the United States , for example , the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops published the United States Catholic Catechism for Adults , officially replacing their previous version , the Baltimore Catechism , though it had already been out of use for nearly forty years . </P> <P> The Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church was published in 2005 , and the first edition in English in 2006 . It is a more concise and dialogic version of the Catechism . The text of the Compendium is available in fourteen languages on the Vatican website , which also gives the text of the Catechism itself in nine languages . </P> <P> Youcat , a catechism for youth , based on the Catechism and its Compendium , was published in 2011 . The Vatican has acknowledged that some translations of Youcat contain errors regarding Church teaching on the status of other religions , contraception and euthanasia , whether due to simple error or poor translations . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Catholicism portal </Li> <Li> Christianity portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Catholic Catechist </Li> <Li> Catholic Directory </Li> <Li> Catholic spirituality </Li> <Li> Glossary of the Catholic Church </Li> <Li> History of the Catholic Church since 1962 </Li> <Li> Index of Catholic Church articles </Li> <Li> Outline of Catholicism </Li> <Li> Pastoral care </Li> <Li> Catholic theology </Li> <Li> Second Vatican Council </Li> <Li> The Common Catechism </Li> <Li> Timeline of the Catholic Church </Li> <Li> Universal call to holiness </Li> <Li> Vocational Discernment in the Catholic Church </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ In an interview in 30Days , 3 - 2004 Cottier remarked : `` Going back to the early years , the first ' big ' text I worked on was the social encyclical Centesimus annus .

All matches played are accorded Twenty20 International status . </P> <P> The event has generally been held every two years . However , the next edition of the tournament is scheduled to take place in 2020 in Australia , four years after the conclusion of the 2016 edition . In May 2016 , the ICC put forward the idea of having a tournament in 2018 , with South Africa being the possible host . But at the conclusion of the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy , the ICC announced that the next edition of the World T20 would take place in 2020 in Australia , as originally scheduled . </P> <P> Six tournaments have so far been played , and only the West Indies , who currently hold the title , has won the tournament on multiple occasions . The inaugural event , the 2007 World Twenty20 , was staged in South Africa , and won by India , who defeated Pakistan in the final at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg . The 2009 tournament took place in England , and was won by the previous runner - up , Pakistan , who defeated Sri Lanka in the final at Lord 's . The third tournament was held in 2010 , hosted by the countries making up the West Indies cricket team . England defeated Australia in the final in Barbados , which was played at Kensington Oval , winning its first and the only international tournament to date . The fourth tournament , the 2012 World Twenty20 , was held in Asia for the first time , with all matches played in Sri Lanka . The West Indies won the tournament by defeating Sri Lanka in the final , winning its first international tournament since the 2004 Champions Trophy . The fifth tournament , the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 , was hosted by Bangladesh , and was won by Sri Lanka defeating India , who became the first team to play in three finals .

Cricketing authorities were looking to boost the game 's popularity with the younger generation in response to dwindling crowds and reduced sponsorship . It was intended to deliver fast - paced , exciting cricket accessible to thousands of fans who were put off by the longer versions of the game . Stuart Robertson , the marketing manager of the ECB , proposed a 20 over per innings game to county chairmen in 2001 and they voted 11 -- 7 in favour of adopting the new format . </P> <Dl> <Dt> Regional tournaments </Dt> </Dl> Bangladesh V South Africa at the 2007 tournament <P> The first official Twenty20 matches were played on 13 June 2003 between the English counties in the Twenty20 Cup . The first season of Twenty20 in England was a relative success , with the Surrey Lions defeating the Warwickshire Bears by 9 wickets in the final to claim the title . The first Twenty20 match held at Lord 's , on 15 July 2004 between Middlesex and Surrey , attracted a crowd of 27,509 , the largest attendance for any county cricket game at the ground other than a one - day final since 1953 . </P> <P> Soon after with the adoption of Twenty20 matches by other cricket boards , the popularity of the format grew with unexpected crowd attendance , new regional tournaments such as Pakistan 's Faysal Bank T20 Cup and Stanford 20 / 20 tournament and the financial incentive in the format . </P> <P> The West Indies regional teams competed in what was named the Stanford 20 / 20 tournament . The event was financially backed by convicted fraudster Allen Stanford , who gave at least US $28,000,000 funding money , the fruit of his massive Ponzi scheme . It was intended that the tournament would be an annual event . Guyana won the inaugural event , defeating Trinidad and Tobago by 5 wickets , securing US $1,000,000 in prize money . A spin - off tournament , the Stanford Super Series , was held in October 2008 between Middlesex and Trinidad and Tobago , the respective winners of the English and Caribbean Twenty20 competitions , and a Stanford Superstars team formed from West Indies domestic players ; Trinidad and Tobago won the competition , securing US $280,000 prize money . On 1 November , the Stanford Superstars played England in what was expected to be the first of five fixtures in as many years with the winner claiming a US $20,000,000 in each match . </P> <Dl> <Dt> Twenty20 Internationals </Dt> </Dl> Main article : Twenty20 International <P> On 17 February 2005 Australia defeated New Zealand in the first men 's full international Twenty20 match , played at Eden Park in Auckland . The game was played in a light - hearted manner -- both sides turned out in kit similar to that worn in the 1980s , the New Zealand team 's a direct copy of that worn by the Beige Brigade . Some of the players also sported moustaches / beards and hair styles popular in the 1980s taking part in a competition amongst themselves for best retro look , at the request of the Beige Brigade . Australia won the game comprehensively , and as the result became obvious towards the end of the NZ innings , the players and umpires took things less seriously -- Glenn McGrath jokingly replayed the Trevor Chappell underarm incident from a 1981 ODI between the two sides , and Billy Bowden showed him a mock red card ( red cards are not normally used in cricket ) in response . </P> <H3> Inaugural tournaments ( edit ) </H3> Lasith Malinga bowling to Shahid Afridi in the 2009 Final at Lord 's . <P> It was first decided that every two years an ICC World Twenty20 tournament is to take place , except in the event of an Cricket World Cup being scheduled in the same year , in which case it will be held the year before . The first tournament was in 2007 in South Africa where India defeated Pakistan in the final . Two Associate teams had played in the first tournament , selected through the 2007 ICC World Cricket League Division One , a 50 - over competition . In December 2007 it was decided to hold a qualifying tournament with a 20 - over format to better prepare the teams . With six participants , two would qualify for the 2009 World Twenty20 and would each receive $250,000 in prize money . The second tournament was won by Pakistan who beat Sri Lanka by 8 wickets in England on 21 June 2009 . The 2010 ICC World Twenty20 tournament was held in West Indies in May 2010 , where England defeated Australia by 7 wickets . The 2012 ICC World Twenty20 was won by the West - Indies , by defeating Sri Lanka at the finals . For the first time , a host nation competed in the final of the ICC World Twenty20 . There were 12 participants for the title including Ireland and Afghanistan as 2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier .

It sums up , in book form , the beliefs of the Catholic faithful . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Publication history </Li> <Li> 2 Doctrinal value </Li> <Li> 3 Contents </Li> <Li> 4 Comments </Li> <Li> 5 Derived works </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 Notes </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 Further reading </Li> <Li> 10 External links <Ul> <Li> 10.1 Text of the Catechism </Li> <Li> 10.2 Comments on the Catechism </Li> <Li> 10.3 Text of the Compendium </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Publication history ( edit ) </H2> <P> The decision to publish a catechism was taken at the Second Extraordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops that was convened by Pope John Paul II on 25 January 1985 for the 20th anniversary of the close of the Second Vatican Council , and in 1986 , put a commission composed of 12 bishops and cardinals in charge of the project . The commission was assisted by a committee consisting seven diocesan bishops , experts in theology and catechesis . </P> <P> The text was approved by John Paul II on 25 June 1992 , and promulgated by him on 11 October 1992 , the 30th anniversary of the opening of the Second Vatican Council , with his apostolic constitution , Fidei depositum . Cardinal Georges Cottier , Theologian emeritus of the Pontifical Household and now Cardinal - Deacon of Santi Domenico e Sisto the University Church of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas , Angelicum was influential in drafting the encyclical . </P> <P> It was published in the French language in 1992 . Later it was then translated into many other languages . In the United States , the English translation was published in 1994 and had been pre-ordered more than 250,000 copies before its release , with a note that it was `` subject to revision according to the Latin typical edition ( editio typica ) when it is published . '' </P> <P> On August 15 , 1997 -- the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary -- John Paul II promulgated the Latin typical edition , with his apostolic letter , Laetamur Magnopere . The Latin text , which became the official text of reference ( editio typica ) , amended the contents of the provisional French text at a few points . One of the changes consisted in the inclusion of the position on death penalty that is defended in John Paul II 's encyclical Evangelium Vitae of 1995 . </P> <P> As a result , the earlier translations from the French into other languages ( including English ) had to be amended and re-published as `` second editions '' . </P> <H2> Doctrinal value ( edit ) </H2> <P> In the apostolic constitution Fidei depositum , John Paul II declared that the Catechism of the Catholic Church is `` a valid and legitimate instrument for ecclesial communion and a sure norm for teaching the faith '' , and stressed that it `` is not intended to replace the local catechisms duly approved by the ecclesiastical authorities , the diocesan Bishops and the Episcopal Conferences '' . </P> <H2> Contents ( edit ) </H2> <P> A catechism has been defined as `` a book that explains the beliefs of the Christian religion by using a list of questions and answers '' . Documents of religious instruction have been written since the beginning of Christianity and a catechism is typically an assemblage of these smaller documents into one large compilation of Church doctrine and teachings . </P> <P> The Catechism itself is not in question - and - answer format . Rather , it is instead a source on which to base such catechisms ( e.g. Youcat and the United States Catholic Catechism for Adults ) and other expositions of Catholic doctrine , called a `` major catechism . '' As stated in the apostolic constitution Fidei depositum , with which its publication was ordered , it was given so `` that it may be a sure and authentic reference text for teaching Catholic doctrine and particularly for preparing local catechisms . '' </P> <P> The Catechism is arranged in four principal parts : </P> <Ul> <Li> The Profession of Faith ( the Apostle 's Creed ) </Li> <Li> The Celebration of the Christian Mystery ( the Sacred Liturgy , and especially the sacraments ) </Li> <Li> Life in Christ ( including the Ten Commandments ) </Li> <Li> Christian Prayer ( including the Lord 's Prayer ) </Li> </Ul> <P> This scheme is often referred to as the `` Four Pillars '' of the Faith . The contents are abundantly footnoted with references to sources of the teaching , in particular the Scriptures , the Church Fathers , and the Ecumenical Councils and other authoritative Catholic statements , principally those issued by recent popes . </P> <P> The section on Scripture in the Catechism recovers the Patristic tradition of `` spiritual exegesis '' as further developed through the scholastic doctrine of the `` four senses . '' This return to spiritual exegesis is based on the Second Vatican Council 's 1965 dogmatic constitution Dei verbum , which taught that Scripture should be `` read and interpreted in light of the same Spirit by whom it was written '' . The Catechism amplifies Dei verbum by specifying that the necessary spiritual interpretation should be sought through the four senses of Scripture , which encompass the literal sense and the three spiritual senses ( allegorical , moral , and anagogical ) . </P> <P> The literal sense pertains to the meaning of the words themselves , including any figurative meanings . The spiritual senses pertain to the significance of the things ( persons , places , objects or events ) denoted by the words . Of the three spiritual senses , the allegorical sense is foundational . It relates persons , events , and institutions of earlier covenants to those of later covenants , and especially to the New Covenant . Building on the allegorical sense , the moral sense instructs in regard to action , and the anagogical sense points to man 's final destiny . The teaching of the Catechism on Scripture has encouraged the pursuit of covenantal theology , an approach that employs the four senses to structure salvation history via the biblical covenants . </P> <H2> Comments ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 1992 , Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger ( later Pope Benedict XVI ) noted : </P> <P> It clearly show ( s ) that the problem of what we must do as human beings , of how we should live our lives so that we and the world may become just , is the essential problem of our day , and basically of all ages . After the fall of ideologies , the problem of man -- the moral problem -- is presented to today 's context in a totally new way : What should we do ? How does life become just ? What can give us and the whole world a future which is worth living ? Since the catechism treats these questions , it is a book which interests many people , far beyond purely theological or ecclesial circles . </P> <P> Ulf Ekman , former Charismatic pastor and the founder of Livets Ord , says that the Catechism is `` the best book he has ever read '' . </P> <H2> Derived works ( edit ) </H2> <P> It was expected that the universal Catechism would serve as a source and template for inculturated national catechisms . In the United States , for example , the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops published the United States Catholic Catechism for Adults , officially replacing their previous version , the Baltimore Catechism , though it had already been out of use for nearly forty years . </P> <P> The Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church was published in 2005 , and the first edition in English in 2006 . It is a more concise and dialogic version of the Catechism . The text of the Compendium is available in fourteen languages on the Vatican website , which also gives the text of the Catechism itself in nine languages . </P> <P> Youcat , a catechism for youth , based on the Catechism and its Compendium , was published in 2011 . The Vatican has acknowledged that some translations of Youcat contain errors regarding Church teaching on the status of other religions , contraception and euthanasia , whether due to simple error or poor translations . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Catholicism portal </Li> <Li> Christianity portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Catholic Catechist </Li> <Li> Catholic Directory </Li> <Li> Catholic spirituality </Li> <Li> Glossary of the Catholic Church </Li> <Li> History of the Catholic Church since 1962 </Li> <Li> Index of Catholic Church articles </Li> <Li> Outline of Catholicism </Li> <Li> Pastoral care </Li> <Li> Catholic theology </Li> <Li> Second Vatican Council </Li> <Li> The Common Catechism </Li> <Li> Timeline of the Catholic Church </Li> <Li> Universal call to holiness </Li> <Li> Vocational Discernment in the Catholic Church </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ In an interview in 30Days , 3 - 2004 Cottier remarked : `` Going back to the early years , the first ' big ' text I worked on was the social encyclical Centesimus annus .

A law passed in a Joint Resolution by the 84th Congress ( P.L. 84 - 140 ) and approved by President Dwight Eisenhower on July 30 , 1956 , declared `` In God We Trust '' must appear on American currency . This phrase was first used on paper money in 1957 , when it appeared on the one - dollar silver certificate . The first paper currency bearing the phrase entered circulation on October 1 , 1957 . The 84th Congress later passed legislation ( P.L. 84 - 851 ) , also signed by President Eisenhower on July 30 , 1956 , declaring the phrase to be the national motto . </P> <P> Some groups and people have expressed objections to its use , citing its religious reference that violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment . These groups believe the phrase should be removed from currency and public property . In lawsuits , this argument has so far not overcome the interpretational doctrine of accommodationism , which allows government to endorse religious establishments as long as they are all treated equally . According to a 2003 joint poll by USA Today , CNN , and Gallup , 90 % of Americans support the inscription `` In God We Trust '' on U.S. coins . </P> <P> In 2006 , `` In God We Trust '' was designated as the motto of the U.S. state of Florida .

Chase , Treasury Secretary , scribes `` In God is our Trust , '' scratches out `` is our '' and overwrites `` We '' to arrive at `` In God We Trust '' in a December 9 , 1863 , letter to James Pollock , Director of the Philadelphia Mint . `` IN GOD WE TRUST '' first appeared on the obverse side of the Two - cent piece in 1864 <P> In 1860 , the phrase was used in the Coat of arms of New Westminster , Canada . The phrase has been incorporated in many hymns and religious - patriotic songs . During the American Civil War , the 125th Pennsylvania Infantry for the Union Army assumed the motto `` In God we trust '' in early August 1862 . William W. Wallace , coiner , circa August 1862 , of the motto `` In God We Trust '' was Captain of Company C of the 125th Pennsylvania Infantry . </P> <P> The Reverend Mark R. Watkinson of ' Ridleyville ' , Pennsylvania , ( pastor of Prospect Hill Baptist Church in present - day Prospect Park , Pennsylvania ) in a letter dated November 13 , 1861 , petitioned the Treasury Department to add a statement recognizing `` Almighty God in some form on our coins '' in order to `` relieve us from the ignominy of heathenism '' . At least part of the motivation was to declare that God was on the Union side of the Civil War . Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase acted on this proposal and directed the then - Philadelphia Director of the Mint , James Pollock , to begin drawing up possible designs that would include the religious phrase . Chase chose his favorite designs and presented a proposal to Congress for the new designs in late 1863 . </P> <P> In December 1863 , Abraham Lincoln 's Secretary of the Treasury decided on a new motto , `` In God We Trust , '' to engrave on U.S. coins . Lincoln 's involvement in this decision is unclear . </P> <P> A version of the motto made an early appearance on obverse side of the twenty dollar interest bearing note issued in 1864 along with the motto `` God and our Right '' . </P> <P> As Chase was preparing his recommendation to Congress , it was found that the Act of Congress dated January 18 , 1837 prescribed the mottoes and devices that should be placed upon the coins of the United States . This meant that the mint could make no changes without the enactment of additional legislation by the Congress . Such legislation was introduced and passed as the Coinage Act of 1864 on April 22 , 1864 , allowing the Secretary of the Treasury to authorize the inclusion of the phrase on one - cent and two - cent coins . </P> <P> An Act of Congress passed on March 3 , 1865 , allowed the Mint Director , with the Secretary 's approval , to place the motto on all gold and silver coins that `` shall admit the inscription thereon '' . In 1873 , Congress passed the Coinage Act , granting that the Secretary of the Treasury `` may cause the motto IN GOD WE TRUST to be inscribed on such coins as shall admit of such motto '' . </P> <P> The similar phrase ' In God is our Trust ' appears in `` The Star - Spangled Banner '' , adopted as the national anthem of the United States in 1931 . Written by Francis Scott Key during the War of 1812 , the fourth stanza includes the phrase , `` And this be our motto : ' In God is our Trust ' '' , which was adapted as the national motto . </P> <P> The use of `` In God We Trust '' has been interrupted . The motto disappeared from the five - cent coin in 1883 , and did not reappear until production of the Jefferson nickel began in 1938 . However , at least two other coins minted in every year in the interim still bore the motto , including the Morgan dollar and the Seated Liberty half dollar . The omission of the motto `` In God We Trust '' on the Indian Head eagle coin caused public outrage , and prompted Congress to pass a bill mandating its inclusion . Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber added the words and made minor modifications to the design . In 1908 , Congress made it mandatory that the phrase be printed on all coins upon which it had previously appeared . This decision was motivated after a public outcry following the release of a $20 coin which did not bear the motto . The motto has been in continuous use on the one - cent coin since 1909 , and on the ten - cent coin since 1916 . It also has appeared on all gold coins and silver dollar coins , half - dollar coins , and quarter - dollar coins struck since July 1 , 1908 . Since 1938 , all US coins have borne the motto . </P> A quarter dollar with the United States ' official motto `` IN GOD WE TRUST '' on the obverse side <P> During the Cold War era , the government of the United States sought to distinguish itself from the Soviet Union , which promoted state atheism and thus implemented antireligious legislation . The 84th Congress passed a joint resolution `` declaring IN GOD WE TRUST the national motto of the United States '' . The resolution passed both the House and the Senate unanimously and without debate . The law was signed by President Eisenhower on July 30 , 1956 . The United States Code at 36 U.S.C. \u00a7 302 , now states : `` ' In God we trust ' is the national motto . '' </P> <P> The same day , the President signed into law a requirement that `` In God We Trust '' be printed on all U.S. currency and coins . On paper currency , it first appeared on the silver certificate in 1957 , followed by other certificates . Federal Reserve Notes and United States Notes were circulated with the motto starting from 1964 to 1966 , depending on the denomination . ( Of these , only Federal Reserve Notes are still circulated . ) </P> <P> Representative Charles Edward Bennett of Florida cited the Cold War when he introduced the bill in the House , saying `` In these days when imperialistic and materialistic communism seeks to attack and destroy freedom , we should continually look for ways to strengthen the foundations of our freedom '' . </P> <P> Aronow v. United States was the first case to challenge the inclusion of `` In God We Trust '' on U.S. currency . The law it challenged was `` 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 324a `` the inscription ' In God we Trust ' ... shall appear on all United States currency and coins '' . O'Hair v. Blumenthal ( 1978 ) challenged the inclusion of the phrase `` In God We Trust '' on U.S. currency . A similar decision was reached by the Fifth Circuit in Madalyn Murray O'Hair vs W. Michael Blumenthal in 1979 , which affirmed that the `` primary purpose of the slogan was secular . '' </P> <P> In March 2001 , Governor of Mississippi Ronnie Musgrove signed legislation requiring the motto `` In God We Trust '' to be displayed in every public school classroom , as well as the school auditoriums and cafeterias , throughout the state . </P> A framed poster displaying the national motto of the United States in a New Philadelphia High School classroom <P> After the September 11 attacks in 2001 , many public schools across the United States posted `` In God We Trust '' framed posters in their `` libraries , cafeterias and classrooms '' . The American Family Association supplied several 11 - by - 14 - inch posters to school systems and vowed to defend any legal challenges to the displaying of the posters . </P> <P> According to a 2003 joint poll by USA Today , CNN , and Gallup , 90 % of Americans support the inscription `` In God We Trust '' on U.S. coins . </P> <P> In 2006 , on the 50th anniversary of its adoption , the Senate reaffirmed `` In God We Trust '' as the official national motto of the United States of America . In Florida House Bill no . 1145 , Florida adopted ' In God We Trust ' as the official state motto , effective July 1 , 2006 . </P> <P> In 2011 the House of Representatives passed an additional resolution reaffirming `` In God We Trust '' as the official motto of the United States , in a 396 -- 9 vote . </P> <P> In 2013 , a federal court rejected a challenge , brought by Michael Newdow and the Freedom From Religion Foundation , to remove `` In God We Trust '' from American currency . </P> `` IN GOD WE TRUST '' on the Seal of Mississippi <P> On January 31 , 2014 , purporting to defend religious freedom , the Mississippi senate voted to add the words , `` In God We Trust '' to the state seal and the change was made effective on July 1 , 2014 . </P> <P> In 2015 the county police department of Jefferson County , Illinois announced that the words `` In God We Trust '' will be on police squad cars . In 2015 , the Freedom from Religion Foundation demanded that local authorities remove decals of the motto from Childress , Texas Police Department patrol vehicles . In response , Police Chief Adrian Garcia told the organization , in a written letter , to `` go fly a kite . '' </P> <P> In early 2018 , Kimberly Daniels , a pastor who currently serves as the representative for Florida House of Representatives District 14 as a member of the Democratic Party , introduced HB 839 , a bill that requires public schools to display the motto `` In God We Trust '' in a conspicuous place . On Tuesday , January 23 , 2018 , the bill received unanimous approval from the House PreK - 12 Innovation Subcommittee . Later , in a vote on February 21 , 2018 , the bill passed 97 to 10 in the House . As part of Florida 's March 2018 K - 12 education law , Gov. Rick Scott mandated that all public schools post the state motto ( `` In God We Trust '' ) in a prominent location . </P> <P> In March 2018 , Act 911 , sponsored by State Rep.

{"content": "Answer the question based on the information provided in the document given below. The answer should be a number\n\nQuestion:\nwhen did they start screening for cystic fibrosis\n\nDocument:\norn screening programs are only detectable after irreversible damage has been done ; in some cases sudden death is the first manifestation of a disease . Screening programs are often run by state or national governing bodies with the goal of screening all infants born in the jurisdiction . The number of diseases screened for is set by each jurisdiction , and can vary greatly . Most newborn screening tests are done by measuring metabolites and enzyme activity in whole blood samples collected on specialized filter paper . Many areas are starting to screen infants for hearing loss using automated auditory brainstem response and congenital heart defects using pulse oximetry . Infants who screen positive undergo further testing to determine if they are truly affected with a disease or if the test result was a false positive . Follow - up testing is typically coordinated between geneticists and the infant 's pediatrician or primary care physician . </P> <P> Newborn screening debuted as a public health program in the United States in the early 1960s , and has expanded to countries around the world , with different testing menus in each country . Both prenatal screening ( screening before birth ) and newborn screening ( screening soon after birth ) have improved health care . The first disorder detected by modern newborn screening programs was phenylketonuria , a metabolic condition in which the inability to degrade the essential amino acid phenylalanine can cause irreversible mental retardation unless detected early . With early detection and dietary management , the negative effects of the disease can be largely eliminated . Robert Guthrie developed a simple method using a bacterial inhibition assay that could detect high levels of phenylalanine in blood shortly after a baby was born . Guthrie also pioneered the collection of blood on filter paper which could be easily transported , recognizing the need for a simple system if the screening was going to be done on a large scale . Newborn screening around the world is still done using similar filter paper . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Targeted disorders <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Amino acid disorders </Li> <Li> 1.2 Fatty acid oxidation disorders </Li> <Li> 1.3 Endocrinopathies </Li> <Li> 1.4 Hemoglobinopathies </Li> <Li> 1.5 Organic acidemias </Li> <Li> 1.6 Cystic fibrosis </Li> <Li> 1.7 Urea cycle disorders </Li> <Li> 1.8 Lysosomal storage disorders </Li> <Li> 1.9 Hearing loss </Li> <Li> 1.10 Congenital heart defects </Li> <Li> 1.11 Severe combined immunodeficiency </Li> <Li> 1.12 Other conditions </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Disease qualification </Li> <Li> 3 Techniques <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Sample collection </Li> <Li> 3.2 Laboratory testing </Li> <Li> 3.3 Reporting results </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Laboratory performance </Li> <Li> 5 History </Li> <Li> 6 Society and culture <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Controversies </Li> <Li> 6.2 Bioethics </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Targeted disorders ( edit ) </H2> See also : List of disorders included in newborn screening programs <P> Newborn screening is intended as a public health program to identify infants with treatable conditions before they present clinically , or suffer irreversible damage . Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) was the first disorder targeted for newborn screening , being implemented in a small number of hospitals and quickly expanding across the United States and the rest of the world . After the success of newborn screening for PKU ( 39 infants were identified and treated in the first two years of screening , with no false negative results ) , Guthrie and others looked for other disorders that could be identified and treated in infants , eventually developing bacterial inhibition assays to identify classic galactosemia and maple syrup urine disease . </P> <P> Newborn screening has expanded since the introduction of PKU testing in the 1960s , but can vary greatly between countries . In 2011 , the United States screened for 54 conditions , Germany for 12 , the United Kingdom for 2 ( PKU and medium chain acyl - CoA dehydrogenase deficiency ( MCADD ) ) , while France and Hong Kong only screened for one condition ( PKU and congenital hypothyroidism , respectively ) . The conditions included in newborn screening programs around the world vary greatly , based on the legal requirements for screening programs , prevalence of certain diseases within a population , political pressure , and the availability of resources for both testing and follow - up of identified patients . </P> <H3> Amino acid disorders ( edit ) </H3> <P> Newborn screening originated with an amino acid disorder , phenylketonuria ( PKU ) , which can be easily treated by dietary modifications , but causes severe mental retardation if not identified and treated early . Robert Guthrie introduced the newborn screening test for PKU in the early 1960s . With the knowledge that PKU could be detected before symptoms were evident , and treatment initiated , screening was quickly adopted around the world . Austria started screening for PKU in 1966 and England in 1968 . </P> <H3> Fatty acid oxidation disorders ( edit ) </H3> <P> With the advent of tandem mass spectrometry as a screening tool , several fatty acid oxidation disorders were targeted for inclusion in newborn screening programs . Medium chain acyl - CoA dehydrogenase deficiency ( MCADD ) , which had been implicated in several cases of sudden infant death syndrome was one of the first conditions targeted for inclusion . MCADD was the first condition added when the United Kingdom expanded their screening program from PKU only . Population based studies in Germany , the United States and Australia put the combined incidence of fatty acid oxidation disorders at 1 : 9300 among Caucasians . The United States screens for all known fatty acid oxidation disorders , either as primary or secondary targets , while other countries screen for a subset of these . </P> <P> The introduction of screening for fatty acid oxidation disorders has been shown to have reduced morbidity and mortality associated with the conditions , particularly MCADD . An Australian study found a 74 % reduction in episodes of severe metabolic decompensation or death among individuals identified by newborn screening as having MCADD versus those who presented clinically prior to screening . Studies in the Netherlands and United Kingdom found improvements in outcome at a reduced cost when infants were identified before presenting clinically . </P> <P> Newborn screening programs have also expanded the information base available about some rare conditions . Prior to its inclusion in newborn screening , short - chain acyl - CoA dehydrogenase deficiency ( SCADD ) was thought to be life - threatening . Most patients identified via newborn screening as having this enzyme deficiency were asymptomatic , to the extent that SCADD was removed from screening panels in a number of regions . Without the cohort of patients identified by newborn screening , this clinical phenotype would likely not have been identified . </P> <H3> Endocrinopathies ( edit ) </H3> <P> The most commonly included disorders of the endocrine system are congenital hypothyroidism ( CH ) and congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( CAH ) . Testing for both disorders can be done using blood samples collected on the standard newborn screening card . Screening for CH is done by measuring thyroxin ( T4 ) , thyrotropin ( TSH ) or a combination of both analytes . Elevated 17\u03b1 - hydroxyprogesterone ( 17\u03b1 - OHP ) is the primary marker used when screening for CAH , most commonly done using enzyme - linked immunosorbant assays , with many programs using a second tier tandem mass spectrometry test to reduce the number of false positive results . Careful analysis of screening results for CAH may also identify cases of congenital adrenal hypoplasia , which presents with extremely low levels of 17\u03b1 - OHP . </P> <P> CH was added to many newborn screening programs in the 1970s , often as the second condition included after PKU . The most common cause of CH is dysgenesis of the thyroid gland After many years of newborn screening , the incidence of CH worldwide had been estimated at 1 : 3600 births , with no obvious increases in specific ethnic groups . Recent data from certain regions have showed an increase , with New York reporting an incidence of 1 : 1700 . Reasons for the apparent increase in incidence have been studied , but no explanation has been found . </P> <P> Classic CAH , the disorder targeted by newborn screening programs , is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme steroid 21 - hydroxylase , and comes in two forms - simple virilizing and a salt - wasting form . Incidence of CAH can vary greatly between populations . The highest reported incidence rates are among the Yupic Eskimos of Alaska ( 1 : 280 ) and on the French island of R\u00e9union ( 1 : 2100 ) . </P> <H3> Hemoglobinopathies ( edit ) </H3> Sickle cells in human blood : both normal red blood cells and sickle - shaped cells are present <P> Any condition that results in the production of abnormal hemoglobin is included under the broad category of hemoglobinopathies . Worldwide , it is estimated that 7 % of the population may carry a hemoglobinopathy with clinical significance . The most well known condition in this group is sickle cell disease . Newborn screening for a large number of hemoglobinopathies is done by detecting abnormal patterns using isoelectric focusing , which can detect many different types of abnormal hemoglobins . In the United States , newborn screening for sickle cell disease was recommended for all infants in 1987 , however it was not implemented in all 50 states until 2006 . </P> <P> Early identification of individuals with sickle cell disease and other hemoglobinopathies allows treatment to be initiated in a timely fashion . Penicillin has been used in children with sickle cell disease , and blood transfusions are used for patients identified with severe thalassemia . </P> <H3> Organic acidemias ( edit ) </H3> <P> Most jurisdictions did not start screening for any of the organic acidemias before tandem mass spectrometry significantly expanded the list of disorders detectable by newborn screening . Quebec has run a voluntary second - tier screening program since 1971 using urine samples collected at three weeks of age to screen for an expanded list of organic acidemias using a thin layer chromatography method . Newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry can detect several organic acidemias , including propionic acidemia , methylmalonic acidemia and isovaleric acidemia . </P> <H3> Cystic fibrosis ( edit ) </H3> <P> Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) was first added to newborn screening programs in New Zealand and regions of Australia in 1981 , by measuring immunoreactive trypsinogen ( IRT ) in dried blood spots . After the CFTR gene was identified , Australia introduced a two tier testing program to reduce the number of false positives . Samples with an elevated IRT value were then analyzed with molecular methods to identify the presence of disease causing mutations before being reported back to parents and health care providers . CF is included in the core panel of conditions recommended for inclusion in all 50 states , Texas was the last state to implement their screening program for CF in 2010 . Alberta was the first Canadian province to implement CF screening in 2007 . Quebec , New Brunswick , Nova Scotia , Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island do not include CF in their screening programs . The United Kingdom as well as many European Union countries screen for CF as well . Switzerland is one of the latest countries to add CF to their newborn screening menu , doing so in January 2011 . </P> <H3> Urea cycle disorders ( edit ) </H3> <P> Disorders of the distal urea cycle , such as citrullinemia , argininosuccinic aciduria and argininemia are included in newborn screening programs in many jurisdictions that using tandem mass spectrometry to identify key amino acids . Proximal urea cycle defects , such as ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and carbamoyl phosphate synthetase deficiency are not included in newborn screening panels because they are not reliably detected using current technology , and also because severely affected infants will present with clinical symptoms before newborn screening results are available . Some regions claim to screen for HHH syndrome ( hyperammonemia , hyperornithinemia , homocitrullinuria ) based on the detection of elevated ornithine levels in the newborn screening dried blood spot , but other sources have shown that affected individuals do not have elevated ornithine at birth . </P> <H3> Lysosomal storage disorders ( edit ) </H3> <P> Lysosomal storage disorders are not included in newborn screening programs with high frequency . As a group , they are heterogenous , with screening only being feasible for a small fraction of the approximately 40 identified disorders . The arguments for their inclusion in newborn screening programs center around the advantage of early treatment ( when treatment is available ) , avoiding a diagnostic odyssey for families and providing information for family planning to couples who have an affected child . The arguments against including these disorders , as a group or individually center around the difficulties with reliably identifying individuals who will be affected with a severe form of the disorder , the relatively unproven nature of the treatment methods , and the high cost / high risk associated with some treatme\n", "answer": "1981"}

In 2011 , Statistics Canada reported approximately 2 million people identifying as adherents . The United Church was founded in 1925 as a merger of four Protestant denominations with a total combined membership of about 600,000 members : the Methodist Church , Canada , the Congregational Union of Ontario and Quebec , two - thirds of the congregations of the Presbyterian Church in Canada , and the Association of Local Union Churches , a movement predominantly of the Canadian Prairie provinces . The Canadian Conference of the Evangelical United Brethren Church joined the United Church of Canada on January 1 , 1968 . </P> <P> Membership peaked in 1964 at 1.1 million , and has declined since that time . From 1991 to 2001 , the number of people claiming an affiliation with the United Church decreased by 8 % , the third largest decrease in mainstream Christian denominations in Canada . Church statistics for the end of 2014 showed 413,717 members in 327,847 households under pastoral care . As of December 31 , 2016 , 132,459 people attend services in 2,141 communities of faith representing 2,834 congregations on a regular basis . </P> <P> The United Church has a `` council - based '' structure , where each council ( congregational , regional , or denominational ) have specific responsibilities . In some areas , each of these councils have sole authority , while in others , approval of other councils is required before action is taken . ( For example , a congregation requires regional council approval before a minister can be called or appointed to the congregation . ) The policies of the church are inclusive and liberal : there are no restrictions of gender , sexual orientation or marital status for a person considering entering the ministry ; interfaith marriages are recognized ; communion is offered to all Christian adults and children , regardless of denomination or age . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Governance and structure <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Moderator </Li> <Li> 1.2 Governance structure </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Ministry </Li> <Li> 3 Beliefs and practices <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Bible </Li> <Li> 3.2 Sacraments <Ul> <Li> 3.2. 1 Communion </Li> <Li> 3.2. 2 Baptism </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3.3 Inclusiveness </Li> <Li> 3.4 Marriage </Li> <Li> 3.5 Interfaith relations </Li> <Li> 3.6 Abortion </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Membership <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Benefits of membership </Li> <Li> 4.2 Transfer of membership and removal from rolls </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 History <Ul> <Li> 5.1 Inauguration </Li> <Li> 5.2 Crest </Li> <Li> 5.3 1930s </Li> <Li> 5.4 1940s </Li> <Li> 5.5 1950s </Li> <Li> 5.6 1960s </Li> <Li> 5.7 1970s </Li> <Li> 5.8 1980s </Li> <Li> 5.9 1990s </Li> <Li> 5.10 2000s </Li> <Li> 5.11 2010s </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Music </Li> <Li> 7 Public positions and policies <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Indigenous people </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 Criticism from outside the church </Li> <Li> 9 References </Li> <Li> 10 Further reading </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Governance and structure ( edit ) </H2> <P> The rules for governance are set out in The Manual , first written in 1925 , and updated on a regular basis . </P> <H3> Moderator ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Moderator of the United Church of Canada <P> The voice and face of the church is the Moderator , who is elected to a three - year term at each General Council .

There are two `` streams '' , ordered ministry and lay ministry . Ordered ministry includes ordained ministers and diaconal ministers . Lay ministry refers to licensed lay ministers , designated lay ministers ( DLM ) and congregational designated ministers ( CDM ) . There are no restrictions on gender , sexual orientation , age , or marital status for any branches of ministry . </P> <H2> Beliefs and practices ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Bible ( edit ) </H3> <P> The United Church believes that the Bible is central to the Christian faith and was written by people who were inspired by God . The church also believes that the circumstances under which the books of the Bible were written were of a particular place and time , and some things can not be reconciled with our lives today , such as slavery . The United Church of Canada uses the historical - critical method of interpreting the bible . </P> <H3> Sacraments ( edit ) </H3> <P> The two sacraments of the United Church are Communion and Baptism . </P> Communion ( edit ) <P> Communion is the ritual sharing of the elements of bread and wine ( or , more commonly , grape juice ) as a remembrance of the Last Supper that Jesus shared with his followers . It is usually celebrated at a table at the front of the sanctuary , where the minister blesses the elements before they are distributed to the congregation . There is no restriction regarding age or United Church membership -- Communion is open to young children as well as Christians from other denominations . The actual distribution can take several forms , including passing a tray of bread cubes and another tray of small juice glasses from person to person , and then eating the bread and drinking the juice in unison ; and `` intinction '' , where each person takes a piece of bread , dips it into a cup of juice and then eats the juice - soaked bread . </P> <P> There is no guideline for frequency . Some congregations celebrate communion once a month , others on a quarterly basis . </P> Baptism ( edit ) <P> The belief of the United Church is that baptism is not a requirement for God 's love ; it is not considered a passport to heaven , nor does the church believe that those who die unbaptised are condemned or damned for eternity . Rather , the church believes that baptism is the first step in church membership , where the parents make a profession of faith on behalf of the infant in the hope that their child will later confirm that profession at or around the age of 13 . </P> <P> The United Church practices infant baptism , but in cases where a person was not baptised as an infant , baptism can be performed at any age . In the case of infant baptism , the parents of the infant , before the congregation , agree to a series of statements about the beliefs of the United Church on behalf of their child . They also promise to encourage the child to seek full membership at an appropriate time . The members of the congregation also promise the parents that they will help to raise the child in a Christian community . The minister then places water on the candidate 's head three times ( expressing the Trinity of Father , Son and Holy Spirit ) and traces a cross on the person 's forehead with water . Baptism by immersion is also an option for adults who request it . </P> <P> In the 1970s , the United Church reached an ecumenical agreement with the Presbyterian , Lutheran , Catholic , and Anglican churches in Canada that baptisms within these churches are mutually recognized as valid . Further to that , the United Church recognizes the validity of any baptism by another denomination that was performed with water and in the name of the Father , Son and Holy Spirit . </P> <H3> Inclusiveness ( edit ) </H3> <P> Remembering that Jesus was reported to have welcomed tax collectors , prostitutes and other `` undesirables '' to his table , the church attempts to welcome everyone , regardless of age , race , class , gender , sexual orientation , or physical ability . In the same manner , there is also no restriction on those interested in entering ministry . </P> <H3> Marriage ( edit ) </H3> <P> Believing that marriage is a celebration of God 's love , the church recognizes and celebrates all legal marriages , including same - sex couples , previously divorced people , and couples of different religions . The actual policy of whom to marry is left up to the church council of each community of faith . For instance , one congregation might not allow same - sex marriages to be performed in their building , while another allows all marriages regardless of sexual orientation . </P> <H3> Interfaith relations ( edit ) </H3> <P> The church believes that there are many paths to God . The United Church 's path is through Jesus Christ , but the church also recognizes that Christians ' understanding of this is limited by an incomplete comprehension of God ; their belief is that the Holy Spirit of God is also at work through other non-Christian faiths . </P> <H3> Abortion ( edit ) </H3> <P> The church supports the right of women to have access to safe abortions that are covered by provincial health care , but also supports better access to contraception , sexual education , and counselling that might eventually make abortion unnecessary . </P> <H2> Membership ( edit ) </H2> <P> A full member is one who has been baptised , either as infant , child , youth or adult , and has made a public profession of faith before the congregation . Membership is not required in order to worship at a United Church , and many who regularly attend worship are adherents rather than members . </P> <P> In order to become a full member , a person goes through a process called `` confirmation '' . This is offered to adults ( starting at around age 13 ) and usually involves a series of classes about the beliefs of the United Church . Following this , the candidate makes a public profession of faith before the congregation , thereby `` confirming '' the statements made by his or her parents during baptism . If the person is unbaptised , the minister baptises the person before the profession of faith . The new member 's name is then entered on the official Roll of Members for that congregation . </P> <H3> Benefits of membership ( edit ) </H3> <P> Only members can be a part of a congregation 's board or council , and only members can vote on spiritual matters at congregational meetings -- usually whether to issue a `` call '' to a new minister to join the congregation . ( On temporal matters -- those that deal with finances , property , etc. -- a motion is usually made at the start of a congregational meeting to allow all who are present , rather than just members , the right to vote . ) </P> <H3> Transfer of membership and removal from rolls ( edit ) </H3> <P> Although confirmation takes place at the congregational level , the person is a member of the entire United Church of Canada , not just one congregation ; therefore membership can be transferred freely from congregation to congregation . </P> <P> A congregation may remove members from i\n\nQuestion:\nwhen did the united church of canada form\n", "answer": "1925"}

The answer should be a number\n\nQuestion:\nwhen did democratic republic of congo become independent\n\nDocument:\n Congo remained present in the region between the 14th and the early 19th centuries . Belgian colonization began when King Leopold II founded the Congo Free State , a corporate state run solely by King Leopold . Reports of widespread murder and torture in the rubber plantations led the Belgian government to seize the Congo from Leopold II and establish the Belgian Congo . Under Belgian rule numerous Christian organizations attempted to Westernize the Congolese people . </P> <P> After an uprising by the Congolese people , Belgium surrendered to the independence of the Congo in 1960 . However , the Congo remained unstable because tribal leaders had more power than the central government . Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba tried to restore order with the aid of the Soviet Union as part of the Cold War , causing the United States to support a coup led by Colonel Joseph Mobutu in 1965 . Mobutu quickly seized complete power of the Congo and renamed the country Zaire . He sought to Africanize the country , changing his own name to Mobutu Sese Seko , and demanded that African citizens change their Western names to traditional African names . Mobutu sought to repress any opposition to his rule , in which he successfully did throughout the 1980s . However , with his regime weakened in the 1990s , Mobutu was forced to agree to a power - sharing government with the opposition party . Mobutu remained the head of state and promised elections within the next two years that never took place . </P> <P> In the First Congo War , Rwanda invaded Zaire ; Mobutu lost his power during this process . Laurent - Desire Kabila took power and renamed the country the Democratic Republic of the Congo . After a disappointing rule under Kabila , the Second Congo War broke out , resulting in a regional war in which different African nations took part . Kabila was assassinated by his bodyguard in 2001 , and his son , Joseph , succeeded him and was later elected president by the Congolese government in 2006 . Kabila quickly sought peace . Foreign soldiers remained in the Congo for a few years and a power - sharing government between Kabila and the opposition party was set up . Kabila later resumed complete control over the Congo and was re-elected in a disputed election in 2011 . Today , the Congo remains dangerously unstable . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Early history </Li> <Li> 2 Colonial rule <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Congo Free State ( 1885 -- 1908 ) </Li> <Li> 2.2 Belgian Congo ( 1908 -- 60 ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Independence and the Congo Crisis ( 1960 -- 65 ) </Li> <Li> 4 Zaire ( 1965 -- 97 ) </Li> <Li> 5 Civil Wars ( 1996 - 2003 ) <Ul> <Li> 5.1 First Congo War ( 1996 -- 97 ) </Li> <Li> 5.2 Second Congo War ( 1998 -- 2003 ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Joseph Kabila period <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Transitional government ( 2003 -- 06 ) </Li> <Li> 6.2 Kabila overstays his term </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Continued conflicts <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Conflict in Kivu ( 2004 - present ) <Ul> <Li> 7.1. 1 Allied Democratic Forces insurgency </Li> <Li> 7.1. 2 Ethnic Mai Mai factions </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7.2 Conflict in Katanga </Li> <Li> 7.3 Conflict in Kasai </Li> <Li> 7.4 Ituri conflict </Li> <Li> 7.5 Dongo Conflict </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 See also </Li> <Li> 9 Notes </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 Sources </Li> <Li> 12 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Early history ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Early Congolese history Map of the Kingdom of Kongo <P> The area now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo was populated as early as 80,000 years ago , as shown by the 1988 discovery of the Semliki harpoon at Katanda , one of the oldest barbed harpoons ever found , which is believed to have been used to catch giant river catfish . During its recorded history , the area has also been known as Congo , Congo Free State , Belgian Congo , and Zaire . </P> <P> The Kingdom of Kongo existed from the 14th to the early 19th century . Until the arrival of the Portuguese it was the dominant force in the region along with the Kingdom of Luba , the Kingdom of Lunda , the Mongo people and the Anziku Kingdom . </P> <H2> Colonial rule ( edit ) </H2> See also : Belgian overseas colonies <H3> Congo Free state ( 1885 -- 1908 ) ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Congo Free State Children mutilated during King Leopold II 's rule <P> The Congo Free State was a corporate state privately controlled by Leopold II of Belgium through the Association internationale africaine , a non-governmental organization . Leopold was the sole shareholder and chairman . The state included the entire area of the present Democratic Republic of the Congo . Under Leopold II , the Congo Free State became one of the most infamous international scandals of the turn of the twentieth century . The report of the British Consul Roger Casement led to the arrest and punishment of white officials who had been responsible for cold - blooded killings during a rubber - collecting expedition in 1900 , including a Belgian national who caused the shooting of at least 122 Congolese natives . Estimates of the total death toll vary considerably . The first census was only done in 1924 , so it is even more difficult to quantify the population loss of the period . Roger Casement 's famous 1904 report estimated ten million people . According to Casement 's report , indiscriminate `` war '' , starvation , reduction of births and tropical diseases caused the country 's depopulation . European and U.S. press agencies exposed the conditions in the Congo Free State to the public in 1900 . By 1908 public and diplomatic pressure had led Leopold II to annex the Congo as the Belgian Congo colony . </P> <H3> Belgian Congo ( 1908 -- 60 ) ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Belgian Congo <P> On 15 November 1908 King L\u00e9opold II of Belgium formally relinquished personal control of the Congo Free State . The renamed Belgian Congo was put under the direct administration of the Belgian government and its Ministry of Colonies . </P> <P> Belgian rule in the Congo was based around the `` colonial trinity '' ( trinit\u00e9 coloniale ) of state , missionary and private company interests . The privileging of Belgian commercial interests meant that large amounts of capital flowed into the Congo and that individual regions became specialised . The interests of the government and private enterprise became closely tied ; the state helped companies break strikes and remove other barriers imposed by the indigenous population . The country was split into nesting , hierarchically organised administrative subdivisions , and run uniformly according to a set `` native policy '' ( politique indig\u00e8ne ) -- in contrast to the British and the French , who generally favoured the system of indirect rule whereby traditional leaders were retained in positions of authority under colonial oversight . There was also a high degree of racial segregation . Large numbers of white immigrants who moved to the Congo after the end of World War II came from across the social spectrum , but were nonetheless always treated as superior to blacks . </P> <P> During the 1940s and 1950s , the Congo experienced an unprecedented level of urbanisation and the colonial administration began various development programmes aimed at making the territory into a `` model colony '' . Notable advances were made in treating diseases such as African trypanosomiasis . One of the results of these measures was the development of a new middle class of Europeanised African \u00e9volu\u00e9s in the cities . By the 1950s the Congo had a wage labour force twice as large as that in any other African colony . The Congo 's rich natural resources , including uranium -- much of the uranium used by the U.S. nuclear programme during World War II was Congolese -- led to substantial interest in the region from both the Soviet Union and the United States as the Cold War developed . </P> <H2> Independence and the Congo crisis ( 1960 -- 65 ) ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Congo Crisis <P> Following riots in Leopoldville 4 -- 7 January 1959 , and in Stanleyville on 31 October 1959 , the Belgians realised they could not maintain control of such a vast country in the face of rising demands for independence . Belgian and Congolese political leaders held a Round Table Conference in Brussels beginning on 18 January 1960 . At the end of the conference on 27 January 1960 it was announced that elections would be held in the Congo on 22 May 1960 , and full independence granted on 30 June 1960 . The Congo was indeed granted its independence on 30 June 1960 , and adopted the name `` Republic of the Congo '' ( R\u00e9publique du Congo ) . The French colony of Middle Congo ( Moyen Congo ) also chose the name Republic of Congo upon its independence , so the two countries are more commonly known as Congo - L\u00e9opoldville and Congo - Brazzaville , after their capital cities . President Mobutu changed the country 's official name to Zaire in 1971 . That name comes from Portuguese , adapted from the Kongo word nzere or nzadi ( `` river that swallows all rivers '' ) </P> <P> In 1960 , the country was very unstable -- regional tribal leaders held far more power than the central government -- and with the departure of the Belgian administrators , almost no skilled bureaucrats remained in the country . The first Congolese graduated university only in 1956 , and very few in the new nation had any idea how to manage a country of such size . </P> <P> Parliamentary elections in 1960 produced the nationalist Patrice Lumumba as prime minister and pro-Western Joseph Kasavubu as president of the newly independent Republic of The Congo . </P> <P> On 5 July 1960 , a military mutiny by Congolese soldiers against their European officers broke out in the capital and rampant looting began . On 11 July 1960 the richest province of the country , Katanga , seceded under Moise Tshombe . The United Nations sent 20,000 peacekeepers to protect Europeans in the country and try to restore order . Western paramilitaries and mercenaries , often hired by mining companies to protect their interests , also began to pour into the country . In this period Congo 's second richest province , Kasai , also announced its independence on 8 August 1960 . </P> <P> Prime Minister Lumumba turned to the USSR for assistance . Nikita Khrushchev agreed to help , offering advanced weaponry and technical advisors . The United States viewed the Soviet presence as an attempt to take advantage of the situation and gain a proxy state in sub-Saharan Africa . UN forces were ordered to block any shipments of arms into the country . The United States also looked for a way to replace Lumumba as leader . President Kasavubu had clashed with Prime Minister Lumumba and advocated an alliance with the West rather than the Soviets . The U.S. sent weapons and CIA personnel to aid forces allied with Kasavubu and combat the Soviet presence . On 14 September 1960 , with U.S. and CIA support , Colonel Joseph Mobutu overthrew the government and arrested Lumumba . </P> <P> On 17 January 1961 Mobutu sent Lumumba to \u00c9lisabethville ( now Lubumbashi ) , capital of Katanga . In full view of the press he was beaten and forced to eat copies of his own speeches . For three weeks afterward , he was not seen or heard from . Then Katangan radio announced implausibly that he had escaped and been killed by villagers . It was soon clear that in fact he had been tortured and killed along with two others shortly after his arrival . In 2001 , a Belgian inquiry established that he had been shot by Katangan gendarmes in the presence of Belgian officers , under Katangan command . Lumumba was beaten , placed in front of a firing squad with two allies , cut up , buried , dug up and what remained was dissolved in acid . </P> <P> In Stanleyville , those loyal to the deposed Lumumba set up a rival government under Antoine Gizenga which lasted from 31 March 1961 until it was reintegrated on 5 August 1961 . After some reverses , UN and Congolese government forces succeeded in recapturing the breakaway provinces of South Kasai on 30 December 1961 , and Katanga on 15 January 1963 . </P> <P> A new crisis erupted in the Simba Rebellion of 1964 - 1965 which saw half the country taken by the rebels . European mercenaries , US , and Belgian troops were called in by the Congolese government to defeat the rebellion . </P> <H2> Zaire ( 1965 -- 97 ) ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Zaire Mobutu Sese Seko <P> Unrest and rebellion plagued the government until November 1965 , when Lieutenant General Mobutu , by then commander in chief of the national army , seized control of the country and declared himself president for five years .

Longacre </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Design date </Th> <Td> 1860 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The Indian Head cent , also known as an Indian Head penny , was a one - cent coin ( $0.01 ) produced by the United States Bureau of the Mint from 1859 to 1909 . It was designed by James Barton Longacre , the Chief Engraver at the Philadelphia Mint . </P> <P> From 1793 to 1857 , the cent was a copper coin about the size of a half dollar . As rising copper prices made it impractical to keep striking them , in 1857 the Mint reduced the size of the cent , issuing a new design , the Flying Eagle cent . The new pieces were identical in diameter to modern cents , though somewhat thicker and made of copper - nickel . The design caused production difficulties , and the Mint soon looked to replace the coin . Mint Director James Ross Snowden selected the Indian Head design , and chose a laurel wreath for the reverse that was replaced in 1860 by an oak wreath with a shield . Cents were hoarded during the economic chaos of the American Civil War , when the metal nickel was in short supply . As Mint officials saw that privately issued bronze tokens were circulating , they induced Congress to pass the Coinage Act of 1864 , authorizing a slimmer cent of bronze alloy . </P> <P> In the postwar period , the cent became very popular and was struck in large numbers in most years . An exception was 1877 , when a poor economy and little demand for cents created one of the rarest dates in the series . With the advent of coin - operated machines in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , even more cents were produced , reaching 100 million for the first time in 1907 . In 1909 , the Indian Head cent was replaced by the Lincoln cent , designed by Victor D. Brenner . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Inception </Li> <Li> 2 Design </Li> <Li> 3 Production <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Redesign and surplus ( 1859 -- 1861 ) </Li> <Li> 3.2 Shortage and redesign ( 1862 -- 1864 ) </Li> <Li> 3.3 Later years ( 1865 -- 1909 ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Replacement </Li> <Li> 5 Collecting </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Inception ( edit ) </H2> Main articles : Large cent ( United States coin ) and Flying Eagle cent <P> The half - dollar - sized large cent was struck from 1793 to 1857 . That coin was intended to contain close to a cent 's worth of copper , as people then expected that coins contain close to their face values in metal . Nevertheless , because of the constitutional clause making only gold and silver legal tender , the government would not accept copper cents for taxes or other payments . By the early 1850s , fluctuations in the price of copper led the Mint of the United States ( hereafter Mint ) to seek alternatives , including reducing the size of the cent and experimenting with compositions other than pure copper . The result was the Flying Eagle cent , the same diameter as the later Lincoln cent but somewhat thicker and heavier , composed of 88 % copper and 12 % nickel . The Flying Eagle cent was struck in limited numbers as a pattern coin in 1856 , then for circulation in 1857 and 1858 . </P> <P> The Flying Eagle cent was issued in exchange for worn Spanish colonial silver coins , which until then had circulated widely in the United States . These `` small cents '' were also issued in exchange for the copper coins they had replaced . By 1858 , Mint authorities found the piece unsatisfactory in production . The high points on both sides of the coin ( the eagle 's head and the wreath ) opposed each other , and it was difficult to get the design to be brought out fully in the tough copper - nickel alloy . Mint Engraver James B. Longacre , designer of the Flying Eagle cent , was instructed to develop alternative designs . He produced one , showing a slimmer eagle , which would not clash as much with the reverse wreath . Although this would have cured the production problem , the design was not liked . Mint Director James Ross Snowden suggested a head of Columbus as an obverse design , but Longacre felt the public would not approve of a historic figure on an American coin . </P> A Spanish colonial two - reales piece ( `` two bits '' ) from the Potos\u00ed Mint ( today in Bolivia ) <P> In 1858 , the Mint tested new designs for the cent . Between 60 and 100 sets of twelve pattern coins were struck , consisting of the standard Flying Eagle obverse , a `` scrawny eagle '' pattern , and the Indian Head design , mated with four different wreaths for the reverse . Snowden would make his choice of what design would be struck in 1859 from these patterns ; the sets were also sold to collectors . The Indian Head design was apparently prepared by April , as on the twelfth of that month , a Mr. Howard wrote to Snowden that `` I have learned that a new pattern piece for the cent has been struck off at the Mint ( with ) a head resembling that of the three dollar piece and on the reverse a shield at the top of the olive and oak wreath '' , and asking to purchase a specimen . Other numismatists also sought pieces : R. Coulton Davis , a Philadelphia druggist with ties to the Mint , wrote to Snowden in June informing him of a favorable story in a Boston newspaper , and Augustus B. Sage wrote to the Mint Director the same month , asking for a specimen for himself , and one for the newly founded American Numismatic Society . </P> <P> According to Walter Breen , Snowden most likely chose the combination of the Indian Head and the laurel wreath as it was the lowest relief of any of the options , and could be expected to strike well . On November 4 , 1858 , Snowden wrote to Treasury Secretary Howell Cobb about the Indian Head design , and two days later wrote to Longacre , informing him that it was approved . Longacre was to prepare the necessary dies for production , which was to begin on January 1 , 1859 . </P> <H2> Design ( edit ) </H2> <P> Longacre advocated his Indian Head design in an August 21 , 1858 , letter to Snowden : </P> <P> From the copper shores of Lake Superior , to the silver mountains of Potosi from the Ojibwa to the Aramanian , the feathered tiara is as characteristic of the primitive races of our hemisphere , as the turban is of the Asiatic . Nor is there anything in its decorative character , repulsive to the association of Liberty ... It is more appropriate than the Phrygian cap , the emblem rather of the emancipated slave , than of the independent freeman , of those who are able to say `` we were never in bondage to any man '' . I regard then this emblem of America as a proper and well defined portion of our national inheritance ; and having now the opportunity of consecrating it as a memorial of Liberty , ' our Liberty ' , American Liberty ; why not use it ? One more graceful can scarcely be devised . We have only to determine that it shall be appropriate , and all the world outside of us can not wrest it from us . </P> <P> By numismatic legend , the facial features of the goddess Liberty on the obverse of the Indian Head cent were based on the features of Longacre 's daughter Sarah ; the tale runs that she was at the mint one day when she tried on the headdress of one of a number of Native Americans who were visiting , and her father sketched her . However , Sarah Longacre was 30 years old and married in 1858 , not 12 as in the tale , and Longacre himself stated that the face was based on a statue of Venus in Philadelphia on loan from the Vatican . He did often sketch his elder daughter , and there are resemblances between the depictions of Sarah and the various representations of Liberty on his coins of the 1850s . These tales were apparently extant at the time , as Snowden , writing to Treasury Secretary Howell Cobb in November 1858 , denied that the coin was based `` on any human features in the Longacre family '' . Lee F. McKenzie , in his 1991 article on Longacre , notes that any artist can be influenced by many things , but calls the story `` essentially false '' . </P> <P> Regardless of who posed for Longacre , the facial features of the `` Indian '' are essentially Caucasian , meaning that a White woman wears the headdress of a Native American man . Longacre had , in 1854 , designed the three - dollar piece with a female with similar features ( also supposedly based on the museum sculpture ) but a more fanciful headdress , and adapted that design for the gold dollar . Officials were aware of this artistic license at the time of issue ; Snowden , in his November 1858 letter to Cobb , characterizes the two earlier coins as `` the artists at the Mint evidently not realizing the absurd incongruity of placing this most masculine attribute of the warrior brave on the head of a woman '' . Longacre would not be the last to juxtapose the features of a White woman with an Indian headdress reserved for men ; Augustus Saint Gaudens , for the Indian Head eagle ( 1907 ) , produced a similar design . Later issues depict more accurate Indians , including Bela Lyon Pratt 's Indian Head gold pieces ( 1908 ) , the Buffalo nickel ( 1913 ) by James Earle Fraser , who worked from Native American models , and the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar ( 1926 ) , designed by Fraser and his wife Laura . </P> Cornelius Vermeule thought the Indian Head cent was better than Longacre 's 1859 pattern half dollar . <P> Art historian Cornelius Vermeule had mixed emotions about the Indian Head cent : `` Longacre enriched the mythology of American coinage in a pleasant if unpretentious fashion . Given his pattern half - dollar designs of 1859 as a yardstick , he could have done worse . '' In another comparison , Vermeule suggested , `` far from a major creation aesthetically or iconographically , and far less attractive to the eye than the ( flying eagle ) , the Indian head cent was at least to achieve the blessing of popular appeal . The coin became perhaps the most beloved and typically American of any piece great or small in the American series . Great art the coin was not , but it was one of the first products of the United States mints to achieve the common touch . '' </P> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Redesign and surplus ( 1859 -- 1861 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> Production of the Indian Head cent for commerce began at the start of 1859 . As issued for circulation , the pieces differ in some particulars from the pattern 1858 cent of similar design ; Longacre sharpened some details . The pattern coin had the laurel leaves in the reverse wreath in bunches of five leaves ; the issued 1859 cent has them in bunches of six . Cents dated 1858 with the adopted reverse ( with six - leaf bunches ) are known , were most likely struck in 1859 , and are extremely rare . </P> <P> In 1860 , the reverse of the cent was changed to feature an oak wreath and a narrow shield ; such reverses are also known on 1859 - dated pieces struck as patterns . According to Richard Snow in his guide book to Flying Eagle and Indian Head cents , this was not due to problems with the `` Laurel Wreath '' reverse design used in 1859 , as full details survive on many extant pie\n", "answer": "1859"}

Benjamin Hoff used Milne 's characters in The Tao of Pooh and The Te of Piglet to explain Taoism . Similarly , Frederick Crews wrote essays about the Pooh books in abstruse academic jargon in The Pooh Perplex and Postmodern Pooh to satirise a range of philosophical approaches . Pooh and the Philosophers by John T. Williams uses Winnie the Pooh as a backdrop to illustrate the works of philosophers including Descartes , Kant , Plato and Nietzsche . </P> <P> One of the best known characters in British children 's literature , a 2011 poll saw Winnie the Pooh voted onto the list of icons of England . Forbes magazine ranked Pooh the most valuable fictional character in 2002 , with merchandising products alone generating more than $5.9 billion that year . In 2005 , Pooh generated $6 billion , a figure surpassed by only Mickey Mouse . In 2006 , Pooh received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame , marking the 80th birthday of Milne 's creation . The bear is such a popular character in Poland that a Warsaw street is named for him , Ulica Kubusia Puchatka . There is also a street named after him in Budapest ( Micimack\u00f3 utca ) . </P> <P> In music , Kenny Loggins wrote the song `` House at Pooh Corner '' , which was originally recorded by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band . Loggins later rewrote the song as `` Return to Pooh Corner '' , featuring on the album of the same name in 1991 . In Italy , a pop band took their name from Winnie , and were titled Pooh . In Estonia there is a punk / metal band called Winny Puhh . </P> <P> In the `` sport '' of Poohsticks , competitors drop sticks into a stream from a bridge and then wait to see whose stick will cross the finish line first . Though it began as a game played by Pooh and his friends in the book The House at Pooh Corner and later in the films , it has crossed over into the real world : a World Championship Poohsticks race takes place in Oxfordshire each year . Ashdown Forest in England where the Pooh stories are set is a popular tourist attraction , and includes the wooden Pooh Bridge where Pooh and Piglet invented Poohsticks . The Oxford University Winnie the Pooh Society was founded by undergraduates in 1982 . </P> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ McDowell , Edwin . `` Winnie Ille Pu Nearly XXV Years Later '' , The New York Times ( 18 November 1984 ) .

( later known as Rankin / Bass Productions ) and currently distributed by Universal Television . It first aired Sunday , December 6 , 1964 , on the NBC television network in the United States , and was sponsored by General Electric under the umbrella title of The General Electric Fantasy Hour . The special was based on the Johnny Marks song `` Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer '' which was itself based on the poem of the same name written in 1939 by Marks ' brother - in - law , Robert L. May . Since 1972 , the special has aired on CBS , with the network unveiling a high - definition , digitally remastered version of the program in 2005 . As with A Charlie Brown Christmas and How the Grinch Stole Christmas , Rudolph no longer airs just once annually , but several times during the Christmas and holiday season on CBS . Unlike other holiday specials that also air on several cable channels ( including Freeform ) , Rudolph only airs on CBS . It has been telecast every year since 1964 , making it the longest continuously running Christmas TV special in history . 2014 marked the 50th anniversary of the television special and a series of postage stamps featuring Rudolph was issued by the United States Postal Service on November 6 , 2014 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Cast </Li> <Li> 3 Production <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Aftermath </Li> <Li> 3.2 Production credits </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Different versions <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Original 1964 NBC broadcast edit </Li> <Li> 4.2 1965 -- 1997 telecasts </Li> <Li> 4.3 1998 -- CBS telecasts </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Home media </Li> <Li> 6 Soundtrack </Li> <Li> 7 Merchandise </Li> <Li> 8 Sequels </Li> <Li> 9 In popular culture <Ul> <Li> 9.1 Films by Corky Quakenbush </Li> <Li> 9.2 Uses in advertising </Li> <Li> 9.3 Other References </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 10 Copyright issues </Li> <Li> 11 See also </Li> <Li> 12 References </Li> <Li> 13 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> Sam the Snowman welcomes the viewers to Christmastown at the North Pole and introduces Santa and Mrs. Claus who live in a castle located north of the Christmas Tree Forest . Mrs. Claus fusses over Santa as she wants him to fatten up by Christmas Eve . Sam then recalls the year Christmas was almost cancelled due to a snowstorm and tells the story of how a very special reindeer saved the day . </P> <P> Donner , Santa 's lead reindeer , and his wife have given birth to their new baby fawn , Rudolph . Upon admiring him , they are surprised to see that Rudolph has been born with a glowing red nose . When Santa arrives , he warns Donner that Rudolph will not make the sleigh team because of his nose . Donner then decides to hide the nose by covering it with mud to allow Rudolph to fit in with all the other reindeer . </P> <P> Over Rudolph 's first year of life , Donner trains him in the basics of being a reindeer , including hiding from the Abominable Snow Monster of the North . Rudolph enters the reindeer games , competing against his fellow fawns . During flight practice , Rudolph meets a doe named Clarice who tells him he is cute , and kisses him , which causes an elated Rudolph to fly higher and faster than everyone else . However , while celebrating with the other bucks , Rudolph 's nose cover pops off , and the others react with fear , then scorn and finally rejection as Rudolph is kicked out of the Reindeer Games . Walking away , Rudolph walks with Clarice , who supports him , until her father firmly tells her to never have any more contacts with a red - nosed reindeer . Then , Rudolph meets up with Hermey , an elf who ran away from Santa 's workshop because he wanted to be a dentist instead of making toys , and they decide to run away together . The pair then meet a prospector named Yukon Cornelius , who has fruitlessly searched his whole life for silver and gold . After escaping the snow monster on an ice floe , the trio crash land on the Island of Misfit Toys where unloved or unwanted toys live with their ruler , a winged lion named King Moonracer . The king allows the group to stay one night on the island in exchange for returning to Christmastown to ask Santa to find homes for the unwanted toys . However , Rudolph leaves the island in the middle of the night on his own , fearing that his nose , which attracts the snow monster , will endanger his friends . </P> <P> Time goes by and Rudolph grows into adulthood ; he tries and fails to find a place to settle where he will be accepted despite his nose . Returning home , he finds that his parents and Clarice have been looking for him for months . He sets out once again to find them , only to discover that the snow monster has captured them . Rudolph tries to save Clarice from being eaten , but the monster hits him in the head with a stalactite , dazing him . Hermey and Yukon return to Christmastown and go to save Rudolph . Hermey , posing as a pig , lures the monster out of his cave and Yukon drops rocks on his head to knock him out . Hermey then pulls out all the monster 's teeth . Realizing Yukon drives the toothless ( and now terrified ) monster back , only to follow it over the cliff with all his pack dogs . Mourning Yukon 's presumed death , Rudolph , Hermey , Clarice , and the Donners return home where everyone apologizes to them . After hearing their story , Santa welcomes the group back to Christmastown , promises that he will find homes for the Misfit Toys , Hermey opens his own dentist 's office , and Clarice 's father apologizes for being so hard on Rudolph . Yukon then returns with a reformed snow monster ( Yukon notes that they bounce ) and demonstrates the beast 's ability to trim a Christmas tree . While everybody 's celebrating , Santa interrupts , grimly informing everyone that because of the storm , he is forced to cancel the Christmas trip . Santa is soon distracted by Rudolph 's red nose and realizes that its light could cut through the storm . He asks Rudolph to lead the sleigh and Rudolph agrees . The team then flies off to the island and pick up the toys . The special ends with Santa wishing the viewers a merry Christmas as he and Rudolph fly off into the night . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> Hermey and Rudolph <Ul> <Li> Billie Mae Richards voices Rudolph , a reindeer with strong mental ( he learns to speak shortly after birth ) and physical strength who is shunned for his nonconforming red nose , but later saves Christmas . </Li> <Li> Stan Francis voices : <Ul> <Li> Santa Claus , portrayed in the special as a moody , nervous and `` skinny Santa '' whose fears are only allayed when he conjures the idea of using Rudolph 's nose to lead the sleigh . </Li> <Li> King Moonracer , a winged lion who rules the entire Island of Misfit Toys . King Moonracer 's voice uses a reverb effect to distinguish it from Santa Claus . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Paul Kligman voices : <Ul> <Li> Donner , Rudolph 's father and Santa 's most prized reindeer . While he loves and accepts Rudolph , he shows great concern that society will reject him for his nose and tries to protect him by creating a nose cover . </Li> <Li> Comet , head coach of the Reindeer Games . </Li> <Li> Clarice 's unnamed father , who forbids Clarice from shaming the family by associating with a red - nosed reindeer . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Burl Ives voices Sam the Snowman , the narrator . </Li> <Li> Paul Soles voices Hermey , an elf who dreams of pursuing a career in dentistry and `` feels different '' from the other elves . He eventually is forced out and runs off with Rudolph . </Li> <Li> Janis Orenstein voices Clarice , a female reindeer who is the only one of Rudolph 's age to not reject him . She later joins Rudolph 's parents in the search party . </Li> <Li> Larry D. Mann voices Yukon Cornelius , the `` greatest prospector of the North '' who joins Rudolph and Hermey on their journey but never finds the silver and gold he seeks . </Li> <Li> Peg Dixon voices : <Ul> <Li> Mrs. Claus , a pushy wife who mocks her husband 's lack of appetite . </Li> <Li> Mrs. Donner , a loving and mostly submissive wife . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Carl Banas voices : <Ul> <Li> The Head Elf . For the Head Elf 's voice , Banas uses a meek Bill Thompson - like voice when speaking in front of Santa Claus , but turns into a ruthless boss with a voice similar to Mel Blanc 's Yosemite Sam or Cosmo Spacely when Santa is not around . </Li> <Li> Various Misfit Toys , including a Spotted Elephant , King Moonracer 's footman ; a bird that swims , a cowboy who rides an ostrich , a train with square wheels on his caboose , two teddy bears ( one on a bicycle and one with wings ) , a boat that does n't float , a set of clown nesting dolls with a wind - up mouse as the last one , a water pistol that shoots jelly , a plane that ca n't fly , a toy car that only drives in reverse , and a scooter with two wheels in front and one in back . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Alfie Scopp voices : <Ul> <Li> Fireball , who introduces Rudolph to the opposite sex , but later snubs Rudolph when his red nose is revealed . </Li> <Li> Charlie - In - The - Box , the island 's sentry . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Corinne Conley voices Dolly , a seemingly normal girl rag doll on the Island of Misfit Toys . Her misfit problem is never explained on the special ; many decades later , on NPR 's Wait Wait ... Do n't Tell Me ! news quiz show ( broadcast December 8 , 2007 ) , Rudolph 's producer , Arthur Rankin Jr. , noted that Dolly 's problem was psychological , caused by being abandoned by her owner ( named as Sue in the special ) and suffering depression from feeling uncared - for . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <P> The TV special , with the teleplay by Romeo Muller , introduced several new characters inspired by the song 's lyrics . Muller told an interviewer shortly before his death that he would have preferred to base the teleplay on May 's original book , but could not find a copy . Other than Burl Ives , all characters were portrayed by Canadian actors recorded at RCA studios in Toronto under the supervision of Bernard Cowan . </P> <P> After the script , concept designs and storyboards for Rudolph were done by Arthur Rankin , Jr. and his staff of artists at Rankin / Bass in New York City . The company 's trademark stop motion animation process , known as `` Animagic '' , was filmed at MOM Productions in Tokyo with supervision by Tadahito Mochinaga and associate direction by Kizo Nagashima . Besides Rudolph , Mochinaga and the rest of the Japanese puppet animation staff are also known for their partnership with Rankin / Bass on their other Animagic productions almost throughout the 1960s , from The New Adventures of Pinocchio , to Willy McBean a\n\nQuestion:\nwhen was rudolf the rednosed reindeer movie made\n", "answer": "1964"}

( later known as Rankin / Bass Productions ) and currently distributed by Universal Television . It first aired Sunday , December 6 , 1964 , on the NBC television network in the United States , and was sponsored by General Electric under the umbrella title of The General Electric Fantasy Hour . The special was based on the Johnny Marks song `` Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer '' which was itself based on the poem of the same name written in 1939 by Marks ' brother - in - law , Robert L. May . Since 1972 , the special has aired on CBS , with the network unveiling a high - definition , digitally remastered version of the program in 2005 . As with A Charlie Brown Christmas and How the Grinch Stole Christmas , Rudolph no longer airs just once annually , but several times during the Christmas and holiday season on CBS . Unlike other holiday specials that also air on several cable channels ( including Freeform ) , Rudolph only airs on CBS . It has been telecast every year since 1964 , making it the longest continuously running Christmas TV special in history . 2014 marked the 50th anniversary of the television special and a series of postage stamps featuring Rudolph was issued by the United States Postal Service on November 6 , 2014 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Cast </Li> <Li> 3 Production <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Aftermath </Li> <Li> 3.2 Production credits </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Different versions <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Original 1964 NBC broadcast edit </Li> <Li> 4.2 1965 -- 1997 telecasts </Li> <Li> 4.3 1998 -- CBS telecasts </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Home media </Li> <Li> 6 Soundtrack </Li> <Li> 7 Merchandise </Li> <Li> 8 Reception </Li> <Li> 9 Sequels </Li> <Li> 10 In popular culture <Ul> <Li> 10.1 Films by Corky Quakenbush </Li> <Li> 10.2 Uses in advertising </Li> <Li> 10.3 Other References </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 11 Copyright issues </Li> <Li> 12 See also </Li> <Li> 13 References </Li> <Li> 14 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> Sam the Snowman welcomes the viewers to Christmastown at the North Pole and introduces Santa and Mrs. Claus who live in a castle located north of the Christmas Tree Forest . Mrs. Claus fusses over Santa as she wants him to fatten up by Christmas Eve . Sam then recalls the year Christmas was almost cancelled due to a snowstorm and tells the story of how a very special reindeer saved the day . </P> <P> Donner , Santa 's lead reindeer , and his wife have given birth to their new baby fawn , Rudolph . Upon admiring him , they are surprised to see that Rudolph has been born with a glowing red nose . When Santa arrives , he warns Donner that Rudolph will not make the sleigh team because of his nose . Donner then decides to hide the nose by covering it with mud to allow Rudolph to fit in with all the other reindeer . </P> <P> Over Rudolph 's first year of life , Donner trains him in the basics of being a reindeer , including hiding from the Abominable Snow Monster of the North . Rudolph enters the reindeer games , competing against his fellow fawns . During flight practice , Rudolph meets a doe named Clarice who tells him he is cute , and kisses him , which causes an elated Rudolph to fly higher and faster than everyone else . However , while celebrating with the other bucks , Rudolph 's nose cover pops off , and the others react with fear , then scorn and finally rejection as Rudolph is kicked out of the Reindeer Games . Walking away , Rudolph walks with Clarice , who supports him , until her father firmly tells her to never have any more contacts with a red - nosed reindeer . Then , Rudolph meets up with Hermey , an elf who ran away from Santa 's workshop because he wanted to be a dentist instead of making toys , and they decide to run away together . The pair then meet a prospector named Yukon Cornelius , who has fruitlessly searched his whole life for silver and gold . After escaping the snow monster on an ice floe , the trio crash land on the Island of Misfit Toys where unloved or unwanted toys live with their ruler , a winged lion named King Moonracer . The king allows the group to stay one night on the island in exchange for returning to Christmastown to ask Santa to find homes for the unwanted toys . However , Rudolph leaves the island in the middle of the night on his own , fearing that his nose , which attracts the snow monster , will endanger his friends . </P> <P> Time goes by and Rudolph grows into adulthood ; he tries and fails to find a place to settle where he will be accepted despite his nose . Returning home , he finds that his parents and Clarice have been looking for him for months . He sets out once again to find them , only to discover that the snow monster has captured them . Rudolph tries to save Clarice from being eaten , but the monster hits him in the head with a stalactite , dazing him . Hermey and Yukon return to Christmastown and go to save Rudolph . Hermey , posing as a pig , lures the monster out of his cave and Yukon drops rocks on his head to knock him out . Hermey then pulls out all the monster 's teeth . Realizing Yukon drives the toothless ( and now terrified ) monster back , only to follow it over the cliff with all his pack dogs . Mourning Yukon 's presumed death , Rudolph , Hermey , Clarice , and the Donners return home where everyone apologizes to them . After hearing their story , Santa welcomes the group back to Christmastown , promises that he will find homes for the Misfit Toys , Hermey opens his own dentist 's office , and Clarice 's father apologizes for being so hard on Rudolph . Yukon then returns with a reformed snow monster ( Yukon notes that they bounce ) and demonstrates the beast 's ability to trim a Christmas tree . While everybody 's celebrating , Santa interrupts , grimly informing everyone that because of the storm , he is forced to cancel the Christmas trip . Santa is soon distracted by Rudolph 's red nose and realizes that its light could cut through the storm . He asks Rudolph to lead the sleigh and Rudolph agrees . The team then flies off to the island and pick up the toys . The special ends with Santa wishing the viewers a merry Christmas as he and Rudolph fly off into the night . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> Hermey and Rudolph <Ul> <Li> Billie Mae Richards voices Rudolph , a reindeer with strong mental ( he learns to speak shortly after birth ) and physical strength who is shunned for his nonconforming red nose , but later saves Christmas . </Li> <Li> Stan Francis voices : <Ul> <Li> Santa Claus , portrayed in the special as a moody , nervous and `` skinny Santa '' whose fears are only allayed when he conjures the idea of using Rudolph 's nose to lead the sleigh . </Li> <Li> King Moonracer , a winged lion who rules the entire Island of Misfit Toys . King Moonracer 's voice uses a reverb effect to distinguish it from Santa Claus . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Paul Kligman voices : <Ul> <Li> Donner , Rudolph 's father and Santa 's most prized reindeer . While he loves and accepts Rudolph , he shows great concern that society will reject him for his nose and tries to protect him by creating a nose cover . </Li> <Li> Comet , head coach of the Reindeer Games . </Li> <Li> Clarice 's unnamed father , who forbids Clarice from shaming the family by associating with a red - nosed reindeer . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Burl Ives voices Sam the Snowman , the narrator . </Li> <Li> Paul Soles voices Hermey , an elf who dreams of pursuing a career in dentistry and `` feels different '' from the other elves . He eventually is forced out and runs off with Rudolph . </Li> <Li> Janis Orenstein voices Clarice , a female reindeer who is the only one of Rudolph 's age to not reject him . She later joins Rudolph 's parents in the search party . </Li> <Li> Larry D. Mann voices Yukon Cornelius , the `` greatest prospector of the North '' who joins Rudolph and Hermey on their journey but never finds the silver and gold he seeks . </Li> <Li> Peg Dixon voices : <Ul> <Li> Mrs. Claus , a pushy wife who mocks her husband 's lack of appetite . </Li> <Li> Mrs. Donner , a loving and mostly submissive wife . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Carl Banas voices : <Ul> <Li> The Head Elf . For the Head Elf 's voice , Banas uses a meek Bill Thompson - like voice when speaking in front of Santa Claus , but turns into a ruthless boss with a voice similar to Mel Blanc 's Yosemite Sam or Cosmo Spacely when Santa is not around . </Li> <Li> Various Misfit Toys , including a Spotted Elephant , King Moonracer 's footman ; a bird that swims , a cowboy who rides an ostrich , a train with square wheels on his caboose , two teddy bears ( one on a bicycle and one with wings ) , a boat that does n't float , a set of clown nesting dolls with a wind - up mouse as the last one , a water pistol that shoots jelly , a plane that ca n't fly , a toy car that only drives in reverse , and a scooter with two wheels in front and one in back . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Alfie Scopp voices : <Ul> <Li> Fireball , who introduces Rudolph to the opposite sex , but later snubs Rudolph when his red nose is revealed . </Li> <Li> Charlie - In - The - Box , the island 's sentry . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Corinne Conley voices Dolly , a seemingly normal girl rag doll on the Island of Misfit Toys . Her misfit problem is never explained on the special ; many decades later , on NPR 's Wait Wait ... Do n't Tell Me ! news quiz show ( broadcast December 8 , 2007 ) , Rudolph 's producer , Arthur Rankin Jr. , noted that Dolly 's problem was psychological , caused by being abandoned by her owner ( named as Sue in the special ) and suffering depression from feeling uncared - for . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <P> The TV special , with the teleplay by Romeo Muller , introduced several new characters inspired by the song 's lyrics . Muller told an interviewer shortly before his death that he would have preferred to base the teleplay on May 's original book , but could not find a copy . Other than Burl Ives , all characters were portrayed by Canadian actors recorded at RCA studios in Toronto under the supervision of Bernard Cowan . </P> <P> After the script , concept designs and storyboards for Rudolph were done by Arthur Rankin , Jr. and his staff of artists at Rankin / Bass in New York City . The company 's trademark stop motion animation process , known as `` Animagic '' , was filmed at MOM Productions in Tokyo with supervision by Tadahito Mochinaga and associate direction by Kizo Nagashima . Besides Rudolph , Mochinaga and the rest of the Japanese puppet animation staff are also known for their partnership with Rankin / Bass on their other Animagic productions almost throughout the 1960s , from The New Adventures of Pinocchio , to Willy McBean and his Magic Machine , to The Daydreamer and Mad Monster Party ? . </P> <H3> Aftermath ( edit ) </H3> <P> Since those involved with the production had no idea of the future value of the stop - motion puppet figures used in the production , many were not preserved . Rankin claimed in 2007 to be in possession of an original Rudolph figure . Nine other puppets -- including Santa and young Rudolph -- were given to a secretary , who gave them to family members . Eventually seven were discarded . In 2005 , the remaining two puppets of Rudolph and Santa were appraised on Antiques Roadshow ; the episode aired in 2006 on PBS . At that time , their appraised value was between $8,000 and $10,000 . The puppets had been damaged through years of rough handling by children and storage in an attic . Toy aficionado Kevin Kriess bought Santa and Rudolph in 2005 ; in 2007 , he had both puppets restored by Screen Novelties , a Los Angeles - based collective of film directors specializ\n", "answer": "1964"}
{"content": "Answer the question based on the information provided in the document given below. The answer should be a number\n\nDocument:\nurity Appeals Tribunal -- SSAT </Li> <Li> 9.2. 2 The AAT and the Courts </Li> <Li> 9.2. 3 The Ombudsman </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 10 See also </Li> <Li> 11 References </Li> <Li> 12 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> Prior to 1900 in Australia , charitable assistance from benevolent societies , sometimes with financial contributions from the authorities , was the primary means of relief for people not able to support themselves . The 1890s economic depression and the rise of the trade unions and the Labor parties during this period led to a movement for welfare reform . </P> <P> In 1900 , the states of New South Wales and Victoria enacted legislation introducing non-contributory pensions for those aged 65 and over . Queensland legislated a similar system in 1907 before the Australian labor Commonwealth government led by Andrew Fisher introduced a national aged pension under the Invalid and Old - Aged Pensions Act 1908 . A national invalid diasbility pension was started in 1910 , and a national maternity allowance was introduced in 1912 . </P> <P> During the Second World War , Australia under a labor government created a welfare state by enacting national schemes for : child endowment in 1941 ( superseding the 1927 New South Wales scheme ) ; a widows ' pension in 1942 ( superseding the New South Wales 1926 scheme ) ; a wife 's allowance in 1943 ; additional allowances for the children of pensioners in 1943 ; and unemployment , sickness , and special benefits in 1945 ( superseding the Queensland 1923 scheme ) . </P> <P> The Social Services Legislation Amendment ( Welfare Reform ) Bill 2017 has changed several aspects of social security in Australia , and has been given assent to as of 11 April 2018 . It includes a demerit - point system for not meeting welfare obligations . </P> <H2> Contemporary welfare attitudes ( edit ) </H2> <P> Current attitudes toward welfare in Australia can be separated into support for the welfare system and support for welfare recipients . A multivariate analysis using canonical correlation analysis identified five distinct profiles of welfare attitudes and socio - demographic characteristics . The main attitude cluster was one toward support for the welfare system and welfare recipients . Having receiving government welfare in the past strongly predicted a person supporting the welfare system and its beneficiaries . The next most prominent attitude profile was summarized as ' the welfare system is good but the people on it are lazy and dependent ' . This attitude profile was found among people receiving welfare payments that were either normative ( e.g. the age pension ) or where there is little expectation that a person will return to work ( e.g. disability support pension ) . Overall , Australian 's hold more negative attitudes toward welfare recipients than they do the welfare system . People with a history of receiving unemployment benefits tend to have more negative welfare attitudes if they live in areas where other community members have more negative attitudes . </P> <H2> Legal framework ( edit ) </H2> <P> Social security payments and other benefits are currently made available under the following acts of parliament : </P> <Ul> <Li> Social Security Act 1991 </Li> <Li> A New Tax System ( Family Assistance ) Act 1999 </Li> <Li> Student Assistance Act 1973 </Li> <Li> Paid Parental Leave Act 2010 </Li> </Ul> <H2> Payments under the Social Security Act and the student Assistance Act ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> ABSTUDY -- offers a range of allowances to assist Indigenous students and New Apprentices . </Li> <Li> Age Pension -- for people planning for retirement or who are already retired aged 65 years and over . </Li> <Li> Assistance for Isolated Children -- for families with a child who can not attend school locally because of distance or special needs . </Li> <Li> Austudy Payment -- for full - time students and New Apprentices aged 25 years or over . </Li> <Li> Carer Allowance -- for people who care for minors 16 -- 17 and adults over 18 years with a disability . </Li> <Li> Carer Allowance ( Child ) -- for people who care for a child under 16 years with a disability . </Li> <Li> Carer Payment -- for people who provide full - time care for someone with a disability </Li> <Li> Disability Support Pension -- for people unable to work for 2 years due to illness , injury or disability . </Li> <Li> Double Orphan Pension -- for people who are raising children who have lost both parents . </Li> <Li> Maternity Payment -- for help with those extra costs after the birth of a new baby . </Li> <Li> Newstart Allowance -- for people who are looking for employment . </Li> <Li> Parenting Payment -- for parents or guardians to help with the cost of raising children under 6 for partnered parents and under 8 for sole parents . </Li> <Li> Pensioner Education Supplement -- for people on pensions with education expenses . </Li> <Li> Special Benefit -- for people who are in financial hardship , have no way of supporting themselves and are not entitled to another payment ( normally due to residency requirements ) </Li> <Li> Youth Allowance -- for full - time students or New Apprentices aged 15 ( under some circumstances ) 16 to 24 and people aged under 21 who are undertaking job search or a combination of approved activities . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Income support ( edit ) </H3> <P> All Centrelink income support payments are payable fortnightly , usually by direct deposit required into the recipient 's bank account . They are also subject to a means test which calculates the recipient ( and their partner 's ) fortnightly income and assets and affects the rate of their payment accordingly . As such , people on lower incomes may be entitled to part - payment of their allowance ( subject to other qualification requirements ) . The assessment of income and assets varies greatly between different social security payments and the effect that income and assets have on each payment differs in that they have different income thresholds ( i.e. how much income one can earn before it affects their payment ) and different taper rates ( the amount the payment drops by per dollar above these thresholds ) . </P> <P> An individual may be precluded from claiming any of income support payments listed below for a certain number of weeks following receipt of a lump sum compensation payment , made wholly or partly in respect of lost earnings or lost capacity to earn resulting from personal injury ( often received in settlement of a Workers ' Compensation claim ) . The number of weeks for which the preclusion period applies to an individual is proportional the size of the lump sum payment they received . Centrelink has a discretion to reduce the duration of the preclusion period if it is satisfied that there exist special circumstances that make an individual 's case out of the ordinary : for example , extreme financial hardship . </P> Age pension ( edit ) <P> The Age Pension was the first payment made by the Commonwealth Government , dating back to 1909 . It is available to persons aged 65 years and over . The eligibility age is currently being progressively increased to a cap of 67 years old . Except for the mandatory superannuation scheme , workers do not contribute to a pension or insurance scheme in Australia , unlike pension schemes in many other countries . Taxpayer - funded pensions are means tested . </P> Newstart Allowance ( edit ) <P> Newstart Allowance is an unemployment benefit paid to unemployed people aged 22 to 64 . To be eligible , a person must apply for the benefit and be actively seeking work . On 1 July 1991 , it replaced the Unemployment Benefit ( UB ) which had been unchanged since 1945 . It was part of a government reform called Newstart - the Active Employment Strategy . </P> <P> It is paid on the basis of a ' mutual agreement ' between the customer and Centrelink , where Centrelink will continue to pay fortnightly payments to the customer for so long as the customer attempts to find employment and fulfills the mutual obligation requirements . These mutual agreements are negotiated between Centrelink , the job seeker and their Job Services Australia provider or Disability Employment Services provider , and are recorded into an Employment Pathway Plan or `` EPP '' . Activities to which a job seeker may have to agree , in order to continue receiving the Newstart Allowance , include applying for a specific number of jobs ( usually ten ) per fortnight and recording these applications in a Centrelink issued diary , undertaking vocational education or training , paid work experience , participation in a labour market program or Work for the Dole project , and other activities , such as voluntary work if considered appropriate by Centrelink . For example , more elderly customers who have been made redundant and are approaching the age pension age , and who may face considerable difficulties re-entering the labour market , are often permitted to fulfil their plan by engaging in voluntary activities alone . A job seeker has to nominate and engage in one activity ( for example , either a vocational education activity or Work for the Dole activity ) in any one mutual obligation period ( lasting six months at a time ) . </P> <P> Clients are not expected to engage in the more intensive of these activities as soon as their receipt of the allowance commences . The amount of activity required on behalf of the client in order to continue receiving his / her benefit is usually staggered as follows : </P> <Ul> <Li> Ordinarily , during the first three months of unemployment , a job seeker has no other obligations but to submit a fortnightly Application For Payment form at the local office . The form asks the applicant a number of questions about his / her circumstances and for the basic details of four positions for which the job seeker applied in the last fortnight . Customers may also be required to make up to 10 ' Job Search Contacts ' per fortnight ( dependent on the local labour market and their personal circumstances ) and record the details of these jobs within a specifically issued Job Seeker Diary for a given period of time . The job seeker then takes the Application For Payment form personally to the local Centrelink Office . He will then attend a short one - on - one interview with a Centrelink officer . The interview is usually for the purposes of checking that the application form is in order and that the applicant is aware of any appointments that may need to be attended , and obligations that may need to be met . The client at this stage also has the opportunity to talk to a Centrelink officer about any problems the client may be encountering without having to make a prior appointment first . </Li> <Li> If after an initial three months of unemployment , during which the job seeker has only to hand in the fortnightly application form and record the Job Seeker Diary , the client remains unemployed ; the client will be required to attend appointments with a Job Services Australia provider whose responsibility it is to assist the client to re-enter the work force . The job seeker also has to attend a two - week training course which focusses on job searching skills such as writing resumes and attending interviews . </Li> <Li> If the customer remains unemployed for twelve months , they are then subject to the Work Experience Phase of their Employment Pathway Plan , which consists of more intensive assistance involving the activities listed above , such as , Work for the Dole , accredited study , part - time work , volunteer work or a combination of these . A Job Services Australia provider may require a Newstart recipient to do voluntary work ( up to 15 hours a week ) , for which clients receive a supplement to their benefit of $20.80 per fortnight . The supplement is also paid to Work for the Dole participants . They must also continue to apply for 4 or more positions at the same time to meet their mutual obligations . </Li> <Li> If the client becomes long - term unemployed ( 24 months or longer ) , the client 's activity requirements will usually consist of another Work Experience Phase style activity for six months in any twelve - month period . ( Australia 's unemployment benefits do not have a time limit : it is , in theory , possible to remain on unemployment benefits for the whole of one 's working life ) . </Li> </Ul> <P> Newstart Allowance rates are adjusted on 20 March and 20 September each year . As of September 2013 , the basic Newstart rate for a single unemployed person without children is A $501 per fortnight . However , this basic rate does not include supplement payments which can include Rent Assistance of up to A $121.00 per fortnight , and other supplements , such as Pharmaceutical Allowance , Telephone Allowance , Remote Area Allowance , Training Supplement and the Work For The Dole Supplement ; which are paid depending on personal circumstances and activity . Rates differ for married couples , registered relationships or de facto couples ( including same sex or opposite sex couples ) and persons with children . Despite significant increases in the cost of living , the increases to the Newstart Allowance have not kept pace with inflation . The initial income threshold has only risen from 1987 's $60 to $62 in 2000 where it remains today . </P> <P> On 1 March 2010 , the Australian Government introduced changes to Disability Employment Services . Multiple existing programs were streamlined into two clearly distinct programs , making assessment and referral processes less complex . </P> <P> All eligible job seekers with disability have access to individually tailored services which meet their needs including capacity building , training , work experience and other ' interventions ' to help participants obtain and maintain suitable employment . DES providers support and manage a participant 's condition in the workplace , along with providing ongoing support in the workplace for as long as it is required . </P> <P> New compliance rules were introduced on 1 July 2011 , dealing with client meetings with a DES provider and payment suspension .

The object is moved in small increments between individually photographed frames , creating the illusion of movement when the series of frames is played as a fast sequence . Dolls with movable joints or clay figures are often used in stop motion for their ease of repositioning . Stop motion animation using plasticine is called clay animation or `` clay - mation '' . Not all stop motion requires figures or models ; many stop motion films can involve using humans , household appliances and other things for comedic effect . Stop motion can also use sequential drawing in a similar manner to traditional animation , such as a flip book . Stop motion using humans is sometimes referred to as pixilation or pixilate animation . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Terminology </Li> <Li> 2 History <Ul> <Li> 2.1 1960s and 1970s </Li> <Li> 2.2 1980s to present </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Variations of stop motion <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Stereoscopic stop motion </Li> <Li> 3.2 Go motion </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Comparison to computer - generated imagery </Li> <Li> 5 Stop motion in television and movies </Li> <Li> 6 Stop motion in other media </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Terminology ( edit ) </H2> <P> The term `` stop motion '' , related to the animation technique , is often spelled with a hyphen , `` stop - motion '' . Both orthographical variants , with and without the hyphen , are correct , but the hyphenated one has , in addition , a second meaning , not related to animation or cinema : `` a device for automatically stopping a machine or engine when something has gone wrong '' ( The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary , 1993 edition ) . </P> <P> Stop motion is often confused with the time lapse technique , where still photographs of a live surrounding are taken at regular intervals and combined into a continuous film . Time lapse is a technique whereby the frequency at which film frames are captured is much lower than that used to view the sequence . When played at normal speed , time appears to be moving faster . </P> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> Play media The Sculptor 's Nightmare Play media Segment from the 1925 film The Lost World animated by Willis O'Brien <P> Stop motion animation has a long history in film . It was often used to show objects moving as if by magic . The first instance of the stop motion technique can be credited to Albert E. Smith and J. Stuart Blackton for Vitagraph 's The Humpty Dumpty Circus ( 1897 ) , in which a toy circus of acrobats and animals comes to life . In 1902 , the film Fun in a Bakery Shop used the stop trick technique in the `` lightning sculpting '' sequence . French trick film maestro Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s used stop motion animation once to produce moving title - card letters in one of his short films , and a number of his special effects are based on stop motion photography . In 1907 , The Haunted Hotel is a new stop motion film by J. Stuart Blackton , and was a resounding success when released . Segundo de Chom\u00f3n ( 1871 -- 1929 ) , from Spain , released El Hotel El\u00e9ctrico later that same year , and used similar techniques as the Blackton film . In 1908 , A Sculptor 's Welsh Rarebit Nightmare was released , as was The Sculptor 's Nightmare , a film by Billy Bitzer . Italian animator Rom\u00e9o Bossetti impressed audiences with his object animation tour - de-force , The Automatic Moving Company in 1912 . The great European stop motion pioneer was Wladyslaw Starewicz ( 1892 -- 1965 ) , who animated The Beautiful Lukanida ( 1910 ) , The Battle of the Stag Beetles ( 1910 ) , The Ant and the Grasshopper ( 1911 ) . </P> <P> One of the earliest clay animation films was Modelling Extraordinary , which impressed audiences in 1912 . December 1916 brought the first of Willie Hopkins ' 54 episodes of `` Miracles in Mud '' to the big screen . Also in December 1916 , the first woman animator , Helena Smith Dayton , began experimenting with clay stop motion . She would release her first film in 1917 , an adaptation of William Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet . </P> <P> In the turn of the century , there was another well known animator known as Willis O ' Brien ( known by others as O'bie ) . His work on The Lost World ( 1925 ) is well known , but he is most admired for his work on King Kong ( 1933 ) , a milestone of his films made possible by stop motion animation . </P> <P> O'Brien's protege and eventual successor in Hollywood was Ray Harryhausen . After learning under O'Brien on the film Mighty Joe Young ( 1949 ) , Harryhausen would go on to create the effects for a string of successful and memorable films over the next three decades . These included The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms ( 1953 ) , It Came from Beneath the Sea ( 1955 ) , Jason and the Argonauts ( 1963 ) , The Golden Voyage of Sinbad ( 1973 ) and Clash of the Titans ( 1981 ) . </P> <P> In a 1940 promotional film , Autolite , an automotive parts supplier , featured stop motion animation of its products marching past Autolite factories to the tune of Franz Schubert 's Military March . An abbreviated version of this sequence was later used in television ads for Autolite , especially those on the 1950s CBS program Suspense , which Autolite sponsored . </P> <H3> 1960s and 1970s ( edit ) </H3> <P> In the 1960s and 1970s , independent clay animator Eliot Noyes Jr. refined the technique of `` free - form '' clay animation with his Oscar - nominated 1965 film Clay ( or the Origin of Species ) . Noyes also used stop motion to animate sand lying on glass for his musical animated film Sandman ( 1975 ) . </P> <P> Stop motion was used by Rankin / Bass Productions on some of their television programs and feature films including The New Adventures of Pinocchio ( 1960 -- 1961 ) , Willy McBean and his Magic Machine ( 1963 , 1965 ) and most notably seasonal / holiday favorites like Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer ( 1964 ) , Mad Monster Party ? ( 1966 , 1967 ) , The Little Drummer Boy ( 1968 ) , Santa Claus is Comin ' to Town ( 1970 ) and Here Comes Peter Cottontail ( 1971 ) . Under the name of `` Animagic '' , the stop motion works of Rankin / Bass were supervised by Tadahito Mochinaga at his MOM Production in Tokyo , Japan . </P> <P> In 1975 , filmmaker and clay animation experimenter Will Vinton joined with sculptor Bob Gardiner to create an experimental film called Closed Mondays which became the world 's first stop motion film to win an Oscar . Will Vinton followed with several other successful short film experiments including The Great Cognito , Creation , and Rip Van Winkle which were each nominated for Academy Awards . In 1977 , Vinton made a documentary about this process and his style of animation which he dubbed `` claymation '' ; he titled the documentary Claymation . Soon after this documentary , the term was trademarked by Vinton to differentiate his team 's work from others who had been , or were beginning to do , `` clay animation '' . While the word has stuck and is often used to describe clay animation and stop motion , it remains a trademark owned currently by Laika Entertainment , Inc . Twenty clay - animation episodes featuring the clown Mr. Bill were a feature of Saturday Night Live , starting from a first appearance in February 1976 . </P> <P> At very much the same time in the UK , Peter Lord and David Sproxton formed Aardman Animations . In 1976 they created the character Morph who appeared as an animated side - kick to the TV presenter Tony Hart on his BBC TV programme Take Hart . The five - inch - high presenter was made from a traditional British modelling clay called Plasticine . In 1977 they started on a series of animated films , again using modelling clay , but this time made for a more adult audience . The soundtrack for Down and Out was recorded in a Salvation Army Hostel and Plasticine puppets were animated to dramatise the dialogue . A second film , also for the BBC followed in 1978 . A TV series The Amazing Adventures of Morph was aired in 1980 . </P> <P> Sand - coated puppet animation was used in the Oscar - winning 1977 film The Sand Castle , produced by Dutch - Canadian animator Co Hoedeman . Hoedeman was one of dozens of animators sheltered by the National Film Board of Canada , a Canadian government film arts agency that had supported animators for decades . A pioneer of refined multiple stop motion films under the NFB banner was Norman McLaren , who brought in many other animators to create their own creatively controlled films . Notable among these are the pinscreen animation films of Jacques Drouin , made with the original pinscreen donated by Alexandre Alexeieff and Claire Parker . </P> <P> Italian stop motion films include Quaq Quao ( 1978 ) , by Francesco Misseri , which was stop motion with origami , The Red and the Blue and the clay animation kittens Mio and Mao . Other European productions included a stop motion - animated series of Tove Jansson 's The Moomins ( from 1979 , often referred to as `` The Fuzzy Felt Moomins '' ) , produced by Film Polski and Jupiter Films . </P> <P> One of the main British Animation teams , John Hardwick and Bob Bura , were the main animators in many early British TV shows , and are famous for their work on the Trumptonshire trilogy . </P> <P> Disney experimented with several stop motion techniques by hiring independent animator - director Mike Jittlov to do the first stop motion animation of Mickey Mouse toys ever produced for a short sequence called Mouse Mania , part of a TV special commemorating Mickey Mouse 's 50th Anniversary called Mickey 's 50 in 1978 . Jittlov again produced some impressive multi-technique stop motion animation a year later for a 1979 Disney special promoting their release of the feature film The Black Hole . Titled Major Effects , Jittlov 's work stood out as the best part of the special . Jittlov released his footage the following year to 16mm film collectors as a short film titled The Wizard of Speed and Time , along with four of his other short multi-technique animated films , most of which eventually evolved into his own feature - length film of the same title . Effectively demonstrating almost all animation techniques , as well as how he produced them , the film was released to theaters in 1987 and to video in 1989 . </P> <H3> 1980s to present ( edit ) </H3> Stefano Bessoni , Italian filmmaker , illustrator and stop - motion animator working on Gallows Songs ( 2014 ) <P> In the 1970s and 1980s , Industrial Light & Magic often used stop motion model animation for films such as the original Star Wars trilogy : the chess sequence in Star Wars , the Tauntauns and AT - AT walkers in The Empire Strikes Back , and the AT - ST walkers in Return of the Jedi were all stop motion animation , some of it using the Go films .

Neil suggested that by making a vehicle that is longer , wider and taller , the company had forsaken the inner logic of the brand : excellent handling in a tiny size . In a March 2011 review titled What Part of ' Mini ' Did You Not Grasp , BMW ? , Neil wrote `` with the Countryman , tiny sharks have been jumped . '' The Countryman became Mini 's second most popular model after the iconic Hardtop . The very first year of production it sold almost 50 % more units than the Clubman , Convertible , and Coupe added together . Almost 1 out of every 3 vehicles Mini sold in 2011 was a Countryman ( U.S. market ) . This trend continued through 2012 also with almost 1 in 3 MINIs sold again being a Countryman - both in the US and globally . By the end of 2013 the Countryman was 31 % of total U.S. sales for the Mini brand . </P> <H3> 2014 update ( r60 lci ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> A minor facelift to the Countryman was unveiled at the 2014 New York International Auto Show . Changes include a new structure of the hexagonal radiator grill , underride guard elements for the Cooper S Countryman ALL4 and additional body colour options . It went on sale in July 2014 . All variants carried over .

Originally , Western Sephardic Jews settling in England in the 17th century would have prepared fried fish in a manner similar to Pescado frito , which is coated in a flour . Battered fish is first coated in flour then dipped into a batter consisting of flour mixed with liquid , usually water but sometimes beer . Some newer modifications to the recipe may have cornflour added , and instead of beer sometimes soda water is added . In 1860 , the first fish and chip shop was opened in London by Joseph Malin who sold `` fish fried in the Jewish fashion '' . </P> <P> Fish and chips became a stock meal among the working classes in England as a consequence of the rapid development of trawl fishing in the North Sea , and the development of railways which connected the ports to major industrial cities during the second half of the 19th century , so that fresh fish could be rapidly transported to the heavily populated areas . </P> <P> Deep - fried chips ( slices or pieces of potato ) as a dish may have first appeared in England in about the same period : the Oxford English Dictionary notes as its earliest usage of `` chips '' in this sense the mention in Charles Dickens ' A Tale of Two Cities ( 1859 ) : `` Husky chips of potatoes , fried with some reluctant drops of oil '' . </P> <P> The modern fish - and - chip shop ( `` chippy '' or `` chipper '' in modern British slang ) originated in the United Kingdom , although outlets selling fried food occurred commonly throughout Europe . Early fish - and - chip shops had only very basic facilities . Usually these consisted principally of a large cauldron of cooking fat , heated by a coal fire . The fish - and - chip shop later evolved into a fairly standard format , with the food served , in paper wrappings , to queuing customers , over a counter in front of the fryers . By 1910 , there were more than 25,000 fish and chip shops across the country , and in the 1920s there were more than 35,000 shops . As a boy Alfred Hitchcock lived above a fish and chip shop in London , which was the family business . According to Professor John Walton , author of Fish and Chips and the British Working Class , the British government made safeguarding supplies of fish and chips during World War I a priority : `` The cabinet knew it was vital to keep families on the home front in good heart , unlike the German regime that failed to keep its people well fed '' . In 1928 , Harry Ramsden opened his fish and chip shop in Guiseley , West Yorkshire . On a single day in 1952 , the shop served 10,000 portions of fish and chips , earning a place in the Guinness Book Of Records . In George Orwell 's The Road to Wigan Pier ( 1937 ) , documenting his experience of working class life in the north of England , the author considered fish and chips chief among the ' home comforts ' which acted as a panacea to the working classes . During World War II , fish and chips remained one of the few foods in the United Kingdom not subject to rationing . Prime Minister Winston Churchill referred to the combination of fish and chips as `` the good companions '' . John Lennon enjoyed his fish and chips -- a staple of the working class -- smothered in ketchup . </P> <P> British fish and chips were originally served in a wrapping of old newspapers but this practice has now largely ceased , with plain paper , cardboard , or plastic being used instead . In the United Kingdom , the Fish Labelling Regulations 2003 and in Ireland the European Communities ( Labelling of Fishery and Aquaculture Products ) Regulations 2003 respectively enact directive 2065 / 2001 / EC , and generally mean that `` fish '' must be sold with the particular commercial name or species named ; so , for example , `` cod and chips '' now appears on menus rather than the more vague `` fish and chips '' . In the United Kingdom the Food Standards Agency guidance excludes caterers from this ; but several local Trading Standards authorities and others do say it can not be sold merely as `` fish and chips '' . </P> <H3> United Kingdom ( edit ) </H3> A blue plaque in Oldham ( Greater Manchester ) in England marking the 1860s origins of the fish and chip shop and the fast food industry <P> A prominent meal in British culture , the dish became popular in wider circles in London and South East England in the middle of the 19th century : Charles Dickens mentions a `` fried fish warehouse '' in Oliver Twist , first published in 1838 , while in the north of England a trade in deep - fried chipped potatoes developed . The first chip shop stood on the present site of Oldham 's Tommyfield Market . It remains unclear exactly when and where these two trades combined to become the fish - and - chip shop industry we know . A Jewish immigrant , Joseph Malin , opened the first recorded combined fish - and - chip shop in London in 1860 or in 1865 ; a Mr Lees pioneered the concept in the North of England , in Mossley , in 1863 . </P> <P> The concept of a fish restaurant , as opposed to take - away , was introduced by Samuel Isaacs ( born 1856 in Whitechapel , London ; died 1939 in Brighton , Sussex ) who ran a thriving wholesale and retail fish business throughout London and the South of England in the latter part of the 19th century . Isaacs ' first restaurant opened in London in 1896 serving fish and chips , bread and butter , and tea for nine pence , and its popularity ensured a rapid expansion of the chain . </P> <P> The restaurants were carpeted , had table service , tablecloths , flowers , china and cutlery , and made the trappings of upmarket dining affordable to the working classes for the first time . They were located in Tottenham Court Road , St Pancras , The Strand , Hoxton , Shoreditch , Brixton and other London districts , as well as Clacton , Brighton , Ramsgate , Margate and other seaside resorts in southern England . Menus were expanded in the early 20th century to include meat dishes and other variations as their popularity grew to a total of thirty restaurants . Sam Isaacs ' trademark was the phrase `` This is the Plaice '' , combined with a picture of the punned - upon fish in question . A glimpse of the old Brighton restaurant at No. 1 Marine Parade can be seen in the background of Norman Wisdom 's 1955 film One Good Turn just as Wisdom / Pitkin runs onto the seafront ; this is now the site of a Harry Ramsden 's fish and chips restaurant . A blue plaque at Oldham 's Tommyfield Market marks the first chips fried in England in 1860 , and the origin of the fish and chip shop and fast food industries . </P> Fish and chips traditionally wrapped in white paper and newspaper <P> Dundee City Council claims that chips were first sold by a Belgian immigrant , Edward De Gernier , in the city 's Greenmarket in the 1870s . </P> <P> In Edinburgh , a combination of Gold Star brown sauce and water or malt vinegar , known as `` sauce '' , or more specifically as `` chippy sauce '' , has great popularity . </P> <H3> Fish & chips Awards ( edit ) </H3> <P> The annual National Fish & Chips Awards were set up in the UK in 1988 . The 30th Annual Fish & Chips Awards ceremony was attended by Norwegian ambassador to the UK Mona Juul . </P> <H3> Ireland ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Irish cuisine <P> In Ireland , the first fish and chips were sold by an Italian immigrant , Giuseppe Cervi , who mistakenly stepped off an North American - bound ship at Queenstown ( now Cobh ) in County Cork in the 1880s and walked all the way to Dublin . He started by selling fish and chips outside Dublin pubs from a handcart . He then found a permanent spot in Great Brunswick Street ( now Pearse Street ) . His wife Palma would ask customers `` Uno di questa , uno di quella ? '' This phrase ( meaning `` one of this , one of that '' ) entered the vernacular in Dublin as `` one and one '' , which is still a way of referring to fish and chips in the city . </P> <H3> New Zealand ( edit ) </H3> Main article : New Zealand cuisine <P> Fish and chips are the most popular takeaway food in New Zealand . Food historians have been unable to pinpoint exactly when the meal became an established part of New Zealand cuisine but all recognise that the first fish and chips shops were introduced by British settlers before World War I. During the 20th century , nearly every small town and suburb in New Zealand had at least one fish - and - chip shop . As in Britain , Friday night has been the traditional night to eat fish . </P> <P> Traditionally , fish and chips were served in wrappings of newspaper . With the decline of the newspaper industry , this has become less common . </P> <P> In 1980 , four up - and - coming Labour Party politicians , including David Lange , were nicknamed the `` Fish and Chip Brigade '' due to a picture published at the time with the group eating fish and chips . </P> <H3> United States ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Cuisine of the United States <P> In the United States , the dish is most commonly sold as `` fish and chips '' , except in Upstate New York and Wisconsin and other parts of the Northeast and Upper Midwest , where this dish would be called a fish fry .

The answer should be a number\n\nDocument:\nInguinal hernia surgery - wikipedia <H1> Inguinal hernia surgery </H1> Jump to : navigation , search Surgical repair of a right inguinal hernia <P> Inguinal hernia surgery refers to a surgical operation for the correction of an inguinal hernia . Surgery is not generally advised in most cases if the hernia produces no symptoms ; watchful waiting being the recommended option . In particular , elective surgery is no longer recommended for the treatment of minimally symptomatic hernias due to the significant risk ( > 10 % ) of chronic pain ( Post herniorraphy pain syndrome ) and the low risk of incarceration ( ca . 2 % per year ) . However , considering that the `` elective ( inguinal ) hernia surgery offers value - for - money '' and the `` symptoms will likely progress and an operation will be needed eventually '' , `` surgery might be superior to `` watchful waiting '' `` . </P> <P> As general advice in surgery , the choice of the surgeon and hospital are more important than the choice of a particular surgical technique or material . High - volume hospitals and surgeons have better outcomes . </P> <P> In particular for inguinal hernias , surgeons with more than 200 interventions per year are preferable . Regarding the surgical technique for inguinal hernias , laparoscopic is better than open repair . Anyway , an expert surgeon in open surgery is preferable to a non-expert one in laparoscopic surgery . In particular , `` recurrence rates with laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair are highly operator dependent '' . The learning curve for laparoscopic techniques has been estimated to be 50 - 100 interventions . However , at least the totally extra-peritoneal ( TEP ) hernia repair is safe when performed by supervised senior surgical trainees . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Mesh repairs <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Open repair ( Lichtenstein , Shouldice , Bassini ) </Li> <Li> 1.2 Laparoscopic repair </Li> <Li> 1.3 Meshes <Ul> <Li> 1.3. 1 Permanent mesh <Ul> <Li> 1.3. 1.1 Commercial mesh </Li> <Li> 1.3. 1.2 Mosquito - net mesh </Li> <Li> 1.3. 1.3 Complications </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 1.3. 2 Absorbable mesh </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Suture repairs <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Tension repairs <Ul> <Li> 2.1. 1 Bassini </Li> <Li> 2.1. 2 McVay / Cooper 's ligament </Li> <Li> 2.1. 3 Shouldice </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2.2 Tension - free repairs <Ul> <Li> 2.2. 1 Desarda </Li> <Li> 2.2. 2 Guarnieri </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Mesh repairs ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Open repair ( Lichtenstein , Shouldice , Bassini ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> The most commonly performed inguinal hernia repair today is the Lichtenstein repair . A flat mesh is placed on top of the defect . </P> <P> It is a `` tension - free '' repair that does not put tension on muscles , contrary to Bassini and Shouldice suture repairs ( but there are also tension - free suture repairs , like Desarda ) . It involves the placement of a mesh to strengthen the inguinal region . Patients typically go home within a few hours of surgery , often requiring no medication beyond paracetamol ( Tylenol / acetaminophen ) . Patients are encouraged to walk as soon as possible postoperatively , and they can usually resume most normal activities within a week or two of the operation . Complications include chronic pain ( varying from 6.9 to 11.7 % for expert surgeons and from 18.1 to 39.4 % for non-expert ones ) , foreign - body sensation , stiffness , ischemic orchitis , testicular atrophy , dysejaculation , anejaculation or painful ejaculation in around 12 % . They are often under - reported . Recurrence rate is low , < 2 %. . In contrast to this however , benefits for patients with pre-existing erectile dysfunction or general sexual dysfunctions have been reported . </P> <H3> Laparoscopic repair ( edit ) </H3> Intraoperative view by TEP Operation. 1 . Genital ramus of genitofemoral nerve . 2 . Preperitoneal lipom and spermatic cord . <P> There are two main methods of laparoscopic repair : transabdominal preperitoneal ( TAPP ) and totally extra-peritoneal ( TEP ) repair . When performed by a surgeon experienced in hernia repair , laparoscopic repair causes fewer complications than Lichtenstein , particularly less chronic pain . However , if the surgeon is experienced in general laparoscopic surgery but not in the specific subject of laparoscopic hernia surgery , laparoscopic repair is not advised as it causes more recurrence risk than Lichtenstein while also presenting risks of serious complications , as organ injury . Indeed , the TAPP approach needs to go through the abdomen . All that said , many surgeons are moving to laparoscopic methodologies as they cause smaller incisions , resulting in less bleeding , less infection , faster recovery , reduced hospitalization , and reduced chronic pain . </P> <Table> Laparoscopic mesh surgery , as compared to open mesh surgery <Tr> <Th> Advantages </Th> <Th> Disadvantages </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Quicker recovery </Li> <Li> Less pain during first days </Li> <Li> Fewer postoperative complications </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> such as infections , bleeding and seromas </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> Less risk of chronic pain </Li> </Ul> </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Needs surgeon highly experienced </Li> </Ul> <P> ( > 200 operations / year ) in inguinal hernia repairs </P> <Ul> <Li> Longer operating time </Li> <Li> Increased recurrence of primary hernias if </Li> </Ul> <P> surgeon not experienced enough </P> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> There is no difference in cost between laparoscopic and open repair as the increased costs of operation are offset by the decreased recovery period . Recurrence rates are identical when laparoscopy is performed by an experienced surgeon . When performed by a surgeon less experienced in inguinal hernia lap repair , recurrence is larger than after Lichtenstein . </P> <H3> Meshes ( edit ) </H3> Inguinal Hernia Patch . Animation in the reference . Permanent mesh ( edit ) Commercial mesh ( edit ) Polypropylene mesh used for inguinal hernia surgery <P> Commercial meshes are typically made of polypropylene or polyester . Marlex , Gore - Tex or Teflon meshes are sold by some companies . Lightweight meshes seem to cause less discomfort than heavyweight meshes . Some repair kits combine a plug and a patch . Some plug - and - patch kits combine an absorbable plug with a nonabsorbable patch , like Bio-A , manufactured by W.L. Gore & Associates . </P> Mosquito - net mesh ( edit ) <P> Meshes made of mosquito net cloth , in copolymer of polyethylene and polypropylene have been used for low - income patients in rural India and Ghana . Each piece costs $0.01 , 3700 times cheaper than an equivalent commercial mesh . They give results identical to commercial meshes in terms of infection and recurrence rate at 5 years . </P> <P> Therefore , it remains to be shown that despite their considerably higher cost , standard commercial meshes could offer any practical improvement over mosquito - net cloth in inguinal hernia surgery . </P> Complications ( edit ) See also : Post herniorraphy pain syndrome <P> Complications are frequent ( > 10 % ) . They include , but are not limited to : foreign - body sensation , chronic pain , ejaculation disorders , mesh migration , mesh folding ( meshoma ) , infection , adhesion formation , erosion into intraperitoneal organs . Such complications usually become apparent weeks to years after the initial repair , presenting as abscess , fistula , or bowel obstruction . </P> <P> In the long term , polypropylene meshes face degradation , due to heat effects . This increases the risk of stiffness and chronic pain . Persistent inflammation and increased cell turnover at the mesh - tissue interface raised the possibility of cancer transformation . </P> <P> Cases of obstructive azoospermia have been related with the use of polypropylene mesh , due to the obstruction of the vas deferens as a result of the fibroblastic reaction to the mesh . However , a recent study finds that this risk seems to be less than 1 % and therefore , it does not need to be notified in an informed consent . </P> Absorbable mesh ( edit ) Main article : Biomesh <P> Biomeshes are increasingly popular since their first use in 1999 and their subsequent introduction on the market in 2003 . Their use is an instance of regenerative medicine . Unlike synthetic non-absorbable meshes , they are absorbable , and can be used for repair in an infected environment , such as an incarcerated hernia . Moreover , they seem to improve comfort and presumably , they reduce the risk of inguinodynia . They have been tested after mesh - related inguinodynia . Some meshes have a price comparable to the high end of synthetic meshes , the cheapest ( $500 ) being Surgisis - Biodesign , manufactured by Cook Group , made from the extra cellular matrix of pig small intestinal submucosa .

It was designed by James Barton Longacre , the Chief Engraver at the Philadelphia Mint . </P> <P> From 1793 to 1857 , the cent was a copper coin about the size of a half dollar . As rising copper prices made it impractical to keep striking them , in 1857 the Mint reduced the size of the cent , issuing a new design , the Flying Eagle cent . The new pieces were identical in diameter to modern cents , though somewhat thicker and made of copper - nickel . The design caused production difficulties , and the Mint soon looked to replace the coin . Mint Director James Ross Snowden selected the Indian Head design , and chose a laurel wreath for the reverse that was replaced in 1860 by an oak wreath with a shield . Cents were hoarded during the economic chaos of the American Civil War , when the metal nickel was in short supply . As Mint officials saw that privately issued bronze tokens were circulating , they induced Congress to pass the Coinage Act of 1864 , authorizing a slimmer cent of bronze alloy . </P> <P> In the postwar period , the cent became very popular and was struck in large numbers in most years . An exception was 1877 , when a poor economy and little demand for cents created one of the rarest dates in the series . With the advent of coin - operated machines in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , even more cents were produced , reaching 100 million for the first time in 1907 . In 1909 , the Indian Head cent was replaced by the Lincoln cent , designed by Victor D. Brenner . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Inception </Li> <Li> 2 Design </Li> <Li> 3 Production <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Redesign and surplus ( 1859 -- 1861 ) </Li> <Li> 3.2 Shortage and redesign ( 1862 -- 1864 ) </Li> <Li> 3.3 Later years ( 1865 -- 1909 ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Replacement </Li> <Li> 5 Collecting </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Inception ( edit ) </H2> Main articles : Large cent ( United States coin ) and Flying Eagle cent <P> The half - dollar - sized large cent was struck from 1793 to 1857 . That coin was intended to contain close to a cent 's worth of copper , as people then expected that coins contain close to their face values in metal . Nevertheless , because of the constitutional clause making only gold and silver legal tender , the government would not accept copper cents for taxes or other payments . By the early 1850s , fluctuations in the price of copper led the Mint of the United States ( hereafter Mint ) to seek alternatives , including reducing the size of the cent and experimenting with compositions other than pure copper . The result was the Flying Eagle cent , the same diameter as the later Lincoln cent but somewhat thicker and heavier , composed of 88 % copper and 12 % nickel . The Flying Eagle cent was struck in limited numbers as a pattern coin in 1856 , then for circulation in 1857 and 1858 . </P> <P> The Flying Eagle cent was issued in exchange for worn Spanish colonial silver coins , which until then had circulated widely in the United States . These `` small cents '' were also issued in exchange for the copper coins they had replaced . By 1858 , Mint authorities found the piece unsatisfactory in production . The high points on both sides of the coin ( the eagle 's head and the wreath ) opposed each other , and it was difficult to get the design to be brought out fully in the tough copper - nickel alloy . Mint Engraver James B. Longacre , designer of the Flying Eagle cent , was instructed to develop alternative designs . He produced one , showing a slimmer eagle , which would not clash as much with the reverse wreath . Although this would have cured the production problem , the design was not liked . Mint Director James Ross Snowden suggested a head of Columbus as an obverse design , but Longacre felt the public would not approve of a historic figure on an American coin . </P> A Spanish colonial two - reales piece ( `` two bits '' ) from the Potos\u00ed Mint ( today in Bolivia ) <P> In 1858 , the Mint tested new designs for the cent . Between 60 and 100 sets of twelve pattern coins were struck , consisting of the standard Flying Eagle obverse , a `` scrawny eagle '' pattern , and the Indian Head design , mated with four different wreaths for the reverse . Snowden would make his choice of what design would be struck in 1859 from these patterns ; the sets were also sold to collectors . The Indian Head design was apparently prepared by April , as on the twelfth of that month , a Mr. Howard wrote to Snowden that `` I have learned that a new pattern piece for the cent has been struck off at the Mint ( with ) a head resembling that of the three dollar piece and on the reverse a shield at the top of the olive and oak wreath '' , and asking to purchase a specimen . Other numismatists also sought pieces : R. Coulton Davis , a Philadelphia druggist with ties to the Mint , wrote to Snowden in June informing him of a favorable story in a Boston newspaper , and Augustus B. Sage wrote to the Mint Director the same month , asking for a specimen for himself , and one for the newly founded American Numismatic Society . </P> <P> According to Walter Breen , Snowden most likely chose the combination of the Indian Head and the laurel wreath as it was the lowest relief of any of the options , and could be expected to strike well . On November 4 , 1858 , Snowden wrote to Treasury Secretary Howell Cobb about the Indian Head design , and two days later wrote to Longacre , informing him that it was approved . Longacre was to prepare the necessary dies for production , which was to begin on January 1 , 1859 . </P> <H2> Design ( edit ) </H2> <P> Longacre advocated his Indian Head design in an August 21 , 1858 , letter to Snowden : </P> <P> From the copper shores of Lake Superior , to the silver mountains of Potosi from the Ojibwa to the Aramanian , the feathered tiara is as characteristic of the primitive races of our hemisphere , as the turban is of the Asiatic . Nor is there anything in its decorative character , repulsive to the association of Liberty ... It is more appropriate than the Phrygian cap , the emblem rather of the emancipated slave , than of the independent freeman , of those who are able to say `` we were never in bondage to any man '' . I regard then this emblem of America as a proper and well defined portion of our national inheritance ; and having now the opportunity of consecrating it as a memorial of Liberty , ' our Liberty ' , American Liberty ; why not use it ? One more graceful can scarcely be devised . We have only to determine that it shall be appropriate , and all the world outside of us can not wrest it from us . </P> <P> By numismatic legend , the facial features of the goddess Liberty on the obverse of the Indian Head cent were based on the features of Longacre 's daughter Sarah ; the tale runs that she was at the mint one day when she tried on the headdress of one of a number of Native Americans who were visiting , and her father sketched her . However , Sarah Longacre was 30 years old and married in 1858 , not 12 as in the tale , and Longacre himself stated that the face was based on a statue of Venus in Philadelphia on loan from the Vatican . He did often sketch his elder daughter , and there are resemblances between the depictions of Sarah and the various representations of Liberty on his coins of the 1850s . These tales were apparently extant at the time , as Snowden , writing to Treasury Secretary Howell Cobb in November 1858 , denied that the coin was based `` on any human features in the Longacre family '' . Lee F. McKenzie , in his 1991 article on Longacre , notes that any artist can be influenced by many things , but calls the story `` essentially false '' . </P> <P> Regardless of who posed for Longacre , the facial features of the `` Indian '' are essentially Caucasian , meaning that a White woman wears the headdress of a Native American man . Longacre had , in 1854 , designed the three - dollar piece with a female with similar features ( also supposedly based on the museum sculpture ) but a more fanciful headdress , and adapted that design for the gold dollar . Officials were aware of this artistic license at the time of issue ; Snowden , in his November 1858 letter to Cobb , characterizes the two earlier coins as `` the artists at the Mint evidently not realizing the absurd incongruity of placing this most masculine attribute of the warrior brave on the head of a woman '' . Longacre would not be the last to juxtapose the features of a White woman with an Indian headdress reserved for men ; Augustus Saint Gaudens , for the Indian Head eagle ( 1907 ) , produced a similar design . Later issues depict more accurate Indians , including Bela Lyon Pratt 's Indian Head gold pieces ( 1908 ) , the Buffalo nickel ( 1913 ) by James Earle Fraser , who worked from Native American models , and the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar ( 1926 ) , designed by Fraser and his wife Laura . </P> Cornelius Vermeule thought the Indian Head cent was better than Longacre 's 1859 pattern half dollar . <P> Art historian Cornelius Vermeule had mixed emotions about the Indian Head cent : `` Longacre enriched the mythology of American coinage in a pleasant if unpretentious fashion . Given his pattern half - dollar designs of 1859 as a yardstick , he could have done worse . '' In another comparison , Vermeule suggested , `` far from a major creation aesthetically or iconographically , and far less attractive to the eye than the ( flying eagle ) , the Indian head cent was at least to achieve the blessing of popular appeal . The coin became perhaps the most beloved and typically American of any piece great or small in the American series . Great art the coin was not , but it was one of the first products of the United States mints to achieve the common touch . '' </P> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Redesign and surplus ( 1859 -- 1861 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> Production of the Indian Head cent for commerce began at the start of 1859 . As issued for circulation , the pieces differ in some particulars from the pattern 1858 cent of similar design ; Longacre sharpened some details . The pattern coin had the laurel leaves in the reverse wreath in bunches of five leaves ; the issued 1859 cent has them in bunches of six . Cents dated 1858 with the adopted reverse ( with six - leaf bunches ) are known , were most likely struck in 1859 , and are extremely rare . </P> <P> In 1860 , the reverse of the cent was changed to feature an oak wreath and a narrow shield ; such reverses are also known on 1859 - dated pieces struck as patterns . According to Richard Snow in his guide book to Flying Eagle and Indian Head cents , this was not due to problems with the `` Laurel Wreath '' reverse design used in 1859 , as full details survive on many extant pie\n\nQuestion:\nwhen was the first indian head penny made\n", "answer": "1859"}

The game 's general principles put it into the Crazy Eights family of card games . The game was originally developed in 1971 by Merle Robbins in Reading , Ohio , a suburb of Cincinnati . It has been a Mattel brand since 1992 . When his family and friends began to play more and more , he spent $8,000 to have 5,000 copies of the game made . He sold it from his barbershop at first , and local businesses began to sell it as well . Robins later sold the rights to UNO to a group of friends headed by Robert Tezak , a funeral parlor owner in Joliet , Illinois , for $50,000 plus royalties of 10 cents per game .

Action cards ( Skip , Draw Two and Reverse ) are worth 20 Points while Wild and Wild Draw Four cards are worth 50 Points . </P> <P> The deck consists of 108 cards , of which there are 25 of each color ( red , green , blue , and yellow ) , each color having two of each rank except zero . The ranks in each color are zero to nine , `` Skip '' , `` Draw Two '' , and `` Reverse '' ( the last three being `` action cards '' ) . In addition , the deck contains four each of `` Wild '' and `` Wild Draw Four '' cards . </P> <P> To start a hand , seven cards are dealt to each player , with the top card of the deck flipped over and set aside to begin the discard pile . The player to the dealer 's left plays first unless the first card on the discard pile is an action or Wild card ( see below ) . On a player 's turn , they must do one of the following : </P> <Ul> <Li> play a card matching the discard in color , number , or symbol </Li> <Li> play a Wild card , or a playable Wild Draw Four card ( see restriction below ) </Li> <Li> draw the top card of the deck </Li> </Ul> <P> Play proceeds clockwise around the table . </P> <P> Action and Wild cards have the following effects : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Card </Th> <Th> Effect when played from hand </Th> <Th> Effect as first discard </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Skip </Td> <Td> Next player in sequence misses a turn </Td> <Td> Player to dealer 's left misses a turn </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Reverse </Td> <Td> Order of play switches directions ( clockwise to counterclockwise , or vice versa ) </Td> <Td> Dealer plays first ; play proceeds counterclockwise </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Draw Two ( + 2 ) </Td> <Td> Next player in sequence draws two cards and misses a turn </Td> <Td> Player to dealer 's left draws two cards and misses a turn </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Wild </Td> <Td> Player determines the next color to be matched ( may be used on any turn even if the player has matching color ) </Td> <Td> Player who puts the color card down chooses the color of the new card by putting down a card of that color . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Wild Draw Four / Draw Four Wild ( + 4 and wild ) </Td> <Td> Player determines next color to be matched ; next player in sequence draws four cards and misses a turn . May be legally played only if the player has no cards of the current color ( see Penalties ) </Td> <Td> Return card to the deck , shuffle , flip top card to start discard pile </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Ul> <Li> A player who draws from the deck must either play or keep that card and may play no other card from their hand on that turn . </Li> <Li> A player may play a Wild card at any time , even if that player has other playable cards . </Li> <Li> A player may play a Wild Draw Four card only if that player has no cards matching the current color . The player may have cards of a different color matching the current number or symbol or a Wild card and still play the Wild Draw Four card . A player who plays a Wild Draw Four may be challenged by the next player in sequence ( see Penalties ) to prove that their hand meets this condition . </Li> <Li> If the entire deck is used during play , the top discard is set aside and the rest of the pile is shuffled to create a new deck . Play then proceeds normally . </Li> <Li> It is illegal to trade cards of any sort with another player . </Li> </Ul> <P> A player who plays their next - to - last - card must call `` Uno '' as a warning to the other players . </P> <P> The first player to get rid of their last card ( `` going out '' ) wins the hand and scores points for the cards held by the other players . Number cards count their face value , all action cards count 20 , and Wild and Wild Draw Four cards count 50 . If a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four card is played to go out , the next player in the sequence must draw the appropriate number of cards before the score is tallied . If the next player has a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four card , it can be stacked and possibly bring the `` out '' player back into play . </P> <P> The first player to score 500 points wins the game . </P> <H3> Penalties ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> If a player does not call `` Uno '' after laying down their next - to - last card and is caught before the next player in sequence takes a turn ( i.e. , plays a card from their hand , draws from the deck , or touches the discard pile ) , they must draw two cards as a penalty . If the player is not caught in time ( subject to interpretation ) or remembers to call `` Uno '' before being caught , they suffer no penalty . If a player falsely calls `` Uno '' while having multiple cards in their hand , they must draw two cards . </Li> <Li> If a player plays a Wild Draw Four card , the following player can challenge its use . The player who used the Wild Draw Four must privately show their hand to the challenging player , in order to demonstrate that they had no matching colored cards . If the challenge is correct , then the challenged player draws four cards instead . If the challenge is wrong , then the challenger must draw six cards ; the four cards they were already required to draw plus two more cards . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Two - player game ( edit ) </H3> <P> In a two - player game , the Reverse card acts like a Skip card ; when played , the other player misses a turn . </P> <H3> House rules ( edit ) </H3> <P> The following house rules are suggested in the Uno rulebook , to alter the game : </P> <Ul> <Li> Progressive Uno : If a draw card is played , and the following player has the same card , they can play that card and `` stack '' the penalty , which adds to the current penalty and passes it to the following player . </Li> <Li> Seven - O : When a certain card is played , the player is able to trade hands with another player or with all players . For example , the person who played the 7 card is able to switch all of their cards with another player ; the player who played the 0 card is able to make every player exchange all their cards to the next player . </Li> <Li> Jump - In : If a player has exactly the same card ( both number and color ) as the top card of the discard pile , they may play it immediately , even if it is not their turn . The game then continues as if that player had just taken their turn . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Strategies ( edit ) </H2> <P> A strategy at Uno may be offensive ( aiming to go out ) , or defensive ( aiming to minimize the value of one 's hand , in the event that another player goes out , thus getting those points ) . Part of the skill of playing Uno is knowing when to adopt an offensive or defensive strategy . </P> <P> An offensive strategy would be holding on to Wild and Wild Draw Four cards because they can be played near the end of the hand in order to go out ( when it 's harder to play a matching card ) . However , a defensive strategy would advise getting rid of such cards early , because they have a high point value . </P> <P> A defensive strategy would advise playing a high card in order to reduce the point value of the hand . However , an offensive strategy would suggest playing a 0 when the player wants to continue on the current color , because it is less likely to be matched by another 0 of a different color ( there is only one 0 of each color , but two of each 1 -- 9 ) . </P> <P> A player holding only one card is required to call out `` Uno '' or risk being penalized if caught . A player who calls `` Uno '' risks being the target of concerted action by the other players , who may be able to use action cards to prevent that player from going out . Depending on the level and seriousness of play , some players may deliberately avoid saying `` Uno '' , in the hope of avoiding detection and then going out on the next turn . For this reason , it is useful to conceal how many cards are in your hand and to keep track of how many cards every other player holds . </P> <P> Little has been published on the optimal strategy for the game of Uno . Simulations of games may shed some light on the matter . Attempts to reduce point count in a player 's hands can be `` read '' by other players if too transparent . This information can be exploited by other players , and it follows that a mixed strategy may be more appropriate . </P> <P> Some work has been done into the psychology of Uno as it relates to individual and group behavior . Players may exhibit physical tells , in which a subtle , often repeated , cue inadvertently reveals their state of mind during a game . Alternatively , they may change their playing style , switching from an aggressive card - shedding strategy to a more subdued one , or vice versa . </P> <H2> Card and deck styles ( edit ) </H2> A deck of Englis\n\nQuestion:\nhow many cards are in a uni deck\n", "answer": "108"}

The team 's name derived from the reputed skill of Brooklyn residents at evading the city 's trolley streetcar network . The Dodgers played in two stadiums in South Brooklyn , each named Washington Park , and at Eastern Park in the neighborhood of Brownsville before moving to Ebbets Field in the neighborhood of Flatbush in 1913 .

Eight of 16 participants in the first convention were from Brooklyn , including the Atlantic , Eckford , and Excelsior clubs that combined to dominate play for most of the 1860s . Brooklyn helped make baseball commercial , as the locale of the first paid admission games , a series of three all star contests matching New York and Brooklyn in 1858 . Brooklyn also featured the first two enclosed baseball grounds , the Union Grounds and the Capitoline Grounds ; enclosed , dedicated ballparks accelerated the evolution from amateurism to professionalism . </P> <P> Despite the early success of Brooklyn clubs in the National Association of Base Ball Players , officially amateur until 1869 , they fielded weak teams in the succeeding National Association of Professional Base Ball Players , the first professional league formed in 1871 . The Excelsiors no longer challenged for the amateur championship after the Civil War and never entered the professional NA . The Eckfords and Atlantics declined to join until 1872 and thereby lost their best players ; the Eckfords survived only one season and the Atlantics four , with losing teams . </P> <P> The National League replaced the NA in 1876 and granted exclusive territories to its eight members , excluding the Atlantics in favor of the New York Mutuals who had shared home grounds with the Atlantics . When the Mutuals were expelled by the league , the Hartford Dark Blues club moved in , changed its name to The Brooklyn Hartfords and played its home games at Union Grounds in 1877 before disbanding . </P> <H3> The origin of the Dodgers ( edit ) </H3> <P> The team currently known as the Dodgers was formed as the Brooklyn Grays in 1883 by real estate magnate and baseball enthusiast Charles Byrne , who convinced his brother - in - law Joseph Doyle and casino operator Ferdinand Abell to start the team with him . Byrne arranged to build a grandstand on a lot bounded by Third Street , Fourth Avenue , Fifth Street , and Fifth Avenue , and named it Washington Park in honor of George Washington . The Grays played in the minor Inter-State Association of Professional Baseball Clubs that first season . Doyle became the first team manager , and they drew 6,431 fans to their first home game on May 12 , 1883 against the Trenton team . The Grays won the league title after the Camden Merritt club disbanded on July 20 and Brooklyn picked up some of its better players . The Grays were invited to join the American Association for the 1884 season . </P> <P> After winning the American Association league championship in 1889 , the Grays ( by then nicknamed the Bridegrooms ) moved to the National League and won the 1890 NL Championship , the only Major League team to win consecutive championships in both professional `` base ball '' leagues . They lost the 1889 World Series to the New York Giants and tied the 1890 World Series with the Louisville Colonels . Their success during this period was partly attributed to their having absorbed skilled players from the defunct New York Metropolitans and Brooklyn Ward 's Wonders . In 1899 , most of the original Baltimore Orioles stars moved to the Grays ( Bridegrooms ) along with Orioles manager Ned Hanlon who became the club 's new manager under Charles Ebbets , who had by now accumulated an 80 % share of the club . The new combined team was dubbed the `` Superbas '' by the press and would become the champions of the National League in 1899 and again in 1900 . </P> <H3> Nicknames ( edit ) </H3> Logo of the Brooklyn Dodgers / Superbas from 1910 through 1913 <P> The team name , Brooklyn Trolley Dodgers , was coined in 1895 . The nickname was still new enough in September 1895 that a newspaper could report that `` ' Trolley Dodgers ' is the new name which eastern baseball cranks ( fans ) have given the Brooklyn club . '' In 1895 , Brooklyn played at Eastern Park , bounded by Eastern Parkway ( now Pitkin Avenue ) , Powell Street , Sutter Avenue , Van Sinderen Street , where they had moved early in the 1891 season when the second Washington Park burned down . Some sources erroneously report that the name `` Trolley Dodgers '' referred to pedestrians avoiding fast cars on street car tracks that bordered Eastern Park on two sides . However , Eastern Park was not bordered by street - level trolley lines that had to be `` dodged '' by pedestrians . The name `` Trolley Dodgers '' implied the dangers posed by trolley cars in Brooklyn generally , which in 1892 , began the switch from horse - power to electrical power , which made them much faster , and were hence regarded as more dangerous . The name was later shortened to Brooklyn Dodgers . The `` Trolley Dodgers '' name was later adopted by the team for the 1911 and 1912 seasons , and the `` Dodgers '' name was used in 1913 . </P> <P> Other team names used by the franchise that finally came to be called `` the Dodgers '' were the Atlantics ( 1884 , not directly related to the earlier Brooklyn Atlantics ) , Bridegrooms or Grooms ( 1888 - 1898 ) , Ward 's Wonders , the Superbas ( 1899 - 1910 ) , and the Robins ( 1914 - 1931 ) . All of these nicknames were used by fans and newspaper sports writers to describe the team , often concurrently , but not in any official capacity . The team 's legal name was the Brooklyn Base Ball Club . However , the `` Trolley Dodgers '' nickname was used throughout this period , along with other nicknames , by fans and sports writers of the day . The team did not use the name in a formal sense until 1932 , when the word `` Dodgers '' appeared on team jerseys . The `` conclusive shift '' came in 1933 , when both home and road jerseys for the team bore the name `` Dodgers '' . </P> <P> Examples of how the many popularized names of the team were used interchangeably are available from newspaper articles from the period before 1932 . A New York Times article describing a game the Dodgers played in 1916 starts out by referring to how `` Jimmy Callahan , pilot of the Pirates , did his best to wreck the hopes the Dodgers have of gaining the National League pennant '' , but then goes on to comment , `` the only thing that saved the Superbas from being toppled from first place was that the Phillies lost one of the two games played . '' Most baseball statistics sites and baseball historians generally now refer to the pennant - winning 1916 Brooklyn team as the Robins . A 1918 New York Times article used the nickname Robins in its title `` Buccaneers Take Last From Robins '' , but the subtitle of the article reads `` Subdue The Superbas By 11 To 4 , Making Series An Even Break '' . </P> <P> Another example of the interchangeability of different nicknames is found on the program issued at Ebbets Field for the 1920 World Series , which identifies the matchup in the series as `` Dodgers vs. Indians '' , despite the fact that the Robins nickname had been in consistent usage at this point for around six years . </P> <H2> Rivalry with the Giants ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Dodgers -- Giants rivalry <P> The historic and heated rivalry between the Dodgers and the Giants is more than a century old . It began when the Dodgers and Giants faced each other in the 1889 World Series , the ancestor of the Subway Series , and both played in separate cities ( the Dodgers in Brooklyn and the Giants in New York City Manhattan ) . When both franchises moved to California after the 1957 season , the rivalry was easily transplanted , as the cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco have long been rivals in economics , culture , and politics . </P> <H3> `` Uncle Robbie '' and the `` Daffiness Boys '' ( edit ) </H3> <P> Manager Wilbert Robinson , another former Oriole , popularly known as `` Uncle Robbie '' , restored the Brooklyn team to respectability . His `` Brooklyn Robins '' reached the 1916 and 1920 World Series , losing both , but contending perennially for several seasons . Charles Ebbets and Ed McKeever died within a week of each other in 1925 , and Robbie was named president while still field manager . Upon assuming the title of president , however , Robinson 's ability to focus on the field declined , and the teams of the late 1920s were often fondly referred to as the `` Daffiness Boys '' for their distracted , error - ridden style of play . Outfielder Babe Herman was the leader both in hitting and in zaniness . The signature Dodger play from this era occurred when three players -- Dazzy Vance , Chick Fewster , and Herman -- ended up at third base at the same time . ( The play is often remembered as Herman `` tripling into a triple play '' , though only two of the three players were declared out and Herman was credited with a double rather than a triple . ) Herman later complained that no one remembered that he drove in the winning run on the play . The incident led to the popular joke : </P> <Ul> <Li> `` The Dodgers have three men on base ! '' </Li> <Li> `` Oh , yeah ? Which base ? '' </Li> </Ul> <P> After his removal as club president , Robinson returned to managing , and the club 's performance rebounded somewhat . </P> <P> When Robinson retired in 1931 , he was replaced as manager by Max Carey . Although some suggested renaming the `` Robins '' the `` Brooklyn Canaries '' , after Carey , whose last name was originally `` Carnarius '' , the name `` Brooklyn Dodgers '' returned to stay following Robinson 's retirement . It was during this era that Willard Mullin , a noted sports cartoonist , fixed the Brooklyn team with the lovable nickname of `` Dem Bums '' . After hearing his cab driver ask , `` So how did those bums do today ? '' , Mullin decided to sketch an exaggerated version of famed circus clown Emmett Kelly to represent the Dodgers in his much - praised cartoons in the New York World - Telegram . Both image and nickname caught on , so much so that many a Dodger yearbook cover , from 1951 through 1957 , featured a Willard Mullin illustration of the Brooklyn Bum . </P> <P> Perhaps the highlight of the Daffiness Boys era came after Wilbert Robinson left the dugout . In 1934 , Giants player / manager Bill Terry was asked about the Dodgers ' chances in the coming pennant race and cracked infamously , `` Is Brooklyn still in the league ? '' Managed then by Casey Stengel , who played for the Dodgers in the 1910s and went on to greatness managing the New York Yankees , the 1934 Dodgers were determined to make their presence felt . As it happened , the season entered its final games with the Giants tied with the St. Louis Cardinals \n", "answer": "1957"}

Il Duomo di Firenze , as it is ordinarily called , was begun in 1296 in the Gothic style with the design of Arnolfo di Cambio and completed structurally in 1436 with the dome engineered by Filippo Brunelleschi . The exterior of the basilica is faced with polychrome marble panels in various shades of green and pink bordered by white and has an elaborate 19th - century Gothic Revival fa\u00e7ade by Emilio De Fabris . </P> <P> The cathedral complex , located in Piazza del Duomo , includes the Baptistery and Giotto 's Campanile . These three buildings are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site covering the historic centre of Florence and are a major attraction to tourists visiting Tuscany . The basilica is one of Italy 's largest churches , and until development of new structural materials in the modern era , the dome was the largest in the world .

The ancient structure , founded in the early 5th century and having undergone many repairs , was crumbling with age , according to the 14th - century Nuova Cronica of Giovanni Villani , and was no longer large enough to serve the growing population of the city . Other major Tuscan cities had undertaken ambitious reconstructions of their cathedrals during the Late Medieval period , such as Pisa and particularly Siena where the enormous proposed extensions were never completed . </P> Giotto 's bell tower ( campanile ) <P> The new church was designed by Arnolfo di Cambio and approved by city council in 1294 . Di Cambio was also architect of the church of Santa Croce and the Palazzo Vecchio . He designed three wide naves ending under the octagonal dome , with the middle nave covering the area of Santa Reparata . The first stone was laid on September 9 , 1296 , by Cardinal Valeriana , the first papal legate ever sent to Florence . The building of this vast project was to last 140 years ; Arnolfo 's plan for the eastern end , although maintained in concept , was greatly expanded in size . </P> The Duomo , as if completed , in a fresco by Andrea di Bonaiuto , painted in the 1360s , before the commencement of the dome <P> After Arnolfo died in 1310 , work on the cathedral slowed for thirty years . When the relics of Saint Zenobius were discovered in 1330 in Santa Reparata , the project gained a new impetus . In 1331 , the Arte della Lana , the guild of wool merchants , took over patronage for the construction of the cathedral and in 1334 appointed Giotto to oversee the work . Assisted by Andrea Pisano , Giotto continued di Cambio 's design . His major accomplishment was the building of the campanile . When Giotto died the January 8th of 1337 , Andrea Pisano continued the building until work was halted due to the Black Death in 1348 . </P> <P> In 1349 , work resumed on the cathedral under a series of architects , starting with Francesco Talenti , who finished the campanile and enlarged the overall project to include the apse and the side chapels . In 1359 , Talenti was succeeded by Giovanni di Lapo Ghini ( 1360 -- 1369 ) who divided the center nave in four square bays . Other architects were Alberto Arnoldi , Giovanni d'Ambrogio , Neri di Fioravante and Andrea Orcagna . By 1375 , the old church Santa Reparata was pulled down . The nave was finished by 1380 , and by 1418 , only the dome remained incomplete . </P> Procession outside the cathedral during the 18th century <P> On 18 August 1418 , the Arte della Lana announced an architectural design competition for erecting Neri 's dome . The two main competitors were two master goldsmiths , Lorenzo Ghiberti and Filippo Brunelleschi , the latter of whom was supported by Cosimo de Medici . Ghiberti had been the winner of a competition for a pair of bronze doors for the Baptistery in 1401 and lifelong competition between the two remained sharp . Brunelleschi won and received the commission . </P> <P> Ghiberti , appointed coadjutator , drew a salary equal to Brunelleschi 's and , though neither was awarded the announced prize of 200 florins , was promised equal credit , although he spent most of his time on other projects . When Brunelleschi became ill , or feigned illness , the project was briefly in the hands of Ghiberti . But Ghiberti soon had to admit that the whole project was beyond him . In 1423 , Brunelleschi was back in charge and took over sole responsibility . </P> <P> Work started on the dome in 1420 and was completed in 1436 . The cathedral was consecrated by Pope Eugene IV on March 25 , 1436 , ( the first day of the year according to the Florentine calendar ) . It was the first ' octagonal ' dome in history to be built without a temporary wooden supporting frame . It was one of the most impressive projects of the Renaissance . During the consecration in 1436 , Guillaume Dufay 's motet Nuper rosarum flores was performed . The structure of this motet was strongly influenced by the structure of the dome . </P> The Duomo and Baptistery of St. John from Piazza del Duomo <P> The decoration of the exterior of the cathedral , begun in the 14th century , was not completed until 1887 , when the polychrome marble fa\u00e7ade was completed with the design of Emilio De Fabris . The floor of the church was relaid in marble tiles in the 16th century . </P> <P> The exterior walls are faced in alternate vertical and horizontal bands of polychrome marble from Carrara ( white ) , Prato ( green ) , Siena ( red ) , Lavenza and a few other places . These marble bands had to repeat the already existing bands on the walls of the earlier adjacent baptistery the Battistero di San Giovanni and Giotto 's Bell Tower . There are two side doors : the Doors of the Canonici ( south side ) and the Door of the Mandorla ( north side ) with sculptures by Nanni di Banco , Donatello , and Jacopo della Quercia . The six side windows , notable for their delicate tracery and ornaments , are separated by pilasters . Only the four windows closest to the transept admit light ; the other two are merely ornamental . The clerestory windows are round , a common feature in Italian Gothic . </P> <P> During its long history , this cathedral has been the seat of the Council of Florence ( 1439 ) , heard the preachings of Girolamo Savonarola and witnessed the murder of Giuliano di Piero de ' Medici on Sunday , 26 April 1478 ( with Lorenzo Il Magnifico barely escaping death ) , in the Pazzi conspiracy . </P> <H2> Exterior ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Plan and structure ( edit ) </H3> Plan of the church with various extension phases <P> The cathedral of Florence is built as a basilica , having a wide central nave of four square bays , with an aisle on either side . The chancel and transepts are of identical polygonal plan , separated by two smaller polygonal chapels . The whole plan forms a Latin cross . The nave and aisles are separated by wide pointed Gothic arches resting on composite piers . </P> <P> The dimensions of the building are enormous : building area 8,300 square metres ( 89,340 square feet ) , length 153 metres ( 502 feet ) , width 38 metres ( 125 feet ) , width at the crossing 90 metres ( 300 feet ) . The height of the arches in the aisles is 23 metres ( 75 feet ) . The height of the dome is 114.5 metres ( 375.7 feet ) . </P> <H3> Dome ( edit ) </H3> <P> By the beginning of the 15th century , after a hundred years of construction , the structure was still missing its dome . The basic features of the dome had been designed by Arnolfo di Cambio in 1296 . His brick model , 4.6 metres ( 15.1 ft ) high , 9.2 metres ( 30.2 feet ) long , was standing in a side aisle of the unfinished building , and had long been sacrosanct . It called for an octagonal dome higher and wider than any that had ever been built , with no external buttresses to keep it from spreading and falling under its own weight . </P> <Table> External video <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> Smarthistory - Brunelleschi 's Dome </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The commitment to reject traditional Gothic buttresses had been made when Neri di Fioravanti 's model was chosen over a competing one by Giovanni di Lapo Ghini . That architectural choice , in 1367 , was one of the first events of the Italian Renaissance , marking a break with the Medieval Gothic style and a return to the classic Mediterranean dome . Italian architects regarded Gothic flying buttresses as ugly makeshifts . Furthermore , the use of buttresses was forbidden in Florence , as the style was favored by central Italy 's traditional enemi\n\nQuestion:\nwhen was the dome of florence cathedral built\n", "answer": "1296"}

The 1974 television film called Wonder Woman directed by Vincent McEveety and starring Cathy Lee Crosby , was a pilot for an intended television series being considered by ABC . Ratings were described as `` respectable but not exactly wondrous , '' and ABC did not pick up the pilot . Instead , Warner Bros. and ABC developed the 1975 television series , Wonder Woman , that fit the more traditional presentation of the character as created by William Moulton Marston , turning away from the 1968 -- 72 era that had influenced the pilot . Wonder Woman , which premiered in 1975 , starred Lynda Carter and eventually led to the full series . Crosby would later claim that she was offered the chance to reprise the role in that series . </P> <H2> Cast and characters ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Lynda Carter as Diana Prince / Wonder Woman </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> This version of the character is exclusive to the continuity of the TV series Wonder Woman and is an adaptation of Diana Prince / Wonder Woman .

Scripting duties were given to Stanley Ralph Ross , who was instructed to be more faithful to the comic book and to create a subtle `` high comedy . '' Ross set the pilot in World War II , the era in which the original comic book began . </P> <P> After an intensive talent search , Lynda Carter , who had had a handful of minor acting roles and had been the 1972 Miss World USA and a Bob Hope USO cast member , was chosen for the lead role . For the role of Steve Trevor , the producers chose Lyle Waggoner , despite his dark brown , almost - black , hair not matching the comic 's blond Trevor , who at the time was better known as a comedic actor after several years co-starring in The Carol Burnett Show . He was also known to Ross as having been one of the leading candidates to play Batman a decade earlier , but instead Adam West was signed . Waggoner was also considered a pin - up hunk , having done a semi-nude pictorial in the first issue of Playgirl . </P> <P> Although the pilot followed the original comic book closely , in particular the aspect of Wonder Woman joining the military under the name Diana Prince , a number of elements were dropped . It mainly omitted Diana 's origin , including her birth on Paradise Island . The comic book Diana obtains the credentials of a look - alike nurse . Although the pilot shows Diana briefly as a nurse at one point , Diana takes on the identity of a Navy Yeoman Petty Officer First Class . </P> <P> One change , which was later to become synonymous with the show , was the transformation of Diana Prince into Wonder Woman by spinning . During the filming of the pilot , producers were trying to figure out a way to show how Diana Prince became Wonder Woman , when Carter suggested that she do a spin . </P> <P> Unlike the earlier pilot , the comic - book origins of the character were emphasized by the retention of the character 's traditional uniform ( the design of which was interpreted and executed by Donald Lee Feld , credited as `` Donfeld '' ) with the original setting and through the use of comic book elements . The series 's title sequence was animated in the form of a series of comic book panels featuring Wonder Woman performing a variety of heroic feats . Within the show , location and exposition were handled through comic book - style text panels . Transitions between scenes and commercial breaks were marked by animated starburst sequences . </P> Synopsis ( edit ) <P> In early 1942 , during the Second World War , American pilot Major Steve Trevor ( Waggoner ) bails out during an air battle over the Bermuda Triangle , location of Paradise Island . The island is home to the Amazons : beautiful , ageless women with great strength , agility , and intelligence . Amazon princess Diana ( Carter ) rescues the handsome unconscious Trevor and helps nurse him back to health . Her mother , the Amazon queen ( Cloris Leachman ; succeeded by Carolyn Jones and Beatrice Straight in later episodes ) , decrees that Olympic - style games shall be held to select one Amazon to return Trevor back to America . But she forbids her own daughter Diana , the princess , to participate . Diana states that since she is not allowed to participate , she does not want to be present for the games and will take a retreat to the other side of the island . The games are held with participants wearing masks and numbers , shown as Roman numerals in triangles on white sleeveless short tunic - dresses . Among the contestants is a blonde Amazon . During the events , the blonde Amazon shows exceptional skills and she ties for first with another Amazon . To break the deadlock , the `` bullets and bracelets '' event is decided as the tiebreaker , wherein each of the women takes turns shooting at the other ; the one being shot at must deflect the bullets with her bulletproof bracelets . The blond woman wins the event , superficially injuring her opponent 's arm . When she is pronounced the winner , she removes her mask and wig and reveals that she is Diana . Her mother , though initially shocked , relents and allows her to go to America . </P> <P> Diana 's uniform as Wonder Woman , designed by Queen Hippolyta , features emblems of America , the land to which she will be returning Steve Trevor . A golden belt will be the source of her strength and power while away from Paradise Island . She has her bullet - deflecting bracelets and also receives a golden lasso which is unbreakable and forces people to obey and tell the truth when bound with it . As shown later in flashback , Hippolyta also teaches Diana how to transform her clothes magically into the uniform . </P> <P> Diana , as Wonder Woman , flies to Washington , D.C. in an invisible plane . After dropping Trevor off at a hospital , the heroine stumbles upon a bank robbery , which she stops . A theatrical agent who sees her in action offers to help make her bullets and bracelets act a stage attraction . Diana is hesitant , but needing money in this new society , she agrees . </P> <P> Meanwhile , Trevor 's civilian secretary Marcia ( Stella Stevens ) is a double agent for the Nazi Fifth Columnists . She seeks to aid top spies in killing Trevor and opposing this new threat , Wonder Woman . Her first attempt is arranging for an accomplice to fire a machine gun at Wonder Woman during her stage act . Later , as spy activities increase , Trevor leaves the hospital but gets in a fight and is captured , prompting his `` nurse '' Diana to come to his rescue . Wonder Woman defeats Marcia in an extended fight sequence in the War Department . Having defeated Marcia , Wonder Woman thwarts a Nazi pilot who had plans to bomb the Brooklyn Navy Yard by using her invisible plane , and she rescues Trevor . With Marcia and the spy ring defeated , the film closes as Trevor and Brigadier General Blankenship talk about Trevor 's new secretary whom Blankenship selected not only for her outstanding clerical test scores , but her decidedly plain appearance in contrast to Marcia : the bespectacled Yeoman First Class Diana Prince USNR ( WR ) , Wonder Woman in disguise . </P> <H3> Season 1 ( edit ) </H3> <P> The pilot film aired on November 7 , 1975 , was a ratings success , and ABC quickly authorized the production of two one - hour specials which aired in April 1976 . These three productions would later be considered part of the show 's first season . The episodes scored strong ratings , and ABC ordered an additional 11 episodes for the new 1976 -- 77 TV season . The network began airing the episodes every few weeks apart at the beginning of the TV season in September 1976 . After mid-December 1976 , episodes aired on a weekly basis until mid-February 1977 . </P> <P> A few cast changes were made between the specials and the series . Former Happy Days recurring actress Beatrice Colen joined the cast as Corporal Etta Candy WAAC , General Blankenship 's secretary , thereby providing YN1 Prince with a subordinate . Three episodes featured Debra Winger as Diana 's younger sister , Drusilla , a.k.a. Wonder Girl , in one of her earliest acting roles . </P> <P> One of the most memorable aspects of the show that was developed during the first season was the transformation sequence that changed Diana Prince into her superheroine alter ego . The sequence in the original specials employed a slow fade between two synchronized shots , both filmed with an overcranked camera to create a slow motion effect . A twirling Diana Prince 's hair would fall loose as the shot transitioned to a twirling Wonder Woman holding h\n\nQuestion:\nwhen did the original wonder woman come out\n", "answer": "1974"}

One of the two parties typically holds a majority in the legislature and is usually referred to as the majority or governing party while the other is the minority or opposition party . Around the world , the term has different senses . For example , in the United States , Jamaica , and Malta , the sense of two party system describes an arrangement in which all or nearly all elected officials belong to one of the only two major parties , and third parties rarely win any seats in the legislature . In such arrangements , two - party systems are thought to result from various factors like winner takes all election rules . In such systems , while chances for third party candidates winning election to major national office are remote , it is possible for groups within the larger parties , or in opposition to one or both of them , to exert influence on the two major parties . In contrast , in the United Kingdom and Australia and in other parliamentary systems and elsewhere , the term two - party system is sometimes used to indicate an arrangement in which two major parties dominate elections but in which there are viable third parties which do win seats in the legislature , and in which the two major parties exert proportionately greater influence than their percentage of votes would suggest . </P> <P> Explanations for why a country with free elections may evolve into a two - party system have been debated . A leading theory , referred to as Duverger 's law , states that two parties are a natural result of a winner - take - all voting system . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Examples <Ul> <Li> 1.1 United States </Li> <Li> 1.2 Commonwealth countries </Li> <Li> 1.3 India </Li> <Li> 1.4 Malta </Li> <Li> 1.5 Other examples </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Comparisons with other party systems </Li> <Li> 3 Causes </Li> <Li> 4 Third parties </Li> <Li> 5 Advantages </Li> <Li> 6 Disadvantages </Li> <Li> 7 History <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Beginnings of parties in Britain </Li> <Li> 7.2 Emergence of the two - party system in Britain </Li> <Li> 7.3 History of American political parties </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 See also </Li> <Li> 9 References </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Examples ( edit ) </H2> <H3> United States ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section does not cite any sources .

In the First Party System , only Alexander Hamilton 's Federalist Party and Thomas Jefferson 's Democratic - Republican Party were significant political parties . Toward the end of the First Party System , the Republicans dominated a one - party system ( primarily under the Presidency of James Monroe ) . Under the Second Party System , the Democratic - Republican Party split during the election of 1824 into Adams ' Men and Jackson 's Men . In 1828 , the modern Democratic Party formed in support of Andrew Jackson . The National Republicans were formed in support of John Quincy Adams . After the National Republicans collapsed , the Whig Party and the Free Soil Party quickly formed and collapsed . In 1854 , the modern Republican Party formed from a loose coalition of former Whigs , Free Soilers and other anti-slavery activists . Abraham Lincoln became the first Republican president in 1860 . </P> <P> During the Third Party System , the Republican Party was the dominant political faction , but the Democrats held a strong , loyal coalition in the Solid South . During the Fourth Party System , the Republicans remained the dominant Presidential party , although Democrats Grover Cleveland and Woodrow Wilson were both elected to two terms . In 1932 , at the onset of the Fifth Party System , Democrats took firm control of national politics with the landslide victories of Franklin D. Roosevelt in four consecutive elections . Other than the two terms of Republican Dwight Eisenhower from 1953 to 1961 , Democrats retained firm control of the Presidency until the mid-1960s . Since the mid-1960s , despite a number of landslides ( such as Richard Nixon carrying 49 states and 61 % of the popular vote over George McGovern in 1972 ; Ronald Reagan carrying 49 states and 58 % of the popular vote over Walter Mondale in 1984 ) , Presidential elections have been competitive between the predominant Republican and Democratic parties and no one party has been able to hold the Presidency for more than three consecutive terms , except for the elections from 1932 through 1948 when FDR won 4 elections and Truman one , both as Democrats . In the election of 2012 , only 4 % separated the popular vote between Barack Obama ( 51 % ) and Mitt Romney ( 47 % ) , although Obama won the electoral vote by a landslide ( 332 -- 206 ) . </P> <P> Throughout every American party system , no third party has won a Presidential election or majorities in either house of Congress . Despite that , third parties and third party candidates have gained traction and support . In the election of 1912 , Theodore Roosevelt won 27 % of the popular vote and 88 electoral votes running as a Progressive . In the 1992 Presidential election , Ross Perot won 19 % of the popular vote but no electoral votes running as an Independent . </P> <H3> Commonwealth countries ( edit ) </H3> <P> In countries such as Britain , two major parties emerge which have strong influence and tend to elect most of the candidates , but a multitude of lesser parties exist with varying degrees of influence , and sometimes these lesser parties are able to elect officials who participate in the legislature . In political systems based on the Westminster system , which is a particular style of parliamentary democracy based on the British model and found in many commonwealth countries , a majority party will form the government and the minority party will form the opposition , and coalitions of lesser parties are possible ; in the rare circumstance in which neither party is the majority , a hung parliament arises . Sometimes these systems are described as two - party systems but they are usually referred to as multi-party systems . There is not always a sharp boundary between a two - party system and a multi-party system . </P> <P> Generally , a two - party system becomes a dichotomous division of the political spectrum with an ostensibly right - wing and left - wing party : the Nationalist Party vs. the Labour Party in Malta , Labor vs. Liberal / National Coalition in Australia , Republicans vs. Democrats in the United States and the Conservative Party vs. the Labour Party in the United Kingdom . </P> <P> Other parties in these countries may have seen candidates elected to local or subnational office , however . Historian John Hicks claims that the United States has never possessed for any considerable period of time the two party system in its pure and undefiled form . </P> <P> In some governments , certain chambers may resemble a two - party system and others a multi-party system . For example , the politics of Australia are largely two - party ( the Liberal / National Coalition is often considered a single party at a national level due to their long - standing alliance in forming government and additionally rarely compete for the same seat ) for the Australian House of Representatives , which is elected by instant - runoff voting , known within Australia as preferential voting . However , third parties are more common in the Australian Senate , which uses a proportional voting system more amenable to minor parties . </P> <P> In the politics of Canada , while having a multiparty system federally and in the largest provinces of Ontario , Quebec and Alberta , many of the provinces have effectively become two - party systems in which only two parties regularly get members elected . Examples include British Columbia ( where the battles are between the New Democratic Party and the BC Liberals ) , Saskatchewan ( between the Saskatchewan Party and New Democratic Party ) , New Brunswick ( between the Liberals and the Progressive Conservatives ) and Prince Edward Island ( between Liberals and Progressive Conservatives ) . </P> <H3> India ( edit ) </H3> <P> India also shows characteristics of a two party system with the United Progressive Alliance ( UPA ) and National Democratic Alliance ( NDA ) as the two main players . It is to be noted that both UPA and NDA are not two political parties but alliances of several smaller parties . Other smaller parties not aligned with either NDA or UPA exist , and overall command about 20 % of the 2009 seats in the Lok Sabha and had further increased to 28 % in 2014 general elections </P> <H3> Malta ( edit ) </H3> <P> Malta is somewhat unusual in that while the electoral system is single transferable vote ( STV ) , traditionally associated with proportional representation , minor parties have not earned much success . Politics is dominated between the centre - left Labour Party and the centre - right Nationalist Party , with no third parties winning seats in Parliament between 1962 and 2017 . </P> <H3> Other examples ( edit ) </H3> <P> The English speaking countries of the Caribbean while inheriting their basic political system from Great Britain have become two party systems . The politics of Jamaica are between the People 's National Party and the Jamaica Labour Party . The politics of Guyana are between the People 's Progressive Party and APNU which is actually a coalition of smaller parties . The politics of Trinidad and Tobago are between the People 's National Movement and the People 's Partnership which is also a coalition . The Politics of Belize are between the United Democratic Party and the People 's United Party . The Politics of the Bahamas are between the Progressive Liberal Party and the Free National Movement . The politics of Barbados are between the Democratic Labour Party and the Barbados Labour Party . </P> <P> The politics of Zimbabwe are effec\n\nQuestion:\nwhen did the two party system start in the united states\n", "answer": "1824"}

Her friend , retired lawyer Celeste Wright , is the mother of twin sons who are also beginning at that same school . New to town is Jane Chapman -- a young single mother raising her son , Ziggy . Renata Klein 's daughter Amabella accuses Ziggy of attempting to choke her , which he denies . Madeline and Celeste befriend Jane . Secrets are revealed , including that Madeline is struggling to cope with her ex-husband Nathan 's marriage to a yoga instructor named Bonnie and also trying to build a relationship with her older daughter .

Child actor Bryan Beck stepped into the role on September 8 , 1982 to 1986 . </P> <P> On December 19 , 1991 , Burton stepped into the role on a contractual basis as a SORASed Jason Quartermaine . In November 1999 , ABC confirmed that Burton had decided not to renew his contract which expired in December to pursue other opportunities . Burton last appeared on contract on January 27 , 2000 . In June 2000 , ABC confirmed that Burton would reprise his role for a six - week stint starting on August 25 , 2000 until he last appeared on October 10 , 2000 . In December 2000 , it was announced that Burton would return to the series once again and began airing on January 29 , 2001 . In January 2001 , Burton announced that his return was only temporary due to his commitment to film a pilot for his DreamWorks Television development deal . Whether he returned to the role full - time would depend on whether the series was picked up . The pilot was not picked up , Burton landed a role in a major motion picture leading to his departure on April 29 , 2001 . Burton returned to the series on contract in 2002 during May Sweeps . </P> <P> In late 2008 , Burton 's contract expired and forcing to make a decision on re-signing with the show . After months of speculation , he announced in a public appearance that he re-signed with the show . Burton stated that he would be willing to take a pay cut because he understands that money is a lot tighter now than it has been in recent years and stated that he is blessed to have a job right now . In 2011 , rumors began circulating that Burton could depart from the series due to contract negotiations . However , in May 2011 Burton announced via Twitter that he had re-signed with the series again . On August 23 , 2012 , Jamey Giddens of the website Daytime Confidential reported that contract negotiations were not going well and Burton was close to walking away from the series . On August 28 , 2012 , Burton confirmed in an interview with TV Guide 's Michael Logan that he would exit the series and agreed to stay long enough for the producers to write his character out properly . Following the announcement that Sean Kanan ( A.J. Quartermaine ) was returning to the series in an undisclosed role , rumors began circulating that Kanan might be a recast of Jason . Kanan 's resemblance to Burton fed into the rumors . </P> <P> On September 2 , 2014 , executive producer Frank Valentini announced on Twitter that former All My Children and The Young and the Restless actor Billy Miller would join the cast as Jason . On September 30 , 2014 , Miller 's air date as Jason was revealed to be on October 1 . </P> <P> In June 2017 , it was announced that Burton would return to the series in an undisclosed role , later referred to as `` Patient 6 . '' In November 2017 , it was announced that Burton had reprised the role of Jason , while Miller 's casting was retconned to the character of Andrew Cain . </P> <H3> Characterization ( edit ) </H3> `` I guess the writers started seeing something that was happening and they had the idea of making me a new character and basically starting from scratch . It has been a great journey for me as an actor and for me , personally . '' -- Burton on Jason Morgan <P> Steve Burton 's early years on the soap as the `` rich , wholesome preppy '' Jason Quartermaine would come to a shocking , and dramatic end in 1995 after a car accident caused by his brother , A.J. leaves the character as a brain damaged amnesiac . Following Jason 's split from the Quartermaines , except for his sister Emily and grandmother Lila Morgan Quartermaine ( Anna Lee ) , and a change of his surname to Morgan , he would become the right - hand man for mob boss , Sonny Corinthos ( Maurice Benard ) . At the time , Burton was considering leaving the show and joked that a producer noted that he played every scene , the same way , as if someone was about to die . Burton 's decision to stay stemmed from a conversation with Benard who gave him advice on how to improve . While still portraying Jason Quartermaine , the writers saw the chemistry between him and Benard and decided to create Jason Morgan . </P> `` Am I a villain ? I guess . If I kill people , then I guess I 'm a villain . The audience knows that it 's been done . But they do n't care . '' -- Burton on his character 's change in direction <P> With a new personality shift , Burton 's Jason went from `` preppy and wholesome '' to `` angry , stoic and emotionless . '' In the early stages of his transformation into Jason Morgan , he would experience fits of rage and was even given the nickname `` anger boy . '' Post accident , as Jason matured the fits of rage subsided , Jason was very light and fun during his relationship with Robin Scorpio . It was n't until after he was hurt multiple times that Jason grew darker and more intense . Jason was seen as `` stone cold , '' and he did n't show much personality , unless it was with his closest loved ones . Despite the drastic change , Burton described his character as `` vulnerable , caring , honest , and honorable '' around those that he loves . Burton welcomed the change in story for his character , noting that it can sometimes become annoying playing `` just plain nice '' all the time . Within the mob and despite constant conflicts with law enforcement , Jason operated as a vigilante often taking down criminals who targeted the Corinthos family and tried to bring illegal substances and weapons into Port Charles , New York . Jason was known to show loyalty and compassion to those he held closest to him . His acts of extreme loyalty and compassion could be seen through his friendships with Sonny and Carly , his romantic relationships and his relationship with his nephew Michael , who he raised for the first year of Michael 's life . The passing years also saw a thaw in Jason 's relationship with the Quartermaines . The death of his father Alan and a shooting that left Michael in a year - long coma opened his eyes to what the Quartermaines suffered after his own accident . For that point on , Jason was shown to be more open to a relationship with his mother Monica , and eventually his grandfather Edward Quartermaine ( John Ingle ) . The extent of the thaw with his family could also be seen through Jason 's decision to name his son , Daniel Edward , after his grandfather . </P> <H2> Storylines ( edit ) </H2> <H3> 1980s ( edit ) </H3> <P> Jason was conceived out of his father , Alan Quartermaine 's ( Stuart Damon ) , affair with Susan Moore ( Gail Ramsey ) . Jason was born on September 14 , 1981 at Our Lady of Mercy Hospital in New York City . When Jason was born , Alan supported him financially , but was fighting for custody of his other son , A.J. . Jason lived with his mother and Scott Baldwin ( Kin Shriner ) up until her death , upon which he lived with Susan 's aunt , Alice Grant ( Lieux Dressler ) . Then he moved into the Quartermaine mansion with Alan . Alan 's wife , Monica ( Leslie Charleson ) , initially rejected Jason , but eventually grew to love him and later adopted him . Jason and A.J. were sent off to boarding school as children . In December 1991 , Jason was aged several years , re-establishing his birth year as 1974 then to 1976 in 2016 . </P> <H3> 1990s ( edit ) </H3> <P> When a newly SORASed Jason and older brother A.J. return to town , Jason , who is a successful student and athlete , is treated as the family favorite while A.J. is failing and dealing with alcoholism . Jason has relationships with Karen Wexler ( Cari Shayne ) , Brenda Barrett ( Vanessa Marcil ) , Robin Sc\n", "answer": "2012"}

The basic format consists of five digits .

The United States Post Office Department ( USPOD ) implemented postal zones for numerous large cities in 1943 . For example : </P> <P> Mr. John Smith </P> <P> 3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue </P> Minneapolis 16 , Minnesota <P> The `` 16 '' was the number of the postal zone from the specific city . </P> <P> By the early 1960s , a more organized system was needed , and non-mandatory five - digit ZIP Codes were introduced nationwide on July 1 , 1963 . The USPOD issued its Publication 59 : Abbreviations for Use with ZIP Code on October 1 , 1963 , with the list of two - letter state abbreviations which are generally written with both letters capitalized . An earlier list in June had proposed capitalized abbreviations ranging from two to five letters . According to Publication 59 , the two - letter standard was `` based on a maximum 23 - position line , because this has been found to be the most universally acceptable line capacity basis for major addressing systems '' , which would be exceeded by a long city name combined with a multi-letter state abbreviation , such as `` Sacramento , Calif . '' along with the ZIP Code . The abbreviations have remained unchanged , with the exception of Nebraska , which was changed from NB to NE in 1969 at the request of the Canadian postal administration , to avoid confusion with the Canadian province of New Brunswick . </P> <P> Robert Moon is considered the father of the ZIP Code ; he submitted his proposal in 1944 while working as a postal inspector . The post office only credits Moon with the first three digits of the ZIP Code , which describe the sectional center facility ( SCF ) or `` sec center . '' An SCF is a central mail processing facility with those three digits . The SCF sorts mail to all post offices with those first three digits in their ZIP Codes . The mail is sorted according to the final two digits of the ZIP Code and sent to the corresponding post offices in the early morning . Sectional centers do not deliver mail and are not open to the public ( though the building may include a post office open to the public ) , and most of their employees work night shift . Mail picked up at post offices is sent to their own SCF in the afternoon , where the mail is sorted overnight . In the cases of large cities , the last two digits coincide with the older postal zone number thus : </P> <P> Mr. John Smith </P> <P> 3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue </P> Minneapolis , MN 55416 <P> In 1967 , these became mandatory for second and third - class bulk mailers , and the system was soon adopted generally . The United States Post Office used a cartoon character which it called Mr. ZIP to promote the use of the ZIP Code . He was often depicted with a legend such as `` USE ZIP CODE '' in the selvage of panes of postage stamps or on the covers of booklet panes of stamps . </P> <P> In 1971 Elmira ( NY ) Star Gazette reporter Dick Baumbach found out the White House was not using a zip code on its envelopes . Herb Klein , special assistant to President Nixon , responded by saying the next printing of envelopes would include the zip code . That did occur . </P> <H3> ZIP + 4 ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1983 , the U.S. Postal Service introduced an expanded ZIP Code system that it called ZIP + 4 , often called `` plus - four codes '' , `` add - on codes '' , or `` add - ons '' . A ZIP + 4 Code uses the basic five - digit code plus four additional digits to identify a geographic segment within the five - digit delivery area , such as a city block , a group of apartments , an individual high - volume receiver of mail , a post office box , or any other unit that could use an extra identifier to aid in efficient mail sorting and delivery . However , initial attempts to promote universal use of the new format met with public resistance and today the plus - four code is not required . In general , mail is read by a multiline optical character reader ( MLOCR ) that almost instantly determines the correct ZIP + 4 Code from the address -- along with the even more specific delivery point -- and sprays an Intelligent Mail barcode ( IM ) on the face of the mail piece that corresponds to 11 digits -- nine for the ZIP + 4 Code and two for the delivery point . </P> <P> For Post Office Boxes , the general ( but not invariable ) rule is that each box has its own ZIP + 4 code . The add - on code is often one of the following : the last four digits of the box number ( e.g. PO Box 107050 , Albany , NY 12201 - 7050 ) , zero plus the last three digits of the box number ( e.g. , PO Box 17727 , Eagle River , AK 99577 - 0727 ) , or , if the box number consists of fewer than four digits , enough zeros are attached to the front of the box number to produce a four - digit number ( e.g. , PO Box 77 , Juneau , AK 99750 - 0077 ) . However , there is no uniform rule , so the ZIP + 4 Code must be looked up individually for each box . </P> <H3> Postal bar Code ( edit ) </H3> <P> The ZIP Code is often translated into an Intelligent Mail barcode that is printed on the mailpiece to make it easier for automated machines to sort . A barcode can be printed by the sender ( some word - processing programs such as WordPerfect and Microsoft Word include the feature - but is not recommended as the address to ZIP lookup tables can be significantly out of date ) . It is better to let the post office put one on when it processes the piece . In general , the post office uses OCR technology , though in some cases a human might have to read and enter the address . </P> <P> Customers who send bulk mail can get a discount on postage if they have printed the barcode themselves and have presorted the mail . This requires more than just a simple font ; mailing lists must be standardized with up - to - date Coding Accuracy Support System ( CASS ) - certified software that adds and verifies a full , correct ZIP + 4 Code and an additional two digits representing the exact delivery point . Furthermore , mail must be sorted in a specific manner to an 11 digit zip with at least 150 mailpieces for each qualifying ZIP code and must be accompanied by documentation confirming this . These steps are usually done with PAVE - certified software that also prints the barcoded address labels and the barcoded sack or tray tags . </P> <P> This means that every single mailable point in the country has its own 12 - digit number ( at least in theory ) . The delivery - point digits ( the 10th and 11th digits ) are calculated based on the primary or secondary number of the address . The USPS publishes the rules for calculating the delivery point in a document called the CASS Technical Guide . However , when confronted with two addresses like 18 and 18C , often CASS will assign the same 12 - digit number to two distinct mail delivery points . The last digit is always a check digit , which is obtained by summing all 5 , 9 or 11 digits , taking the residue modulo 10 of this sum ( i.e. , the remainder after dividing by 10 ) and finally subtracting this from 10 . ( Thus , the check digit for 10001 - 0001 00 would be 7 , since 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 , 3 \u2261 3 ( mod 10 ) and 10 -- 3 = 7 . ) </P> <H2> Structure and allocation ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Scope and international mail ( edit ) </H3> <P> ZIP Codes designate delivery points within the United States ( including territories ) , and overseas stations of its armed forces . There are also ZIP Codes for independent countries of the Federated States of Micronesia , the Republic of the Marshall Islands , and the Republic of Palau , each of which is integrated into the U.S. postal system under a Compact of Free Association . </P> <P> Mail to U.S. diplomatic missions overseas is addressed as if it were addressed to a street address in Washington , D.C. The four - digit diplomatic pouch number is used as a building number , while the city in which the embassy or consulate is located is combined with the word `` Place '' to form a street name . Each mission uses a ZIP + 4 Code consisting of 20521 and the diplomatic pouch number . For example , the mailing address of the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi , India would be : </P> <P> Embassy of the United States of America </P> <P> 9000 New Delhi Place </P> Washington , DC 20521 - 9000 <H3> By type and use ( edit ) </H3> U.S. postage stamp , 1973 : `` It all depends on ZIP Code '' <P> There are four types of ZIP Codes : </P> <Ul> <Li> Unique : assigned to a single high - volume address </Li> <Li> Post Office Box only : used only for PO Boxes at a given facility , not for any other type of delivery </Li> <Li> Military : used to route mail for the U.S. military </Li> <Li> Standard : all other ZIP Codes . </Li> </Ul> <P> Unique ZIP Codes are used for governmental agencies , universities , businesses , or buildings that receive such extremely high volumes of mail that they need their own ZIP Codes . Government examples include 20505 for the Central Intelligence Agency in Washington , D.C. ; 81009 for the Federal Citizen Information Center of the U.S. General Services Administration ( GSA ) in Pueblo , Colorado . Examples of private address unique ZIP Codes include the headquarters of Wal - Mart ( 72716 ) . </P> <P> An example of a PO Box only ZIP Code is 22313 , which is used for PO Boxes at the main post office in Alexandria , Virginia , such as those used by the United States Patent and Trademark Office . In the area surrounding that post office , home and business mail delivery addresses use ZIP Code 22314 , which is thus a Standard ZIP Code . </P> <P> In certain exceptional cases , a nominally Standard - type ZIP Code may , in practice , be used as one of the three other types . For example , the ZIP Code 43210 in Columbus , Ohio is listed as a Standard - type ZIP Code . However , since its geographic boundaries are essentially coterminous with those of The Ohio State University 's main campus , it is effectively exclusive to the university even though it is not officially a `` Unique '' - type ZIP code . </P> <H3> By geography ( edit ) </H3> Primary state prefixes ( edit ) <P> ZIP Codes are numbered with the first digit representing a certain group of U.S. states , the second and third digits together representing a region in that group ( or perhaps a large city ) and the fourth and fifth digits representing a group of delivery addresses within that region . The main town in a region ( if applicable ) often gets the first ZIP Codes for that region ; afterward , the numerical order often follows the alphabetical order . Because ZIP Codes are intended for efficient postal delivery , there are unusual cases where a ZIP Code crosses state boundaries , such as a military facility spanning multiple states or remote areas of one state most easily serviced from a bordering state . For example , ZIP Code 42223 serves Fort Campbell , which spans Christian County , Kentucky and Montgomery County , Tennessee , and ZIP Code 97635 includes portions of Lake County , Oregon and Modoc County , California . </P> <P> In general , the first three digits designate a sectional center facility , the mail sorting and distribution center for an area . A sectional center facility may have more than one three - digit code assigned to it . For example , the Northern Virginia sectional center facility in Merrifield is assigned codes 220 , 221 , 222 and 223 . In some cases , a sectional center facility may serve an area in an adjacent state , usually due to the lack of a proper location for a center in that region . For example , 739 in Oklahoma is assigned to Liberal , Kansas ; 865 in Arizona is assigned to Gallup , New Mexico ; and 961 in California to Reno , Nevada . </P> <P> In terms of geographic location , many of the lowest ZIP Codes , which begin with ' 0 ' , are in the New England region . Also in the ' 0 ' region are New Jersey ( non-contiguous with the remainder of the ' 0 ' area ) , Puerto Rico , the \n\nQuestion:\nwhen did the usps start using zip codes\n", "answer": "1963"}

Like Australia , it first became accessible to university students in the country in 1989 . As of October 2015 , there are 1,926,000 broadband connections and 53,000 dialup connections in New Zealand , of which 1,661,000 are residential and 316,000 are business or government . ( For reference , there are 1,679,800 households in New Zealand as of September 2013 . ) </P> <P> Digital subscriber line ( DSL ) over phone lines provides two - thirds of broadband access in New Zealand . ADSL2+ is available in most parts of the country , with VDSL2 available in some areas . Fibre to the home cover over half of the main towns and cities . The phone and fibre networks are mostly owned by network company Chorus Limited , which wholesale services to retail ISPs . Parts of Wellington , Kapiti and Christchurch have cable internet access . Nearly all of the population is covered by 3G mobile broadband , with 4G available to the majority . Satellite internet is available throughout the country . </P> <P> As of July 2017 , Ookla reports the average download speed for fixed broadband as 61.21 Mbit / s and the average upload speed as 30.32 Mbit / s ( ranked 16th in the world ) . As of Q1 2017 , Akamai reports an average peak download speed of 70.8 Mbit / s ( 35th ) . For mobile broadband , as of July 2017 , Ookla reports the average speed as 35.19 Mbit / s , ranking it 14th in the world . Broadband pricing is at , or above the OECD average , and most connections have an unlimited data cap . There are more than 80 ISPs , with two of them having three - quarters of the market . The New Zealand Government is funding two broadband expansion initiatives , with the aim of providing fibre to the home of 80 % of the population and bringing broadband to 97.8 % of the population by 2019 .

There are also 485,000 ( 25 % ) cellular , satellite , cable and fixed wireless connections , and 105,000 ( 5 % ) fibre connections . </P> <H3> DSL ( edit ) </H3> <P> Most of the telephone infrastructure is owned by Chorus . Chorus provides ADSL ( up to 8 / 1 Mbit / s ) , ADSL2+ ( up to 24 / 1 Mbit / s ) and VDSL2 ( up to 100 / 50 Mbit / s or 70 / 30 Mbit / s ) services over the copper phone network . </P> <P> Contrary to the usual practice overseas , most connections are at full speed , instead plans differ in the amount of data included . As DSL is sensitive to distance , the closer the customer is to the equipment , the faster the connections . Chorus has implemented a fibre - to - the - node ( also known as `` cabinetisation '' ) project to bring the equipment closer to the user , so 91 % of the population is able to access a DSL connection of 10Mbit / s or more . As of January 2014 , 97.3 % of phone lines are capable of accessing ADSL and 62.4 % are capable of VDSL2 . </P> <P> As of December 2014 , Chorus has about 1.717 million copper connections , of which 1.133 million ( 66 % ) has broadband service provided using Chorus equipment . 1.040 million ( 92 % ) are using ADSL1 / 2 + and 93,000 ( 8 % ) are using VDSL2 . DSL is usually sold with a phoneline service ( called `` clothed DSL '' ) , but is also available without the phoneline ( called `` naked DSL '' ) . 113,000 ( 11 % ) of the ADSL ( 2 + ) connections , and 23,000 ( 25 % ) of the VDSL2 connections are naked . </P> <P> Chorus can not sell services directly to customers , instead , they wholesale services to internet retailers at regulated prices . The copper loop is unbundled , so operators like Vodafone , Compass and CallPlus ( Slingshot / Orcon ) can install their own equipment at telephone exchanges and rent just the copper line from Chorus . As of December 2013 , 131,000 ( 8 % ) lines are unbundled . </P> <H3> Fibre ( edit ) </H3> See also : Fiber to the premises by country \u00a7 New Zealand <P> Fibre to the home is being rolled out to the urban areas of the country via the Ultra-Fast Broadband scheme ( see below ) . The network is being constructed using Gigabit - capable Passive Optical Networks ( GPON ) technology , which is reliable , comparatively low - cost and has been used in projects such as Google Fiber . </P> <P> As of March 2017 , the project is 74 % complete , with fibre available to 1,103,874 users , of which 367,788 have signed up . Residential plans are between 30 / 10 Mbit / s and 1000 / 500 Mbit / s , with 1000 Mbit / s ( gigabit ) services available in many areas . As of March 2017 , there are 92 retailers of UFB services . </P> <P> P2P fibre is available in business areas of the cities from several companies , including Chorus , Vodafone , CityLink and Vector . </P> <H3> Cable ( edit ) </H3> <P> Vodafone has a DOCSIS 3.1 hybrid fibre - coaxial network covering parts of Kapiti , 85 % of Wellington and almost two - thirds of Christchurch , a total of 145,000 homes . There are about 60,000 customers on the cable network . It provides plans of 200 / 20Mbit / s and 1000 / 100Mbit / s . </P> <H3> Mobile ( edit ) </H3> <P> There are three physical cellphone networks in the country . Vodafone provides 2G and 3G coverage to 97.5 % of the population and LTE to 84 % . Spark provides 3G coverage to 97 % and LTE to `` over two - thirds '' . 2degrees has a 2G / 3G network covering 96 % of the population , with users roaming to Vodafone outside that area . 2degrees also has 4G LTE coverage to 86 % of the population . </P> <H3> Fixed wireless ( edit ) </H3> <P> There are a total of about 50,000 fixed wireless connections using a variety of providers . </P> <P> Vodafone offers a fixed wireless service provided over LTE / HSPA+ in rural areas under the government - subsidized Rural Broadband Initiative scheme ( see below ) . As a condition of the subsidy , Vodafone also wholesales this service to other retailers . Spark also offers a fixed wireless service over LTE in rural areas . </P> <P> Woosh offered a fixed wireless service in Southland until 1 July 2016 . It used a proprietary TDD - CDMA technology by IP Wireless that was no longer supported by vendors . The maximum speed was 1.6 Mbit / s . </P> <P> There are smaller regional providers covering rural areas . They typically use the unlicensed 2.4 and 5.8 GHz bands . </P> <H3> Satellite ( edit ) </H3> <P> Satellite is available throughout the country from Farmside ( using IPSTAR ) and Wireless Nation ( using Optus D2 ) for people in areas unserviced by broadband . </P> <H3> Dial - up ( edit ) </H3> <P> Almost every household is able to access dial - up , thanks to Chorus inheriting the formerly state - owned copper phone network . For the ten thousand most remote households , their phone lines are connected back to the exchange via a radio system called customer multi-access radio ( CMAR ) . These households can only access 14.4 kbit / s speeds . As of October 2015 , there were 53,000 dial - up connections ( 3 % of all connections ) , down from 99,000 ( 5 % ) in 2013 , and 127,000 ( 7 % ) in 2012 . </P> <H2> Government broadband upgrade plan ( edit ) </H2> <P> The government has two plans to bring fast broadband to 97.8 % of the population by 2019 . </P> <H3> Ultra-Fast broadband Initiative ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Ultra-Fast Broadband <P> The Government is spending NZ $1.35 billion on public - private partnerships with Chorus and three local electricity network companies to roll out fibre - to - the - home connection in all main towns and cities with population over 10,000 . The programme aims to deliver ultra-fast broadband capable of at least 100 Mbit / s download and 50Mbit / s upload to 75 % of New Zealanders by 2019 . In total , 1,340,000 households will be connected . </P> <P> In 2015 , the Government launched a $152 million to $210 million extension of the original UFB programme , with the aim of extending UFB programme coverage from 75 per cent to 80 per cent of New Zealanders . </P> <H3> Rural broadband Initiative ( edit ) </H3> <P> The government has awarded a $300 million Rural Broadband Initiative ( RBI ) contract to Vodafone and Chorus to bring broadband of at least 5Mbit / s to 86 % of rural customers by 2016 . Vodafone will install 154 new cell towers and upgrade 387 towers , adding 250,000 addresses to its 3G coverage . As of June 2015 , 116 new towers have been installed and 314 towers upgraded , covering approximately 242,814 addresses . As of June 2014 , there are 6064 customers on the RBI wireless network . By January 2016 , Vodafone was actively extending its 4G network , and on track to deliver speeds as high as 100Mbit / s . Chorus will provide fibre to the new Vodafone towers , 1040 schools , 183 libraries and 50 health providers . Chorus will also be upgrading or installing 1215 new cabinets to increase GPON , VDSL and ADSL coverage to 100,969 lines . As of June 2015 , 93,348 lines have been upgraded , with a 80 % uptake rate . </P> <P> In 2015 , in addition to expanding the coverage of the UFB programme , the government also launched a further $100 million investment to expand the RBI , and $50 million to improve mobile coverage in black spot areas . </P> <H2> Data caps ( edit ) </H2> <Table> Data caps ( as of October 2014 ) <Tr> <Th> Data cap ( GB / month ) </Th> <Th> Connections </Th> <Th> Percentage </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> < 5 </Td> <Td> 204,000 </Td> <Td> 11 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 5 - 20 </Td> <Td> 64,000 </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 20 - 50 </Td> <Td> 492,000 </Td> <Td> 26 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 50 - 100 </Td> <Td> 411,000 </Td> <Td> 21 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> > 100 </Td> <Td> 125,000 </Td> <Td> 6 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> None </Td> <Td> 628,000 </Td> <Td> 33 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> As of October 2015 , 67 % of internet connections have a fixed data cap .

Active as a group between 1985 and 1995 , these four artists recorded three major label albums as The Highwaymen : two on Columbia Records and one for Liberty Records . Their Columbia works produced three chart singles , including the number one `` Highwayman '' in 1985 . </P> <P> Between the years of 1996 and 1999 , Nelson , Kristofferson , Cash , and Jennings also provided the voice and dramatization for the Louis L'Amour Collection , a four CD box set of seven Louis L'Amour stories published by the HighBridge Company , although the four were not credited as `` The Highwaymen '' in this work . </P> <P> Besides the four formal members of the group , only one other vocal recording artist ever appeared on a Highwaymen recording : Johnny Rodriguez , who provided Spanish vocal on `` Deportee '' , a Woody Guthrie composition , from `` Highwayman '' . </P> <P> The four original members starred in a movie together : the 1986 film Stagecoach . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Albums <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Highwayman </Li> <Li> 1.2 Highwayman 2 </Li> <Li> 1.3 The Road Goes on Forever </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Discography <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Studio albums </Li> <Li> 2.2 Compilation albums </Li> <Li> 2.3 Singles </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Videography <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Music videos </Li> <Li> 3.2 Video albums </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Albums ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Highwayman ( edit ) </H3> <P> Formed in 1985 , the group did not have an official name when they released their first album on Columbia Records . The album , entitled Highwayman , was credited to `` Nelson , Jennings , Cash , Kristofferson '' . The single `` Highwayman '' , a Jimmy Webb composition , became a # 1 country hit . Their remake of Guy Clark 's `` Desperados Waiting for a Train '' reached the Top 20 . ( Clark is frequently referred to as `` The Fifth Highwayman '' . ) The album was produced by Chips Moman . </P> <H3> Highwayman 2 ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1990 , the group reunited for a second effort , titled Highwayman 2 , which reached # 4 on the country album chart . The Lee Clayton - penned song `` Silver Stallion '' was the first single and made the country Top 40 . The album was nominated for a Grammy for Best Country Vocal Collaboration . Highwayman 2 was produced , once again , by Moman .

( later known as Rankin / Bass Productions ) and currently distributed by Universal Television . It first aired Sunday , December 6 , 1964 , on the NBC television network in the United States , and was sponsored by General Electric under the umbrella title of The General Electric Fantasy Hour . The special was based on the Johnny Marks song `` Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer '' which was itself based on the poem of the same name written in 1939 by Marks ' brother - in - law , Robert L. May . Since 1972 , the special has aired on CBS , with the network unveiling a high - definition , digitally remastered version of the program in 2005 . As with A Charlie Brown Christmas and How the Grinch Stole Christmas , Rudolph no longer airs just once annually , but several times during the Christmas and holiday season on CBS . Unlike other holiday specials that also air on several cable channels ( including Freeform ) , Rudolph only airs on CBS . It has been telecast every year since 1964 , making it the longest continuously running Christmas TV special in history . 2014 marked the 50th anniversary of the television special and a series of postage stamps featuring Rudolph was issued by the United States Postal Service on November 6 , 2014 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Cast </Li> <Li> 3 Production <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Aftermath </Li> <Li> 3.2 Production credits </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Different versions <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Original 1964 NBC broadcast edit </Li> <Li> 4.2 1965 -- 1997 telecasts </Li> <Li> 4.3 1998 -- CBS telecasts </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Home media </Li> <Li> 6 Soundtrack </Li> <Li> 7 Merchandise </Li> <Li> 8 Reception </Li> <Li> 9 Sequels </Li> <Li> 10 In popular culture <Ul> <Li> 10.1 Films by Corky Quakenbush </Li> <Li> 10.2 Uses in advertising </Li> <Li> 10.3 Other References </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 11 Copyright issues </Li> <Li> 12 See also </Li> <Li> 13 References </Li> <Li> 14 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> Sam the Snowman welcomes the viewers to Christmastown at the North Pole and introduces Santa and Mrs. Claus who live in a castle located north of the Christmas Tree Forest . Mrs. Claus fusses over Santa as she wants him to fatten up by Christmas Eve . Sam then recalls the year Christmas was almost cancelled due to a snowstorm and tells the story of how a very special reindeer saved the day . </P> <P> Donner , Santa 's lead reindeer , and his wife have given birth to their new baby fawn , Rudolph . Upon admiring him , they are surprised to see that Rudolph has been born with a glowing red nose . When Santa arrives , he warns Donner that Rudolph will not make the sleigh team because of his nose . Donner then decides to hide the nose by covering it with mud to allow Rudolph to fit in with all the other reindeer . </P> <P> Over Rudolph 's first year of life , Donner trains him in the basics of being a reindeer , including hiding from the Abominable Snow Monster of the North . Rudolph enters the reindeer games , competing against his fellow fawns . During flight practice , Rudolph meets a doe named Clarice who tells him he is cute , and kisses him , which causes an elated Rudolph to fly higher and faster than everyone else . However , while celebrating with the other bucks , Rudolph 's nose cover pops off , and the others react with fear , then scorn and finally rejection as Rudolph is kicked out of the Reindeer Games . Walking away , Rudolph walks with Clarice , who supports him , until her father firmly tells her to never have any more contacts with a red - nosed reindeer . Then , Rudolph meets up with Hermey , an elf who ran away from Santa 's workshop because he wanted to be a dentist instead of making toys , and they decide to run away together . The pair then meet a prospector named Yukon Cornelius , who has fruitlessly searched his whole life for silver and gold . After escaping the snow monster on an ice floe , the trio crash land on the Island of Misfit Toys where unloved or unwanted toys live with their ruler , a winged lion named King Moonracer . The king allows the group to stay one night on the island in exchange for returning to Christmastown to ask Santa to find homes for the unwanted toys . However , Rudolph leaves the island in the middle of the night on his own , fearing that his nose , which attracts the snow monster , will endanger his friends . </P> <P> Time goes by and Rudolph grows into adulthood ; he tries and fails to find a place to settle where he will be accepted despite his nose and decides to return home . There , he finds that his parents and Clarice have been looking for him for months ; he sets out once again to find them , only to discover that the snow monster has captured them . Rudolph tries to save Clarice from being eaten , but the monster hits him in the head with a stalactite , dazing him . Hermey and Yukon return to Christmastown and go to save Rudolph . Hermey , posing as a pig , lures the monster out of his cave and Yukon drops rocks on his head to knock him out . Hermey then pulls out all the monster 's teeth . Realizing Yukon drives the toothless ( and now terrified ) monster back , only to follow it over the cliff with all his pack dogs . Mourning Yukon 's presumed death , Rudolph , Hermey , Clarice , and the Donners return home where everyone apologizes to them . After hearing their story , Santa welcomes the group back to Christmastown , promises that he will find homes for the Misfit Toys , Hermey opens his own dentist 's office , and Clarice 's father apologizes for being so hard on Rudolph . Yukon then returns with a reformed snow monster ( Yukon notes that they bounce ) and demonstrates the beast 's ability to trim a Christmas tree . While everybody 's celebrating , Santa interrupts , grimly informing everyone that because of the storm , he is forced to cancel the Christmas trip . Santa is soon distracted by Rudolph 's red nose and realizes that its light could cut through the storm . He asks Rudolph to lead the sleigh and Rudolph agrees . The team then flies off to the island and pick up the toys . The special ends with Santa wishing the viewers a merry Christmas as he and Rudolph fly off into the night . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> Hermey and Rudolph <Ul> <Li> Billie Mae Richards voices Rudolph , a reindeer with strong mental ( he learns to speak shortly after birth ) and physical strength who is shunned for his nonconforming red nose , but later saves Christmas . </Li> <Li> Stan Francis voices : <Ul> <Li> Santa Claus , portrayed in the special as a moody , nervous and `` skinny Santa '' whose fears are only allayed when he conjures the idea of using Rudolph 's nose to lead the sleigh . </Li> <Li> King Moonracer , a winged lion who rules the entire Island of Misfit Toys . King Moonracer 's voice uses a reverb effect to distinguish it from Santa Claus . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Paul Kligman voices : <Ul> <Li> Donner , Rudolph 's father and Santa 's most prized reindeer . While he loves and accepts Rudolph , he shows great concern that society will reject him for his nose and tries to protect him by creating a nose cover . </Li> <Li> Comet , head coach of the Reindeer Games . </Li> <Li> Clarice 's unnamed father , who forbids Clarice from shaming the family by associating with a red - nosed reindeer . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Burl Ives voices Sam the Snowman , the narrator . </Li> <Li> Paul Soles voices Hermey , an elf who dreams of pursuing a career in dentistry and `` feels different '' from the other elves . He eventually is forced out and runs off with Rudolph . </Li> <Li> Janis Orenstein voices Clarice , a female reindeer who is the only one of Rudolph 's age to not reject him . She later joins Rudolph 's parents in the search party . </Li> <Li> Larry D. Mann voices Yukon Cornelius , the `` greatest prospector of the North '' who joins Rudolph and Hermey on their journey but never finds the silver and gold he seeks . </Li> <Li> Peg Dixon voices : <Ul> <Li> Mrs. Claus , a pushy wife who mocks her husband 's lack of appetite . </Li> <Li> Mrs. Donner , a loving and mostly submissive wife . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Carl Banas voices : <Ul> <Li> The Head Elf . For the Head Elf 's voice , Banas uses a meek Bill Thompson - like voice when speaking in front of Santa Claus , but turns into a ruthless boss with a voice similar to Mel Blanc 's Yosemite Sam or Cosmo Spacely when Santa is not around . </Li> <Li> Various Misfit Toys , including a Spotted Elephant , King Moonracer 's footman ; a bird that swims , a cowboy who rides an ostrich , a train with square wheels on his caboose , two teddy bears ( one on a bicycle and one with wings ) , a boat that does n't float , a set of clown nesting dolls with a wind - up mouse as the last one , a water pistol that shoots jelly , a plane that ca n't fly , a toy car that only drives in reverse , and a scooter with two wheels in front and one in back . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Alfie Scopp voices : <Ul> <Li> Fireball , who introduces Rudolph to the opposite sex , but later snubs Rudolph when his red nose is revealed . </Li> <Li> Charlie - In - The - Box , the island 's sentry . </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> Corinne Conley voices Dolly , a seemingly normal girl rag doll on the Island of Misfit Toys . Her misfit problem is never explained on the special ; many decades later , on NPR 's Wait Wait ... Do n't Tell Me ! news quiz show ( broadcast December 8 , 2007 ) , Rudolph 's producer , Arthur Rankin Jr. , noted that Dolly 's problem was psychological , caused by being abandoned by her owner ( named as Sue in the special ) and suffering depression from feeling uncared - for . </Li> </Ul> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <P> The TV special , with the teleplay by Romeo Muller , introduced several new characters inspired by the song 's lyrics . Muller told an interviewer shortly before his death that he would have preferred to base the teleplay on May 's original book , but could not find a copy . Other than Burl Ives , all characters were portrayed by Canadian actors recorded at RCA studios in Toronto under the supervision of Bernard Cowan . </P> <P> After the script , concept designs and storyboards for Rudolph were done by Arthur Rankin , Jr. and his staff of artists at Rankin / Bass in New York City . The company 's trademark stop motion animation process , known as `` Animagic '' , was filmed at MOM Productions in Tokyo with supervision by Tadahito Mochinaga and associate direction by Kizo Nagashima . Besides Rudolph , Mochinaga and the rest of the Japanese puppet animation staff are also known for their partnership with Rankin / Bass on their other Animagic productions almost throughout the 1960s , from The New Adventures of\n", "answer": "1964"}

The answer should be a number\n\nDocument:\n Congo remained present in the region between the 14th and the early 19th centuries . Belgian colonization began when King Leopold II founded the Congo Free State , a corporate state run solely by King Leopold . Reports of widespread murder and torture in the rubber plantations led the Belgian government to seize the Congo from Leopold II and establish the Belgian Congo . Under Belgian rule numerous Christian organizations attempted to Westernize the Congolese people . </P> <P> After an uprising by the Congolese people , Belgium surrendered to the independence of the Congo in 1960 . However , the Congo remained unstable because tribal leaders had more power than the central government . Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba tried to restore order with the aid of the Soviet Union as part of the Cold War , causing the United States to support a coup led by Colonel Joseph Mobutu in 1965 . Mobutu quickly seized complete power of the Congo and renamed the country Zaire . He sought to Africanize the country , changing his own name to Mobutu Sese Seko , and demanded that African citizens change their Western names to traditional African names . Mobutu sought to repress any opposition to his rule , in which he successfully did throughout the 1980s . However , with his regime weakened in the 1990s , Mobutu was forced to agree to a power - sharing government with the opposition party . Mobutu remained the head of state and promised elections within the next two years that never took place . </P> <P> In the First Congo War , Rwanda invaded Zaire ; Mobutu lost his power during this process . Laurent - Desire Kabila took power and renamed the country the Democratic Republic of the Congo . After a disappointing rule under Kabila , the Second Congo War broke out , resulting in a regional war in which different African nations took part . Kabila was assassinated by his bodyguard in 2001 , and his son , Joseph , succeeded him and was later elected president by the Congolese government in 2006 . Kabila quickly sought peace . Foreign soldiers remained in the Congo for a few years and a power - sharing government between Kabila and the opposition party was set up . Kabila later resumed complete control over the Congo and was re-elected in a disputed election in 2011 . Today , the Congo remains dangerously unstable . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Early history </Li> <Li> 2 Colonial rule <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Congo Free State ( 1885 -- 1908 ) </Li> <Li> 2.2 Belgian Congo ( 1908 -- 60 ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Independence and the Congo Crisis ( 1960 -- 65 ) </Li> <Li> 4 Zaire ( 1965 -- 97 ) </Li> <Li> 5 Civil Wars ( 1996 - 2003 ) <Ul> <Li> 5.1 First Congo War ( 1996 -- 97 ) </Li> <Li> 5.2 Second Congo War ( 1998 -- 2003 ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Joseph Kabila period <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Transitional government ( 2003 -- 06 ) </Li> <Li> 6.2 Kabila overstays his term </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Continued conflicts <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Conflict in Kivu ( 2004 - present ) <Ul> <Li> 7.1. 1 Allied Democratic Forces insurgency </Li> <Li> 7.1. 2 Ethnic Mai Mai factions </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7.2 Conflict in Katanga </Li> <Li> 7.3 Conflict in Kasai </Li> <Li> 7.4 Ituri conflict </Li> <Li> 7.5 Dongo Conflict </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 See also </Li> <Li> 9 Notes </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 Sources </Li> <Li> 12 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Early history ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Early Congolese history Map of the Kingdom of Kongo <P> The area now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo was populated as early as 80,000 years ago , as shown by the 1988 discovery of the Semliki harpoon at Katanda , one of the oldest barbed harpoons ever found , which is believed to have been used to catch giant river catfish . During its recorded history , the area has also been known as Congo , Congo Free State , Belgian Congo , and Zaire . </P> <P> The Kingdom of Kongo existed from the 14th to the early 19th century . Until the arrival of the Portuguese it was the dominant force in the region along with the Kingdom of Luba , the Kingdom of Lunda , the Mongo people and the Anziku Kingdom . </P> <H2> Colonial rule ( edit ) </H2> See also : Belgian overseas colonies <H3> Congo Free state ( 1885 -- 1908 ) ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Congo Free State Children mutilated during King Leopold II 's rule <P> The Congo Free State was a corporate state privately controlled by Leopold II of Belgium through the Association internationale africaine , a non-governmental organization . Leopold was the sole shareholder and chairman . The state included the entire area of the present Democratic Republic of the Congo . Under Leopold II , the Congo Free State became one of the most infamous international scandals of the turn of the twentieth century . The report of the British Consul Roger Casement led to the arrest and punishment of white officials who had been responsible for cold - blooded killings during a rubber - collecting expedition in 1900 , including a Belgian national who caused the shooting of at least 122 Congolese natives . Estimates of the total death toll vary considerably . The first census was only done in 1924 , so it is even more difficult to quantify the population loss of the period . Roger Casement 's famous 1904 report estimated ten million people . According to Casement 's report , indiscriminate `` war '' , starvation , reduction of births and tropical diseases caused the country 's depopulation . European and U.S. press agencies exposed the conditions in the Congo Free State to the public in 1900 . By 1908 public and diplomatic pressure had led Leopold II to annex the Congo as the Belgian Congo colony . </P> <H3> Belgian Congo ( 1908 -- 60 ) ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Belgian Congo <P> On 15 November 1908 King L\u00e9opold II of Belgium formally relinquished personal control of the Congo Free State . The renamed Belgian Congo was put under the direct administration of the Belgian government and its Ministry of Colonies . </P> <P> Belgian rule in the Congo was based around the `` colonial trinity '' ( trinit\u00e9 coloniale ) of state , missionary and private company interests . The privileging of Belgian commercial interests meant that large amounts of capital flowed into the Congo and that individual regions became specialised . The interests of the government and private enterprise became closely tied ; the state helped companies break strikes and remove other barriers imposed by the indigenous population . The country was split into nesting , hierarchically organised administrative subdivisions , and run uniformly according to a set `` native policy '' ( politique indig\u00e8ne ) -- in contrast to the British and the French , who generally favoured the system of indirect rule whereby traditional leaders were retained in positions of authority under colonial oversight . There was also a high degree of racial segregation . Large numbers of white immigrants who moved to the Congo after the end of World War II came from across the social spectrum , but were nonetheless always treated as superior to blacks . </P> <P> During the 1940s and 1950s , the Congo experienced an unprecedented level of urbanisation and the colonial administration began various development programmes aimed at making the territory into a `` model colony '' . Notable advances were made in treating diseases such as African trypanosomiasis . One of the results of these measures was the development of a new middle class of Europeanised African \u00e9volu\u00e9s in the cities . By the 1950s the Congo had a wage labour force twice as large as that in any other African colony . The Congo 's rich natural resources , including uranium -- much of the uranium used by the U.S. nuclear programme during World War II was Congolese -- led to substantial interest in the region from both the Soviet Union and the United States as the Cold War developed . </P> <H2> Independence and the Congo crisis ( 1960 -- 65 ) ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Congo Crisis <P> Following riots in Leopoldville 4 -- 7 January 1959 , and in Stanleyville on 31 October 1959 , the Belgians realised they could not maintain control of such a vast country in the face of rising demands for independence . Belgian and Congolese political leaders held a Round Table Conference in Brussels beginning on 18 January 1960 . At the end of the conference on 27 January 1960 it was announced that elections would be held in the Congo on 22 May 1960 , and full independence granted on 30 June 1960 . The Congo was indeed granted its independence on 30 June 1960 , and adopted the name `` Republic of the Congo '' ( R\u00e9publique du Congo ) . The French colony of Middle Congo ( Moyen Congo ) also chose the name Republic of Congo upon its independence , so the two countries are more commonly known as Congo - L\u00e9opoldville and Congo - Brazzaville , after their capital cities . President Mobutu changed the country 's official name to Zaire in 1971 . That name comes from Portuguese , adapted from the Kongo word nzere or nzadi ( `` river that swallows all rivers '' ) </P> <P> In 1960 , the country was very unstable -- regional tribal leaders held far more power than the central government -- and with the departure of the Belgian administrators , almost no skilled bureaucrats remained in the country . The first Congolese graduated university only in 1956 , and very few in the new nation had any idea how to manage a country of such size . </P> <P> Parliamentary elections in 1960 produced the nationalist Patrice Lumumba as prime minister and pro-Western Joseph Kasavubu as president of the newly independent Republic of The Congo . </P> <P> On 5 July 1960 , a military mutiny by Congolese soldiers against their European officers broke out in the capital and rampant looting began . On 11 July 1960 the richest province of the country , Katanga , seceded under Moise Tshombe . The United Nations sent 20,000 peacekeepers to protect Europeans in the country and try to restore order . Western paramilitaries and mercenaries , often hired by mining companies to protect their interests , also began to pour into the country . In this period Congo 's second richest province , Kasai , also announced its independence on 8 August 1960 . </P> <P> Prime Minister Lumumba turned to the USSR for assistance . Nikita Khrushchev agreed to help , offering advanced weaponry and technical advisors . The United States viewed the Soviet presence as an attempt to take advantage of the situation and gain a proxy state in sub-Saharan Africa . UN forces were ordered to block any shipments of arms into the country . The United States also looked for a way to replace Lumumba as leader . President Kasavubu had clashed with Prime Minister Lumumba and advocated an alliance with the West rather than the Soviets . The U.S. sent weapons and CIA personnel to aid forces allied with Kasavubu and combat the Soviet presence . On 14 September 1960 , with U.S. and CIA support , Colonel Joseph Mobutu overthrew the government and arrested Lumumba . </P> <P> On 17 January 1961 Mobutu sent Lumumba to \u00c9lisabethville ( now Lubumbashi ) , capital of Katanga . In full view of the press he was beaten and forced to eat copies of his own speeches . For three weeks afterward , he was not seen or heard from . Then Katangan radio announced implausibly that he had escaped and been killed by villagers . It was soon clear that in fact he had been tortured and killed along with two others shortly after his arrival . In 2001 , a Belgian inquiry established that he had been shot by Katangan gendarmes in the presence of Belgian officers , under Katangan command . Lumumba was beaten , placed in front of a firing squad with two allies , cut up , buried , dug up and what remained was dissolved in acid . </P> <P> In Stanleyville , those loyal to the deposed Lumumba set up a rival government under Antoine Gizenga which lasted from 31 March 1961 until it was reintegrated on 5 August 1961 . After some reverses , UN and Congolese government forces succeeded in recapturing the breakaway provinces of South Kasai on 30 December 1961 , and Katanga on 15 January 1963 . </P> <P> A new crisis erupted in the Simba Rebellion of 1964 - 1965 which saw half the country taken by the rebels . European mercenaries , US , and Belgian troops were called in by the Congolese government to defeat the rebellion . </P> <H2> Zaire ( 1965 -- 97 ) ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Zaire Mobutu Sese Seko <P> Unrest and rebellion plagued the government until November 1965 , when Lieutenant General Mobutu , by then commander in chief of the national army , seized control of the country and declared himself president for five years . Mobutu quickly consolidated his power and was elected unopposed as president in 1970 . Embarking on a campaign of cultural awareness , Mobutu renamed the country the Republic of Zaire in 1971 and required citizens to adopt African name\n\nQuestion:\nwhen did democratic republic of congo become independent\n", "answer": "1960"}

The commission was assisted by a committee consisting seven diocesan bishops , experts in theology and catechesis . </P> <P> The text was approved by John Paul II on 25 June 1992 , and promulgated by him on 11 October 1992 , the 30th anniversary of the opening of the Second Vatican Council , with his apostolic constitution , Fidei depositum . Cardinal Georges Cottier , Theologian emeritus of the Pontifical Household and now Cardinal - Deacon of Santi Domenico e Sisto the University Church of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas , Angelicum was influential in drafting the encyclical . </P> <P> It was published in the French language in 1992 . Later it was then translated into many other languages . In the United States , the English translation was published in 1994 and had been pre-ordered more than 250,000 copies before its release , with a note that it was `` subject to revision according to the Latin typical edition ( editio typica ) when it is published . '' </P> <P> On August 15 , 1997 -- the Solemnity of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary -- John Paul II promulgated the Latin typical edition , with his apostolic letter , Laetamur Magnopere . The Latin text , which became the official text of reference ( editio typica ) , amended the contents of the provisional French text at a few points . One of the changes consisted in the inclusion of the position on death penalty that is defended in John Paul II 's encyclical Evangelium Vitae of 1995 . </P> <P> As a result , the earlier translations from the French into other languages ( including English ) had to be amended and re-published as `` second editions '' . </P> <H2> Doctrinal value ( edit ) </H2> <P> In the apostolic constitution Fidei depositum , John Paul II declared that the Catechism of the Catholic Church is `` a valid and legitimate instrument for ecclesial communion and a sure norm for teaching the faith '' , and stressed that it `` is not intended to replace the local catechisms duly approved by the ecclesiastical authorities , the diocesan Bishops and the Episcopal Conferences '' . </P> <H2> Contents ( edit ) </H2> <P> A catechism has been defined as `` a book that explains the beliefs of the Christian religion by using a list of questions and answers '' . Documents of religious instruction have been written since the beginning of Christianity and a catechism is typically an assemblage of these smaller documents into one large compilation of Church doctrine and teachings . </P> <P> The Catechism itself is not in question - and - answer format . Rather , it is instead a source on which to base such catechisms ( e.g. Youcat and the United States Catholic Catechism for Adults ) and other expositions of Catholic doctrine , called a `` major catechism . '' As stated in the apostolic constitution Fidei depositum , with which its publication was ordered , it was given so `` that it may be a sure and authentic reference text for teaching Catholic doctrine and particularly for preparing local catechisms . '' </P> <P> The Catechism is arranged in four principal parts : </P> <Ul> <Li> The Profession of Faith ( the Apostle 's Creed ) </Li> <Li> The Celebration of the Christian Mystery ( the Sacred Liturgy , and especially the sacraments ) </Li> <Li> Life in Christ ( including the Ten Commandments ) </Li> <Li> Christian Prayer ( including the Lord 's Prayer ) </Li> </Ul> <P> This scheme is often referred to as the `` Four Pillars '' of the Faith . The contents are abundantly footnoted with references to sources of the teaching , in particular the Scriptures , the Church Fathers , and the Ecumenical Councils and other authoritative Catholic statements , principally those issued by recent popes . </P> <P> The section on Scripture in the Catechism recovers the Patristic tradition of `` spiritual exegesis '' as further developed through the scholastic doctrine of the `` four senses . '' This return to spiritual exegesis is based on the Second Vatican Council 's 1965 dogmatic constitution Dei verbum , which taught that Scripture should be `` read and interpreted in light of the same Spirit by whom it was written '' . The Catechism amplifies Dei verbum by specifying that the necessary spiritual interpretation should be sought through the four senses of Scripture , which encompass the literal sense and the three spiritual senses ( allegorical , moral , and anagogical ) . </P> <P> The literal sense pertains to the meaning of the words themselves , including any figurative meanings . The spiritual senses pertain to the significance of the things ( persons , places , objects or events ) denoted by the words . Of the three spiritual senses , the allegorical sense is foundational . It relates persons , events , and institutions of earlier covenants to those of later covenants , and especially to the New Covenant . Building on the allegorical sense , the moral sense instructs in regard to action , and the anagogical sense points to man 's final destiny . The teaching of the Catechism on Scripture has encouraged the pursuit of covenantal theology , an approach that employs the four senses to structure salvation history via the biblical covenants . </P> <H2> Comments ( edit ) </H2> <P> In 1992 , Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger ( later Pope Benedict XVI ) noted : </P> <P> It clearly show ( s ) that the problem of what we must do as human beings , of how we should live our lives so that we and the world may become just , is the essential problem of our day , and basically of all ages . After the fall of ideologies , the problem of man -- the moral problem -- is presented to today 's context in a totally new way : What should we do ? How does life become just ? What can give us and the whole world a future which is worth living ? Since the catechism treats these questions , it is a book which interests many people , far beyond purely theological or ecclesial circles . </P> <P> Ulf Ekman , former Charismatic pastor and the founder of Livets Ord , says that the Catechism is `` the best book he has ever read '' . </P> <H2> Derived works ( edit ) </H2> <P> It was expected that the universal Catechism would serve as a source and template for inculturated national catechisms . In the United States , for example , the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops published the United States Catholic Catechism for Adults , officially replacing their previous version , the Baltimore Catechism , though it had already been out of use for nearly forty years . </P> <P> The Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church was published in 2005 , and the first edition in English in 2006 . It is a more concise and dialogic version of the Catechism . The text of the Compendium is available in fourteen languages on the Vatican website , which also gives the text of the Catechism itself in nine languages . </P> <P> Youcat , a catechism for youth , based on the Catechism and its Compendium , was published in 2011 . The Vatican has acknowledged that some translations of Youcat contain errors regarding Church teaching on the status of other religions , contraception and euthanasia , whether due to simple error or poor translations . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Catholicism portal </Li> <Li> Christianity portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> Catholic Catechist </Li> <Li> Catholic Directory </Li> <Li> Catholic spirituality </Li> <Li> Glossary of the Catholic Church </Li> <Li> History of the Catholic Church since 1962 </Li> <Li> Index of Catholic Church articles </Li> <Li> Outline of Catholicism </Li> <Li> Pastoral care </Li> <Li> Catholic theology </Li> <Li> Second Vatican Council </Li> <Li> The Common Catechism </Li> <Li> Timeline of the Catholic Church </Li> <Li> Universal call to holiness </Li> <Li> Vocational Discernment in the Catholic Church </Li> </Ul> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ In an interview in 30Days , 3 - 2004 Cottier remarked : `` Going back to the early years , the first ' big ' text I worked on was the social encyclical Centesimus annus .

Originally a basement - run role - playing game publisher , the company popularized the collectible card game genre with Magic : The Gathering in the mid-1990s , acquired the popular Dungeons & Dragons role - playing game by purchasing the failing company TSR , and experienced tremendous success by publishing the licensed Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game .

Originally the company only published role - playing games such as the third edition of Talislanta and its own The Primal Order . The 1992 release of The Primal Order , a supplement designed for use with any game system , brought legal trouble with Palladium Books suing for references to Palladium 's game and system . The suit was settled in 1993 . </P> <P> In 1991 , Richard Garfield approached Wizards of the Coast with the idea for a new board game called RoboRally , but was turned down because the game would have been too expensive for Wizards of the Coast to produce . Instead , Adkison asked Garfield if he could invent a game that was both portable and quick - playing , to which Garfield agreed . </P> <P> Adkison set up a new corporation , Garfield Games , to develop Richard Garfield 's collectible card game concept , originally called Manaclash , into Magic : The Gathering . This kept the game sheltered from the legal battle with Palladium , and Garfield Games then licensed the production and sale rights to Wizards until the court case was settled , at which point the shell company was shut down . Wizards debuted Magic in July 1993 at the Origins Game Fair in Dallas . The game proved extremely popular at Gen Con in August 1993 , selling out of its supply of 2.5 million cards , which had been scheduled to last until the end of the year . The success of Magic generated revenue that carried the company out from the handful of employees in 1993 working out of Peter 's original basement headquarters into 250 employees in its own offices in 1995 . In 1994 , Magic won both the Mensa Top Five mind games award and the Origins Awards for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Board Game of 1993 and Best Graphic Presentation of a Board Game of 1993 . </P> <P> In 1994 , Wizards began an association with The Beanstalk Group , a brand licensing agency and consultancy , to license the Magic brand . After the success of Magic , Wizards published RoboRally in 1994 , and it soon won the 1994 Origins Awards for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Board Game and Best Graphic Presentation of a Board Game . Wizards also expanded its role - playing game line by buying SLA Industries from Nightfall Games and Ars Magica from White Wolf , Inc. in 1994 . In 1995 , Wizards published another card game by Richard Garfield , The Great Dalmuti , which won the 1995 Best New Mind Game award from Mensa . In August 1995 , Wizards released Everway and then four months later closed its roleplaying game product line . Peter Adkison explained that the company was doing a disservice to the games with lack of support and had lost money on all of Wizards ' roleplaying game products . Also in 1995 , Wizards ' annual sales passed US $65 million . </P> <H3> Acquisition of TSR and Pok\u00e9mon ( edit ) </H3> Peter Adkison , founder of Wizards of the Coast , at Gen Con Indy 2007 <P> Wizards announced the purchase of TSR , the cash - strapped makers of Dungeons & Dragons on April 10 , 1997 . Wizards acquired TSR and Five Rings Publishing Group for $25 million . Many of the creative and professional staff of TSR relocated from Wisconsin to the Renton area . Wizards used TSR as a brand name for a while , then retired it , allowing the TSR trademarks to expire . Between 1997 and 1999 , the company spun off several well - loved but poorly selling campaign settings ( including Planescape , Dark Sun and Spelljammer ) to fan groups , focusing business primarily on the more profitable Greyhawk and Forgotten Realms lines . </P> <P> In Summer 1997 , Wizards revisited the concept of a 3rd edition of Dungeons & Dragons , having first discussed it soon after the purchase of TSR . Looking back on the decision in 2004 , Adkison stated : `` Obviously , ( Wizards ) had a strong economic incentive for publishing a new edition ; sales for any product line tend to spike when a new edition comes out , assuming the new edition is an improvement over the first . And given the change in ownership we thought this would be an excellent opportunity for WotC to ' put its stamp on D&D ' . '' He later `` Set ( the ) overall design direction '' for the new edition of D&D . Wizards released the third edition of Dungeons & Dragons in 2000 , as well as the d20 System . With these releases came the Open Game License , which allowed other companies to make use of those systems . The new edition of the D&D game won the 2000 Origins Award for Best Roleplaying Game . In 2002 , Wizards sponsored a design contest which allowed designers to submit their campaign worlds to Wizards , to produce an entirely original campaign world ; Wizards selected `` Eberron '' , submitted by Keith Baker , and its first hardcover book was released in June 2004 . In 2003 Wizards released version 3.5 of Dungeons & Dragons and the d20 system . Wizards helped to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the D&D game at Gen Con Indy 2004 . </P> <P> On August 2 , 1997 , Wizards of the Coast was granted U.S. Patent 5,662,332 on collectible card games . In January 1999 , Wizards of the Coast began publishing the highly successful Pok\u00e9mon Trading Card Game . The game proved to be very popular , selling nearly 400,000 copies in less than six weeks , and selling 10 times better than Wizards ' initial projections . There was such a high demand for Pok\u00e9mon cards that some sports card series were discontinued in 1999 because so many printers were producing Pok\u00e9mon cards . The game won the 1999 National Parenting Center 's Seal of Approval . </P> <P> Within a year , Wizards had sold millions of copies of the Pok\u00e9mon game , and the company released a new set that included an instructional CD - ROM . Wizards continued to publish the game until 2003 . One of Nintendo 's affiliates , Pok\u00e9mon USA , had begun producing a new edition for the game before the last of its agreements with Wizards expired September 30 , and Wizards filed suit against Nintendo the following day , October 1 , 2003 . The two companies resolved their differences in December 2003 without going to court . </P> <H3> Acquisition by Hasbro ( edit ) </H3> <P> Seeing the continued success of Pok\u00e9mon and Magic : The Gathering , the game and toy giant Hasbro bought Wizards of the Coast in September 1999 , for about US $325 million . Hasbro had expressed interest in purchasing Wizards of the Coast as early as 1994 , and had been further impressed after the success of its Pok\u00e9mon game . Avalon Hill was made a division of Wizards of the Coast , in late 1999 ; the company had been purchased by Hasbro in the summer of 1998 . </P> <P> Vince Caluori became President of Wizards of the Coast in November 1999 . As of January 1 , 2001 , Peter Adkison resigned from Wizards . Chuck Huebner became President and CEO of Wizards of the Coast in June 2002 , and Loren Greenwood succeeded Huebner in these positions in April 2004 . Greg Leeds succeeded Loren Greenwood as President and CEO of Wizards of the Coast in March 2008 . </P> <P> In November 1999 , Wizards announced that Gen Con would leave Milwaukee after the 2002 convention . Hasbro sold Origins to GAMA , and in May 2002 sold Gen Con to Peter Adkison . Wizards also outsourced its magazines by licensing Dungeon , Dragon , Polyhedron , and Amazing Stories to Paizo Publishing . Wizards released the Dungeons & Dragons miniatures collectible pre-painted plastic miniatures games in 2003 , and added a licensed Star Wars line in 2004 , and through its Avalon Hill brand an Axis & Allies World War II miniatures game in 2005 . Wizards of the Coast 's book publishing division has produced hundreds of titles that have sold millions of copies in over 16 languages . </P> <P> After the company 's great success in 1999 with Pok\u00e9mon , Wizards of the Coast acquired and expanded The Game Keeper , a US chain of retail gaming stores , eventually changing its name to Wizards of the Coast , including the company 's flagship gaming center on The Ave in Seattle for several years , and its retail stores , which were mostly in shopping malls in the US . The gaming center was closed by March 2001 and eventually Wizards announced in December 2003 that it would close all of its stores in order to concentrate on game design . The stores were closed in the spring of 2004 . </P> <H3> 2000s - 2010s ( edit ) </H3> <P> In early 2006 , Wizards of the Coast filed a lawsuit against Daron Rutter , then administrator of the MTGSalvation website ( on which he is known as `` Ra\n", "answer": "2003"}

It was used on a range of mass - produced general - purpose tractors manufactured by Henry Ford & Son Inc from 1917 to 1920 , by Ford Motor Company ( U.S. ) and Ford Motor Company Ltd ( U.K. ) from 1920 to 1928 , and by Ford Motor Company Ltd ( U.K. ) from 1929 to 1964 . The latter ( Ford of Britain ) also later built trucks under the Fordson brand . </P> <P> American engineer , inventor , and businessman Henry Ford built experimental tractors from automobile components during the early 20th century , and launched a prototype known as the Model B in August 1915 . Further prototypes , with a dedicated tractor design , followed in 1916 . With World War I raging in Europe , the first regular - production Henry Ford & Son tractors were exported to the U.K. in 1917 to expand British agriculture . In 1918 , exports continued , the tractors began to be labeled as Fordsons , and U.S. domestic sales began . Sales boomed in 1918 and 1919 . </P> <P> Between 1917 and 1922 , the Fordson was for tractors somewhat like the Ford Model T was for automobiles -- it captured the public 's imagination and widely popularized the machine , with a reliable design , a low price affordable for workers and farmers , a widespread dealership network , and a production capacity for large numbers . Just as the Model T helped the public to appreciate how soon cars and trucks might replace most horses in transport , the Fordson helped people to appreciate how soon tractors might replace most horses in farming ( advancing the mechanisation of agriculture ) . As with cars , Ford never had the market to itself , but it dominated the market for a time ( for cars , roughly 1910 - 1925 ; for tractors , roughly 1917 - 1925 ) . Ford was the only automotive firm to sell cars , trucks and tractors simultaneously from 1917 to 1928 . </P> <P> For a decade between 1928 and 1939 , Ford of the U.S. left the tractor business . During that decade , Ford of Britain continued to build Fordsons and to develop new variants , which it exported widely . In 1939 Ford of the U.S. reentered the tractor market with an all - new model , this time with the Ford brand . Ford of Britain continued to use the Fordson brand until 1964 . </P> <P> Fordson production occurred in the U.S. ( 1917 -- 1928 ) ; Cork , Ireland ( 1919 -- 1923 and 1928 -- 1933 ) ; and at Dagenham , Essex , England ( 1933 -- 1964 ) . Tens of thousands of Fordsons , most from the U.S. and some from Ireland , were exported to the Soviet Union from 1920 to 1927 .

At the time , farm work was extremely arduous , because on the typical farm virtually nothing could get done without manual labour or animal labour as the motive power . As his interest in automobiles grew , he also expressed a desire to `` lift the burden of farming from flesh and blood and place it on steel and motors . '' In the early 20th century , he began to build experimental tractors from automobile components . Four years after founding the Ford Motor Company in 1903 , Ford finished his first experimental tractor in 1907 on Woodward Avenue in Detroit , referring to it as the `` Automobile Plow '' . Approximately 600 gasoline - powered tractors were in use on American farms in 1908 . Fordson tractor design was headed by Eugene Farkas and J\u00f3zsef Galamb , both involved in the design of the successful Ford Model T automobile . </P> <P> Traction engines had been around for a while , but they were large , heavy , expensive machines suited to prairie grain farming more than to small family farms in other regions . In the early 1910s , North America and Europe were hungry for small , inexpensive tractors , and many people seized on the Model T as a platform with which to create them . Clearly the idea of an auto - like tractor , made using auto - like parts and methods or by conversion from autos , was ripe . </P> <P> Henry Ford experimented with both auto - plows and heavier tractors . In August 1915 , at a plowing demonstration in Fremont , Nebraska , he introduced a newly designed tractor known as the Model B. It used a 16 horsepower , two - cylinder , horizontally opposed engine , a spur gear transmission and three wheels - two front drivers and one rear steerer . The Model B was never produced , but did gain enough publicity to let the world know Ford was interested in developing a tractor . </P> <P> Knowing there was demand for a Ford - built tractor , a group of entrepreneurs in Minneapolis organized The Ford Tractor Company , paying a company clerk surnamed Ford for the use of his name , with the intention of getting sales and attention from the confusion of this Ford with Ford Motor Company . The company built and sold some tractors , but anticipated a settlement with Henry Ford for permission to use their already - trademarked name . However , Ford thwarted them by using another name . </P> <H3> Fordson origins , Model F , and Model N ( edit ) </H3> Overview of the original Fordson tractor A cutaway view of the original Fordson tractor Disassembly of the original Fordson tractor , showing the unit - frame construction and how the tractor can be taken apart for service , with blocks of wood inserted to support the separated parts A cutaway view of the engine of the original Fordson tractor A cutaway view of the intake of the original Fordson tractor ( including the intake manifold , vaporizer , carburetor , and fuel lines ) A cutaway view of the clutch , transmission , and rear of the original Fordson tractor , including the worm drive An early Fordson discing a field in Princess Anne County , Virginia , USA , in 1925 <P> The first prototypes of the new Henry Ford & Son tractor , which would later be called the Fordson , were completed in 1916 . World War I was raging in Europe , and the United Kingdom , a net importer of food , was desperate for tractors in its attempt to expand its agriculture enough to feed Britain despite the great shipping disruption of the war . In 1917 , the British Ministry of Munitions selected the Fordson for both importation from the U.S. and domestic U.K. production . It was thought that domestic U.K. production was preferable because so much Atlantic shipping was being sunk that exporting tractors from the U.S. would be counterproductive , as many would be lost at sea . This was soon modified to exclude the London area because of concerns about its vulnerability to German attacks . Henry Ford decided to build the tractor at Cork , Ireland ( which at the time was still part of the U.K. ) , partly because he wanted to bring jobs to , and foster industriousness in , southern Ireland . But the Cork plant did not begin production until 1919 , after the war had ended . As events turned out , thousands of tractors were exported from the U.S. in 1917 and 1918 . </P> <P> The tractor used a 20 hp ( 15 kW ) , inline four - cylinder engine . The engine was similar to the Ford Model T engine in many respects . Like many engines of its day , it was multifuel - capable ; it was usually tuned for gasoline or kerosene , but alcohol could also be burned . ( Tractor vaporising oil ( TVO ) existed in 1920 but was not yet widely used . It entered broader use in the 1930s and 1940s . ) Like many other multifuel machines , the Fordson started on gasoline from a small auxiliary tank ( just a few quarts ) and then switched over to the main fuel tank once warmed up sufficiently ( no more than 5 minutes ) . To handle the kerosene ( or , rarely , TVO ) , the intake system had a vaporizer downstream of the carburetor . The mixture coming from the carburetor was intentionally rich , and the vaporizer heated it and mixed it with more air to lean it out to the final ratio before entering the intake manifold . The intake system also had a water - bath air cleaner to filter the dust out of the air inhaled by the engine ( an invention that did not originate at Ford but that was still rather novel in 1917 ) . Air cleaning is critical to engine lifespan , even for road vehicles and most especially for farming and construction vehicles ( which work in environments where dirt is frequently stirred up into the air ) . The Fordson carburetor and air cleaner were designed by Holley . In later decades , the water bath would be replaced with an oil bath for better filtering performance . </P> <P> The ignition system was similar to that of the Model T , with a flywheel - mounted low - tension magneto and trembler coils . The ignition timing was manually advanced or retarded with the spark advance lever mounted near the steering column , which rotated the timer . The cooling was by thermosiphon . ( In later decades , a high - tension magneto and a water pump would be added . ) The transmission was a three - speed spur gear ( the three forward speeds ranged from approximately 2 \u200b \u2044 to 6 \u200b \u2044 mph ) . A worm drive reduction set and a differential made up the rear . The design of the rear was patented for its ease of manufacture and service . Brakes were not provided on early Fordsons , as high - ratio worm sets generally transmitted rotation in one direction only , from the worm element to the gear element , because of the high power loss through friction . To stop the tractor , the driver depressed the clutch . </P> <P> Ford engineer Eugene Farkas successfully made the engine block , oil pan , transmission , and rear axle stressed members constituting the frame . By eliminating the need for a heavy separate frame , costs were reduced and manufacturing was simplified . Ford held a patent on a unit - frame tractor . The rear wheels were fabricated steel , spoked and cleated . The earliest ones were 12 - spoke ; a 14 - spoke version followed . Several models of front wheel were used , including 10 - spoked fabricated steel and 5 - spoke cast iron . Industrial models also used other wheels designed for specific tasks , including aftermarket wheels . </P> <P> In 1916 and 1917 , the name `` Fordson '' was not yet used as the tractor 's make or model name , nor was `` Model F '' . During this period , terms such as `` the ( real / genuine ) Ford tractor '' or `` the Henry Ford tractor '' , as well as `` the MOM tractor '' ( because almost all output was going to the British Ministry of Munitions ) , were used . In early 1918 , the name `` Fordson '' was trademarked , and within a few months it was being marked on the tractors . Published sources vary somewhat on the origin of the name . All agree that the name reflects the contemporary name of the tractor company , `` Henry Ford & Son '' , and its obvious eponyms : Henry and Edsel . Some claim that the company had been using the cable address `` Fordson '' for several years , which would mean even before the company was officially incorporated in July 1917 . Another implies that February 1918 marked the first use of `` Fordson '' in a cablegram . Regardless , by April 1918 the name `` Fordson '' was established as the brand , and its eponyms were obvious . In that month , U.S. sales began under County War Board distribution rules . The Model F designation ( for essentially the same model , with improvements ) began in 1919 . Sales boomed in 1918 and 1919 . </P> <P> There was nothing about the Fordson 's design or farming capabilities that was a `` first ever '' among tractors ( Ford 's version of a unit f\n\nQuestion:\nwhat was the last year ford made tractors\n", "answer": "1964"}

L'Engle wrote repeatedly about the writing of the story and the long struggle to get it published . In A Circle of Quiet ( 1972 ) , she explains that the book was conceived `` during a time of transition . '' After years of living in rural Goshen , Connecticut , and running a general store , L'Engle's family , the Franklins , moved back to New York City , first taking a ten - week camping trip across the country and back again . L'Engle writes that `` we drove through a world of deserts and buttes and leafless mountains , wholly new and alien to me . And suddenly into my mind came the names , Mrs Whatsit . Mrs Who . Mrs Which . '' This was in the spring of 1959 . L'Engle was reading about quantum physics at the time , which also made its way into the story . When she completed the book in early 1960 , however , it was rejected by at least 26 publishers , because it was , in L'Engle's words , `` too different , '' and `` because it deals overtly with the problem of evil , and it was really difficult for children , and was it a children 's or an adults ' book , anyhow ? '' </P> <P> In `` A Special Message from Madeleine L'Engle '' on the Random House website , L'Engle explains another possible reason for the rejections : `` A Wrinkle in Time had a female protagonist in a science fiction book , '' which at the time was uncommon . After trying `` forty - odd '' publishers ( L'Engle later said `` twenty - six rejections '' ) , L'Engle's agent returned the manuscript to her . Then at Christmas , L'Engle threw a tea party for her mother . One of the guests happened to know John C. Farrar of Farrar , Straus and Giroux , and insisted that L'Engle should meet with him . Although the publisher did not , at the time , publish a line of children 's books , Farrar met L'Engle , liked the novel , and ultimately published it . </P> <P> In 1963 the book won the Newbery Medal which awarded annually by the Association for Library Service to Children , a division of the American Library Association , to the author of the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children . The book has been continuously in print since its first publication . The hardback edition is still published by Farrar , Straus & Giroux . The original blue dust jacket by Ellen Raskin was replaced with new art by Leo and Diane Dillon , with the publication of A Swiftly Tilting Planet in 1978 . The book has also been published in a 25th anniversary collectors ' edition ( limited to 500 signed and numbered copies ) , at least two book club editions ( one hardback , one Scholastic Book Services paperback ) , as a trade paperback under the Dell Yearling imprint , and as a mass market paperback under the Dell Laurel - Leaf imprint . The cover art on the paperback editions has changed several times since first publication . </P> <P> The book was reissued by Square Fish in trade and mass market paperback formats in May 2007 , along with the rest of the Time Quintet . This new edition includes a previously unpublished interview with L'Engle as well as the text of her Newbery Medal acceptance speech . </P> <H2> Plot summary ( edit ) </H2> <P> Thirteen - year - old Meg Murry 's classmates and teachers see her as a troublesome and stubborn student . Her family knows that she is emotionally immature but also sees her capable of doing great things . The family includes her scientist mother Katherine , her missing scientist father Alexander , the twins Sandy and Dennys , and her five - year - old brother Charles Wallace Murry , a child genius who can sometimes read Meg 's mind . </P> <P> The book begins with the line `` It was a dark and stormy night , '' an allusion to the opening words in Edward Bulwer - Lytton 's 1830 novel Paul Clifford . Unable to sleep during a thunderstorm , Meg descends from her attic room to find Charles Wallace sitting at the table drinking milk and eating bread and jam . They are then joined by their mother , and are visited by their new eccentric neighbor , Mrs Whatsit . In the course of conversation , Mrs Whatsit casually mentions there is such a thing as a tesseract , which causes Katherine to almost faint . </P> <P> The next morning , Meg discovers that the term refers to a scientific concept her father was working on before his mysterious disappearance . The following afternoon , Meg and Charles Wallace encounter Meg 's schoolmate , Calvin O'Keefe , a high - school junior who , although he is a `` big man on campus '' , considers himself a misfit as well . They then go to visit an old haunted house near town which Charles Wallace already knows is the home of Mrs Whatsit . There they encounter two companions of Mrs Whatsit 's , the equally strange Mrs Who and the unseen voice of Mrs Which . She promises that she and her friends will help Meg find and rescue her father . A budding love interest develops between Meg and Calvin . In the evening , Charles Wallace declares it is time for them to go on their mission to save their father . This is accompanied by the appearance of the third member of the `` Mrs Ws '' , Mrs Which , who appears to materialize out of nothing . </P> <P> Mrs Whatsit , Mrs Who , and Mrs Which turn out to be supernatural beings who transport Meg , Charles Wallace , and Calvin O'Keefe through the universe by means of tesseract , a fifth - dimensional phenomenon explained as being similar to folding the fabric of space and time . Their first stop is the planet Uriel , a Utopian world filled with Centaur - like beings who live in a state of light and love . Mrs Whatsit herself shows that she , Mrs Who , and Mrs Which are all these centaur - like creatures in disguise as humans . There the `` Mrs Ws '' reveal to the children that the universe is under attack from an evil being who appears as a large dark cloud called The Black Thing , which is essentially the personification of evil . The children are then taken to visit the `` Happy Medium '' , a woman with a crystal ball through which they see that Earth is partially covered by the darkness , although great religious figures , philosophers , and artists have been fighting against it . Mrs Whatsit is revealed to be a former star who exploded in an act of self - sacrifice to fight the darkness . </P> <P> The children then travel to the dark planet of Camazotz , which has `` given in '' to the Black Thing . Meg 's father is trapped there . They find that all the inhabitants behave in a mechanistic way and seem to be under the control of a single mind . At the planet 's central headquarters ( described as CENTRAL Central Intelligence ) , they discover a telepathic red - eyed man who can cast a hypnotic spell and claims to know their father 's whereabouts . Charles Wallace deliberately looks into the man 's red eyes , allowing himself to be hypnotized in order to find their father . Under its influence , he takes Meg and Calvin to the place where Alexander is being held prisoner because he would not succumb to the group mind . </P> <P> The planet turns out to be controlled by an evil disembodied brain with powerful abilities , which the inhabitants of Camazotz call `` IT . '' Charles Wallace takes them to the place where IT is held . In such proximity to IT , the children are threatened by a possible telepathic takeover of their minds . With special powers from Mrs Who 's glasses , Alexander is able to `` tesser '' Calvin , Meg and himself away from Camazotz , but Charles Wallace is left behind , still under the influence of IT . Dr. Murry , inexperienced at tessering , does not know how to protect Meg from the Black Thing which surrounds the planet as they tesser through it , nearly killing her . When they arrive on the neighboring planet of Ixchel , Meg is nearly frozen , and paralyzed . Calvin and the Murrys are discovered by the planet 's inhabitants - large , eyeless `` beasts '' with featureless faces , tentacles and four arms , who prove both wise and gentle . Meg 's paralysis is cured under the care of one inhabitant , whom Meg nicknames `` Aunt Beast . '' Meg overcomes her anger at her father for leaving Charles Wallace on Camazotz , realizing that parents ca n't fix everything , and sometimes children can solve problems themselves . </P> <P> Then the trio of Mrs Whatsit , Mrs Who , and Mrs Which arrive . They charge Meg with rescuing Charles Wallace from IT , because only Meg has a strong enough bond with him . Their father had last seen Charles Wallace when he was a baby and Calvin had only just met him . They each give her a gift . Mrs Whatsit gives Meg her love . Mrs Who quotes to Meg a passage from the Bible about God choosing the foolish of the world to confound the wise , and the weak to defeat the strong ( 1 Corinthians 1 : 27 - 29 ) . Mrs Which tells Meg that she has one thing that IT does not have but does n't specify what it is . Upon arriving at the building where IT is housed , Charles Wallace is still there under IT 's influence . Meg realizes that the one thing she has that IT does not is love . She focuses all her love at Charles Wallace and is able to free him from IT 's control . Mrs Who , Mrs Which and Mrs Whatsit tesser the Murrys and Calvin back to Earth . In the vegetable garden they are all reunited with Katherine and the twins . Mrs Whatsit says that although she and the others like the spectacle of the family reuniting , they have to go somewhere . Before Mrs Whatsit finishes her sentence , she and the others disappear . </P> <H2> Major themes ( edit ) </H2> <P> Madeleine L'Engle's fantasy works are in part highly expressive of her Christian viewpoint in a manner somewhat similar to that of Christian fantasy writer C.S. Lewis . She was herself the official writer - in - residence at New York City 's Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Divine , which is known for its prominent position in the liberal wing of the Episcopal Church . L'Engle's liberal Christianity has been the target of criticism from more conservative Christians , especially with respect to certain elements of A Wrinkle in Time . </P> <P> The theme of picturing the fight of good against evil as a battle of light and darkness is a recurring one . Its manner is reminiscent of the prologue to the Gospel of John , which is quoted within the book . When the `` Mrs Ws '' reveal their secret roles in the cosmic fight against `` the darkness '' they ask the children to name some figures on Earth ( a partially dark planet ) who fight the darkness . They name Jesus , and later in the discussion Buddha is named as well , along with various creative artists an\n\nQuestion:\nwhen was the novel a wrinkle in time written\n", "answer": "1962"}
{"content": "Answer the question based on the information provided in the document given below. The answer should be a number\n\nQuestion:\nwhen was mesh first used for hernia repair\n\nDocument:\n and therefore , it does not need to be notified in an informed consent . </P> Absorbable mesh ( edit ) Main article : Biomesh <P> Biomeshes are increasingly popular since their first use in 1999 and their subsequent introduction on the market in 2003 . Their use is an instance of regenerative medicine . Unlike synthetic non-absorbable meshes , they are absorbable , and can be used for repair in an infected environment , such as an incarcerated hernia . Moreover , they seem to improve comfort and presumably , they reduce the risk of inguinodynia . They have been tested after mesh - related inguinodynia . Some meshes have a price comparable to the high end of synthetic meshes , the cheapest ( $500 ) being Surgisis - Biodesign , manufactured by Cook Group , made from the extra cellular matrix of pig small intestinal submucosa . Currently , there exists one synthetic totally absorbable mesh , Tigr Matrix , manufactured by Novus Scientific , on the US market ( 510 ( k ) Food and Drug Administration clearance ) since 2010 and on the EU market since 2011 . It only has one 3 - year pre-clinical evidence on sheep . </P> <P> Though their benefit is not fully established yet , the market for biological meshes is exploding , and if the current trend is confirmed , they may replace synthetic meshes in the US by 2016 </P> <H2> Suture repairs ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Tension repairs ( edit ) </H3> Bassini ( edit ) Bassini technique , first suture. 1 . Aponeurosis musculi obliq . ext. ; 2 . Musculus obliquus internus ; 3 . Musculus transversalis ; 4 . Fascia transversalis ; 5 . Peritoneum ; 6 . Ligamentum inguinale . <P> The first efficient inguinal hernia repair was described by Edoardo Bassini in the 1880s . The Bassini technique is a `` tension '' repair , in which the edges of the defect are sewn back together , without any mesh . In the Bassini technique , the conjoint tendon ( formed by the distal ends of the transversus abdominis and internal oblique muscles ) is approximated to the inguinal ligament and closed . Today , Bassini 's main interest is historical . It remains performed in some developing countries , if surgeons do not have knowledge of the mosquito - net alternative to commercial meshes in Lichtenstein repair , or if they ignore more efficient suture - based repairs . </P> McVay / Cooper 's ligament ( edit ) <P> The floor of the canal is reinforced by approximating the transversus abdominal aponeurosis and transverse fascia to pectineal ( Cooper 's ) ligament medially from the pubic tubercle to the femoral vein . Lateral to this the floor is restored by approximating the femoral sheath to the inguinal ligament . It is also used in femoral hernia repairs . </P> Shouldice ( edit ) <P> The Shouldice technique is the mainstream suture - based repair . It is a relatively difficult four layer reconstruction of fascia transversalis ; however , it has relatively low reported recurrence rates in the hand of a surgeon experienced with this method . </P> <P> Shouldice repairs are less commonly used today than in previous years , especially in developed countries . This is mostly due to the fact that mesh - based Lichtenstein method is easier to perform . The Shouldice repair has a higher rate of hernia recurrence in the hands of surgeons inexperienced with them ( < 200 operations / year ) . Another drawback is the post-operative pain due to the tension on muscles , which generally lasts some weeks . However , this pain is well - managed with analgesics , and this short - term pain must be balanced with the much lower risk of long - term pain of the Shouldice technique , which is half Lichtenstein ( but similar to laparoscopic ) . This is why few tension repairs are still in use today ; these include the Shouldice and the Cooper 's ligament / McVay repair . </P> <P> The main advantage of the Shouldice technique remains the relatively low report of chronic pain ( 10 % incidence ) , as compared with mesh - based open repair ( Lichtenstein ) ( 20 % incidence ) . However , the risk of chronic pain with this method is comparable to a laparoscopic repair performed by a surgeon experienced with inguinal hernia repair ( i.e. > 200 hernias / year ) ( 8 % incidence ) ( and not simply a surgeon experienced with laparoscopy . This difference is important ) . </P> <P> Moreover , if the surgeon is not experienced enough with the Shouldice technique , as is the case for most surgeons nowadays , mesh - based repair can be advised . For example , in developing countries , where commercial meshes are expensive , but where surgeons might also be less qualified , a mosquito - net mesh open repair can be better than Shouldice . Indeed , both have a similar cost ( a mosquito - net mesh costs less than $0.01 . Its sterilization costs less than $1 ) , and mesh repair is easier to perform than Shouldice . Desarda repair is also another option , but it is less widely known . </P> <P> Another advantage of suture - based repairs over permanent mesh repairs is that they do not introduce significant permanent foreign - body material , at worst , only polypropylene non-absorbable sutures . Permanent meshes can cause additional long - term complications due to this fact . </P> <H3> Tension - free repairs ( edit ) </H3> Desarda ( edit ) <P> The Desarda technique is an emerging suture - based technique . It can be performed with absorbable sutures . It is simpler and faster to perform than Shouldice and Lichtenstein . It also gives similar results to Lichtenstein in terms of recurrence , with the significant benefit of not introducing permanent foreign - body material . Moreover , this technique is tension - free , mesh - free , and it pays attention to the physiology . Other techniques using a flap from the external oblique aponeurosis were proposed independently by other surgeons . </P> Guarnieri ( edit ) <P> Guarnieri technique appeared in 1988 . It can be used with or without mesh . Like Desarda technique , the Guarnieri method pays attention to the physiology , and it is also tension - free . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Simons , M.P. ; Aufenacker , T. ; Bay - Nielsen , M. ; Bouillot , J.L. ; Campanelli , G. ; Conze , J. ; Lange , D. ; Fortelny , R. ; et al.

The 1890s economic depression and the rise of the trade unions and the Labor parties during this period led to a movement for welfare reform . </P> <P> In 1900 , the states of New South Wales and Victoria enacted legislation introducing non-contributory pensions for those aged 65 and over . Queensland legislated a similar system in 1907 before the Australian labor Commonwealth government led by Andrew Fisher introduced a national aged pension under the Invalid and Old - Aged Pensions Act 1908 . A national invalid diasbility pension was started in 1910 , and a national maternity allowance was introduced in 1912 . </P> <P> During the Second World War , Australia under a labor government created a welfare state by enacting national schemes for : child endowment in 1941 ( superseding the 1927 New South Wales scheme ) ; a widows ' pension in 1942 ( superseding the New South Wales 1926 scheme ) ; a wife 's allowance in 1943 ; additional allowances for the children of pensioners in 1943 ; and unemployment , sickness , and special benefits in 1945 ( superseding the Queensland 1923 scheme ) . </P> <P> The Social Services Legislation Amendment ( Welfare Reform ) Bill 2017 has changed several aspects of social security in Australia , and has been given assent to as of 11 April 2018 . It includes a demerit - point system for not meeting welfare obligations . </P> <H2> Contemporary welfare attitudes ( edit ) </H2> <P> Current attitudes toward welfare in Australia can be separated into support for the welfare system and support for welfare recipients . A multivariate analysis using canonical correlation analysis identified five distinct profiles of welfare attitudes and socio - demographic characteristics . The main attitude cluster was one toward support for the welfare system and welfare recipients . Having receiving government welfare in the past strongly predicted a person supporting the welfare system and its beneficiaries . The next most prominent attitude profile was summarized as ' the welfare system is good but the people on it are lazy and dependent ' . This attitude profile was found among people receiving welfare payments that were either normative ( e.g. the age pension ) or where there is little expectation that a person will return to work ( e.g. disability support pension ) . Overall , Australian 's hold more negative attitudes toward welfare recipients than they do the welfare system . People with a history of receiving unemployment benefits tend to have more negative welfare attitudes if they live in areas where other community members have more negative attitudes . </P> <H2> Legal framework ( edit ) </H2> <P> Social security payments and other benefits are currently made available under the following acts of parliament : </P> <Ul> <Li> Social Security Act 1991 </Li> <Li> A New Tax System ( Family Assistance ) Act 1999 </Li> <Li> Student Assistance Act 1973 </Li> <Li> Paid Parental Leave Act 2010 </Li> </Ul> <H2> Payments under the Social Security Act and the student Assistance Act ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> ABSTUDY -- offers a range of allowances to assist Indigenous students and New Apprentices . </Li> <Li> Age Pension -- for people planning for retirement or who are already retired aged 65 years and over . </Li> <Li> Assistance for Isolated Children -- for families with a child who can not attend school locally because of distance or special needs . </Li> <Li> Austudy Payment -- for full - time students and New Apprentices aged 25 years or over . </Li> <Li> Carer Allowance -- for people who care for minors 16 -- 17 and adults over 18 years with a disability . </Li> <Li> Carer Allowance ( Child ) -- for people who care for a child under 16 years with a disability . </Li> <Li> Carer Payment -- for people who provide full - time care for someone with a disability </Li> <Li> Disability Support Pension -- for people unable to work for 2 years due to illness , injury or disability . </Li> <Li> Double Orphan Pension -- for people who are raising children who have lost both parents . </Li> <Li> Maternity Payment -- for help with those extra costs after the birth of a new baby . </Li> <Li> Newstart Allowance -- for people who are looking for employment . </Li> <Li> Parenting Payment -- for parents or guardians to help with the cost of raising children under 6 for partnered parents and under 8 for sole parents . </Li> <Li> Pensioner Education Supplement -- for people on pensions with education expenses . </Li> <Li> Special Benefit -- for people who are in financial hardship , have no way of supporting themselves and are not entitled to another payment ( normally due to residency requirements ) </Li> <Li> Youth Allowance -- for full - time students or New Apprentices aged 15 ( under some circumstances ) 16 to 24 and people aged under 21 who are undertaking job search or a combination of approved activities . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Income support ( edit ) </H3> <P> All Centrelink income support payments are payable fortnightly , usually by direct deposit required into the recipient 's bank account . They are also subject to a means test which calculates the recipient ( and their partner 's ) fortnightly income and assets and affects the rate of their payment accordingly . As such , people on lower incomes may be entitled to part - payment of their allowance ( subject to other qualification requirements ) . The assessment of income and assets varies greatly between different social security payments and the effect that income and assets have on each payment differs in that they have different income thresholds ( i.e. how much income one can earn before it affects their payment ) and different taper rates ( the amount the payment drops by per dollar above these thresholds ) . </P> <P> An individual may be precluded from claiming any of income support payments listed below for a certain number of weeks following receipt of a lump sum compensation payment , made wholly or partly in respect of lost earnings or lost capacity to earn resulting from personal injury ( often received in settlement of a Workers ' Compensation claim ) . The number of weeks for which the preclusion period applies to an individual is proportional the size of the lump sum payment they received . Centrelink has a discretion to reduce the duration of the preclusion period if it is satisfied that there exist special circumstances that make an individual 's case out of the ordinary : for example , extreme financial hardship . </P> Age pension ( edit ) <P> The Age Pension was the first payment made by the Commonwealth Government , dating back to 1909 . It is available to persons aged 65 years and over . The eligibility age is currently being progressively increased to a cap of 67 years old . Except for the mandatory superannuation scheme , workers do not contribute to a pension or insurance scheme in Australia , unlike pension schemes in many other countries . Taxpayer - funded pensions are means tested . </P> Newstart Allowance ( edit ) <P> Newstart Allowance is an unemployment benefit paid to unemployed people aged 22 to 64 . To be eligible , a person must apply for the benefit and be actively seeking work . On 1 July 1991 , it replaced the Unemployment Benefit ( UB ) which had been unchanged since 1945 . It was part of a government reform called Newstart - the Active Employment Strategy . </P> <P> It is paid on the basis of a ' mutual agreement ' between the customer and Centrelink , where Centrelink will continue to pay fortnightly payments to the customer for so long as the customer attempts to find employment and fulfills the mutual obligation requirements . These mutual agreements are negotiated between Centrelink , the job seeker and their Job Services Australia provider or Disability Employment Services provider , and are recorded into an Employment Pathway Plan or `` EPP '' . Activities to which a job seeker may have to agree , in order to continue receiving the Newstart Allowance , include applying for a specific number of jobs ( usually ten ) per fortnight and recording these applications in a Centrelink issued diary , undertaking vocational education or training , paid work experience , participation in a labour market program or Work for the Dole project , and other activities , such as voluntary work if considered appropriate by Centrelink . For example , more elderly customers who have been made redundant and are approaching the age pension age , and who may face considerable difficulties re-entering the labour market , are often permitted to fulfil their plan by engaging in voluntary activities alone . A job seeker has to nominate and engage in one activity ( for example , either a vocational education activity or Work for the Dole activity ) in any one mutual obligation period ( lasting six months at a time ) . </P> <P> Clients are not expected to engage in the more intensive of these activities as soon as their receipt of the allowance commences . The amount of activity required on behalf of the client in order to continue receiving his / her benefit is usually staggered as follows : </P> <Ul> <Li> Ordinarily , during the first three months of unemployment , a job seeker has no other obligations but to submit a fortnightly Application For Payment form at the local office . The form asks the applicant a number of questions about his / her circumstances and for the basic details of four positions for which the job seeker applied in the last fortnight . Customers may also be required to make up to 10 ' Job Search Contacts ' per fortnight ( dependent on the local labour market and their personal circumstances ) and record the details of these jobs within a specifically issued Job Seeker Diary for a given period of time . The job seeker then takes the Application For Payment form personally to the local Centrelink Office . He will then attend a short one - on - one interview with a Centrelink officer . The interview is usually for the purposes of checking that the application form is in order and that the applicant is aware of any appointments that may need to be attended , and obligations that may need to be met . The client at this stage also has the opportunity to talk to a Centrelink officer about any problems the client may be encountering without having to make a prior appointment first . </Li> <Li> If after an initial three months of unemployment , during which the job seeker has only to hand in the fortnightly application form and record the Job Seeker Diary , the client remains unemployed ; the client will be required to attend appointments with a Job Services Australia provider whose responsibility it is to assist the client to re-enter the work force . The job seeker also has to attend a two - week training course which focusses on job searching skills such as writing resumes and attending interviews . </Li> <Li> If the customer remains unemployed for twelve months , they are then subject to the Work Experience Phase of their Employment Pathway Plan , which consists of more intensive assistance involving the activities listed above , such as , Work for the Dole , accredited study , part - time work , volunteer work or a combination of these .

The Kingdom of Congo remained present in the region between the 14th and the early 19th centuries . Belgian colonization began when King Leopold II founded the Congo Free State , a corporate state run solely by King Leopold . Reports of widespread murder and torture in the rubber plantations led the Belgian government to seize the Congo from Leopold II and establish the Belgian Congo . Under Belgian rule numerous Christian organizations attempted to Westernize the Congolese people . </P> <P> After an uprising by the Congolese people , Belgium surrendered to the independence of the Congo in 1960 . However , the Congo remained unstable because tribal leaders had more power than the central government . Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba tried to restore order with the aid of the Soviet Union as part of the Cold War , causing the United States to support a coup led by Colonel Joseph Mobutu in 1965 . Mobutu quickly seized complete power of the Congo and renamed the country Zaire . He sought to Africanize the country , changing his own name to Mobutu Sese Seko , and demanded that African citizens change their Western names to traditional African names . Mobutu sought to repress any opposition to his rule , in which he successfully did throughout the 1980s . However , with his regime weakened in the 1990s , Mobutu was forced to agree to a power - sharing government with the opposition party . Mobutu remained the head of state and promised elections within the next two years that never took place . </P> <P> In the First Congo War , Rwanda invaded Zaire ; Mobutu lost his power during this process . Laurent - Desire Kabila took power and renamed the country the Democratic Republic of the Congo . After a disappointing rule under Kabila , the Second Congo War broke out , resulting in a regional war in which different African nations took part . Kabila was assassinated by his bodyguard in 2001 , and his son , Joseph , succeeded him and was later elected president by the Congolese government in 2006 . Kabila quickly sought peace . Foreign soldiers remained in the Congo for a few years and a power - sharing government between Kabila and the opposition party was set up . Kabila later resumed complete control over the Congo and was re-elected in a disputed election in 2011 . Today , the Congo remains dangerously unstable . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Early history </Li> <Li> 2 Colonial rule <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Congo Free State ( 1885 -- 1908 ) </Li> <Li> 2.2 Belgian Congo ( 1908 -- 60 ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Independence and the Congo Crisis ( 1960 -- 65 ) </Li> <Li> 4 Zaire ( 1965 -- 97 ) </Li> <Li> 5 Civil Wars ( 1996 - 2003 ) <Ul> <Li> 5.1 First Congo War ( 1996 -- 97 ) </Li> <Li> 5.2 Second Congo War ( 1998 -- 2003 ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 6 Joseph Kabila period <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Transitional government ( 2003 -- 06 ) </Li> <Li> 6.2 Kabila overstays his term </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Continued conflicts <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Conflict in Kivu ( 2004 - present ) <Ul> <Li> 7.1. 1 Allied Democratic Forces insurgency </Li> <Li> 7.1. 2 Ethnic Mai Mai factions </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7.2 Conflict in Katanga </Li> <Li> 7.3 Conflict in Kasai </Li> <Li> 7.4 Ituri conflict </Li> <Li> 7.5 Dongo Conflict </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 See also </Li> <Li> 9 Notes </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 Sources </Li> <Li> 12 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Early history ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Early Congolese history Map of the Kingdom of Kongo <P> The area now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo was populated as early as 80,000 years ago , as shown by the 1988 discovery of the Semliki harpoon at Katanda , one of the oldest barbed harpoons ever found , which is believed to have been used to catch giant river catfish . During its recorded history , the area has also been known as Congo , Congo Free State , Belgian Congo , and Zaire . </P> <P> The Kingdom of Kongo existed from the 14th to the early 19th century . Until the arrival of the Portuguese it was the dominant force in the region along with the Kingdom of Luba , the Kingdom of Lunda , the Mongo people and the Anziku Kingdom . </P> <H2> Colonial rule ( edit ) </H2> See also : Belgian overseas colonies <H3> Congo Free state ( 1885 -- 1908 ) ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Congo Free State Children mutilated during King Leopold II 's rule <P> The Congo Free State was a corporate state privately controlled by Leopold II of Belgium through the Association internationale africaine , a non-governmental organization . Leopold was the sole shareholder and chairman . The state included the entire area of the present Democratic Republic of the Congo . Under Leopold II , the Congo Free State became one of the most infamous international scandals of the turn of the twentieth century . The report of the British Consul Roger Casement led to the arrest and punishment of white officials who had been responsible for cold - blooded killings during a rubber - collecting expedition in 1900 , including a Belgian national who caused the shooting of at least 122 Congolese natives . Estimates of the total death toll vary considerably . The first census was only done in 1924 , so it is even more difficult to quantify the population loss of the period . Roger Casement 's famous 1904 report estimated ten million people . According to Casement 's report , indiscriminate `` war '' , starvation , reduction of births and tropical diseases caused the country 's depopulation . European and U.S. press agencies exposed the conditions in the Congo Free State to the public in 1900 . By 1908 public and diplomatic pressure had led Leopold II to annex the Congo as the Belgian Congo colony . </P> <H3> Belgian Congo ( 1908 -- 60 ) ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Belgian Congo <P> On 15 November 1908 King L\u00e9opold II of Belgium formally relinquished personal control of the Congo Free State . The renamed Belgian Congo was put under the direct administration of the Belgian government and its Ministry of Colonies . </P> <P> Belgian rule in the Congo was based around the `` colonial trinity '' ( trinit\u00e9 coloniale ) of state , missionary and private company interests . The privileging of Belgian commercial interests meant that large amounts of capital flowed into the Congo and that individual regions became specialised . The interests of the government and private enterprise became closely tied ; the state helped companies break strikes and remove other barriers imposed by the indigenous population . The country was split into nesting , hierarchically organised administrative subdivisions , and run uniformly according to a set `` native policy '' ( politique indig\u00e8ne ) -- in contrast to the British and the French , who generally favoured the system of indirect rule whereby traditional leaders were retained in positions of authority under colonial oversight . There was also a high degree of racial segregation . Large numbers of white immigrants who moved to the Congo after the end of World War II came from across the social spectrum , but were nonetheless always treated as superior to blacks . </P> <P> During the 1940s and 1950s , the Congo experienced an unprecedented level of urbanisation and the colonial administration began various development programmes aimed at making the territory into a `` model colony '' . Notable advances were made in treating diseases such as African trypanosomiasis . One of the results of these measures was the development of a new middle class of Europeanised African \u00e9volu\u00e9s in the cities . By the 1950s the Congo had a wage labour force twice as large as that in any other African colony . The Congo 's rich natural resources , including uranium -- much of the uranium used by the U.S. nuclear programme during World War II was Congolese -- led to substantial interest in the region from both the Soviet Union and the United States as the Cold War developed . </P> <H2> Independence and the Congo crisis ( 1960 -- 65 ) ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Congo Crisis <P> Following riots in Leopoldville 4 -- 7 January 1959 , and in Stanleyville on 31 October 1959 , the Belgians realised they could not maintain control of such a vast country in the face of rising demands for independence . Belgian and Congolese political leaders held a Round Table Conference in Brussels beginning on 18 January 1960 . At the end of the conference on 27 January 1960 it was announced that elections would be held in the Congo on 22 May 1960 , and full independence granted on 30 June 1960 . The Congo was indeed granted its independence on 30 June 1960 , and adopted the name `` Republic of the Congo '' ( R\u00e9publique du Congo ) . The French colony of Middle Congo ( Moyen Congo ) also chose the name Republic of Congo upon its independence , so the two countries are more commonly known as Congo - L\u00e9opoldville and Congo - Brazzaville , after their capital cities . President Mobutu changed the country 's official name to Zaire in 1971 . That name comes from Portuguese , adapted from the Kongo word nzere or nzadi ( `` river that swallows all rivers '' ) </P> <P> In 1960 , the country was very unstable -- regional tribal leaders held far more power than the central government -- and with the departure of the Belgian administrators , almost no skilled bureaucrats remained in the country . The first Congolese graduated university only in 1956 , and very few in the new nation had any idea how to manage a country of such size . </P> <P> Parliamentary elections in 1960 produced the nationalist Patrice Lumumba as prime minister and pro-Western Joseph Kasavubu as president of the newly independent Republic of The Congo . </P> <P> On 5 July 1960 , a military mutiny by Congolese soldiers against their European officers broke out in the capital and rampant looting began . On 11 July 1960 the richest province of the country , Katanga , seceded under Moise Tshombe . The United Nations sent 20,000 peacekeepers to protect Europeans in the country and try to restore order . Western paramilitaries and mercenaries , often hired by mining companies to protect their interests , also began to pour into the country . In this period Congo 's second richest province , Kasai , also announced its independence on 8 August 1960 . </P> <P> Prime Minister Lumumba turned to the USSR for assistance . Nikita Khrushchev agreed to help , offering advanced weaponry and technical advisors . The United States viewed the Soviet presence as an attempt to take advantage of the situation and gain a proxy state in sub-Saharan Africa . UN forces were ordered to block any shipments of arms into the country . The United States also looked for a way to replace Lumumba as leader . President Kasavubu had clashed with Prime Minister Lumumba and advocated an alliance with the West rather than the Soviets . The U.S. sent weapons and CIA personnel to aid forces allied with Kasavubu and combat the Soviet presence . On 14 September 1960 , with U.S. and CIA support , Colonel Joseph Mobutu overthrew the government and arrested Lumumba . </P> <P> On 17 January 1961 Mobutu sent Lumumba to \u00c9lisabethville ( now Lubumbashi ) , capital of Katanga . In full view of the press he was beaten and forced to eat copies of his own speeches . For three weeks afterward , he was not seen or heard from . Then Katangan radio announced implausibly that he had escaped and been killed by villagers .

He had two brothers , Roy and Hal Jr. , and two sisters , Doris Ann ( accidentally killed at age 2 by 6 - year - old Roy playing with a shotgun ) and Pansy Lee . His first experience with the military was as a teen at the Citizens Military Training Camp at Fort Benjamin Harrison , Indianapolis , Indiana , during the summers of 1939 and 1940 . On February 26 , 1945 , Yeager married Glennis Dickhouse , and the couple had four children . Glennis died in 1990 . </P> <P> The name `` Yeager '' ( / \u02c8je\u026a\u0261\u0259r / ) is an Anglicized form of the German name J\u00e4ger or Jaeger ( German : `` hunter '' ) . He is the cousin of former baseball catcher Steve Yeager . </P> <H2> Career ( edit ) </H2> <H3> World War II ( edit ) </H3> <P> Yeager enlisted as a private in the U.S. Army Air Forces ( USAAF ) on September 12 , 1941 , and became an aircraft mechanic at George Air Force Base , Victorville , California . At enlistment , Yeager was not eligible for flight training because of his age and educational background , but the entry of the U.S. into World War II less than three months later prompted the USAAF to alter its recruiting standards . Having unusually sharp vision ( a visual acuity rated 20 / 10 ) , which once enabled him to shoot a deer at 600 yards ( 550 m ) , Yeager displayed natural talent as a pilot and was accepted for flight training . </P> <P> He received his wings and a promotion to flight officer at Luke Field , Arizona , where he graduated from class 43C on March 10 , 1943 . Assigned to the 357th Fighter Group at Tonopah , Nevada , he initially trained as a fighter pilot , flying Bell P - 39 Airacobras ( being grounded for seven days for clipping a farmer 's tree during a training flight ) , and shipped overseas with the group on November 23 , 1943 . </P> P - 51D - 20NA , Glamorous Glen III , is the aircraft in which Yeager achieved most of his aerial victories . <P> Stationed in the United Kingdom at RAF Leiston , Yeager flew P - 51 Mustangs in combat with the 363d Fighter Squadron . He named his aircraft Glamorous Glen after his girlfriend , Glennis Faye Dickhouse , who became his wife in February 1945 . Yeager had gained one victory before he was shot down over France in his first aircraft ( P - 51B - 5 - NA s / n 43 - 6763 ) on March 5 , 1944 during his eighth mission . He escaped to Spain on March 30 with the help of the Maquis ( French Resistance ) and returned to England on May 15 , 1944 . During his stay with the Maquis , Yeager assisted the guerrillas in duties that did not involve direct combat ; he helped to construct bombs for the group , a skill that he had learned from his father . He was awarded the Bronze Star for helping a B - 24 navigator , `` Pat '' Patterson , who was shot in the knee during the escape attempt , to cross the Pyrenees . Yeager cut off the tendon by which Patterson 's leg was hanging below the knee , then tied off the leg with a spare shirt made of parachute silk . </P> <P> Despite a regulation prohibiting `` evaders '' ( escaped pilots ) from flying over enemy territory again , the purpose of which was to prevent a second capture from compromising resistance groups , Yeager was reinstated to flying combat . He had joined another evader , fellow P - 51 pilot 1st Lt Fred Glover , in speaking directly to the Supreme Allied Commander , General Dwight D. Eisenhower , on June 12 , 1944 . With Glover pleading their case , they argued that because the Allies had invaded France and the Maquis were by then openly fighting the Nazis alongside Allied troops , if Yeager or Glover were shot down again , there was little about those who had previously helped them evade capture that could be revealed to the enemy . </P> <P> Eisenhower , after gaining permission from the War Department to decide the requests , concurred with Yeager and Glover . Yeager later credited his postwar success in the Air Force to this decision , saying that his test pilot career followed naturally from his having been a decorated combat pilot , along with having been an aircraft mechanic before attending pilot school . In part , because of his maintenance background , he also frequently served as a maintenance officer in his flying units . </P> <P> Yeager demonstrated outstanding flying skills and combat leadership . On October 12 , 1944 , he became the first pilot in his group to make `` ace in a day , '' downing five enemy aircraft in a single mission . Two of these kills were scored without firing a single shot : when he flew into firing position against a Messerschmitt Bf 109 , the pilot of the aircraft panicked , breaking to starboard and colliding with his wingman . Yeager said both pilots bailed out . He finished the war with 11.5 official victories , including one of the first air - to - air victories over a jet fighter , a German Messerschmitt Me 262 that he shot down on final approach for landing . </P> <P> In his 1986 memoirs , Yeager recalled with disgust that `` atrocities were committed by both sides '' said he went on a mission with orders from the Eighth Air Force to `` strafe anything that moved . '' During the mission briefing , he whispered to Major Donald H. Bochkay , `` If we are going to do things like this , we sure as hell better make sure we are on the winning side . '' Yeager said , `` I 'm certainly not proud of that particular strafing mission against civilians . But it is there , on the record and in my memory . '' He has also expressed bitterness at his treatment in Britain during WWII , describing the British as `` arrogant '' and `` nasty '' . </P> <P> Yeager was commissioned a second lieutenant while at Leiston , and was promoted to captain before the end of his tour . He flew his 61st and final mission on January 15 , 1945 , and returned to the United States in early February . As an evader , he received his choice of assignments and , because his new wife was pregnant , chose Wright Field to be near his home in West Virginia . His high number of flight hours and maintenance experience qualified him to become a functional test pilot of repaired aircraft , which brought him under the command of Colonel Albert Boyd , head of the Aeronautical Systems Flight Test Division . </P> <H3> Post-world War II ( edit ) </H3> Test pilot -- breaking the sound barrier ( edit ) Play media Yeager broke the sound barrier on October 14 , 1947 , in the X-1 . <P> Yeager remained in the Air Force after the war , becoming a test pilot at Muroc Army Air Field ( now Edwards Air Force Base ) , following graduation from Air Materiel Command Flight Performance School ( Class 46C ) . After Bell Aircraft test pilot Chalmers `` Slick '' Goodlin demanded $150,000 ( $1.6 million in 2015 dollars ) to break the sound `` barrier , '' the USAAF selected Yeager to fly the rocket - powered Bell XS - 1 in a NACA program to research high - speed flight . </P> Yeager in front of the Bell X-1 , which , as with all of the aircraft assigned to him , he named Glamorous Glennis ( or some variation thereof ) , after his wife . Yeager in the Bell X-1 cockpit <P> Such was the difficulty in this task that the answer to many of the inherent challenges was along the lines of `` Yeager better have paid - up insurance . '' Two nights before the scheduled date for the flight , Yeager broke two ribs when he fell from a horse . He was worried that the injury would remove him from the mission and reported that he went to a civilian doctor in nearby Rosamond , who taped his ribs . Yeager told only his wife , as well as friend and fellow project pilot Jack Ridley , about the accident . On the day of the flight , Yeager was in such pain that he could not seal the X-1's hatch by himself . Ridley rigged up a device , using the end of a broom handle as an extra lever , to allow Yeager to seal the hatch . </P> <P> Yeager broke the sound barrier on October 14 , 1947 , flying the X-1 at Mach 1.07 at an altitude of 45,000 ft ( 13,700 m ) . over the Rogers Dry Lake in the Mojave Desert . Yeager was awarded the MacKay and Collier Trophies in 1948 for his mach - transcending flight , and the Harmon International Trophy in 1954 . The X-1 he flew that day was later put on permanent display at the Smithsonian Institution 's National Air and Space Museum . </P> <P> Yeager went on to break many other speed and altitude records . He was also one of the first American pilots to fly a MiG - 15 , after its pilot , No Kum - sok , defected to South Korea . Returning to Muroc , during the latter half of 1953 , Yeager was involved with the USAF team that was working on the X-1A , an aircraft designed to surpass Mach 2 in level flight . That year , he flew a chase aircraft for the civilian pilot Jackie Cochran as she became the first woman to fly faster than sound . </P> <P> On November 20 , 1953 , the U.S. Navy program involving the D - 558 - II Skyrocket and its pilot , Scott Crossfield , became the first team to reach twice the speed of sound . After they were bested , Ridley and Yeager decided to beat rival Crossfield 's speed record in a series of test flights that they dubbed `` Operation NACA Weep . '' Not only did they beat Crossfield by setting a new record at Mach 2.44 on December 12 , 1953 , but they did it in time to spoil a celebration planned for the 50th anniversary of flight in which Crossfield was to be called `` the fastest man alive . '' </P> <P> The new record flight , however , did not entirely go to plan , since shortly after reachi\n\nQuestion:\nwhen was the sound barrier broken for the first time\n", "answer": "1947"}

The object is moved in small increments between individually photographed frames , creating the illusion of movement when the series of frames is played as a fast sequence . Dolls with movable joints or clay figures are often used in stop motion for their ease of repositioning . Stop motion animation using plasticine is called clay animation or `` clay - mation '' . Not all stop motion requires figures or models ; many stop motion films can involve using humans , household appliances and other things for comedic effect . Stop motion can also use sequential drawing in a similar manner to traditional animation , such as a flip book . Stop motion using humans is sometimes referred to as pixilation or pixilate animation . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Terminology </Li> <Li> 2 History <Ul> <Li> 2.1 1960s and 1970s </Li> <Li> 2.2 1980s to present </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Variations of stop motion <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Stereoscopic stop motion </Li> <Li> 3.2 Go motion </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Comparison to computer - generated imagery </Li> <Li> 5 Stop motion in television and movies </Li> <Li> 6 Stop motion in other media </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Terminology ( edit ) </H2> <P> The term `` stop motion '' , related to the animation technique , is often spelled with a hyphen , `` stop - motion '' . Both orthographical variants , with and without the hyphen , are correct , but the hyphenated one has , in addition , a second meaning , not related to animation or cinema : `` a device for automatically stopping a machine or engine when something has gone wrong '' ( The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary , 1993 edition ) . </P> <P> Stop motion is often confused with the time lapse technique , where still photographs of a live surrounding are taken at regular intervals and combined into a continuous film . Time lapse is a technique whereby the frequency at which film frames are captured is much lower than that used to view the sequence . When played at normal speed , time appears to be moving faster . </P> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> Play media The Sculptor 's Nightmare Play media Segment from the 1925 film The Lost World animated by Willis O'Brien <P> Stop motion animation has a long history in film . It was often used to show objects moving as if by magic . The first instance of the stop motion technique can be credited to Albert E. Smith and J. Stuart Blackton for Vitagraph 's The Humpty Dumpty Circus ( 1897 ) , in which a toy circus of acrobats and animals comes to life . In 1902 , the film Fun in a Bakery Shop used the stop trick technique in the `` lightning sculpting '' sequence . French trick film maestro Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s used stop motion animation once to produce moving title - card letters in one of his short films , and a number of his special effects are based on stop motion photography . In 1907 , The Haunted Hotel is a new stop motion film by J. Stuart Blackton , and was a resounding success when released . Segundo de Chom\u00f3n ( 1871 -- 1929 ) , from Spain , released El Hotel El\u00e9ctrico later that same year , and used similar techniques as the Blackton film . In 1908 , A Sculptor 's Welsh Rarebit Nightmare was released , as was The Sculptor 's Nightmare , a film by Billy Bitzer . Italian animator Rom\u00e9o Bossetti impressed audiences with his object animation tour - de-force , The Automatic Moving Company in 1912 . The great European stop motion pioneer was Wladyslaw Starewicz ( 1892 -- 1965 ) , who animated The Beautiful Lukanida ( 1910 ) , The Battle of the Stag Beetles ( 1910 ) , The Ant and the Grasshopper ( 1911 ) . </P> <P> One of the earliest clay animation films was Modelling Extraordinary , which impressed audiences in 1912 . December 1916 brought the first of Willie Hopkins ' 54 episodes of `` Miracles in Mud '' to the big screen . Also in December 1916 , the first woman animator , Helena Smith Dayton , began experimenting with clay stop motion . She would release her first film in 1917 , an adaptation of William Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet . </P> <P> In the turn of the century , there was another well known animator known as Willis O ' Brien ( known by others as O'bie ) . His work on The Lost World ( 1925 ) is well known , but he is most admired for his work on King Kong ( 1933 ) , a milestone of his films made possible by stop motion animation . </P> <P> O'Brien's protege and eventual successor in Hollywood was Ray Harryhausen . After learning under O'Brien on the film Mighty Joe Young ( 1949 ) , Harryhausen would go on to create the effects for a string of successful and memorable films over the next three decades . These included The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms ( 1953 ) , It Came from Beneath the Sea ( 1955 ) , Jason and the Argonauts ( 1963 ) , The Golden Voyage of Sinbad ( 1973 ) and Clash of the Titans ( 1981 ) . </P> <P> In a 1940 promotional film , Autolite , an automotive parts supplier , featured stop motion animation of its products marching past Autolite factories to the tune of Franz Schubert 's Military March . An abbreviated version of this sequence was later used in television ads for Autolite , especially those on the 1950s CBS program Suspense , which Autolite sponsored . </P> <H3> 1960s and 1970s ( edit ) </H3> <P> In the 1960s and 1970s , independent clay animator Eliot Noyes Jr. refined the technique of `` free - form '' clay animation with his Oscar - nominated 1965 film Clay ( or the Origin of Species ) . Noyes also used stop motion to animate sand lying on glass for his musical animated film Sandman ( 1975 ) . </P> <P> Stop motion was used by Rankin / Bass Productions on some of their television programs and feature films including The New Adventures of Pinocchio ( 1960 -- 1961 ) , Willy McBean and his Magic Machine ( 1963 , 1965 ) and most notably seasonal / holiday favorites like Rudolph the Red - Nosed Reindeer ( 1964 ) , Mad Monster Party ? ( 1966 , 1967 ) , The Little Drummer Boy ( 1968 ) , Santa Claus is Comin ' to Town ( 1970 ) and Here Comes Peter Cottontail ( 1971 ) . Under the name of `` Animagic '' , the stop motion works of Rankin / Bass were supervised by Tadahito Mochinaga at his MOM Production in Tokyo , Japan . </P> <P> In 1975 , filmmaker and clay animation experimenter Will Vinton joined with sculptor Bob Gardiner to create an experimental film called Closed Mondays which became the world 's first stop motion film to win an Oscar . Will Vinton followed with several other successful short film experiments including The Great Cognito , Creation , and Rip Van Winkle which were each nominated for Academy Awards . In 1977 , Vinton made a documentary about this process and his style of animation which he dubbed `` claymation '' ; he titled the documentary Claymation . Soon after this documentary , the term was trademarked by Vinton to differentiate his team 's work from others who had been , or were beginning to do , `` clay animation '' . While the word has stuck and is often used to describe clay animation and stop motion , it remains a trademark owned currently by Laika Entertainment , Inc . Twenty clay - animation episodes featuring the clown Mr. Bill were a feature of Saturday Night Live , starting from a first appearance in February 1976 . </P> <P> At very much the same time in the UK , Peter Lord and David Sproxton formed Aardman Animations . In 1976 they created the character Morph who appeared as an animated side - kick to the TV presenter Tony Hart on his BBC TV programme Take Hart . The five - inch - high presenter was made from a traditional British modelling clay called Plasticine . In 1977 they started on a series of animated films , again using modelling clay , but this time made for a more adult audience . The soundtrack for Down and Out was recorded in a Salvation Army Hostel and Plasticine puppets were animated to dramatise the dialogue . A second film , also for the BBC followed in 1978 . A TV series The Amazing Adventures of Morph was aired in 1980 . </P> <P> Sand - coated puppet animation was used in the Oscar - winning 1977 film The Sand Castle , produced by Dutch - Canadian animator Co Hoedeman . Hoedeman was one of dozens of animators sheltered by the National Film Board of Canada , a Canadian government film arts agency that had supported animators for decades . A pioneer of refined multiple stop motion films under the NFB banner was Norman McLaren , who brought in many other animators to create their own creatively controlled films . Notable among these are the pinscreen animation films of Jacques Drouin , made with the original pinscreen donated by Alexandre Alexeieff and Claire Parker . </P> <P> Italian stop motion films include Quaq Quao ( 1978 ) , by Francesco Misseri , which was stop motion with origami , The Red and the Blue and the clay animation kittens Mio and Mao . Other European productions included a stop motion - animated series of Tove Jansson 's The Moomins ( from 1979 , often referred to as `` The Fuzzy Felt Moomins '' ) , produced by Film Polski and Jupiter Films . </P> <P> One of the main British Animation teams , John Hardwick and Bob Bura , were the main animators in many early British TV shows , and are famous for their work on the Trumptonshire trilogy . </P> <P> Disney experimented with several stop motion techniques by hiring independent animator - director Mike Jittlov to do the first stop motion animation of Mickey Mouse toys ever produced for a short sequence called Mouse Mania , part of a TV special commemorating Mickey Mouse 's 50th Anniversary called Mickey 's 50 in 1978 . Jittlov again produced some impressive multi-technique stop motion animation a year later for a 1979 Disney special promoting their release of the feature film The Black Hole . Titled Major Effects , Jittlov 's work stood out as the best part of the special . Jittlov released his footage the following year to 16mm film collectors as a short film titled The Wizard of Speed and Time , along with four of his other short multi-technique animated films , most of which eventually evolved into his own feature - length film of the same title . Effectively demonstrating almost all animation techniques , as well as how he produced them , the film was released to theaters in 1987 and to video in 1989 . </P> <H3> 1980s to present ( edit ) </H3> Stefano Bessoni , Italian filmmaker , illustrator and stop - motion animator working on Gallows Songs ( 2014 ) <P> In the 1970s and 1980s , Industrial Light & Magic often used stop motion model animation for films such as the original Star Wars trilogy : the chess sequence in Star Wars , the Tauntauns and AT - AT walkers in The Empire Strikes Back , and the AT - ST walkers in Return of the Jedi were all stop motion animation , some of it using the Go films .

See history of the United States dollar . </P> <H2> Passive retirement ( edit ) </H2> <P> Although they are still technically legal tender in the United States , high - denomination bills were last printed on December 27 , 1945 , and officially discontinued on July 14 , 1969 , by the Federal Reserve System , due to ' lack of use ' . The $5,000 and $10,000 effectively disappeared well before then . </P> <P> The Federal Reserve began taking high - denomination currency out of circulation ( destroying large bills received by banks ) in 1969 . As of May 30 , 2009 , only 336 $10,000 bills were known to exist ; 342 remaining $5,000 bills ; and 165,372 remaining $1,000 bills . Due to their rarity , collectors often pay considerably more than the face value of the bills to acquire them . Some are in museums in other parts of the world . </P> <P> For the most part , these bills were used by banks and the Federal government for large financial transactions . This was especially true for gold certificates from 1865 to 1934 . However , for the most part , the introduction of an electronic money system has made large - scale cash transactions obsolete . When combined with concerns about counterfeiting and the use of cash in unlawful activities such as the illegal drug trade and money laundering , it is unlikely that the U.S. government will re-issue large denomination currency in the near future , despite the amount of inflation that has occurred since 1969 ( a $100 bill is now worth less , in real terms , than a $20 bill was worth in 1969 ) . According to the U.S. Department of Treasury website , `` The present denominations of our currency in production are $1 , $2 , $5 , $10 , $20 , $50 and $100 . The purpose of the United States currency system is to serve the needs of the public and these denominations meet that goal . Neither the Department of the Treasury nor the Federal Reserve System has any plans to change the denominations in use today .

Longacre </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Design date </Th> <Td> 1860 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The Indian Head cent , also known as an Indian Head penny , was a one - cent coin ( $0.01 ) produced by the United States Bureau of the Mint from 1859 to 1909 . It was designed by James Barton Longacre , the Chief Engraver at the Philadelphia Mint . </P> <P> From 1793 to 1857 , the cent was a copper coin about the size of a half dollar . As rising copper prices made it impractical to keep striking them , in 1857 the Mint reduced the size of the cent , issuing a new design , the Flying Eagle cent . The new pieces were identical in diameter to modern cents , though somewhat thicker and made of copper - nickel . The design caused production difficulties , and the Mint soon looked to replace the coin . Mint Director James Ross Snowden selected the Indian Head design , and chose a laurel wreath for the reverse that was replaced in 1860 by an oak wreath with a shield . Cents were hoarded during the economic chaos of the American Civil War , when the metal nickel was in short supply . As Mint officials saw that privately issued bronze tokens were circulating , they induced Congress to pass the Coinage Act of 1864 , authorizing a slimmer cent of bronze alloy . </P> <P> In the postwar period , the cent became very popular and was struck in large numbers in most years . An exception was 1877 , when a poor economy and little demand for cents created one of the rarest dates in the series . With the advent of coin - operated machines in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , even more cents were produced , reaching 100 million for the first time in 1907 . In 1909 , the Indian Head cent was replaced by the Lincoln cent , designed by Victor D. Brenner . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Inception </Li> <Li> 2 Design </Li> <Li> 3 Production <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Redesign and surplus ( 1859 -- 1861 ) </Li> <Li> 3.2 Shortage and redesign ( 1862 -- 1864 ) </Li> <Li> 3.3 Later years ( 1865 -- 1909 ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Replacement </Li> <Li> 5 Collecting </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Inception ( edit ) </H2> Main articles : Large cent ( United States coin ) and Flying Eagle cent <P> The half - dollar - sized large cent was struck from 1793 to 1857 . That coin was intended to contain close to a cent 's worth of copper , as people then expected that coins contain close to their face values in metal . Nevertheless , because of the constitutional clause making only gold and silver legal tender , the government would not accept copper cents for taxes or other payments . By the early 1850s , fluctuations in the price of copper led the Mint of the United States ( hereafter Mint ) to seek alternatives , including reducing the size of the cent and experimenting with compositions other than pure copper . The result was the Flying Eagle cent , the same diameter as the later Lincoln cent but somewhat thicker and heavier , composed of 88 % copper and 12 % nickel . The Flying Eagle cent was struck in limited numbers as a pattern coin in 1856 , then for circulation in 1857 and 1858 . </P> <P> The Flying Eagle cent was issued in exchange for worn Spanish colonial silver coins , which until then had circulated widely in the United States . These `` small cents '' were also issued in exchange for the copper coins they had replaced . By 1858 , Mint authorities found the piece unsatisfactory in production . The high points on both sides of the coin ( the eagle 's head and the wreath ) opposed each other , and it was difficult to get the design to be brought out fully in the tough copper - nickel alloy . Mint Engraver James B. Longacre , designer of the Flying Eagle cent , was instructed to develop alternative designs . He produced one , showing a slimmer eagle , which would not clash as much with the reverse wreath . Although this would have cured the production problem , the design was not liked . Mint Director James Ross Snowden suggested a head of Columbus as an obverse design , but Longacre felt the public would not approve of a historic figure on an American coin . </P> A Spanish colonial two - reales piece ( `` two bits '' ) from the Potos\u00ed Mint ( today in Bolivia ) <P> In 1858 , the Mint tested new designs for the cent . Between 60 and 100 sets of twelve pattern coins were struck , consisting of the standard Flying Eagle obverse , a `` scrawny eagle '' pattern , and the Indian Head design , mated with four different wreaths for the reverse . Snowden would make his choice of what design would be struck in 1859 from these patterns ; the sets were also sold to collectors . The Indian Head design was apparently prepared by April , as on the twelfth of that month , a Mr. Howard wrote to Snowden that `` I have learned that a new pattern piece for the cent has been struck off at the Mint ( with ) a head resembling that of the three dollar piece and on the reverse a shield at the top of the olive and oak wreath '' , and asking to purchase a specimen . Other numismatists also sought pieces : R. Coulton Davis , a Philadelphia druggist with ties to the Mint , wrote to Snowden in June informing him of a favorable story in a Boston newspaper , and Augustus B. Sage wrote to the Mint Director the same month , asking for a specimen for himself , and one for the newly founded American Numismatic Society . </P> <P> According to Walter Breen , Snowden most likely chose the combination of the Indian Head and the laurel wreath as it was the lowest relief of any of the options , and could be expected to strike well . On November 4 , 1858 , Snowden wrote to Treasury Secretary Howell Cobb about the Indian Head design , and two days later wrote to Longacre , informing him that it was approved . Longacre was to prepare the necessary dies for production , which was to begin on January 1 , 1859 . </P> <H2> Design ( edit ) </H2> <P> Longacre advocated his Indian Head design in an August 21 , 1858 , letter to Snowden : </P> <P> From the copper shores of Lake Superior , to the silver mountains of Potosi from the Ojibwa to the Aramanian , the feathered tiara is as characteristic of the primitive races of our hemisphere , as the turban is of the Asiatic . Nor is there anything in its decorative character , repulsive to the association of Liberty ... It is more appropriate than the Phrygian cap , the emblem rather of the emancipated slave , than of the independent freeman , of those who are able to say `` we were never in bondage to any man '' . I regard then this emblem of America as a proper and well defined portion of our national inheritance ; and having now the opportunity of consecrating it as a memorial of Liberty , ' our Liberty ' , American Liberty ; why not use it ? One more graceful can scarcely be devised . We have only to determine that it shall be appropriate , and all the world outside of us can not wrest it from us . </P> <P> By numismatic legend , the facial features of the goddess Liberty on the obverse of the Indian Head cent were based on the features of Longacre 's daughter Sarah ; the tale runs that she was at the mint one day when she tried on the headdress of one of a number of Native Americans who were visiting , and her father sketched her . However , Sarah Longacre was 30 years old and married in 1858 , not 12 as in the tale , and Longacre himself stated that the face was based on a statue of Venus in Philadelphia on loan from the Vatican . He did often sketch his elder daughter , and there are resemblances between the depictions of Sarah and the various representations of Liberty on his coins of the 1850s . These tales were apparently extant at the time , as Snowden , writing to Treasury Secretary Howell Cobb in November 1858 , denied that the coin was based `` on any human features in the Longacre family '' . Lee F. McKenzie , in his 1991 article on Longacre , notes that any artist can be influenced by many things , but calls the story `` essentially false '' . </P> <P> Regardless of who posed for Longacre , the facial features of the `` Indian '' are essentially Caucasian , meaning that a White woman wears the headdress of a Native American man . Longacre had , in 1854 , designed the three - dollar piece with a female with similar features ( also supposedly based on the museum sculpture ) but a more fanciful headdress , and adapted that design for the gold dollar . Officials were aware of this artistic license at the time of issue ; Snowden , in his November 1858 letter to Cobb , characterizes the two earlier coins as `` the artists at the Mint evidently not realizing the absurd incongruity of placing this most masculine attribute of the warrior brave on the head of a woman '' . Longacre would not be the last to juxtapose the features of a White woman with an Indian headdress reserved for men ; Augustus Saint Gaudens , for the Indian Head eagle ( 1907 ) , produced a similar design . Later issues depict more accurate Indians , including Bela Lyon Pratt 's Indian Head gold pieces ( 1908 ) , the Buffalo nickel ( 1913 ) by James Earle Fraser , who worked from Native American models , and the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar ( 1926 ) , designed by Fraser and his wife Laura . </P> Cornelius Vermeule thought the Indian Head cent was better than Longacre 's 1859 pattern half dollar . <P> Art historian Cornelius Vermeule had mixed emotions about the Indian Head cent : `` Longacre enriched the mythology of American coinage in a pleasant if unpretentious fashion . Given his pattern half - dollar designs of 1859 as a yardstick , he could have done worse . '' In another comparison , Vermeule suggested , `` far from a major creation aesthetically or iconographically , and far less attractive to the eye than the ( flying eagle ) , the Indian head cent was at least to achieve the blessing of popular appeal . The coin became perhaps the most beloved and typically American of any piece great or small in the American series . Great art the coin was not , but it was one of the first products of the United States mints to achieve the common touch . '' </P> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Redesign and surplus ( 1859 -- 1861 ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> Production of the Indian Head cent for commerce began at the start of 1859 . As issued for circulation , the pieces differ in some particulars from the pattern 1858 cent of similar design ; Longacre sharpened some details . The pattern coin had the laurel leaves in the reverse wreath in bunches of five leaves ; the issued 1859 cent has them in bunches of six . Cents dated 1858 with the adopted reverse ( with six - leaf bunches ) are known , were most likely struck in 1859 , and are extremely rare . </P> <P> In 1860 , the reverse of the cent was changed to feature an oak wreath and a narrow shield ; such reverses are also known on 1859 - dated pieces struck as patterns . According to Richard Snow in his guide book to Flying Eagle and Indian Head cents , this was not due to problems with the `` Laurel Wreath '' reverse design used in 1859 , as full details survive on many extant pie\n", "answer": "1859"}

The 1890s economic depression and the rise of the trade unions and the Labor parties during this period led to a movement for welfare reform . </P> <P> In 1900 , the states of New South Wales and Victoria enacted legislation introducing non-contributory pensions for those aged 65 and over . Queensland legislated a similar system in 1907 before the Australian labor Commonwealth government led by Andrew Fisher introduced a national aged pension under the Invalid and Old - Aged Pensions Act 1908 . A national invalid diasbility pension was started in 1910 , and a national maternity allowance was introduced in 1912 . </P> <P> During the Second World War , Australia under a labor government created a welfare state by enacting national schemes for : child endowment in 1941 ( superseding the 1927 New South Wales scheme ) ; a widows ' pension in 1942 ( superseding the New South Wales 1926 scheme ) ; a wife 's allowance in 1943 ; additional allowances for the children of pensioners in 1943 ; and unemployment , sickness , and special benefits in 1945 ( superseding the Queensland 1923 scheme ) . </P> <P> The Social Services Legislation Amendment ( Welfare Reform ) Bill 2017 has changed several aspects of social security in Australia , and has been given assent to as of 11 April 2018 . It includes a demerit - point system for not meeting welfare obligations . </P> <H2> Contemporary welfare attitudes ( edit ) </H2> <P> Current attitudes toward welfare in Australia can be separated into support for the welfare system and support for welfare recipients . A multivariate analysis using canonical correlation analysis identified five distinct profiles of welfare attitudes and socio - demographic characteristics . The main attitude cluster was one toward support for the welfare system and welfare recipients . Having receiving government welfare in the past strongly predicted a person supporting the welfare system and its beneficiaries . The next most prominent attitude profile was summarized as ' the welfare system is good but the people on it are lazy and dependent ' . This attitude profile was found among people receiving welfare payments that were either normative ( e.g. the age pension ) or where there is little expectation that a person will return to work ( e.g. disability support pension ) . Overall , Australian 's hold more negative attitudes toward welfare recipients than they do the welfare system . People with a history of receiving unemployment benefits tend to have more negative welfare attitudes if they live in areas where other community members have more negative attitudes . </P> <H2> Legal framework ( edit ) </H2> <P> Social security payments and other benefits are currently made available under the following acts of parliament : </P> <Ul> <Li> Social Security Act 1991 </Li> <Li> A New Tax System ( Family Assistance ) Act 1999 </Li> <Li> Student Assistance Act 1973 </Li> <Li> Paid Parental Leave Act 2010 </Li> </Ul> <H2> Payments under the Social Security Act and the student Assistance Act ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> ABSTUDY -- offers a range of allowances to assist Indigenous students and New Apprentices . </Li> <Li> Age Pension -- for people planning for retirement or who are already retired aged 65 years and over . </Li> <Li> Assistance for Isolated Children -- for families with a child who can not attend school locally because of distance or special needs . </Li> <Li> Austudy Payment -- for full - time students and New Apprentices aged 25 years or over . </Li> <Li> Carer Allowance -- for people who care for minors 16 -- 17 and adults over 18 years with a disability . </Li> <Li> Carer Allowance ( Child ) -- for people who care for a child under 16 years with a disability . </Li> <Li> Carer Payment -- for people who provide full - time care for someone with a disability </Li> <Li> Disability Support Pension -- for people unable to work for 2 years due to illness , injury or disability . </Li> <Li> Double Orphan Pension -- for people who are raising children who have lost both parents . </Li> <Li> Maternity Payment -- for help with those extra costs after the birth of a new baby . </Li> <Li> Newstart Allowance -- for people who are looking for employment . </Li> <Li> Parenting Payment -- for parents or guardians to help with the cost of raising children under 6 for partnered parents and under 8 for sole parents . </Li> <Li> Pensioner Education Supplement -- for people on pensions with education expenses . </Li> <Li> Special Benefit -- for people who are in financial hardship , have no way of supporting themselves and are not entitled to another payment ( normally due to residency requirements ) </Li> <Li> Youth Allowance -- for full - time students or New Apprentices aged 15 ( under some circumstances ) 16 to 24 and people aged under 21 who are undertaking job search or a combination of approved activities . </Li> </Ul> <H3> Income support ( edit ) </H3> <P> All Centrelink income support payments are payable fortnightly , usually by direct deposit required into the recipient 's bank account . They are also subject to a means test which calculates the recipient ( and their partner 's ) fortnightly income and assets and affects the rate of their payment accordingly . As such , people on lower incomes may be entitled to part - payment of their allowance ( subject to other qualification requirements ) . The assessment of income and assets varies greatly between different social security payments and the effect that income and assets have on each payment differs in that they have different income thresholds ( i.e. how much income one can earn before it affects their payment ) and different taper rates ( the amount the payment drops by per dollar above these thresholds ) . </P> <P> An individual may be precluded from claiming any of income support payments listed below for a certain number of weeks following receipt of a lump sum compensation payment , made wholly or partly in respect of lost earnings or lost capacity to earn resulting from personal injury ( often received in settlement of a Workers ' Compensation claim ) . The number of weeks for which the preclusion period applies to an individual is proportional the size of the lump sum payment they received . Centrelink has a discretion to reduce the duration of the preclusion period if it is satisfied that there exist special circumstances that make an individual 's case out of the ordinary : for example , extreme financial hardship . </P> Age pension ( edit ) <P> The Age Pension was the first payment made by the Commonwealth Government , dating back to 1909 . It is available to persons aged 65 years and over . The eligibility age is currently being progressively increased to a cap of 67 years old . Except for the mandatory superannuation scheme , workers do not contribute to a pension or insurance scheme in Australia , unlike pension schemes in many other countries . Taxpayer - funded pensions are means tested . </P> Newstart Allowance ( edit ) <P> Newstart Allowance is an unemployment benefit paid to unemployed people aged 22 to 64 . To be eligible , a person must apply for the benefit and be actively seeking work . On 1 July 1991 , it replaced the Unemployment Benefit ( UB ) which had been unchanged since 1945 . It was part of a government reform called Newstart - the Active Employment Strategy . </P> <P> It is paid on the basis of a ' mutual agreement ' between the customer and Centrelink , where Centrelink will continue to pay fortnightly payments to the customer for so long as the customer attempts to find employment and fulfills the mutual obligation requirements . These mutual agreements are negotiated between Centrelink , the job seeker and their Job Services Australia provider or Disability Employment Services provider , and are recorded into an Employment Pathway Plan or `` EPP '' . Activities to which a job seeker may have to agree , in order to continue receiving the Newstart Allowance , include applying for a specific number of jobs ( usually ten ) per fortnight and recording these applications in a Centrelink issued diary , undertaking vocational education or training , paid work experience , participation in a labour market program or Work for the Dole project , and other activities , such as voluntary work if considered appropriate by Centrelink . For example , more elderly customers who have been made redundant and are approaching the age pension age , and who may face considerable difficulties re-entering the labour market , are often permitted to fulfil their plan by engaging in voluntary activities alone . A job seeker has to nominate and engage in one activity ( for example , either a vocational education activity or Work for the Dole activity ) in any one mutual obligation period ( lasting six months at a time ) . </P> <P> Clients are not expected to engage in the more intensive of these activities as soon as their receipt of the allowance commences . The amount of activity required on behalf of the client in order to continue receiving his / her benefit is usually staggered as follows : </P> <Ul> <Li> Ordinarily , during the first three months of unemployment , a job seeker has no other obligations but to submit a fortnightly Application For Payment form at the local office . The form asks the applicant a number of questions about his / her circumstances and for the basic details of four positions for which the job seeker applied in the last fortnight . Customers may also be required to make up to 10 ' Job Search Contacts ' per fortnight ( dependent on the local labour market and their personal circumstances ) and record the details of these jobs within a specifically issued Job Seeker Diary for a given period of time . The job seeker then takes the Application For Payment form personally to the local Centrelink Office . He will then attend a short one - on - one interview with a Centrelink officer . The interview is usually for the purposes of checking that the application form is in order and that the applicant is aware of any appointments that may need to be attended , and obligations that may need to be met . The client at this stage also has the opportunity to talk to a Centrelink officer about any problems the client may be encountering without having to make a prior appointment first . </Li> <Li> If after an initial three months of unemployment , during which the job seeker has only to hand in the fortnightly application form and record the Job Seeker Diary , the client remains unemployed ; the client will be required to attend appointments with a Job Services Australia provider whose responsibility it is to assist the client to re-enter the work force . The job seeker also has to attend a two - week training course which focusses on job searching skills such as writing resumes and attending interviews . </Li> <Li> If the customer remains unemployed for twelve months , they are then subject to the Work Experience Phase of their Employment Pathway Plan , which consists of more intensive assistance involving the activities listed above , such as , Work for the Dole , accredited study , part - time work , volunteer work or a combination of these .

( June 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> ZIP Codes are a system of postal codes used by the United States Postal Service ( USPS ) since 1963 . The term ZIP is an acronym for Zone Improvement Plan ; it was chosen to suggest that the mail travels more efficiently and quickly ( zipping along ) when senders use the code in the postal address . The basic format consists of five digits . An extended ' ZIP + 4 ' code was introduced in 1983 which includes the five digits of the ZIP Code , followed by a hyphen and four additional digits that determine a more specific location . </P> <P> The term ZIP Code was originally registered as a servicemark by the U.S. Postal Service , but its registration has since expired . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Early history and five - digit ZIP Codes </Li> <Li> 1.2 ZIP + 4 </Li> <Li> 1.3 Postal bar code </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Structure and allocation <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Scope and international mail </Li> <Li> 2.2 By type and use </Li> <Li> 2.3 By geography <Ul> <Li> 2.3. 1 Primary state prefixes </Li> <Li> 2.3. 2 Secondary regional prefixes ( 123xx ) and local ZIP Codes ( 12345 ) </Li> <Li> 2.3. 3 ZIP Codes and previous zoning lines </Li> <Li> 2.3. 4 Division and reallocation of ZIP codes </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Other uses <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Delivery services </Li> <Li> 3.2 Statistics </Li> <Li> 3.3 Marketing </Li> <Li> 3.4 Legislative districts </Li> <Li> 3.5 Internet </Li> <Li> 3.6 Credit card security </Li> <Li> 3.7 Insurance rating </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Early History and five - digit ZIP Codes ( edit ) </H3> A 1963 U.S. Post Office sign <P> The early history and context of postal codes began with postal district / zone numbers . The United States Post Office Department ( USPOD ) implemented postal zones for numerous large cities in 1943 . For example : </P> <P> Mr. John Smith </P> <P> 3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue </P> Minneapolis 16 , Minnesota <P> The `` 16 '' was the number of the postal zone from the specific city . </P> <P> By the early 1960s , a more organized system was needed , and non-mandatory five - digit ZIP Codes were introduced nationwide on July 1 , 1963 . The USPOD issued its Publication 59 : Abbreviations for Use with ZIP Code on October 1 , 1963 , with the list of two - letter state abbreviations which are generally written with both letters capitalized . An earlier list in June had proposed capitalized abbreviations ranging from two to five letters . According to Publication 59 , the two - letter standard was `` based on a maximum 23 - position line , because this has been found to be the most universally acceptable line capacity basis for major addressing systems '' , which would be exceeded by a long city name combined with a multi-letter state abbreviation , such as `` Sacramento , Calif . '' along with the ZIP Code . The abbreviations have remained unchanged , with the exception of Nebraska , which was changed from NB to NE in 1969 at the request of the Canadian postal administration , to avoid confusion with the Canadian province of New Brunswick . </P> <P> Robert Moon is considered the father of the ZIP Code ; he submitted his proposal in 1944 while working as a postal inspector . The post office only credits Moon with the first three digits of the ZIP Code , which describe the sectional center facility ( SCF ) or `` sec center . '' An SCF is a central mail processing facility with those three digits . The SCF sorts mail to all post offices with those first three digits in their ZIP Codes . The mail is sorted according to the final two digits of the ZIP Code and sent to the corresponding post offices in the early morning . Sectional centers do not deliver mail and are not open to the public ( though the building may include a post office open to the public ) , and most of their employees work night shift . Mail picked up at post offices is sent to their own SCF in the afternoon , where the mail is sorted overnight . In the cases of large cities , the last two digits coincide with the older postal zone number thus : </P> <P> Mr. John Smith </P> <P> 3256 Epiphenomenal Avenue </P> Minneapolis , MN 55416 <P> In 1967 , these became mandatory for second and third - class bulk mailers , and the system was soon adopted generally . The United States Post Office used a cartoon character which it called Mr. ZIP to promote the use of the ZIP Code . He was often depicted with a legend such as `` USE ZIP CODE '' in the selvage of panes of postage stamps or on the covers of booklet panes of stamps . </P> <P> In 1971 Elmira ( NY ) Star Gazette reporter Dick Baumbach found out the White House was not using a zip code on its envelopes . Herb Klein , special assistant to President Nixon , responded by saying the next printing of envelopes would include the zip code . That did occur . </P> <H3> ZIP + 4 ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1983 , the U.S. Postal Service introduced an expanded ZIP Code system that it called ZIP + 4 , often called `` plus - four codes '' , `` add - on codes '' , or `` add - ons '' . A ZIP + 4 Code uses the basic five - digit code plus four additional digits to identify a geographic segment within the five - digit delivery area , such as a city block , a group of apartments , an individual high - volume receiver of mail , a post office box , or any other unit that could use an extra identifier to aid in efficient mail sorting and delivery . However , initial attempts to promote universal use of the new format met with public resistance and today the plus - four code is not required . In general , mail is read by a multiline optical character reader ( MLOCR ) that almost instantly determines the correct ZIP + 4 Code from the address -- along with the even more specific delivery point -- and sprays an Intelligent Mail barcode ( IM ) on the face of the mail piece that corresponds to 11 digits -- nine for the ZIP + 4 Code and two for the delivery point . </P> <P> For Post Office Boxes , the general ( but not invariable ) rule is that each box has its own ZIP + 4 code . The add - on code is often one of the following : the last four digits of the box number ( e.g. PO Box 107050 , Albany , NY 12201 - 7050 ) , zero plus the last three digits of the box number ( e.g. , PO Box 17727 , Eagle River , AK 99577 - 0727 ) , or , if the box number consists of fewer than four digits , enough zeros are attached to the front of the box number to produce a four - digit number ( e.g. , PO Box 77 , Juneau , AK 99750 - 0077 ) . However , there is no uniform rule , so the ZIP + 4 Code must be looked up individually for each box . </P> <H3> Postal bar Code ( edit ) </H3> <P> The ZIP Code is often translated into an Intelligent Mail barcode that is printed on the mailpiece to make it easier for automated machines to sort . A barcode can be printed by the sender ( some word - processing programs such as WordPerfect and Microsoft Word include the feature - but is not recommended as the address to ZIP lookup tables can be significantly out of date ) . It is better to let the post office put one on when it processes the piece . In general , the post office uses OCR technology , though in some cases a human might have to read and enter the address . </P> <P> Customers who send bulk mail can get a discount on postage if they have printed the barcode themselves and have presorted the mail . This requires more than just a simple font ; mailing lists must be standardized with up - to - date Coding Accuracy Support System ( CASS ) - certified software that adds and verifies a full , correct ZIP + 4 Code and an additional two digits representing the exact delivery point . Furthermore , mail must be sorted in a specific manner to an 11 digit zip with at least 150 mailpieces for each qualifying ZIP code and must be accompanied by documentation confirming this . These steps are usually done with PAVE - certified software that also prints the barcoded address labels and the barcoded sack or tray tags . </P> <P> This means that every single mailable point in the country has its own 12 - digit number ( at least in theory ) . The delivery - point digits ( the 10th and 11th digits ) are calculated based on the primary or secondary number of the address . The USPS publishes the rules for calculating the delivery point in a document called the CASS Technical Guide . However , when confronted with two addresses like 18 and 18C , often CASS will assign the same 12 - digit number to two distinct mail delivery points . The last digit is always a check digit , which is obtained by summing all 5 , 9 or 11 digits , taking the residue modulo 10 of this sum ( i.e. , the remainder after dividing by 10 ) and finally subtracting this from 10 . ( Thus , the check digit for 10001 - 0001 00 would be 7 , since 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 , 3 \u2261 3 ( mod 10 ) and 10 -- 3 = 7 . ) </P> <H2> Structure and allocation ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Scope and international mail ( edit ) </H3> <P> ZIP Codes designate delivery points within the United States ( including territories ) , and overseas stations of its armed forces . There are also ZIP Codes for independent countries of the Federated States of Micronesia , the Republic of the Marshall Islands , and the Republic of Palau , each of which is integrated into the U.S. postal system under a Compact of Free Association . </P> <P> Mail to U.S. diplomatic missions overseas is addressed as if it were addressed to a street address in Washington , D.C. The four - digit diplomatic pouch number is used as a building number , while the city in which the embassy or consulate is located is combined with the word `` Place '' to form a street name . Each mission uses a ZIP + 4 Code consisting of 20521 and the diplomatic pouch number . For example , the mailing address of the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi , India would be : </P> <P> Embassy of the United States of America </P> <P> 9000 New Delhi Place </P> Washington , DC 20521 - 9000 <H3> By type and use ( edit ) </H3> U.S. postage stamp , 1973 : `` It all depends on ZIP Code '' <P> There are four types of ZIP Codes : </P> <Ul> <Li> Unique : assigned to a single high - volume address </Li> <Li> Post Office Box only : used only for PO Boxes at a given facility , not for any other type of delivery </Li> <Li> Military : used to route mail for the U.S. military </Li> <Li> Standard : all other ZIP Codes . </Li> </Ul> <P> Unique ZIP Codes are used for governmental agencies , universities , businesses , or buildings that receive such extremely high volumes of mail that they need their own ZIP Codes . Government examples include 20505 for the Central Intelligence Agency in Washington , D.C. ; 81009 for the Federal Citizen Information Center of the U.S. General Services Administration ( GSA ) in Pueblo , Colorado . Examples of private address unique ZIP Codes include the headquarters of Wal - Mart ( 72716 ) . </P> <P> An example of a PO Box only ZIP Code is 22313 , which is used for PO Boxes at the main post office in Alexandria , Virginia , such as those used by the United States Patent and Trademark Office . In the area surrounding that post office , home and business mail delivery addresses use ZIP Code 22314 , which is thus a Standard ZIP Code . </P> <P> In certain exceptional cases , a nominally Standard - type ZIP Code may , in practice , be used as one of the three other types . For example , the ZIP Code 43210 in Columbus , Ohio is listed as a Standard - type ZIP Code . However , since its geographic boundaries are essentially coterminous with those of The Ohio State University 's main campus , it is effectively exclusive to the university even though it is not officially a `` Unique '' - type ZIP code . </P> <H3> By geography ( edit ) </H3> Primary state prefixes ( edit ) <P> ZIP Codes are numbered with the first digit representing a certain group of U.S. states , the second and third digits together representing a region in that group ( or perhaps a large city ) and the fourth and fifth digits representing a group of delivery addresses within that region . The main town in a region ( if applicable ) often gets the first ZIP Codes for that region ; afterward , the numerical order often follows the alphabetical order . Because ZIP Codes are intended for efficient postal delivery , there are unusual cases where a ZIP Code crosses state boundaries , such as a military facility spanning multiple states or remote areas of one state most easily serviced from a bordering state . For example , ZIP Code 42223 serves Fort Campbell , which spans Christian County , Kentucky and Montgomery County , Tennessee , and ZIP Code 97635 includes portions of Lake County , Oregon and Modoc County , California . </P> <P> In general , the first three digits designate a sectional center facility , the mail sorting and distribution center for an area . A sectional center facility may have more than one three - digit code assigned to it . For example , the Northern Virginia sectional center facility in Merrifield is assigned codes 220 , 221 , 222 and 223 . In some cases , a sectional center facility may serve an area in an adjacent state , usually due to the lack of a proper location for a center in that region . For example , 739 in Oklahoma is assigned to Liberal , Kansas ; 865 in Arizona is assigned to Gallup , New Mexico ; and 961 in California to Reno , Nevada . </P> <P> In terms of geographic location , many of the lowest ZIP Codes , which begin with ' 0 ' , are in the New England region . Also in the ' 0 ' region are New Jersey ( non-contiguous with the remainder of the ' 0 ' area ) , Puerto Rico , the \n\nQuestion:\nwhen did the usps start using zip codes\n", "answer": "1963"}

The answer should be a number\n\nDocument:\nBridges of Pittsburgh - wikipedia <H1> Bridges of Pittsburgh </H1> Jump to : navigation , search Seventeen of Pittsburgh 's bridges are visible in this aerial photo . <P> The Bridges of Pittsburgh play an important role in the city 's transportation system . Without bridges , the Pittsburgh region would be a series of fragmented valleys , hillsides , river plains , and isolated communities . </P> <P> A 2006 study determined that Pittsburgh has 446 bridges , and with its proximity to three major rivers and countless hills and ravines , Pittsburgh is known as `` The City of Bridges '' . The city of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County are the largest owners of great bridges in the country , in proper proportion to their size , with the possible exception of the City of New York , which is built on an island and surrounded by large bodies of water . </P> <P> According to a 2011 study by Transportation for America , 1,194 bridges in the Pittsburgh area -- or 30.4 % -- were deficient , the highest proportion in the nation . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Major bridges </Li> <Li> 3 Notable bridges </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> Pittsburgh 's first river bridges , made of wood and long since replaced , opened in 1818 at Smithfield Street and 1819 at Sixth Street ( then St. Clair Street ) . The city 's oldest in - service bridge is the current Smithfield Street Bridge , which opened in 1883 ; it was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976 . Pittsburgh waged a massive road and bridge building campaign from 1924 to 1940 ; most of Pittsburgh 's oldest major bridges date from this period . The coming of the Interstate Highway System triggered more construction in the second half of the twentieth century , as vehicular speed and throughput requirements increased . The result of more than 100 years of bridge building is a collection of most of the major types of bridge ( suspension , cantilever , arch , etc . ) , mostly built from locally produced steel , including about forty river spans . </P> <P> Many of the bridges in the Downtown area are colored Aztec Gold , either constructed as such or painted afterward , to match the city 's official colors of black and gold . A few old and out - of - service bridges , such as the Hot Metal Bridge ( which stood dormant until reopening as a passenger bridge in the year 2000 ) , are exceptions to this rule . </P> <H2> Major bridges ( edit ) </H2> <P> This table lists all bridges crossing the Allegheny , Monongahela and Ohio rivers in the City of Pittsburgh limits . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Crossing </Th> <Th> Carries </Th> <Th> River </Th> <Th> Image </Th> <Th> </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Fort Pitt Bridge </Td> <Td> I - 376 / US 19 Truck / US 22 / US 30 </Td> <Td> Monongahela </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> 40 \u00b0 26 \u2032 20 '' N 80 \u00b0 00 \u2032 40 '' W \ufeff / \ufeff 40.4388 \u00b0 N 80.0111 \u00b0 W \ufeff / 40.4388 ;

The song was originally recorded by Akon and Jackson in 2008 . The song was an international top 10 hit in nations such as Austria , Belgium , Denmark , Germany , Hungary , Italy , New Zealand , Norway , Poland , Spain , Sweden , Switzerland and the United Kingdom . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Background </Li> <Li> 2 Music video </Li> <Li> 3 Critical reception </Li> <Li> 4 Commercial performance </Li> <Li> 5 Track listing </Li> <Li> 6 Chart performance <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Charts </Li> <Li> 6.2 Year - end charts </Li> <Li> 6.3 Certifications </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Release history </Li> <Li> 8 Personnel </Li> <Li> 9 See also </Li> <Li> 10 References </Li> <Li> 11 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Background ( edit ) </H2> <P> Co-writer Claude Kelly told HitQuarters that `` Hold My Hand '' was originally written with Whitney Houston in mind . Akon and Kelly had been in the studio working on songs for Houston 's I Look to You album and while on his own Kelly completed the song from a track Akon had left . After hearing the song later , Akon said that he loved it and wanted to keep it for himself , so he wanted to record his own version of it . Shortly afterwards Akon went to Las Vegas to work on what would have been Michael Jackson 's next album . While there Jackson heard the song and loved it , and decided he wanted to contribute to it . When Kelly was asked what he thought it was about the song that struck a chord with both Akon and Jackson , he said that it was the song 's theme of friendship and togetherness . `` Hold My Hand '' was recorded by Jackson and Akon in 2008 . Akon finished the rest of his vocals for the song in 2010 , a few days before the release . A handwritten note from Jackson belonging to his Estate indicated his desire that `` Hold My Hand '' be the first single on his next project . However , in its unfinished state , the song leaked out in 2008 . This would be the last new song leaked during Jackson 's lifetime . Due to the leak , the song was subsequently pulled from Akon 's track listing for his 2008 album , Freedom . </P> <P> Akon commented , `` The world was not ready to hear ' Hold My Hand ' when it leaked a couple years ago . We were devastated about it . But its time has definitely come ; now in its final state , it has become an incredible , beautiful , anthemic song . I 'm so proud to have had the chance to work with Michael , one of my all time idols . '' Before the official release of the song , Akon stated on Twitter that the final version would have more of Jackson 's vocals . The song was released globally on Monday , November 15 , 2010 , at 12 : 01am EST . It was available to stream from Jackson 's official website . Jackson 's nephew , Taj Jackson , posted a message saying that his uncle was proud of the song . `` I 'll never forget that smile he had on his face as the song played through the speakers ( in his room ) at the Palms Hotel in Vegas . '' The song is the second collaboration between the two artists and the second consecutive duet single release for Jackson , following `` Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' 2008 '' . That song proved a commercial success and charted within the top 20 in several countries . </P> <H2> Music video ( edit ) </H2> <P> On Monday , November 22 , 2010 , the filming for the official video began in Tustin , California , a main filming location being the airship hangars at Marine Corps Air Station Tustin . There was a casting call posted up on Jackson 's official website , saying that they were `` looking for his fans of all ages who want to be a part of this iconic event . '' On December 4 , 2010 , a 30 - second teaser of the video was released on Michael Jackson 's official YouTube channel and the official website . It featured clips from Jackson 's Live in Bucharest : The Dangerous Tour DVD and clips of fans dancing . The video debuted at midnight December 9 , 2010 on worldwide websites , including MichaelJackson.com . The video showed Jackson in concert ( from Dangerous World Tour in Bucharest and HIStory World Tour in Munich ) , Akon singing and children dancing in the dress of Jackson , as well as sentimental scenes of children , families , and elderly people holding hands and a woman weeping . The video was directed by Mark Pellington . </P> <H2> Critical reception ( edit ) </H2> <P> The song received mostly positive reviews in contrast to the negative reviews of the previous promotional single `` Breaking News . '' Ashante Infantry , entertainment reporter for the Toronto Star , called it a `` catchy , well - meaning addition to Jackson 's catalog . '' She also wrote , `` Buoyed by strings and a backing chorus , the singer applies his angelic tenor to soaring phrasing that models the uplifting purport of the tune 's love and unity lyrics in the spirit of 1995 's `` You Are Not Alone '' , Jackson 's last No. 1 hit . '' Huffington Post commentator Joe Vogel praised it as `` a simple , but powerful song that embodies so much of what fans loved about Michael Jackson ... making the personal something more profound and universal '' , and Vogel stated as well that `` With its catchy chorus and majestic crescendo it has all the makings of a big hit . '' Vogel also noted the first line of the song , `` This life do n't last forever , '' was a `` poignant reminder of the transience of life . '' MTV 's Gil Kaufman stated that `` the uplifting ' Hold My Hand ' is one of Jackson 's classic love ballads , a heart - stirring call to unity , '' and that it ended with `` a majestic feel . '' Newsday music critic Glenn Gamboa said that the tune `` finds Jackson in fine voice . '' He also remarked , `` Now this is more like it . '' Gerrick D. Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times music blog wrote that the `` mid-tempo uplifting track is classic M.J. '' </P> <P> Negative reviews however came from Yahoo ! Music , where commentator Chris Willman argued that the single stole elements from the Hootie & the Blowfish song of the same name , and Minneapolis City Pages where commentator Ray Cummings said `` there 's no way to reasonably avoid being disappointed and dispirited by its thinness . '' Boston Herald critic Jed Gottlieb described the song as `` an average , Auto - Tuned Akon croon '' without `` the snap , crackle and pop of a finished King of Pop product . '' Gottlieb also wrote , `` Jackson is grumbling from his grave . '' Jason Lipshutz from Billboard said , it `` is n't a classic Jackson single , '' but Michael Jackson 's `` diehards should delight in hearing a stylish pop production that does n't dwell on the singer 's troubled life . '' </P> <H2> Commercial performance ( edit ) </H2> <P> The song debuted at number 53 on the Hot R&B / Hip - Hop Songs chart the week of November 27 , 2010 . It also became Michael Jackson 's 48th hit on Billboard Hot 100 , and debuted at number 84 . It debuted on the Adult R&B chart at number 16 as the chart 's highest start in 2010 the same week .

The team is scheduled to begin play as the Las Vegas Raiders for the 2020 National Football League ( NFL ) season ( although a move to Las Vegas could happen as soon as 2019 with Sam Boyd Stadium ) , playing home games at the Las Vegas Stadium . NFL team owners voted 31 -- 1 to approve the move , which was announced at the annual league meetings in Phoenix , Arizona on March 27 , 2017 . The Raiders became the third NFL franchise to relocate in the 2010s , following the Rams ' move from St. Louis , Missouri to Los Angeles , California on January 12 , 2016 , and the Chargers ' move from San Diego , California to Los Angeles on January 12 , 2017 . The Raiders ' move to Las Vegas comes after years of failed efforts to renovate or replace the Oakland -- Alameda County Coliseum , which has been rated by multiple sources as one of the worst stadiums in the NFL . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Background </Li> <Li> 2 The hunt for a home <Ul> <Li> 2.1 2011 : Levi 's Stadium </Li> <Li> 2.2 2012 \u2212 2013 : Coliseum City </Li> <Li> 2.3 2013 : Concord , California </Li> <Li> 2.4 2014 : San Antonio , Texas </Li> <Li> 2.5 2015 : Raiders attempt to put together a project with Athletics </Li> <Li> 2.6 2015 : Los Angeles project and losing to the Rams </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 2015 \u2212 2017 : Negotiations to move to Las Vegas and last Oakland stadium effort <Ul> <Li> 3.1 2015 : Exploring Las Vegas </Li> <Li> 3.2 2016 </Li> <Li> 3.3 2017 </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Relocation to Las Vegas <Ul> <Li> 4.1 2018 </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Popular culture </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Background ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Oakland Raiders were founded as a charter member of the American Football League ( AFL ) in 1960 . The team joined the NFL as a result of the merger in 1970 . From 1966 until 1981 , it played home games at the Oakland -- Alameda County Coliseum , which it shared with Major League Baseball 's Oakland Athletics after that team moved to Oakland in 1968 . In 1980 Al Davis , dissatisfied with the stadium situation in Oakland and seeing luxury boxes as the future of the NFL came to an agreement with the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum commission to move the Raiders to Los Angeles . The NFL had refused to let the team move , but a court over-ruled the league , clearing the way for the Raiders to move to Los Angeles and become the Los Angeles Raiders . In 1982 , the Raiders ( then owned by Al Davis ) were approved to relocate from Oakland to Los Angeles . The Raiders played home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum from 1982 to 1994 . In 1995 , after being unable to secure a new stadium in the Los Angeles area and after a proposed move to Sacramento that involved Davis taking ownership of the Sacramento Kings fell apart the Raiders moved back to Oakland . </P> <P> Meanwhile , Las Vegas had been home to a number of other professional football franchises between 1994 and the Raiders ' arrival , none of which were particularly successful . The Las Vegas Posse , part of the Canadian Football League 's effort to enter the U.S. market , lasted one season in 1994 and suffered from poor on - field product and worse attendance figures . The XFL included the Las Vegas Outlaws in its lone 2001 season ; its attendance and on - field performance were respectable , and the team embraced the city 's culture , but the Outlaws ' modest success was overshadowed by the failure of the XFL . The Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League were a major on - field success and were one of the UFL 's best teams ; it nonetheless suffered from poor attendance to start that continued to decline throughout the league 's existence to the point that its last home game drew only 600 fans . The Arena Football League included three teams in Las Vegas over the course of its history : the Las Vegas Sting ( 1994 and 1995 ) , Las Vegas Gladiators ( 2003 to 2007 , now the Cleveland Gladiators ) , and another Las Vegas Outlaws ( 2015 ) . The Las Vegas Sin of the Lingerie Football League ( now the Legends Football League ) played in the city from 2011 to 2014 . </P> <H2> The hunt for a home ( edit ) </H2> Raiders owner Mark Davis <P> Recent efforts to either renovate the Oakland -- Alameda County Coliseum or replace it with a new football stadium in Oakland or elsewhere date back to November 18 , 2009 . In 2011 , Al Davis died and control of the team was assumed by his son Mark Davis who made finding a solution to the 3 decade long stadium problem a top priority . The Raiders were free to move after the 2013 NFL season , when its lease on the Oakland -- Alameda County Coliseum expired . While exploring possible solutions in the Bay Area and potential relocation candidates , the Raiders signed one - year extensions of its lease on the Coliseum . </P> <H3> 2011 : Levi 's stadium ( edit ) </H3> <P> There had been discussions for the Raiders to share Levi 's Stadium in Santa Clara , California with the San Francisco 49ers . However , the 49ers went ahead without the Raiders and broke ground on the $1.2 billion stadium on April 19 , 2012 and afterwards sold $670 million worth of seats including 70 % of club and luxury suites , making it more unlikely that the Raiders would continue to explore the idea of sharing the stadium as they would then be secondary tenants with little to no commercial rights over the highly lucrative luxury suites . </P> <P> Mark Davis further increased the unlikelihood of the Raiders and the 49ers to share Levi 's stadium when he told NFL Network reporter Ian Rapoport that he had no plans to share the stadium but that he did recognize the Raiders ' need for a new home and that he hoped the new home would be in Oakland . When Levi 's Stadium had its grand opening on July 17 , 2014 , NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell mentioned to the live crowd that it would make a great home for the Raiders and that the team had to decide whether or not it wanted to play there or build a stadium on the site of the Oakland -- Alameda County Coliseum . </P> <H3> 2012 \u2212 2013 : Coliseum city ( edit ) </H3> <P> On March 7 , 2012 , then - mayor Jean Quan unveiled an ambitious project to the media that was designed to improve the sports facilities of all three major league sports teams in the city ( the Raiders , Major League Baseball ( MLB ) 's Athletics and the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) 's Golden State Warriors ) , as well as attract new businesses to the city . The project , dubbed Coliseum City , had entailed the redevelopment of the existing Oakland -- Alameda County Coliseum complex . The redevelopment would have seen the construction of two new stadiums on the present location , a baseball - only stadium and a football - only stadium , while Oracle Arena , home of the Warriors , would have been either rebuilt or undergone extensive renovations . A sum of $3.5 million was committed to preliminary planning on the project . However , no officials from either of Oakland 's major league teams were present at the media conference . </P> <P> According to the San Francisco Business Times , Oakland 's assistant city administrator Fred Blackwell said the Bay Investment Group LLC , an entity being formed by Colony Capital LLC , Rashid Al Malik ( chairman and CEO of HayaH Holdings ) , and the city , had numerous details to continue working out for the prospective $2 billion Coliseum City project , which covered 800 acres surrounding the Oakland -- Alameda Coliseum Complex . The development team also included JRDV Urban International , HKS Architects , and Forest City Real Estate Services . In an ideal situation , construction could have started by the end of 2014 . Meanwhile , the Warriors began to go forward with plans to build a new arena at Mission Bay , not far from AT&T Park , and move back across the Bay from Oakland to San Francisco as soon as 2019 . </P> <H3> 2013 : Concord , California ( edit ) </H3> <P> The abandoned Concord Naval Weapons Station , 26.6 miles from Oakland , was announced in 2013 as a possible location for a new stadium but developments failed to materialize . </P> <H3> 2014 : San Antonio , Texas ( edit ) </H3> <P> In July 2014 , San Antonio , Texas , emerged as a potential relocation candidate for the team , after Raiders owner Mark Davis visited an event hosted for former Raiders wide receiver Cliff Branch in the city . San Antonio , while it was in a smaller media market than the San Francisco Bay Area , had the advantage of having a relatively new and NFL - ready stadium in the Alamodome and less sporting competition . On July 29 , 2014 , it was reported by the San Antonio Express - News that Mark Davis met with officials from the city of San Antonio to discuss the possibility of relocating the Raiders to San Antonio after the 2014 -- 15 NFL season . Davis confirmed that he did speak with San Antonio city officials while visiting San Antonio to honor former Raiders wide receiver Cliff Branch 's induction into a local Hall of Fame , but did not comment on whether he was considering relocation to San Antonio . The Raiders would have played at the 65,000 - seat Alamodome until a new stadium could be built . San Antonio remained in contention as a site through at least November 2014 , when Raiders staffers scouted the stadium and began negotiating with San Antonio officials . </P> <H3> 2015 : Raiders attempt to put together a project with Athletics ( edit ) </H3> <P> It was reported in early 2015 that the Raiders sat down with Athletics owner Lewis Wolff in an effort to create a stadium solution where two separate stadiums ( one for the Raiders and one for the Athletics ) would have been built on the coliseum site . The Athletics balked at the deal . In an interview with J.T. the Brick on KGMZ on April 4 , 2017 , Davis revealed that he offered Wolff ( the owner of the Athletics ) 20 percent of the Raiders in an attempt to get a deal done . Davis further elaborated that the closest the Raiders came to a deal in Oakland was in 2013 with Colony Capital , before the Athletics agreed to a 10 - year lease extension at the Coliseum with the city of Oakland . </P> <H3> 2015 : Los Angeles project and losing to the Rams ( edit ) </H3> Main articles : National Football League in Los Angeles , Carson Stadium , Los Angeles Stadium at Hollywood Park , and History of the Los Angeles Raiders \u00a7 Attempted return to Los Angeles <P> On February 19 , 2015 , the Raiders and the then San Diego Chargers announced that they would build a privately financed $1.78 billion stadium in Carson , California if they were to move back to the Los Angeles market . Both teams stated that they would continue to attempt to get stadiums built in their respective cities . The Carson City Council would bypass the public vote and approved the plan 3 -- 0 . The council voted without having clarified several issues , including who would finance the stadium , how the required three - way land swap would be performed , and how it would raise enough revenue if only one team moved in as tenant . On January 12 , 2016 , the NFL rejected the Raiders ' relocation request in favor of a competing plan by Stan Kroenke to move the then St. Louis Rams back to Los Angeles and construct a stadium and entertainment district in Inglewood , California . However , the NFL left open the possibility of the Raiders relocating to Los Angeles by 2020 and playing in the new stadium under construction to house the Los Angeles Rams . The San Diego Chargers however had the first option to join the Rams at the new stadium , the Raiders would have been authorized to negotiate an agreement if the Chargers did not exercise their option by January 2017 . The Chargers exercised their choice and announced their relocation to Los Angeles in January 2017 , shutting the Raiders out of the Southern California market . </P> <P> Around this time other markets expressed interest in luring the Raiders . For example Duluth , Minnesota submitted a proposal to construct a new stadium for the team , a proposal that was not taken seriously because of the metro area 's small size , proximity to the Minnesota Vikings and unwillingness to commit money to the stadium proposal . </P> <P> Less than a month after the Chargers announced their move to Los Angeles , Las Vegas had emerged as the most likely destination candidate\n\nQuestion:\nwhen do the oakland raiders become the las vegas raiders\n", "answer": "2020"}
