Well, let me get you something at the bar, all right?\" said by Jack\n\"No, no, no! No, no. No, no. I got this. Two martinis, one dirty, one with extra olives, and I can\u2019t wait to chat up the bartender or mixologist or whatever he wants to be called, because I am dying for small talk with strangers.

Where\u2019d you just go now?\" said by Jack\n\"It\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s nothing.

It\u2019s like they\u2019re living separate lives.\" said by Diane\n\"None of this has been easy for either of them. None of this has been easy for us.

All of the stress will start to slowly go away and that will be better for everyone. Summer and kyle included. And we will be there for them, but until then, tonight, this is about you. About your courage, about your strength. It\u2019s a celebration of you. So, where do we go now?\" said by Jack\n\"I think I\u2019m going back to the bar to get my drink.

Harrison and the nanny are out catching fireflies by the pool house.\" said by Kyle\n\"Mmm.\" said by Summer\n\"So nice seeing him excited and carefree and laughing. It\u2019s almost as if the kid notices a burden has been lifted off of this house. Oh, uh, look, I\u2019m sorry. I know it must be hard for you, celebrating a homecoming of sorts, knowing your mother\u2019s still out there.\" said by Kyle\n\"I need to go out.\" said by Summer\n\"Again?\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah, I need to talk to daniel.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay, can\u2019t it wait \u2019til morning?\" said by Kyle\n\"No, he just dropped off lucy at the airport, so he\u2019s got time right now.\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, it\u2019s late. My parents will be home soon.\" said by Kyle\n\"Look, things have been a mess between me and daniel. I mean, you\u2019ve seen it. We\u2019re so angry at each other and I know that my mom would hate that, so I just feel like while we\u2019re waiting to see her, it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s one of the only things that we can do, is clear up the animosity between us. I mean, you can understand that, right?\" said by Summer\n\"Look, I\u2019m all for you resolving your issues with daniel.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019m sorry, I know that I\u2019ve hurt you. The way that I\u2019ve shut down and shut you out, and\u2026 I really am so sorry, I know\u2026 I believe that you\u2019re on my side, even if I don\u2019t deserve it.\" said by Summer\n\"Why would you say that? Of course you do.\" said by Kyle\n\"I love you.\" said by Summer\n\"I love you, too. And I will always be on your side. And I will be waiting here when you get back. Unless you want me to come with you.\" said by Kyle\n\"No! Uh\u2026 I mean you should\u2013 you should stay here and celebrate with your folks. I mean, your family is healing, and the least I can do is try to do the same for mine.\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m sure you have enough going on without babysitting me. You missed all those calls from sally. Is she okay?\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, uh\u2026 news isn\u2019t great. Apparently, sally\u2019s at risk for pre-eclampsia.\" said by Nick\n\"Nick, that\u2019s serious.\" said by Sharon\n\"I know. So she\u2019s gonna scale back her work, and, uh, try and take it easy. A lot more rest. Get on the meds, and uh\u2026 lot of monitoring.\" said by Nick\n\"Maybe you should go and be with her right now.\" said by Sharon\n\"Ah, she\u2019s home. She\u2019s safe now. I\u2019ll feel a lot better when I get you home. You know, with cameron kirsten on the loose, we all have to be on defcon one right now.\" said by Nick\n\"Still can\u2019t believe he approached faith, and it\u2019s totally my fault.\" said by Sharon\n\"Why would you say that?\" said by Nick\n\"Because when cameron delivered that cigar box to the front porch, faith was there. I could have warned her, right then, what was going on, to be careful. Maybe then, she would have run the other direction when cameron approached her in the park. I thought that I was protecting her. I was\u2026 leaving her to be vulnerable.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, she knows now.\" said by Nick\n\"I told her about everything that happened with cameron after you and chance left.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, I\u2019m sure that wasn\u2019t easy, but faith needed to know. She needed the truth. We all have to have our eyes wide open right now.\" said by Nick\n\"Every time I open the door, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m gonna run into another one of cameron\u2019s sick gifts. And I have a feeling his head games are just getting started.\" said by Sharon\n\"Thank you.\" said by Diane\n\"Shouldn\u2019t leave your drink unattended like that.\" said by Cameron\n\"Excuse me?\" said by Diane\n\"Your martini. It\u2019s been sitting there for a while. You shouldn\u2019t do that. Any kind of creep could come along, drop something in it. No one would notice. You got no idea what some people will do.\" said by Cameron\n\"I think it\u2019s okay.\" said by Diane\n\"Just saying. You can\u2019t trust anybody.\" said by Cameron\n\"Well, I\u2013 I think I can trust anyone here.

It seems that chancellor-winters is in corporate limbo.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Oh. Well, I\u2019m sorry to hear that.\" said by Michael\n\"Yeah, daniel must be so frustrated.\" said by Lauren\n\"Yeah. So I decided to be proactive and, um, shop the project around to see if I can get financial backing from another company, and, um, you know, just in case things at chancellor-winters imploded.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Wait. What? Without consulting daniel?\" said by Lauren\n\"Why would you meddle with that?\" said by Michael\n\"Well, I wasn\u2019t meddling. It was just an exploratory conversation.\" said by Phyllis\n\"And you don\u2019t think that\u2019s overstepping just a wee bit?\" said by Lauren\n\"Well, no, because daniel gave me the authority. I\u2019m his right-hand man.\" said by Phyllis\n\"On the technical and staffing side so he could keep his eye on the big picture\u2026\" said by Michael\n\"Okay.\" said by Phyllis\n\"\u2026Like deciding which company to choose to ally himself with.\" said by Michael\n\"Well, I just wanted to be proactive. I knew how important this project is to my son, but it has him doubting me again, so, i mean, I don\u2019t know what to do. I can\u2019t win. I mean, do I try too hard? I don\u2019t get it.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Ohh, phyllis, i think there\u2019s a common denominator with these problems with the children. Diane. Your intractable hostility towards her. It cost you your job at marchetti, and from what you\u2019ve already told us, it\u2019s creating friction between you and daniel.\" said by Michael\n\"Um, okay, diane has nothing to do with this issue right now with me and daniel. And I don\u2019t want to get lectured about diane. Please.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Too bad.\" said by Lauren\n\"Just to calm your mind, I\u2019ve taken into consideration how adam\u2019s return would affect both victoria and nicholas. That\u2019s why I want to find something for adam that he can run independent of them. That way, we all win.\" said by Victor\n\"[ Sighs ] I hate to see you make an enemy of jack again, not to mention tucker. And then you\u2019ll be let down when adam rejects you again.\" said by Nikki\n\"You make that sound as if it is inevitable.\" said by Victor\n\"I believe that it is.\" said by Nikki\n\"No, it isn\u2019T.

Now that the sad reality has a chance to sink in, let me explain more fully why I made the decision that I did.\" said by Adam\n\"I already know why you did it. I heard everything that you said when you thought that I was asleep earlier. I\u2013 I didn\u2019t miss a word. How much you still love me. And how hard that decision was for you to make. But\u2026 if you were faced with the same situation again, you would make the same decision and honestly, that is the last thing that I want to hear right now.\" said by Sally\n\"What\u2019s going on, nick? Where\u2019s all this hostility coming from?\" said by Nate\n\"Don\u2019t insult my intelligence.\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2019m not insulting your intelligence. Why would I do that, nick? What is the problem?\" said by Nate\n\"You. You\u2019re the problem. I knew day one hiring you was a big mistake.\" said by Nick\n\"Mistake? I brought nothing but success to newman media.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, I don\u2019t deny that. You seem to be a very quick study.\" said by Nick\n\"So what if I am? The numbers don\u2019t lie and I have a great mentor.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, is that what she is? A mentor? Or is she a target? Like what you tried to pull with your families company?\" said by Nick\n\"Really, nick? I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re still throwing that back in my face.\" said by Nate\n\"And I can\u2019t believe you think a betrayal like that could be so easily forgotten. I mean, I gotta wonder how far you would have taken this if elena hadn\u2019t made you come clean. I mean, would you and my sister be running your family\u2019s company? The one you tried to steal from your cousins right now? What I find really interesting about this, nate, is my sister seems to be pretty central to all of your big power moves.\" said by Nick\n\"Believe me, nicholas will get past his initial upset and he\u2019ll realize that he truly needs this little break.\" said by Victoria\n\"I doubt that very much. Why are you forcing this on him? Especially with everything else that\u2019s going on in his life right now? I asked you not to push him, or at the very least, let him make the decision.\" said by Nikki\n\"You know how stubborn he can be. Besides, his ordeal with cameron and sally losing her baby, it\u2019s too much for anyone to handle all at once.\" said by Victoria\n\"Victoria, you should have let him make the call.\" said by Nikki\n\"I made the right decision for nicholas and for the company. He\u2013 he may not see that for himself right now.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, I\u2019m not sure I can see it either. So, what happens next? What\u2019s your next move?\" said by Nikki\n\"Next move? There is no next move. How many times do I have to say it? This isn\u2019t part of some scheme to oust my brother from the company and quite frankly, I am sick and tired of people second guessing my decisions for this company.\" said by Victoria\n\"What\u2019s going on? That\u2019s me before dawn powerwash.\" said by Victor\n\"Victoria has forced nicholas to take a leave of absence.\" said by Nikki\n\"Why would you do that?\" said by Victor\n\"Well, because she decided that with all the trauma, with sally losing her baby and cameron kirsten terrorizing sharon and faith, that he must take a break from the company, whether he wants to or not.\" said by Nikki\n\"Nicholas thinks that he can handle this all. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s wise. And I told him as much. And I\u2013 I brought up the idea of him taking a little time off.\" said by Victoria\n\"Which, if you recall, is exactly what I asked you after the whole ashland locke debacle, but you refused to take time off. You said you needed to focus on work.\" said by Nikki\n\"But\u2013 look, those are completely different situations. You can\u2019t compare the two. Three of the women in nick\u2019s life that he loves the most have been through horrific situations and they need him right now.\" said by Victoria\n\"Nicholas knows what he needs to do to take care of his family.\" said by Nikki\n\"Your brother is perfectly capable of focusing on his job while handling his personal affairs.\" said by Victor\n\"But this is not about his capability. I\u2019m not worried about that. What I\u2019m worried about is him carrying around this heavy burden on top of his workload. And look, newman is in a strong enough position. We can afford for nick to take a little time to himself. He\u2019ll thank me for it later,\" said by Victoria\n\"But who are you to make that decision for him?\" said by Nikki\n\"It\u2019s my decision to make. I am looking out for everyone concerned, including this company.\" said by Victoria\n\"Did you ever stop to think that nicholas needs a distraction like work with everything else that\u2019s going on with him right now?\" said by Nikki\n\"Why is everyone making such a big deal out of this?\" said by Victoria\n\"While I suspect that there\u2019s more at play here than you\u2019re saying. And I believe it has something to do with your relationship with nate hastings.\" said by Nikki\n\"You\u2019re way off the mark here, nick. There is no clandestine plan going on with victoria and me.\" said by Nate\n\"Why should i believe you?\" said by Nick\n\"Look, I know you\u2019re going through a lot of personal issues right now, and I get it. It\u2019s a lot for anyone to handle, so I\u2019m going to give you a break and cut you some slack this time.\" said by Nate\n\"Don\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t use that against me. You and victoria are using my personal issues to shove me aside.\" said by Nick\n\"Nobody is trying to shove you aside.\" said by Nate\n\"Nate, just stop, all right? And don\u2019t act like you didn\u2019t know vic was going to force me into this leave of absence. I mean, how long is it going to be before she makes you interim coo? Or has she done that already?\" said by Nick\n\"I don\u2019t regret that you heard me pour my heart out. Maybe if I\u2019d known you were listening, I wouldn\u2019t have opened up so completely, but I did. You heard it all. You heard the hard, painful truth.\" said by Adam\n\"Please, adam.\" said by Sally\n\"What? What, sally?\" said by Adam\n\"There\u2019s nothing that can change or fix this decision that you\u2019ve made. How can I ever forgive you? Why didn\u2019t you give the word to save our baby\u2019s life?\" said by Sally\n\"Don\u2019t you see? I couldn\u2019T. I had to give the word to save yours. She found it.\" said by Adam\n\"Don\u2019t\u2013 don\u2019t push me away. Just\u2013 just hear me out. How could you think that I could give a blanket permission that could take your life?\" said by Adam\n\"So, instead, you sacrificed our baby.\" said by Sally\n\"I had to make a lifesaving decision. Time was of the essence. Okay, when you\u2013 when you heard me before, you couldn\u2019t look into my eyes, but now you can. Sally, we have never been able to lie to each other with much success, but if you would just look at me, you will know that I mean every word. You will see how much I am grieving our little baby girl and how I will never get over something like that, but at least I\u2019m not grieving you. Even if I had opted to save the baby, there was no guarantee that she was going to live. I couldn\u2019t risk losing both of you. And I\u2019ll never regret saving you because you deserve to live.\" said by Adam\n\"Yes, but ava deserved to live too.\" said by Sally\n\"But you will be a mother again someday. You\u2019ll be the mother that you always wanted to be. And even though I won\u2019t be the father, your next baby will be the luckiest little being in the world. Because she\u2019ll have you as her mother. If I could only save one life for sure, it had to be yours.\" said by Adam\n\"Just go. Please just go.\" said by Sally\n\"Why would you assume that nick\u2019s leave of absence has anything to do with nate?\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, it\u2019s pretty obvious since he\u2019s already delegating newman media work to audra.\" said by Nikki\n\"And? Is there a problem with that? I mean, she is his coo.\" said by ", "answer": "Victoria"}

I\u2019m not sure if I can trust your son again.\" said by Brooke\n\"No, that\u2019s fair. It is.

You were lonely and you found solace in the worst person on the planet. Let me ask you this. If katie or brooke had taken you back, would you be with sheila right now?

I\u2019ve hurt her over and over again. I have broken her trust again and again. But your daughter is one of the most special people I have ever met. And everything that\u2019s great about her is exemplified in her line. It\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s so special and important, and\u2013 and people need it in their lives. So, please let me save her line. I owe it to her.\" said by Thomas\n\"Hope.\" said by Taylor\n\"Hey, hope. I was just, um, I\u2019m doing what you asked, apologizing to your mother and begging for her forgiveness. Please don\u2019t let the line go, hope. It\u2019s too powerful. It\u2019s too important. People need it in their lives. So, come on, let\u2019s bring it back to life. You can make a real impact.\" said by Thomas\n\"You have your own life to worry about, liam.

Yeah, a raging narcissist, absolutely. But you\u2019re nothing like her. Look at me right now, look at me. I\u2019m your son, right? What am I doing? I\u2019m here fighting for you.

So you sounded like it was urgent on the phone, so I made the ranch my first stop, but I am late for the arbitration.\" said by Jill\n\"Oh, is that today?\" said by Victor\n\"Yes, victor, that is today and I\u2019ve got to get going and I\u2019m sure you\u2019d like to cut to the chase anyway, yes?\" said by Jill\n\"Well, then, I have to say, my timing is perfect.\" said by Victor\n\"Oh, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. It\u2019s like you read my mind.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, yeah?\" said by Nate\n\"I was hoping to go over some budgetary issues regarding newman media\u2019s next quarter.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay, well, I\u2019m happy to do that, but I was hoping we could discuss something else first.\" said by Nate\n\"Sounds like something\u2019s bothering you. Is there anything that I can do to help?\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah, look, um\u2026\" said by Nate\n\"It\u2019s fine. You can talk to me about it.\" said by Victoria\n\"Amanda.\" said by Devon\n\"Devon.\" said by Amanda\n\"I was surprised to hear that you agreed to come back and represent chancellor-winters \u2019cause i figured you\u2019d never want to see me again.\" said by Devon\n\"Well, when lily reached out to me, it made perfect sense to take this case, since I was instrumental in solidifying the merger in the first place. No one knows the ins and outs better than I do.\" said by Amanda\n\"Except for maybe me and lily.\" said by Devon\n\"I don\u2019t think now is a time or place for this.\" said by Lily\n\"No, no, it\u2019s okay. See, devon, you were more about the big picture. I was the one in the trenches dotting the \u201cI\u2019s\u201d and crossing the \u201ct\u2019S.\u201d But I simply see this as a natural extension of what I was already doing for jill and lily.\" said by Amanda\n\"Well, sure, but you know that sometimes a case is about more than just \u201cI\u2019s\u201d and \u201ct\u2019s,\u201d and it\u2019s about right and wrong.\" said by Devon\n\"I couldn\u2019t agree more.\" said by Amanda\n\"And about knowing the history and how much time I\u2019ve put into a company like hamilton-winters.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, I know. Do you not remember all of the long conversations we had about neil? The fact that you are here touting your history and loyalty is a joke\" said by Amanda\n\"Joke? So is this, like, revenge, then, for you?\" said by Devon\n\"Don\u2019t flatter yourself. I am here to win an arbitration. Having a front-row seat to watching you lose? That\u2019s just a perk. Not flossing well?\" said by Amanda\n\"Good morning.\" said by Christine\n\"Hey.\" said by Devon\n\"Everyone\u2019s exchanging pleasantries. That\u2019s nice to see. Devon, why don\u2019t we go inside?\" said by Christine\n\"Sure.\" said by Devon\n\"If you want any shot of walking away with your company, you can\u2019t let them get under your skin.\" said by Christine\n\"I \u2014 abby gave me the same advice. I know how to handle myself.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay, it\u2019s just, you seem a little rattled. Clearly, that\u2019s part of their strategy.\" said by Christine\n\"Maybe I\u2019m letting them think that they\u2019ve gotten to me.\" said by Devon\n\"Then you\u2019re doing a good job.\" said by Christine\n\"Are both sides ready to proceed?\" said by Arbitrator\n\"We are, ms. Shannon.\" said by Christine\n\"I don\u2019t think we are yet, as we\u2019re missing someone important. Is jill not meant to be here?\" said by Devon\n\"Why don\u2019t you let me speak on our behalf?\" said by Christine\n\"Ms. Winters is here on behalf of chancellor-winters. These legal proceedings are of the utmost importance to both ms. Winters and ms. Abbott, but they still have a company to run. The massive reach of their conglomerate necessitates that someone be available at nearly all times, but I assure you ms. Abbott will be joining us as soon as she\u2019s able to step away from her professional obligations.\" said by Amanda\n\"Very well. Then let\u2019s begin.\" said by Arbitrator\n\"Audra, hey. Nate around?\" said by Elena\n\"I think he\u2019s in a meeting.\" said by Audra\n\"[ Chuckles ] Let me guess, with victoria.\" said by Elena\n\"I believe so. Is everything okay?\" said by Audra\n\"Honestly, I don\u2019t even know.\" said by Elena\n\"Hey, maybe we could have a chat \u2014 away from this place. You up for a cup of coffee?\" said by Audra\n\"I think we need to address what happened the other night.\" said by Nate\n\"I thought that we were pretty clear with one another.\" said by Victoria\n\"Saying everything is fine is one thing, but is it really? Victoria, I don\u2019t want what happened to change our work dynamic, and I hope it doesn\u2019t alter the trust and comfort we have with one another.\" said by Nate\n\"Nate, don\u2019t give it any more thought. Really, it bears little to no weight on my end.\" said by Victoria\n\"I hope that\u2019s the case.\" said by Nate\n\"Look, if it would make you feel better, I will willingly admit that i overstepped, and I\u2019ll apologize. I apologize if I made you feel uncomfortable.\" said by Victoria\n\"No apologies necessary\" said by Nate\n\"Excuse me?\" said by Victoria\n\"You don\u2019t feel like you overstepped, now, do you?\" said by Nate\n\"No, I don\u2019T.\" said by Victoria\n\"Would you please stop being so cryptic? You have my attention.\" said by Jill\n\"Ooh, I\u2019m being cryptic now.\" said by Victor\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Jill\n\"Well, to be honest with you, I was surprised to learn that you\u2019re willing to go to war with devon over hamilton-winters.\" said by Victor\n\"Why would that surprise you.\" said by Jill\n\"And put lily against her brother?\" said by Victor\n\"Look, if there had been a more amicable option, I would have taken it. You of all people know there isn\u2019t always one. And when you\u2019re dealing with family, things can turn very ugly.\" said by Jill\n\"Only too true.\" said by Victor\n\"I take no pleasure in this battle with them. I can already see the emotional toll it\u2019s taking on lily and devon. But he accepted this merger with the full knowledge that I would retain the majority interest in chancellor-winters.\" said by Jill\n\"Right.\" said by Victor\n\"And as open as I am to listening to other people\u2019s opinion, in the end, the decision\u2019s mine, and I like the company the way it is.\" said by Jill\n\"You bet. Hi. I keep my home fresh with febreze fade defy plug.\" said by Victor\n\"Now, you must remember that I do understand that you have a certain vision for your company, as you should. You\u2019re the decision-maker.\" said by Victor\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Jill\n\"Let me ask you, how do you think katherine would feel? She realized you drew a very hard line with devon. I mean, devon is her grandson.\" said by Victor\n\"You\u2019re playing the katherine card, aren\u2019t you? Look, katherine had a lot of opinions, a lot of opinions about a lot of things, and most of them I did not agree with. But make no mistake, there are times when I miss her like crazy.\" said by Jill\n\"Yep.\" said by Victor\n\"What I don\u2019t miss is when she harped at me on how to run the company all the time. She and I can discuss that in the afterlife.\" said by Jill\n\"[ Chuckles ] Well, that\u2019s fair enough.\" said by Victor\n\"Just so you know, lily and I did try to come to an agreement with devon, okay? We offered him a really, really generous settlement, we offered to let him retain the hamilton-winters name, but he shot all that down. He\u2019s trying to make some sort of a point. I don\u2019t think it can be made in the time he has left. The trouble is, he\u2019s playing with a really weak hand. I mean, he\u2019s got the emotion and the sentiment, but he has no legal standing.\" said by Jill\n\"Yeah, you\u2019re correct about all of that, I think. However, I think your personal relationship with him is going to suffer some damage, and that would be a shame, you know? I mean, I asked you to come here knowing full well what the complications can be, but instead of a lawsuit and all those legal entanglements and hostilities, I\u2019m willing to offer you an alternative.\" said by ", "answer": "Victor"}

What are you doing here? I thought you\u2019d be spending the day with summer.\" said by Victoria\n\"I mean, that was my plan but every time I try and talk to her or offer to help with the service, she just tells me to back off and says she\u2019s got it handled.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, imagine that. The daughter of two unstoppable powerhouses, and\u2026 the granddaughter of an unmovable force wanting to take on the world herself.\" said by Victoria\n\"What do you think I should do?\" said by Nick\n\"Maybe don\u2019t hover so much. Just give her a little space and make sure that you keep an eye on her, though, in case she\u2019s taking on too much.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah. She could also just be going all in as like a coping mechanism.\" said by Nick\n\"Which is why you\u2019re also at work today, I assume.\" said by Victoria\n\"That\u2019s part of it.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, you know that your boss is not going to fire you for taking bereavement leave.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, you can\u2019t fall behind, vic, with all of your grand plans and your corporate shopping sprees.\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2019m planning on putting some of my purchases on hold for a while.\" said by Victoria\n\"Really?

Is it a good vintage?\" said by Tucker\n\"I think so. Check the year.\" said by Devon\n\"No, that\u2019s right.

So, you need to know that lily and I had a conversation at the gala, after they had the dedication to neil.\" said by Devon\n\"That was a beautiful gesture, by the way.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah, it really was. And it made me stop and realize just how important family is. And for me that\u2019s lily. So, she and i talked things through and that is why I will not be buying mccall.\" said by Devon\n\"[ Sighs ] Given that bit of news, you wouldn\u2019t happen to have anything stronger than apple juice, would you?\" said by Tucker\n\"Listen. I know it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s not what you want to hear but it is what it is.\" said by Devon\n\"What is it, exactly? I\u2019m trying to understand your thought process in this.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah, I\u2019m gonna be going back to work at chancellor winters, so I\u2019m not gonna need to buy mccall unlimited.\" said by Devon\n\"It is\u2013 it\u2019s terrific news about you and lily mending fences.

But\u2026 do you really think there\u2019ll be any lasting peace between you with the company going public?\" said by Tucker\n\"It\u2019s not gonna be an issue anymore.\" said by Devon\n\"Since when?\" said by Tucker\n\"Since jill decided to keep chancellor winters a private company.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh. Well, congratulations all around then.\" said by Tucker\n\"Thank you.\" said by Devon\n\"Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but\u2026 that wouldn\u2019t preclude you from acquiring mccall on your own, would it?

What to do with mccall?\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, actually jill said that she would buy your company if you weren\u2019t included in the deal.\" said by Devon\n\"Summer, you have more than enough on your plate right now.\" said by Chance\n\"Look, just hear me out. I know that it might sound crazy, but I am convinced that my mom\u2019s death was not an accident and I\u2019m not gonna give up until I know the whole truth.\" said by Summer\n\"We are investigating every possibility.\" said by Chance\n\"What if stark married her for her money and then he killed her to get it?\" said by Summer\n\"That\u2019s the theory that your working with?\" said by Chance\n\"Well, diane has got to be involved. This feud has been going on for decades. She left town in disgrace. She had years to plot her revenge. She threatened my mom\u2019s life the very same night that she died.\" said by Summer\n\"And you don\u2019t think that could have been a coincidence?\" said by Chance\n\"Don\u2019t you owe it to us to find out for sure?\" said by Summer\n\"That is what I plan to do, summer.\" said by Chance\n\"I know how to find out the truth.\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, I can\u2019t let you get involved in a police investigation. Okay? Not only could you compromise the case but if anything would happen to you\u2013\" said by Chance\n\"Just come to my mom\u2019s memorial service. That could be part of a murder investigation, right? Come, see who shows up, study their demeanor.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah, that is something that we are interested in doing.\" said by Chance\n\"Everyone who cared about my mom is gonna be there and people who wanted her dead. It\u2019s guaranteed to be emotional. Tears, sadness, disbelief, and you\u2019re gonna be there to see it all. Okay? Watch the mourners\u2019 reactions. Study their behavior. Watch diane.\" said by Summer\n\"Summer\u2013\" said by Chance\n\"No. No one was closer to my mom than I was and she tried to warn me. She tried to warn all of us and we just\u2013 we ignored her. We refused to believe her. She must have felt so alone and I know how that feels right now. Look, you don\u2019t have to believe me. Just be there. Watch diane. Find the evidence and make her pay.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay. Listen. There\u2019s something you should know.\" said by Chance\n\"The gala wasn\u2019t supposed to end that way. Phyllis\u2019s life was not supposed to end in that moment. She had so much more life to live\u2026 with her kids, her\u2013 her grandkids and her new career path. I mean, she was always reinventing herself, from\u2026 the computers and the cosmetics and the magazine and the hotel. And I always held out hope that she would find\u2026 her true love. And then years down the line, we would be sitting in\u2013 in our caftans, poolside, drinking martinis and laughing. And talking about the extraordinary life that we had lived.\" said by Lauren\n\"It\u2019s, uh, heartbreaking\u2026 to lose someone. Yeah, you\u2013 you lose their laugh, their support\u2026\" said by Christine\n\"I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re talking about phyllis anymore.\" said by Lauren\n\"Uh, maybe not.\" said by Christine\n\"Oh, honey. Are you ready to talk about what happened with paul? I\u2013 I mean, unless you think I\u2019m overstepping.\" said by Lauren\n\"Can friends really overstep at this point in our lives?

I mean, look, if thomas isn\u2019t setting off alarm bells, you know, you\u2019re not getting that weird twisty feeling in your gut, I\u2019m gonna say that you probably don\u2019t have to stress about it.

You know, after all this time?\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2019m trying to set this aside for today.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, I hear you, sharon, but until we hear from chance though, we have to err on the side of caution. If cameron has been released, you have to protect yourself and you can\u2019t do that until you know for sure.\" said by Nick\n\"Nicholas?\" said by Nikki\n\"I gotta run.

Have a friend, but you better hope that she is better at keeping a secret than you are. I\u2019m so stupid. Like, why did I even tell you any of this?\" said by Summer\n\"It doesn\u2019t matter. Mom called me too. She may not have spoken on the phone, but I knew it was her. So, I would\u2019ve figured it out eventually.\" said by Daniel\n\"You know what, daniel? You need to be careful. Because if other people start finding out about this. I don\u2019t know, people who\u2026 own media companies, then you are putting our mom in serious danger.\" said by Summer\n\"You seem to be the one with all the knowledge. So, what do you suggest we do?\" said by Daniel\n\"She stays hidden. Until we can prove that the situation she was in was kill or be killed. I don\u2019t know, maybe we\u2013 we try to find the emt. Stark must\u2019ve paid him off to do what he did.\" said by Summer\n\"That\u2019s a good point.\" said by Daniel\n\"So, we find him, we get him to corroborate mom\u2019s story\u2013\" said by Summer\n\"We can\u2019t put all our trust in one guy though.

We can\u2019t just do nothing.\" said by Summer\n\"What about kyle?\" said by Daniel\n\"What about kyle?\" said by Summer\n\"You know that this is upsetting him. You know he doesn\u2019t like seeing his mother suffer like this.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah, living in the lap of luxury, surrounded by her family. Poor diane.\" said by Summer\n\"Mom started this. She\u2019s the one who chose this path.\" said by Daniel\n\"People make mistakes, daniel. Chance. Hi.\" said by Summer\n\"Hey.\" said by Chance\n\"What\u2019s up, man?\" said by Daniel\n\"A lot, actually. I have some news.\" said by Chance\n\"How bad is it?\" said by Summer\n\"Depends on how you look at it.\" said by Chance\n\"Uh, can I get you anything?\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah, yeah. A night at the movies. A day at the park. Feeding the ducks at the pond with harrison.\" said by Diane\n\"We will have all of that if we just show patience and a little bit of faith.\" said by Jack\n\"I\u2019m trying.\" said by Diane\n\"I know.\" said by Jack\n\"I was worried you were gonna bolt. Set off the alarm bells.\" said by Kyle\n\"No. I\u2019m not running anywhere. I have too much to stay for. But phyllis, on the other hand, she\u2019s probably off on some island, sunning herself.\" said by Diane\n\"I know it\u2019s frustrating, but we\u2019re not giving up, are we?\" said by Jack\n\"Someone will find her, the charges will be dropped, and we\u2019ll all go back to our normal lives.\" said by Kyle\n\"But time is running out.\" said by Diane\n\"Wait, why do you say that?\" said by Jack\n\"Because the longer it takes to find her, the farther away she can get. She can change her name. She can meet all the right people who will help her do all the wrong things. Trust me, trust me. I know how easy it is for a motivated person to disappear.\" said by Diane\n\"They are going to find her.\" said by Kyle\n\"I don\u2019t know. By then, I may be rotting away in some prison cell.

What do you want, sheila?\" said by Jack\n\"It is so good to see you, jack.\" said by Sheila\n\"Bill\u2019s hurt katie too many times already. He\u2019s hurt her in ways that\u2013\" said by Carter\n\"Katie\u2019s smart, all right? She\u2019s not gonna let bill deceive her again. Especially when there\u2019s a\u2013 a better option at hand. You two have not, uh, exactly been able to hide how you feel about each other.\" said by Eric\n\"Yes,\" said by Carter\n\"You\u2019re right.\" said by Katie\n\"It\u2019s true. Katie\u2019s become very special to me. I wanna give her all the good things.\" said by Carter\n\"Good. Yeah, especially in opposition to how things have been with him all these years. Look, I\u2019m with you. I don\u2019t wanna see katie\u2019s fragile heart in\u2013 in\u2013 in bill spencer\u2019s hands.\" said by Eric\n\"Chef said about 10 more minutes. Can I get you something to drink while we\u2019re waiting?\" said by Bill\n\"Uh, no\u2013 no, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m good. I actually\u2013 I\u2013 I\u2013 I\u2019m kind of rethinking whether I should stay for a meal.\" said by Katie\n\"Well, it\u2019s kind of an important part of having lunch together, don\u2019t you think?\" said by Bill\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s just that I\u2013 I should\u2019ve been clearer about my intentions. I\u2013 I wanted to come by to reiterate how grateful I am for what you did with sheila, but anything else\u2026\" said by Katie\n\"Because of carter?\" said by Bill\n\"I told you how much I\u2019m enjoying getting to know him.\" said by Katie\n\"Well, how well do you know him, katie? What exactly is going on between you two?\" said by Bill\n\"I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want me to get into details.\" said by Katie\n\"What about me? You did kiss me, after all, when you found out the truth of what was really going on with sheila.\" said by Bill\n\"Yes, and as I recall, I slapped you as well. Bill, you and carter are just two very different people.\" said by Katie\n\"Well, I\u2019ll give him credit for one thing. Smart man, falling for you.\" said by Bill\n\"This was a mistake.\" said by Jack\n\"No, no, come on, please. At least\u2013 at least hear me out.\" said by Sheila\n\"What can you possibly have to say that I\u2019d want to hear, sheila?\" said by Jack\n\"Well, I\u2019ve had a lot of time, um\u2026 to think here, jack.\" said by Sheila\n\"To think about your crimes? Good. Sort of the point.\" said by Jack\n\"About my past and better days. And I realized that a lot of those were with you. I\u2026 those early years with you and I treasure those memories. I treasure those moments and\u2013 and none of them more than the night that we conceived finn.\" said by Sheila\n\"Yeah, I know.\" said by Jack\n\"You know, I\u2013 I couldn\u2019t be more proud of our son and the man that he turned out to be. And I owe you thanks for that, jack, the way you raised him.\" said by Sheila\n\"What are you trying to do here, sheila?\" said by Jack\n\"Maybe\u2026 we can help one another?\" said by Sheila\n\"If you think you could drag me into your madness or that I would ever help you in any way\u2026 you\u2019re even crazier than I thought.\" said by Jack\n\"Look, eric, you and I can understand that bill\u2019s no good for katie, but our opinion doesn\u2019t exactly count. She has to know it, too.\" said by Carter\n\"I\u2019m pretty sure she does.\" said by Eric\n\"Intellectually, yes. But emotionally, when you throw that in the mix, there\u2019s a history there, eric. A marriage full of memories. A child they both adore.\" said by Carter\n\"And you\u2019re scared that he\u2019s gonna remind her of that? That he\u2019s gonna convince her that, uh, he deserves another chance?\" said by Eric\n\"He\u2019s already proven that he\u2019s the hero, right? He took down sheila carter.\" said by Carter\n\"That was a team effort.\" said by Eric\n\"Okay, but it all hinged on bill, his performance, and there\u2019s no denying that it\u2019s changed the way everyone looks at him, including katie.\" said by Carter\n\"Look, carter, two opposing things can be true at the same time. On the one hand, you know, bill\u2019s a big hero. He saved his whole family from a psychotic killer. On the other hand, he\u2019s the worst possible partner that katie could have in this world. So, I\u2019m not gonna worry about it. Look, it doesn\u2019t matter how much he rattles on about having a third and fourth, and fifth chance. You have to have faith that katie\u2019s not gonna fall for it.\" said by Eric\n\"I hope not. I mean, how could she ever believe bill\u2019s feelings for her? Knowing deep down, they\u2019ll never compare to what he feels for her sister.\" said by Carter\n\"You say carter is a smart man. Well, I agree. He\u2019s very smart, he\u2019s very accomplished.\" said by Katie\n\"Odd. Where\u2019s the part where we\u2019re supposedly very different?\" said by Bill\n\"Well, he\u2019s never fallen for my sister, so that\u2019s a huge plus.\" said by Katie\n\"Can we leave brooke out of it?\" said by Bill\n\"I wish\u2013 I wish we could. I wish you would have. Things would have been really different. I suppose you\u2019ve heard about the pact that brooke and taylor have made. They\u2019re gonna put their friendship first and they\u2019re swearing off ridge.\" said by Katie\n\"Yeah, that pact will never last.\" said by Bill\n\"Well, I think it will. I can\u2019t speak for taylor, but brooke, she\u2019s pretty committed to staying true to it. So, she\u2019s available.\" said by Katie\n\"And I\u2019m sure the right guy is out there for her. But if you\u2019re suggesting that\u2019s me, katie\u2013\" said by Bill\n\"You want her. You know you do. So, now\u2019s your chance. You\u2013 she\u2019s all alone. She\u2019s all alone in that big house, so you should make your move. You know you want to. Go to her.\" said by Katie\n\"There was a time when I would have raced right over. I will admit that she had a hold on me. But it had an expiration date and that time has passed. You are the only woman I want, katie. You are the only woman I need. I used to pre-rinse dishes cause my old detergent\" said by ", "answer": "Bill"}

At least 90 percent of the people in this town wanna see me fry, and I\u2019m sure that includes lauren.\" said by Diane\n\"So, tell me all the evidence they have against me.\" said by Diane\n\"All right, well, we\u2019ll discuss that later. First, you walk me through exactly what happened the night phyllis died. The bad, the ugly, the potentially embarrassing, all of it.

I\u2013 I\u2019m running an errand.\" said by Summer\n\"Wait, let me come with you.\" said by Kyle\n\"That is very unnecessary.

I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s the healthiest thing in the world for you to be hanging out in the place where your mother died.\" said by Kyle\n\"You know what, kyle? My mom was unpredictable. And yeah, she drove me crazy, but we\u2019re a lot alike. So, if I need to mourn her in this crazy, unpredictable way, then you just need to understand that.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay, okay. I get it. Just be careful.\" said by Kyle\n\"Besides, this errand, it could bring us all some closure. I used to wait to run my dishwasher\" said by Summer\n\"There\u2019s a gap in your timeline.\" said by Michael\n\"I have to account for every second the night of the gala?\" said by Diane\n\"You were alone for a period of time between wishing that you could strangle phyllis to death and her collapse in the lounge.\" said by Michael\n\"So, christine wants to prove that I wasn\u2019t putting myself back together after phyllis attacked me. What does she think? That I ran out and grabbed some poison and somehow slipped it into phyllis\u2019s champagne?\" said by Diane\n\"Actually, no.

It\u2019s you trying to convince me to let go of my anger and accept what you did, but that\u2019s not going to happen with one conversation. It\u2019s going to take time.

Did you consult with anyone before giving her this promotion?\" said by Billy\n\"Additional sponsorship provided by\u2026\" said by Announcer\n\"All right, well, if the topic is nick\u2019s leave of absence, then, um, I\u2019m having a drink and I assume that you\u2019ll join me.\" said by Victoria\n\"Your mother and i were concerned about your reaction during our earlier conversation.\" said by Victor\n\"You mean because I walked out on you?\" said by Victoria\n\"Yes. We seem to have struck a nerve.\" said by Victor\n\"[ Sighing ] Daddy, I was in the middle of handling other business issues when you and mom started questioning my decisions.\" said by Victoria\n\"Your unilateral decision to replace your brother and put nate in this position. It\u2019s not just business.Other d i have questions about that.\" said by Victor\n\"Do you know how frustrating it is? Having my executive moves scrutinized when I have so much else on my plate.\" said by Victoria\n\"And yet you said that if I didn\u2019t like your decision, I could let you go.\" said by Victor\n\"Daddy, I just said that in the heat of the moment. I don\u2019t sincerely want you to fire me from the company.\" said by Victoria\n\"So then I assume you have cooled off. So, let\u2019s talk.\" said by Victor\n\"Have you or mom considered that maybe this has hit me emotionally as well? Thinking about my sweet little niece being kidnapped and having explosives s\u2013 strapped to her body. I mean, I can only imagine how traumatizing this must have been for nicholas. That\u2019s why I am insisting that he take some time off to recover from this.\" said by Victoria\n\"But sweetheart, your brother can make that decision on his own. You don\u2019t have to make it for him.\" said by Victor\n\"Look, I\u2019m sorry if this decision that I\u2019ve made has upset you. I didn\u2019t mean for that to happen, but dad, he\u2019s been through hell. And as much as I don\u2019t want to even talk about it, you have to remember what happened with ashland.\" said by Victoria\n\"It\u2019s on the forefront of my mind.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, then you will remember that nick\u2019s emotional reaction to killing him crept up on him slowly. He made it seem like it didn\u2019t affect him at all, but it did. It affected him a lot. And I\u2019m just trying to give him a little time to deal with the fallout from all of that without having to feel like he has to hide what he\u2019s going through to protect his job. Look. [ Sighing ] Nick will come back when he is ready and strong and centered.\" said by Victoria\n\"How did he react to your decision?\" said by Victor\n\"I haven\u2019t heard from him since I\u2019ve told him, but I assume and hope that he\u2019s made the decision to use the time well.\" said by Victoria\n\"All right. Now, let\u2019s talk about nate hastings.\" said by Victor\n\"I had the announcement drafted and sent out by our pr team myself.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, that\u2019s one less cause of alarm that I could check off the list because for a second there, I thought maybe somebody hacked into our system for the sole purpose of causing corporate upheaval.\" said by Billy\n\"It\u2019s a little bit dramatic, don\u2019t you think?\" said by Jack\n\"Not as dramatic as the other possibility. That you just detonated a bomb that is going to cause a family war.\" said by Billy\n\"Billy, I can assure you, you don\u2019t need to feel threatened by that.\" said by Diane\n\"Is that right, diane? Look, there are lines being crossed right now. I hope you realize that we just had a family meeting about it. This is the exact thing traci just warned us against.\" said by Billy\n\"I am ceo of jabot. This is my decision to make.\" said by Jack\n\"Right, and I really wish that you would have talked to your co-ceo before making this decision, jack. But what I\u2019m really worried about is that you don\u2019t seem to have any ethical obligation to warning your family before you hire your fianc\u00e9 into a c-suite position.\" said by Billy\n\"Diane, why don\u2019t you head to the club and get us a table? And I don\u2019t need you to be subjected to billy\u2019s overreaction or anything else he might regret saying. It won\u2019t take long.\" said by Jack\n\"No problem.\" said by Diane\n\"I suggest you grab an appetizer, diane. This might take longer than jack thinks.\" said by Billy\n\"Thank you. I was enjoying our non-personal conversation. Why ruin a good thing?\" said by Kyle\n\"Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not gonna grill you about whatever turmoil you\u2019re in right now.\" said by Audra\n\"Is it that obvious?\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, I mean, I just\u2013 you know, I assume that when someone so invested in keeping the conversation light, it\u2019s because they\u2019re avoiding some darker feelings. That, and our growing bar tab.\" said by Audra\n\"Hmm. Perceptive. So why not indulge me in a little more light chit chat?\" said by Kyle\n\"Hmm. Look, I want to be a friendly ear, but I can only talk about cheeseburgers for so long.\" said by Audra\n\"Whoo, whoo, whoo. Are you calling me uptight?\" said by Kyle\n\"No, I just, you know, noted that you\u2019re a man who continues to present a well-kept facade to the world while claiming his personal life is falling apart. You\u2019re the one who used the word uptight.\" said by Audra\n\"Well, I am the ceo of marchetti. Appearances matter.\" said by Kyle\n\"And you get an a+ in that category. You know, I wonder what your grade will be in \u201cfun-loving.\u201d\" said by Audra\n\"Well, with time and responsibility comes structure and discipline.\" said by Kyle\n\"Uh, that\u2019s a solid c-.\" said by Audra\n\"If you knew my past, you\u2019d give me a higher score.\" said by Kyle\n\"Are you asking me to grade you on a curve?\" said by Audra\n\"I\u2019m just saying I partied with the best of them.\" said by Kyle\n\"Oh, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to need some details. Are we talking broke into the family liquor cabinet for a few sips of scotch and stayed out a few minutes past curfew? Because if that\u2019s all you\u2019ve got, no.\" said by Audra\n\"Ooh, hey, now. I can do better than that.\" said by Kyle\n\"Okay.\" said by Audra\n\"Try raided the liquor cabinet of the richest guy in new york city.\" said by Kyle\n\"Uh-huh.\" said by Audra\n\"And had an affair with his wife.\u201d\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle abbott. I\u2019m shocked. Hm. There might be hope for you after all.\" said by Audra\n\"There you go. Moderate to severe eczema\" said by Kyle\n\"There is nothing to discuss about nate.\" said by Victoria\n\"I disagree. You never answered the question your mother and I had. About whether nate\u2019s influenced your decision to have nicholas take a leave for absence.\" said by Victor\n\"He absolutely did not. It was my call to insist that nick take a step away and my decision to have nate step in. As a matter of fact, he challenged me on it.\" said by ", "answer": "Victoria"}

Well, maybe not all of us. Some of us, most of us were sitting at this table, and, um, I was being kicked out of the company, and out of the line.\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah, but you proved yourself. You did the work, and now look at you, jetting off to rome with hope. The forrester dream team, taking the world by storm.\" said by Carter\n\"Maybe we should talk about thomas.

I understand why you are concerned about thomas. That makes total sense, but what I think the real issue is\u2013 is your trust in me.\" said by Hope\n\"No! No. It\u2019s not\u2013 I\u2013 I trust you. Like, I\u2013 I don\u2019t know how I can make that clear.\" said by Liam\n\"Okay, all right, so then trust my judgment in thomas.\" said by Hope\n\"Okay, there\u2019s a difference between trusting your judgment and trusting your intentions. Where your judgment is concerned, it\u2019s a fact that thomas has successfully manipulated you more than once.\" said by Liam\n\"I just\u2013 how many times do we have to go over this?\" said by Hope\n\"I don\u2019t know how many times, un\u2013 until you acknowledge what thomas is capable of.

People saying that she might have feelings for you.\" said by Ridge\n\"Thomas is my lead designer. He is responsible for so much of the hope for the future collection, and designers are at press events and fashion shows. And liam, you know this.\" said by Hope\n\"However, this is a unique and really weirdly complicated situation.\" said by Liam\n\"It\u2019s a business trip.\" said by Hope\n\"I\u2013 I\u2013 I understand that you view it that way, and I believe you.

I just want you to understand that hope for the future is my life\u2019s work!\" said by Hope\n\"I absolutely understand that, and I support you in that.\" said by Liam\n\"Okay, so then do you understand that I tried to find a designer that would make it work? I mean, eric, one of the most prolific designers to ever pick up a pencil, even he couldn\u2019t interpret my vision as well as thomas could.\" said by Hope\n\"The designs are done, though. The dresses are made. You don\u2019t need thomas for this next part.\" said by Liam\n\"Okay, I\u2013 I get that you have issues with thomas.\" said by Hope\n\"Of course I have issues with thomas. How could I possibly trust him after everything he\u2019s done to us?\" said by Liam\n\"Because I do! I\u2013 I\u2019m not some child, liam. I\u2013 I work with him every day, I\u2019ve seen the changes that he\u2019s implemented into his life, a\u2013 and the progress that he\u2019s made, and not only that, he\u2013 he brings a certain artistry, a certain creativity to my line.\" said by Hope\n\"Hope, hope. I\u2019m not asking you to get a new designer.\" said by Liam\n\"But you\u2019re telling me not to bring thomas to rome. And I can\u2019t do that.\" said by Hope\n\"You can\u2019t or you won\u2019t?\" said by Liam\n\"Liam, I don\u2019t want to hurt you. But thomas is my lead designer. He is my partner, and\u2026 I can\u2019t imagine being in rome without him. \u201cLook at this skin, baby.\" said by Hope\n\"Okay, what are the two of you asking me?\" said by Thomas\n\"We\u2019re asking you if there\u2019s any truth to hope being interested in you.\" said by Ridge\n\"You can\u2019t be serious.\" said by Thomas\n\"Oh, we\u2019re very serious, thomas. We know that you\u2019ve changed. But if hope has feelings for you, then that\u2013\" said by Taylor\n\"No, no, no, no. That\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s ridiculous, though.\" said by Thomas\n\"Okay, normally, your father and i would agree with you, but\u2013\" said by Taylor\n\"But you\u2019re what? You\u2019re gonna both get involved in office gossip?\" said by Thomas\n\"Well, that\u2019s not office gossip. It came from your sister, it came from steffy.\" said by Ridge\n\"Yeah.

So, did liam not get to the preview on time?\" said by Finn\n\"No, he just missed it.\" said by Steffy\n\"Oh, that\u2019s a bummer. He must have been disappointed to miss her big moment.\" said by Finn\n\"Oh, he was more than disappointed. I\u2013 I told him that hope went out to go sightseeing after the preview, and he took off. He went towards the colosseum. And, uh\u2013\" said by Steffy\n\"Well, that makes sense. I mean, that\u2019s like the number one sight to see when you\u2019re in rome.

He came back to la.\" said by Steffy\n\"Wait, well, th\u2013 that doesn\u2019t make any sense.

Anyway, how\u2019s daniel doing?\" said by Kyle\n\"He really went off on stark. Who could blame him? Going on about his marriage to phyllis, waving a marriage certificate in everyone\u2019s face?\" said by Jack\n\"It kind of makes you think, doesn\u2019t it?

And what\u2019s it like knowing how upset he is about his mother? His mother that he just started to rebuild a relationship with. How can you look him in the eyes knowing that you could take all that pain away? But instead, you just keep choosing to lie to him.\" said by Daniel\n\"Thanks, but I\u2019m good. I gotta go.\" said by Kyle\n\"No, no, no. The hell you are. Your life is a mess. I say that with love. But this thing that you\u2019re doing, kyle, this stiff upper lip thing, it\u2019s not good.

My mom got out on bail today.\" said by Kyle\n\"That is amazing. So, why don\u2019t you look happier? And why are you here instead of with diane?\" said by Mariah\n\"Well, summer walked in the front door, saw her, there was a confrontation, and she couldn\u2019t get out of the house fast enough. I\u2019ve been looking everywhere for her.\" said by Kyle\n\"Ah. Uh, well, I gotta say, I think that I\u2019m team summer on this one. It\u2019s gotta be hard living under the same roof as the person who was accused of killing your mom. Not that I think diane did it.\" said by Mariah\n\"No, my mom is innocent. Summer just can\u2019t see it. Even worse, I swear that when she looks at me, she doesn\u2019t see her husband, she sees the son of her mother\u2019s killer.\" said by Kyle\n\"As sure as you are of your mother\u2019s innocence, you have to understand that summer sees it differently. Her mom was killed. She is grieving and she\u2019s angry and she has to have a place to put all of this blame. And who better than the person that all of the evidence points to?\" said by Mariah\n\"No, I\u2013 I get why summer feels the way she does. But I don\u2019t know how much longer I can stand having my wife believe I am defending a murderer. Just the idea that she thinks that of me, it hurts like hell.\" said by Kyle\n\"How the hell did you get out of jail?\" said by Ashley\n\"Calm down, okay?\" said by Jack\n\"What\u2019d you do, jack?

Or at least a way to assign a different judge to the case?\" said by Hope\n\"I don\u2019t\u2013 I don\u2019t think that would do any good because knowing my dad, he\u2019d be willing to pay off every judge in town as long as it kept sheila out of jail.\" said by Liam\n\"God. What? He\u2019s that convinced that he is in love with her? In love with this monster? I mean, it wasn\u2019t so long ago where he professed his love to me.\" said by Brooke\n\"He\u2019s a different person now. You should see him, brooke. I mean, and you will. He\u2019s hollow, he\u2019s muted, he\u2013 he\u2013 he lets sheila speak for him, it\u2019s\u2013\" said by Liam\n\"Do you think she has something on him?\" said by Brooke\n\"He swears no, she doesn\u2019t, and it\u2019s just that they\u2019re\u2026 in love.\" said by Liam\n\"Uh, okay. Okay. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s it, I have no choice. I\u2019ve gotta go see him.\" said by Brooke\n\"I think it will be a good thing. I mean, we all know how bill felt about you.\" said by Hope\n\"Feels. Feels about you. You really could be the one person that gets through to him.\" said by Liam\n\"Yeah. I hope so. I hope we can convince him how wrong this is.\" said by Brooke\n\"Mom, just please promise me you\u2019ll be careful. Bill might not be alone and we all know you can never be too careful when it comes to sheila.\" said by Hope\n\"Whatever you\u2019re feeling, good or bad, I\u2013 I\u2013 I want you to turn to me. I wanna be the one that you confide in. It thrills me to think that\u2013 that I can be a source of\u2013 of positive things for you. I\u2013 if I could give you a percentage of what you\u2019ve given me and I\u2019m not talking just about helping me stay out of prison. You believed in me, you defended me, and you loved me, and I never thought I would ever feel that in my life again. You are a miracle, bill, you are my miracle. And what caused your relationships that have been damaged because you\u2019ve chosen me. I can\u2019t believe it. I think that you have that faith in what we can be, even after katie came here saying what she wanted to. And liam and wyatt attacking me the way that they did, and yet you never swayed. You stood up for me. And I know that had to take its toll, a huge toll on you. Maybe more than you realize. Maybe\u2013 maybe you are swaying. You know, I told you I\u2019m a big girl and you can tell me anything, I\u2013 I meant that. If you want me to leave, I\u2019ll leave. No arguing, no tears. I\u2019ll live a happy life of freedom and forever grateful to you and in debt to you and I will always remember fondly that these moments we shared were so special to me. So, just say the word, okay? You say the word and\u2013 and I can be gone. You never have to see me again. There you go. What\u2019s it gonna be? Do you\u2013 do you\u2013 do you want me to walk out those doors because if\u2013 if that\u2019s what you want, that\u2019s what I\u2019ll do. Sweet pillows of softness!\" said by Sheila\n\"Do you think we should\u2019ve let her go over there alone?\" said by Hope\n\"Thanks. No, I think your mom has a better chance without us tagging along and making my dad feel ganged up on.\" said by Liam\n\"Yeah, but what if sheila really is over there?\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah, I know that you\u2019re worried about what might happen.\" said by Liam\n\"Well, aren\u2019t you?\" said by Hope\n\"I am, but I also know how much my dad cares about your mom and he would never ever let harm come to her.\" said by Liam\n\"That is the father that you used to know. Not the man that he\u2019s turned into. I mean, I don\u2019t even know who he is anymore. This whole situation is surreal.\" said by Hope\n\"I know, it\u2019s weird, it\u2019s hard to make sense of. I mean, I\u2013 I wanted my dad to find someone special, you know? I want him to have a loving, healthy relationship, but for him to think he\u2019ll get that from sheila, like\u2013\" said by Liam\n\"It\u2019s scary how good she is at using people. I mean, to know how she has manipulated your father, someone who is usually so shrewd and cunning.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah, she actually convinced him to break his promise to taylor to keep her secret. I mean, like\u2013 like, none of this would even be happening right now if my dad didn\u2019t have that ammunition.\" said by Liam\n\"And it just all goes back to that terrible night taylor shot your father.\" said by Hope\n\"So, what do you say? Are you having second thoughts? Do you want me to leave?\" said by Sheila\n\"Bill.\" said by Brooke\n\"Brooke.\" said by Sheila\n\"So it\u2019s true? Everything I\u2019ve heard about the two of you?\" said by Brooke\n\"I guess it depends on\u2013 on what you\u2019ve been listening to.\" said by Sheila\n\"So you\u2019d really do this, bill? You would threaten taylor\u2019s freedom, you\u2019d blackmail her to keep sheila out of prison.\" said by Brooke\n\"It keeps taylor out, too. It\u2019s a win-win. And you can just keep staring daggers through me, but it\u2019s the truth.\" said by Sheila\n\"I\u2019m not here to talk to you. I\u2019m here to talk to bill, so if you could just give us a minute.\" said by Brooke\n\"No, I know why you\u2019re here. You wanna tell bill how horrible he is. The same way katie did and\u2013 and liam and wyatt, too. Steffy and taylor. It\u2019s no surprise that you want a turn.\" said by Sheila\n\"You think that\u2019s why I\u2019m here? That I wanna tell bill that he\u2019s a horrible person? No, sheila. I could never do that.\" said by Brooke\n\"Okay. Well, you know what? Why don\u2019t you go ahead and give your speech because\u2013\" said by Sheila\n\"Oh, my god, please!\" said by Brooke\n\"I\u2019m sure it\u2019s nothing we haven\u2019t already heard.\" said by Sheila\n\"This is between bill and me and whatever you and I have to say to each other should be through the bars of a cell.\" said by ", "answer": "Brooke"}

This is a team sport.\" said by Thomas\n\"Quite a departure from the last collection.\" said by Ridge\n\"Yeah. Well, I thought it would be really cool to take one of the old designs and update it. Very poetic, you know. And also show the public we\u2019re a force to be reckoned with.

How about by noon?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Also, we have to talk about that cover before we meet with dad.\" said by Liam\n\"Oh, he came roaring back, didn\u2019t he?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Well, ever since sheila went bye bye.\" said by Liam\n\"Right. I\u2019m sure the same thing is going on for ridge. Missed all those months of work, right? Oh, you guys had that dinner last night? The family dinner? You and the kids and hope, brooke, ridge. Is he as amped to be back?\" said by Wyatt\n\"I\u2013 I wouldn\u2019t know. Um, change of plans. Hope and i spent the evening alone, so.\" said by Liam\n\"Oh.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Yeah.\" said by Liam\n\"Oh, really?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Okay. Don\u2019t\u2013 don\u2019t do that.\" said by Liam\n\"Really?\" said by Wyatt\n\"That\u2019s weird, wyatt.

And thank you for your enthusiasm.\" said by Brooke\n\"Hello.\" said by Taylor\n\"Hi. Ever since we announced that thomas is coming back as lead designer for hope for the future, we\u2019ve had so much interest.\" said by Brooke\n\"Well, that makes sense to me. Our kids are a brilliant design team. The whole world knows it.\" said by Taylor\n\"I\u2019m just so happy for hope. She\u2019s so excited and she\u2019s so energized.\" said by Brooke\n\"Yeah. Thomas feels the same way really, you know? God, there are so many things to celebrate right now. You know, I\u2019ve been, um\u2013 I\u2019ve been curious how your family dinner went last night with ridge.\" said by Taylor\n\"Oh, um\u2026 about that.\" said by Brooke\n\"What happened?\" said by Taylor\n\"Liam and hope and the kids, they couldn\u2019t make it.\" said by Brooke\n\"Oh, okay. I\u2019m sorry. So, you had to reschedule?\" said by Taylor\n\"No.\" said by Brooke\n\"No? So, you and ridge had dinner alone?\" said by Taylor\n\"But it was supposed to be a family dinner, really, right?\" said by Taylor\n\"Right.\" said by Brooke\n\"Right.\" said by Taylor\n\"Yeah. I mean, that was the plan. It\u2019s just that at the last minute, hope came in and she told me she decided to spend some time alone with liam instead, and then she arranged these sleepovers for the kids, so.\" said by Brooke\n\"Okay. And so it was\u2013 it was just you and old ridgey?\" said by Taylor\n\"Yep. It was.\" said by Brooke\n\"Hmm.\" said by Taylor\n\"Yeah, man. I came home to this uber romantic setting, courtesy of my beautiful wife.\" said by Liam\n\"Nice. Nice.\" said by Wyatt\n\"The kids were already at play dates, so.\" said by Liam\n\"Place all to yourselves. Judging by that stupid grin on your face, you made the most of it.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Did indeed. And oh, my god, did we need that.\" said by Liam\n\"Yeah. Good.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Yeah.\" said by Liam\n\"I think I wanna bring this in just a tad. Make it a little bit more body conscious.\" said by Thomas\n\"It\u2019s subtle, but it does the trick.\" said by Zende\n\"You really are an amazing designer.\" said by Sloane\n\"Thank you.\" said by Thomas\n\"I\u2019d love to hear how you got that way. Maybe you\u2019ll let me buy you a drink some night soon?\" said by Sloane\n\"Ah, well, I think that could be arranged. All right, well, we\u2019re good. Here. I\u2019ll\u2013 I\u2019ll give you a call.\" said by Thomas\n\"I\u2019ll be waiting.\" said by Sloane\n\"Oh, boy. To be young again, huh? Have fun, but\u2013\" said by Ridge\n\"Be respectful and be smart. I remember.\" said by Thomas\n\"Okay.\" said by Ridge\n\"Okay.\" said by Thomas\n\"I was concerned about hope for the future, but you guys are pulling it off. I\u2019m impressed.\" said by Ridge\n\"It\u2019s so good to have you back. No one gets hope for the future like you do. Am I right?\" said by Zende\n\"He certainly does.\" said by Hope\n\"Nothing happened. It was just dinner with ridge.\" said by Brooke\n\"God, I cannot believe this, brooke. You cooked?\" said by Taylor\n\"What? God, no. No, I\u2013 I didn\u2019t cook. I ordered out from il giardino.\" said by Brooke\n\"Okay.\" said by Taylor\n\"This is nice to spend some time with ridge.\" said by Brooke\n\"I\u2019m really glad that you can be transparent with me about everything, especially when it comes to ridge. Thank you. God, we\u2019ve come such a long way, haven\u2019t we?\" said by Taylor\n\"Yeah.\" said by Brooke\n\"I trust you.\" said by Taylor\n\"I trust you.\" said by Brooke\n\"Good.\" said by Taylor\n\"Look, you have to know this. I take our vow very seriously. Men, they can come and go, but girlfriends, they last forever.\" said by Brooke\n\"Come here.\" said by Taylor\n\"Thanks. So hold on. Let me\u2013 let me get this straight. Thomas caught hope as she fell off a riser in the design office?\" said by Wyatt\n\"I swear to god, wyatt, if you had seen what I walked in on.\" said by Liam\n\"Oh, I would\u2019ve done a lot more than shove him, that\u2019s for sure.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Yeah.\" said by Liam\n\"So\u2013 so you and hope, what, cleared things up last night then or no?\" said by Wyatt\n\"You know what, it was nice. It was really nice to just kinda like table thomas and\u2013 and focus on each other. Here\u2019s the\u2013 here\u2019s the thing. I know that hope and I are never going to agree on thomas because I look at him and I don\u2019t see a better man. I see a better liar. I see an algorithm that is just learning with every failed manipulation.\" said by Liam\n\"So, did you tell hope though? Does she know how you feel about this?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Of course, she knows.\" said by Liam\n\"Okay. Then, unfortunately, you have to trust her. I mean, if she says one more move and thomas is out, then you have to believe that. You have to believe that she\u2019s gonna handle it.\" said by Wyatt\n\"I mean, I know. I know. I\u2013 and\u2013 and the problem is I trust hope and I don\u2019t trust thomas.\" said by Liam\n\"Right.\" said by Wyatt\n\"But you know what? It\u2019s nights like last night that make me feel better because she made an effort. She showed up. She\u2013 she acknowledged my point of view. She thanked me for my\u2013 my\u2013 my patience. I mean, it was just\u2013 it was\u2013 it was really nice. And it\u2013 and it\u2013 it gives me certainty that thomas isn\u2019t gonna interfere in our marriage.\" said by Liam\n\"Have you, uh, heard from chief baker?\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah. No, I talked to him earlier. Sheila still recovering from her heart attack and yeah, she\u2019s gonna end up behind bars.\" said by Ridge\n\"I am still blown away that you and bill were able to pull this off.\" said by Zende\n\"Yeah. Teamwork makes the dream work. We know a lot about that, don\u2019t we?\" said by Thomas\n\"Absolutely.\" said by Hope\n\"We sure do.\" said by Zende\n\"You know what\u2019s nice? Being excited about a line again. Hope for the future, I think, is gonna be better than ever. And hope, I know you had some reservations about rehiring thomas. I think you made the right choice. A strong choice makes you the leader that you are, doing what\u2019s right for the company. You guys make a good team. Ultomiris is for adults with generalized myasthenia gravis\" said by Ridge\n\"Not to uh, overshare, but hope and I, we have not uh, connected like that in a long time.\" said by Liam\n\"I mean, you need that. I\u2019m happy for you guys.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Yeah, I mean\u2013\" said by Liam\n\"What?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Just\u2013 no, nothing. It\u2019s not\u2013 there were like a couple of moments where she seemed a little off, I guess.\" said by Liam\n\"What do you mean?\" said by Wyatt\n\"No, she\u2019s not\u2013 it wasn\u2019t\u2013 I\u2019m overplaying it. It wasn\u2019t\u2013 she wasn\u2019t off. She was just like\u2013 she would\u2013 oh, my god. And then, when it was over, she like got dressed like really, really fast and said she had to go see her mom.\" said by Liam\n\"Really? That\u2019s odd.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Yeah, it was. It was super abrupt and weird. And I don\u2019t know, it kind of freaked me out a little bit. So, I went up to the main house after she did, and I don\u2019t know what she and brooke were talking about, but\u2013 but by the time I got there, it was\u2013 it was tense. Like hope was tense.\" said by Liam\n\"So, what do you think?\" said by Thomas\n\"It reminds me of, I don\u2019t know, a different time when things were less complicated? I mean, it feels relaxed, comfortable.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah. Unstructured, but sensual. You know, that\u2019s what this line\u2019s all about.\" said by Thomas\n\"Exactly. I mean, I\u2019ve always been drawn to that sort of style. The\u2013 I don\u2019t know, hippie-esque, flowy, \u201960s vibe.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah. \u201960s for sure. \u201970s a little bit as well. I mean the\u2013 the hippie fashions and the boho were very similar in a lot of ways, but they\u2019re also different. I mean, you know, boho is a little bit more\u2013 a little bit more romantic, right? I mean, the boho designs sort of incorporate the fringe and the\u2013 the flare, all those kind of things, right? I mean, it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s really impressive and cool how you see the\u2013 the\u2013 the designs expand over time and\u2013 and\u2013 and that sort of boho get a little bit more artistic and\u2013 and kind of complicated in a lot of ways and this is a lot of information you already know and I don\u2019t need to tell you \u2019cause it\u2019s boring you to death.\" said by Thomas\n\"No, not boring. Not boring at all. It\u2019s just\u2013 it\u2019s nice to see you so passionate.\" said by Hope\n\"So did chief baker call you?\" said by Brooke\n\"He did. He told me that sheila was recovering from her heart attack in the prison hospital and that we don\u2019t have to worry about her anymore. We don\u2019t have to worry about her coming after any of us.\" said by Taylor\n\"Still blows me away actually, that we thought ridge was out there traveling around trying to find himself, and he was right here in town trying to help trap sheila.\" said by Brooke\n\"Yeah, yeah. You know, keeping us safe and most importantly, keeping the futures of our grandchildren safe and secure, which is amazing.\" said by ", "answer": "Taylor"}

I told her I refused to let this thing come between us, to tear us apart. What\u2019s more, I told her that I wanted to marry her now more than ever and I wanted to do it right away.\" said by Jack\n\"And what did she say?\" said by Billy\n\"Mom?\" said by Summer\n\"It\u2019s just me.

I just gave you alternative moves that you could make.\" said by Ashley\n\"You cracked the door open just enough for me to believe that maybe we can make it work this time around.\" said by Tucker\n\"Maybe being the operative word. You know, there\u2019s no guarantees.\" said by Ashley\n\"I know. But I\u2019m glad that we both agreed that this is at least worth exploring. And uh, anyway, it was a very romantic gesture to offer to share your home with me and I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m rather looking forward to seeing the look on jack\u2019s face when he\u2013\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah.\" said by Ashley\n\"When he sees me coming down the stairs for breakfast.\" said by Tucker\n\"I don\u2019t want to talk about jack right now.\" said by Ashley\n\"Sure.\" said by Tucker\n\"Let\u2019s not do it.

You don\u2019t really believe that. You don\u2019t honestly think that I am defending a woman who cost phyllis her life?\" said by Michael\n\"I do. Christine is sure that she is to blame and chance is damn good at his job. Do you remember when diane was cuffed and hauled out of here and she begged you to represent her and you refused, as you should? That was your gut telling you, you should not give that woman the benefit of the doubt.\" said by Lauren\n\"You\u2019re right. You\u2019re right. How could I not? I was reeling. We all were. We had just found out that phyllis had been poisoned.\" said by Michael\n\"And after jack pleaded with you personally, you still refused. What superseded your reluctance? Your enormous ego?\" said by Lauren\n\"How could you even say that?\" said by Michael\n\"Because I remember you telling me that victor and nikki were giving you a hard time for even thinking about defending diane. So what was this, the ultimate pushback to prove that you can make your own decisions?\" said by Lauren\n\"You hold on now. That is a gross oversimplification. I would not just blithely sacrifice my job with victor because my fragile and enormous ego was bruised.\" said by Michael\n\"Then tell me. Tell me what it was? Because it certainly seems that your desire to prove a point was more important than everything, including my feelings. You knew exactly how I would react with you defending diane and you went and you did it anyway.\" said by Lauren\n\"So you asked diane to marry you, right then and there? And she didn\u2019t give you an answer?\" said by Billy\n\"Nope. I\u2019m not sure why. I thought that offering to marry her now would make her see that my faith in her is unshakeable. That I could make her see that I deeply believe she was coming home. That any day now, we could start to rebuild this new chapter in our lives that\u2013 that we dreamed about.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. Well, you know, jack, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m sure she\u2019s scared, you know, and overwhelmed. I\u2019m not surprised that she put the brakes on. She\u2019s trying to get through her life right now, hour by hour.\" said by Billy\n\"I know\u2013 I know all that. That\u2019s why I\u2019m doing everything I can to give her some sense of comfort.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, I know. I\u2019m sure she appreciates that, but I can\u2019t imagine she was prepared for you to show up and say, \u201clet\u2019s get hitched right now\u201d, you know. As much as she loves you, and she does love you, that is pretty impulsive.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah, I will admit to that.\" said by Jack\n\"Look, maybe she\u2019s thinking that there\u2019s more to this than you asking her to marry you.\" said by Billy\n\"Meaning what?\" said by Jack\n\"I think it\u2019s pretty clear that you think things are spinning out of control right now and maybe this is your attempt to desperately find something that you can control.\" said by Billy\n\"Billy, the last thing I need right now is you analyzing me. My suggestion did not come out of the blue. We are engaged. I fully intend to spend the rest of my life with her. I was simply moving up the timetable.\" said by Jack\n\"Why don\u2019t you just slow down a little bit, okay? This isn\u2019t something you can outrun, jack.\" said by Billy\n\"What are you talking about? What am I trying to outrun?\" said by Jack\n\"Not that long ago, you were ready to spend the rest of your life with someone else. Someone that you loved deeply. You called her red, and now she\u2019s gone and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve even begun to mourn that loss yet.\" said by Billy\n\"You are overwhelmed and emotional and I think I know what\u2019s going on. I haven\u2019t told anyone this, but I see mom too. I see her all the time. Someone walking by me on the street and\u2013 and my heart, it skips a beep.\" said by Daniel\n\"This wasn\u2019t like that, daniel. This was real.\" said by Summer\n\"I know that it seems that way. I mean, those fleeting moments, they\u2013 they feel real to me too. But our mind, it plays tricks on us, especially in a stressful situation like this. And I think that\u2019s why mom, she comes to me in my dreams and you know, when I\u2019m alone, sometimes I find myself talking to her. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just my way of trying to hold on to her, I guess. Trying to still feel close and connected with her. I just keep thinking about the way she died and going over and over all the unanswered questions.\" said by Daniel\n\"What if I had answers to those questions? Moderate to severe eczema\" said by Summer\n\"Once again, you have misconstrued things. My desire to marry diane is quite separate from my need to mourn phyllis.\" said by Jack\n\"With all due respect, I\u2013 I disagree, jack. It seems like to me, you\u2019re avoiding your pain and your grief by simply focusing on your future with diane.\" said by Billy\n\"Believe me, I have grieved. I poured my heart out at that memorial service. I am not in denial.\" said by Jack\n\"I\u2019m not saying you are, but what I am saying is that you\u2019re not really allowing yourself to understand what\u2019s going on inside of you. I mean, everything has been moving at warp speed since that gala. I\u2019m sure you haven\u2019t had a second to even take a breath.\" said by ", "answer": "Billy"}

I don\u2019t even like the fact that my mind is going there, but it\u2019s going there and I have to admit it and I just, you know, like there\u2019s a lot\u2013 there\u2019s so many things I can forgive but not that, you know, never, never that.\" said by Liam\n\"You are the most principled and\u2013 and moral person I\u2019ve ever met. You\u2019re nothing like your mother. You love your family. You always wanna be with liam and\u2013 and nothing is gonna come between you two.\" said by Thomas\n\"Thank you. Thank you. Yeah.\" said by Hope\n\"[ Laughs ] Here.\" said by Thomas\n\"I should have seen this coming.\" said by Liam\n\"No one could have predicted that the jet would break down.\" said by Steffy\n\"Not the\u2013 not the jet breaking down, but I\u2013 I could have predicted that things like this would start to happen if hope brought thomas back to work on her line.\" said by Liam\n\"What are you talking about?\" said by Steffy\n\"There\u2019s always gonna be business trips. There\u2019s always gonna be these special, personal appearances that hope has to make to promote her line. I mean, it\u2019s naive to think that thomas wouldn\u2019t want to tag along every chance he gets.\" said by Liam\n\"Whoa, liam. That\u2019s not what happened. The buyers wanted to see thomas. He didn\u2019t just horn in to be around hope.\" said by Steffy\n\"That\u2013 I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what happened this time. I\u2019m saying\u2013 let\u2019s say his obsession with hope kicks in again. Okay, this is\u2013 this is exactly the kind of opportunity that he could seize upon. They\u2019re in san francisco.\" said by Liam\n\"Okay, liam, I am telling you, thomas is not gonna be an issue when it comes to hope.\" said by Steffy\n\"You really believe that?\" said by Liam\n\"I really believe that.\" said by Steffy\n\"So, I have\u2013 I have nothing to worry about? Nothing at all.\" said by Liam\n\"Hope, tell me the truth. You have feelings for him.\" said by Steffy\n\"It\u2019s trevor.\" said by Hope\n\"Okay.\" said by Thomas\n\"Hi. Hi. Any news?\" said by Hope\n\"Yes. Good news. We were finally able to get all the mechanical issues fixed.\" said by Trevor\n\"Okay. So, the jet\u2019s all set to go?\" said by Hope\n\"I\u2019m sorry about the delay, but we are a go. And hope? Did you hear me? As soon as you get to the airport, we\u2019ll be ready to go.\" said by Trevor\n\"Yes. Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thomas and I will be there soon. Special k is oven-toasted to crisp perfection\" said by Hope\n\"Okay. Okay. I have tried to reassure you every way I know how about my brother, but I really don\u2019t know what else I can say.\" said by Steffy\n\"I know. I know. Hey, I do have a certain psychiatrist you would totally get along with because taylor had plenty to say about how thomas has changed and he\u2019s not the same person. He\u2019s been doing work on himself and that change is real and lasting and important.\" said by Liam\n\"Yeah? Did my mom\u2013 did she sway you?\" said by Steffy\n\"No, she didn\u2019t sway me. But I do understand why she thinks I\u2019m the one being unreasonable.\" said by Liam\n\"Look, my mom respects you. And you\u2019re right to feel the way that you do.\" said by Steffy\n\"Listen, I get it. It\u2019s like you, your mom, your dad, your whole family, even hope. I mean, like literally everybody thinks I just need to get over myself and accept that thomas has changed.\" said by Liam\n\"Thomas is just trying to be his best self. New and improved thomas forrester. There\u2019s no hint of him backsliding.\" said by Steffy\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Liam\n\"I don\u2019t believe he\u2019s gonna initiate anything.\" said by Steffy\n\"Well, he better not because he\u2019s already created a lot of friction in my marriage and I\u2019m not gonna let anything come between us. Especially not him.\" said by Liam\n\"So, the jet\u2019s ready to go. So, we should get ready to head to the airport.\" said by Hope\n\"Sure. Um, do you wanna call liam? I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be relieved knowing you\u2019ll be home tonight.\" said by Thomas\n\"Right, yeah. Of course.\" said by Hope\n\"Hey, you okay?\" said by Liam\n\"Yeah. Yeah. The pilot just called and they fixed the jet.\" said by Hope\n\"Are you flying home tonight?\" said by Liam\n\"Yep.\" said by Hope\n\"Good.\" said by Liam\n\"Good. I\u2019m anxious to get home.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah. No kidding. It\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s been, what? Less than a day and it just feels like so much longer than that.\" said by Liam\n\"Well, I love you and I can\u2019t wait to be in your arms again.\" said by Hope\n\"I like the sound of that. Um\u2026 I love you too. Uh\u2026 be safe and I\u2019ll see you soon.\" said by Liam\n\"They\u2019re on their way back?\" said by Steffy\n\"Yeah. So that\u2019s\u2013 hey! Don\u2019t have to have that in my head for the rest of the night. Hopefully, right?\" said by Liam\n\"It\u2019s great. I\u2019m telling you, thomas is doing the work as a designer, as a co-parent, for douglas. Thomas isn\u2019t the one you should be concerned about.\" said by Steffy\n\"He has his hat on straight.\" said by Steffy\n\"I really wanna believe that.\" said by Liam\n\"All right, I texted the front desk and cancelled that other room. Got everything?\" said by Thomas\n\"I think so. You?\" said by Hope\n\"Think so.\" said by Thomas\n\"Good, I\u2019m glad we were able to go home tonight.\" said by Hope\n\"Home to your husband and family. Diabetes can serve up a lot of questions,\" said by Thomas\n\"You\u2013 you relax. I already put the kids down. I whipped up a light dinner, the two of us and we can eat after you\u2013\" said by Finn\n\"Thank you.\" said by Steffy\n\"Unwind.\" said by Finn\n\"What did I do to deserve being married to such an incredible husband? Really?\" said by Steffy\n\"I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll show your appreciation later.\" said by Finn\n\"Oh, you best believe it.\" said by Steffy\n\"So your text said you were at spencer publications?\" said by Finn\n\"Yeah, I\u2013 I needed to talk to liam.\" said by Steffy\n\"About eye on fashion?\" said by Finn\n\"No, about um, hope and thomas. I was just\u2026 checking in on him about their business trip to san francisco.\" said by Steffy\n\"Oh, yeah. Is liam doing any better with that? He didn\u2019t seem too thrilled when it came up. Yeah, he was even less than thrilled when hope called and said that she wasn\u2019t gonna make it back tonight.\" said by Finn\n\"What do you mean? There was something wrong with the jet. Some kind of like malfunction and they weren\u2019t sure if they\u2019re gonna be able to fix it and\u2013 anyways, it looked like hope and thomas were gonna spend the night in san francisco.\" said by Finn\n\"Wow. Wait. Oh, so, your brother and hope alone together overnight.\" said by Finn\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s putting it mildly. Liam can\u2019t get past everything that thomas has done. He keeps thinking that thomas is going to revert to his old ways.\" said by Steffy\n\"So, did they make it back to L.A. At least?\" said by Finn\n\"Uh, yeah, they\u2019re\u2013 the plane\u2019s fixed and they\u2019re on their way now.\" said by Steffy\n\"Okay, good. So no harm, no foul, liam can relax.\" said by Finn\n\"Yeah. Um, actually, there\u2019s more.\" said by Steffy\n\"Concerning liam and thomas?\" said by Finn\n\"I mean, should we tell dad about the final numbers? What do you think he\u2019s gonna say? You know, I know he said he liked the company and that he wanted us to pull the trigger and\u2013 and you know, lock it in and everything. It\u2019s just, I don\u2019t know. Are we moving too fast? I mean, are we not seeing something here? Are we overlooking anything that could be like a problem for the company later on? I\u2019m just not\u2013 I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m freaking out here. Liam?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Yo.\" said by Liam\n\"Hey!\" said by Wyatt\n\"Hey.\" said by Liam\n\"I could use your feedback here.

Otherwise, she never would\u2019ve let him back on her line.\" said by Taylor\n\"Because hope sees what we do, that thomas is making improvements. He\u2019s taking steps.

Didn\u2019t know you\u2019d be here.\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah, well, some of my favorite people hang out here. What is it?\" said by Taylor\n\"Something wrong?\" said by Ridge\n\"Um, I\u2019m not sure.\" said by Thomas\n\"What does that mean?\" said by Steffy\n\"Uh, hope was modelling one of my latest designs. She was up on the riser and um, I was making adjustments.\" said by Thomas\n\"Thomas, what did you do?\" said by Steffy\n\"Nothing. I\u2013 I\u2013 I\u2013 I caught her. She fell off the riser and I broke her fall.\" said by Thomas\n\"Okay, that\u2013 that doesn\u2019t sound like such a bad thing.\" said by Taylor\n\"Right, it doesn\u2019T. It\u2019s not a bad thing other than she\u2013 when she fell, she fell into me and uh, we fell into the couch, and then liam walked in to the door.\" said by Thomas\n\"Oh.\" said by Steffy\n\"He was angry. He was blinded by his hatred for me and started yelling and then told me I need to leave and uh, so instead of escalating the situation, I left. The old me would not have done that.\" said by Thomas\n\"And he didn\u2019t let you explain at all?\" said by Ridge\n\"No, but I can\u2019t exactly fault him for that. I mean, look, what I\u2019ve done in the past with his wife, him looking out for her, of course he reacted that way.\" said by Thomas\n\"So, you\u2013 you promise that this is completely innocent, right?\" said by Steffy\n\"I promise.\" said by Thomas\n\"And liam probably thinks you orchestrated the whole thing, right?\" said by Taylor\n\"Yeah, yeah, probably. Hope is over there. She\u2019s talking to him right now. Hopefully, she can help him see the truth in the situation. I just hope this doesn\u2019t cause issues in their marriage.\" said by Thomas\n\"Liam, please let me explain.\" said by Hope\n\"What did\u2013 what\u2013 what is there to explain? I called this. I totally called this.\" said by Liam\n\"What you walked in on is not at all what you think it is.\" said by Hope\n\"Really? \u2018Cause what I think I walked in on was you two on the couch with his hands all over you.\" said by Liam\n\"Because I fell. We were in a fitting and I was up on that riser and I lost my balance and I started to fall, thomas tried to catch me and we both fell. So that\u2013 that is what you walked in on. But really, honestly, the most hurtful part about that reaction was the fact that you think I would willingly put myself in that position.\" said by Hope\n\"Do you really not understand how that looked?\" said by Liam\n\"You wanna know what it looks like? It looks like I have a husband who does not trust me. I mean me, after all of these years, and\u2013 and one that is so ready to jump to the\u2013 to the craziest, most incorrect conclusion because you\u2019ve decided that thomas is not capable of change. I mean, you were just so chomping at the bit for him to mess up. But really, what takes the cake is that you think that I, little me, don\u2019t know how to handle myself around him. I mean, liam, you talk about being supportive and what you\u2019ve had to endure? Well, what about me? What about everything that I have had to endure? The trust that I have had to put into you? After everything you\u2019ve done in the past? Let\u2019s talk about that?\" said by Hope\n\"I don\u2019t know what to say here. How many times have I told you that it\u2019s not you I don\u2019t trust. It\u2019s never been you. Okay, let\u2019s say this time is innocent. What about the next time? Or the time after that? Or the time after that because hope, it\u2019s a-coming. It\u2019s coming, unless you hold up a hand and you say enough is enough. The man is toxic and he has to go.\" said by Liam\n\"Okay, all right. So, I\u2019m just supposed to, you know, lose my line because my husband\u2013\" said by Hope\n\"Because I don\u2019t trust him and neither should you! Why on earth would you trust him at this point? He knew beth was alive! He watched us grieve and he said nothing! Because that is how far he is willing to go to have you and he\u2019s proven it. The man is and always has been demented!\" said by Liam\n\"He\u2019s not that man. And you are acting as if my word carries no weight. I have told thomas that if I see him start to backslide into that version of himself, he is gone. And I mean it. But liam, guess what? I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna happen. I don\u2019t because I believe he has changed and the time that we spend together is strictly professional, that is it. The real thing\u2026 is why\u2026 why don\u2019t you believe me?\" said by Hope\n\"Because you keep finding new reasons to invite him into your life. Why do you do that? Why do you do that? Hi, I\u2019m katie, I\u2019ve lost 110 pounds\" said by Liam\n\"If liam\u2019s freaking out, it could change hope\u2019s mind about working with you.\" said by Steffy\n\"Yeah, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019s trying to convince her to take me off the line right now. And hopefully, she can\u2013 she can speak that truth into him and he can see the situation for what it is.\" said by Thomas\n\"You know what? At this point, it sounds like more of a hope and liam situation and you can\u2019t control that. You just need to remember that\u2013 that we believe in you and we know the changes that you\u2019ve made and we have your back, always.\" said by Taylor\n\"We\u2019ve got your back because I think you\u2019re on the right path for the first time in a long time. So don\u2019t let liam or hope or anyone throw you off it. You can do this.\" said by Ridge\n\"That means the world to me. I mean, I\u2013 I made a lot of mistakes, but\u2026 without your faith in me, all of you, I never would have moved past that. You know, I\u2013 I made a lot of horrible mistakes and I turned into a wretched person, but I had to be able to put that out on the table. I had to put my obsession with hope, my lies, my manipulations, everything that I used to participate in, that\u2013 that ate at me from the inside and I let it all out and it was really hard to do that, but I finally put that down and I realized that that doesn\u2019t define me. It\u2019s not who I am and that\u2019s thanks to your love. You\u2019ve shown me that I don\u2019t always be that. I can be something so much better and I love you all for it, and none more than you, mom, because you\u2026 you\u2019re the glue that holds this family together, you know? You make us a team.\" said by Thomas\n\"Team taylor? Is it too soon or?\" said by Ridge\n\"No. Team taylor. And I\u2019ll say it again because you won\u2019t say it about yourself.

Oh, did you feel that too?\" said by Sally\n\"Mariah, you don\u2019t have to stay to help clean up. I\u2019ve got this.\" said by Faith\n\"Oh, no, you\u2013 you just got home. You can go unpack or hang out with dorm cat.\" said by Mariah\n\"His name is borgnine, as you know. And he\u2019s probably still sleeping. So, I\u2019m on cleanup duty.

How kind of you.\" said by Faith\n\"Well, I gave you a chance to escape, but you sort of blew it, so.\" said by Mariah\n\"I mean, will you look at these pictures? The greatest collection of women who\u2019ve ever been assembled. The photographer\u2019s obviously very talented. He crushed it.\" said by Nick\n\"Poor dad. You can\u2019t actually take credit for all of our fabulousness. All you did was take the picture.\" said by Faith\n\"That\u2019s a skill, faith. I mean, you can\u2019t just aim and shoot, all right? The framing, the lighting, it\u2019s all perfect. I mean, ask your mom. She\u2019s impressed.\" said by Nick\n\"Mom?\" said by Faith\n\"Huh? Yeah. Uh, you\u2019re all wonderful and\u2013 and talented.\" said by Sharon\n\"Uh, sort of out of nowhere, but I will take it.\" said by Mariah\n\"What\u2019s going on? What\u2019s got you so distracted?

That\u2019s exactly what I was thinking about, our family and how lucky I am to have all of you. But it is time for you two to go. There\u2019s no reason for you to hang out. Nick can help me clean up.\" said by Sharon\n\"We don\u2019t mind. Really.\" said by Faith\n\"No, no. Faith, you just got home. Why don\u2019t you go and visit your friends or visit family. I know that victor and nikki are dying to see you.\" said by Sharon\n\"I did promise granddad I\u2019d be by to lose at chess.\" said by Faith\n\"Wow. That\u2019s the fighting spirit.\" said by Mariah\n\"Guess the dirty dishes are on you, dad.\" said by Faith\n\"It is my welcome home gift to you, kiddo.\" said by Nick\n\"Have fun.\" said by Sharon\n\"Bye. Maybe we can go to the tack house first so I can video chat moses and show him the new baby.\" said by Faith\n\"Perfect. I mean, if she\u2019s asleep, she will not be for long. Trust me. Bye, guys.\" said by Mariah\n\"Bye.\" said by Nick\n\"Bye.\" said by Sharon\n\"You did a great job covering. What was in the box that was delivered?\" said by Nick\n\"Okay.\" said by Sharon\n\"This is the motel where cameron attacked you. The son of a bitch has a twisted sense of humor.\" said by Nick\n\"Makes me sick to my stomach to think about it. But, he\u2019s in prison, right?\" said by Sharon\n\"I mean, he certainly should be. There\u2019s no way this lunatic should be out in the streets ever again.\" said by Nick\n\"Cameron is up to something. Sending me all of these little packages and gifts. What can he possibly want? What message is he trying to send?\" said by Sharon\n\"Hey.\" said by Chance\n\"Hey.\" said by Nick\n\"I got news about kirsten. It\u2019s not great.\" said by Chance\n\"Miss? Hey, I\u2013 I don\u2019t mean to bother you, but, um, are you okay?\" said by Cameron\n\"Yeah, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m fine. I just\u2013 I had a little double vision. It\u2019s just making me dizzy.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah. Well, look in\u2013 in your condition that\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s nothing to mess around with, uh. Can I\u2013 can I call somebody for you?\" said by Cameron\n\"Well, you must be relieved, kyle. Your mom\u2019s been vindicated. What our mother put you and the rest of your family through was brutal. Still can\u2019t believe she would do such a thing.\" said by Daniel\n\"But it wasn\u2019t mom\u2019s fault. You know, it was stark. He was the one that lured her in, manipulated her, threatened to kill her when she didn\u2019t do what he wanted. I mean, that\u2019s what she told you, right?\" said by Summer\n\"Right. And, you know, I\u2019m sure stark didn\u2019t expect to wind up dead.\" said by Daniel\n\"If stark had it his way, then mom would be the one that was dead right now. Both mom and diane are stark\u2019s victim.\" said by Summer\n\"Exactly. Just let your mom know how happy I am that this part of the nightmare is over for her and I\u2019m sorry that I couldn\u2019t do something to clear her sooner.\" said by Daniel\n\"I\u2019ll certainly pass along your message. And we\u2019ll always owe you a debt of gratitude for coming forward after hearing about phyllis.\" said by Kyle\n\"It was the only right thing to do.\" said by Daniel\n\"Even so, you could have kept phyllis\u2019s secret. I know you wanted to protect her at all costs, but you didn\u2019T. You came forward and set my mom free.\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, I can never stay quiet when someone\u2019s entire future is at stake. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to live with myself otherwise.\" said by Daniel\n\"I\u2013 I realize the emotions are complicated for both of you, but the good news is your mother is alive. It\u2019s like a miracle you secretly hope for, but never out loud. I get it. And when phyllis comes forward and explains why she did what she did, christine, the police, they\u2019ll listen. They\u2019ll try to be fair. I know you\u2019re worried about the repercussions, but phyllis is tough as hell. She\u2019ll get through it.\" said by Kyle\n\"There shouldn\u2019t be any repercussions. Anything criminal my mom did was in self-defense. She\u2019s not a murderer. She\u2019s just not. The D.A. Is gonna see that. She has to.

That\u2019s a yes.\" said by Lucy\n\"Okay. Have you talked to your dad about this?\" said by Lily\n\"No, not\u2013 not yet. But\u2013 but I can if you\u2019re not comfortable talking about it. I mean, dad will tell me the truth no matter what, even if it\u2019s that awful.\" said by Lucy\n\"Well, no, no, no, no. It\u2013 it wasn\u2019t awful. I mean, that\u2019s definitely an overstatement.\" said by Lily\n\"How old were you guys?\" said by Lucy\n\"Uh, we were not old enough to be married, that\u2019s for sure.\" said by Lily\n\"This is crazy. I mean, you\u2019re literally my dad\u2019s ex-wife and you guys just act like your old friends.\" said by Lucy\n\"Okay, listen. I do not condone what we did at such a young age. I do not.\" said by Lily\n\"Okay. Okay. I get it. I won\u2019t run off and marry some kid from homeroom. Tell me everything.\" said by Lucy\n\"Oh, gosh. Um\u2026\" said by Lily\n\"I mean, you guys said vows and there\u2013 there must have been a marriage license and then a divorce? I mean, just think about all the teasing I can get off of my dad. And wait, doesn\u2019t that make you guys each other\u2019s first loves? Wow. How romantic is that? Now you guys are together again. I mean, that\u2019s a book I\u2019d totally read.\" said by Lucy\n\"Okay, hold on.\" said by Lily\n\"Wait. And if my dad ever tells me that I\u2019m too young to know what love is, I can just point at you guys.

The other best thing that we could do is get you some coffee and a couple of those butterscotch scones that you love, on the house.\" said by Faith\n\"Oh, come on, that\u2019s not necessary.\" said by Chance\n\"You saved our lives.

This is gonna take some time for them to get past. That\u2019s yet another reason why nick has earned a well-deserved break, I think.\" said by Victoria\n\"What? Are you still pushing for that? Even now?\" said by Nikki\n\"I think that it\u2019s even more imperative given the trauma that he\u2019s been through. I\u2019m hoping that you\u2019ll support me.

Just as you were concerned about me as a mother after what happened with ashland.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay. For the record, you refused to take even one minute off. You said that work was the best remedy. Now, nicholas may feel the same way. If he needs a vacation, by all means, he should take all the time that he needs. But it should be his choice, victoria.\" said by Nikki\n\"Are you seriously defending your brother and justifying his decision?

Are they okay?\" said by Sally\n\"They\u2019re fine. But when cameron forced me to decide who lives and who dies, in that moment, that awful, soul-crushing moment, I couldn\u2019t give an answer.

I\u2019m grateful that I didn\u2019t have to decide who lives and who dies. Sally, adam\u2026 he wasn\u2019t spared that. He faced the same black hole I did. I can\u2019t fault his decision.\" said by Nick\n\"It\u2019s just not entirely the same, nick. My little girl never even got a chance to take her first breath. She deserved that and adam took that from her.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, I\u2019m not up for a big night on the town, but I\u2019m doing okay. I\u2019m mostly grateful that things didn\u2019t turn out any worse than they were.

You don\u2019t know the whole story. Chance was a hero yesterday.\" said by Sharon\n\"A hero? Really?\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah, if he hadn\u2019t arrived when he did, faith and i might not be here right now.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, maybe if he had found kirsten sooner, faith wouldn\u2019t have been kidnapped at all.\" said by Adam\n\"Be nice. You and chance actually have a lot in common.\" said by Faith\n\"Okay, somehow I doubt that.\" said by Adam\n\"You risked your lives to save mine.

How do you be so generous after what I\u2019ve done to you in the past, sharon? I let you think you lost a baby. A lot of people would say I deserve to be going through every bit of hell that I\u2019m going through right now.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay, if anybody says that to you, they have no decency. A lot of people have been through the kind of loss you\u2019ve suffered and no one deserves that.\" said by Sharon\n\"Your stance on this wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with the fact that you have someone eagerly waiting in the wings to jump behind nicholas\u2019 desk, would it?\" said by Nikki\n\"Mom, let me say this again. This is not some attempt to remove nicholas from the company permanently. He is far too valuable for that. It\u2019s merely a tactical move for newman and it\u2019s in nick\u2019s best interest.\" said by Victoria\n\"And if you care about his best interest, you will see that it needs to be his choice.\" said by Nikki\n\"This a bad time?\" said by Nate\n\"It\u2019s perfect timing, as usual.\" said by Victoria\n\"Nikki.

Honestly, I\u2013 I had no idea if, uh, the new-and-improved thomas would actually be any good.\" said by Thomas\n\"What do you mean?\" said by Hope\n\"Look, I\u2026 I realize this now after putting myself through therapy and digging into this stuff, but in the past, I\u2013 I took all of my frustration, my anger, and\u2013 and that\u2019s what fuelled me and made me put pen to paper. Very \u201crage against the machine,\u201d right? And, now, uh, I\u2013 I don\u2019t do that anymore and there was a time where I thought I would have no idea if what would come out would actually be of any substance, or good.\" said by Thomas\n\"Well, I don\u2019t think you have to worry, thomas, because your designs are on a whole other level now.\" said by Hope\n\"That\u2019s \u2019cause of you. You have inspired me from the beginning, but you used to inspire me in a different way, and now, you inspire me with\u2026 love. And that is what fuels me and I wake up every morning now with\u2013 with all of these designs flowing through my mind and it\u2019s like\u2013 it\u2019s a freedom that I have never experienced.\" said by Thomas\n\"Peace.\" said by Hope\n\"Exactly.\" said by Thomas\n\"I think it\u2019s evident that you have finally found peace within yourself. And it\u2019s made you not only a better designer, but a better father and a better man as well.

But there\u2019s only one way to find out you\u2019re as good as you think you are. So, I\u2019m gonna put you to the test.\" said by Deacon\n\"A test?\" said by Count boucie\n\"Yep, blind taste-test. I\u2019m gonna ask you to please leave the room, I\u2019m gonna pour three glasses of wine and I want you to tell me what region they\u2019re from.

Because what I do know is that she loved her children and that you and daniel meant everything to her. And I\u2013\" said by Diane\n\"Um, I think that\u2019s maybe my cue to speak. You know my mother, um, I don\u2019t really know if I could sum mom up in mere words. A friend of mine once described her to me as fierce. I would definitely say that that is an understatement. You know how when you\u2019re a kid, you think that your mom is the most beautiful person in the world. That\u2019s how I saw her. That\u2019s how I\u2019ll always see her. You know, this is, um\u2026 just paint and paper. Um, it resembles her. But my mom, she\u2026 she was an adventure.

It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve had a ceo of newman media with his talent.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah, I know exactly how gifted he is. You know, his instincts are remarkable. So, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he shot straight up the ladder here, you know, or somewhere else. So, it doesn\u2019t hurt that I am familiar with practically every aspect of the projects that matter most to him.\" said by Audra\n\"Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but what I\u2019m hearing right now is that if nate were promoted, or if he were poached, you would want to take his place?\" said by Victoria\n\"When I look at my son,\" said by Danny\n\"I guess I\u2019m always looking for the next challenge. Uh, but of course, this is all just hypothetical, at least for now.

I have a great deal to learn and a lot to offer, which is why I want to make myself as useful as possible.

I\u2019m excited and happy and I\u2019m looking forward to what\u2019s ahead for us in the future.\" said by Abby\n\"Well, I know exactly what you mean because after these last few months of being angry, being hurt and making bad choices, I finally feel like I\u2019m getting back to the life that I want. And that\u2019s spending time with the people that make me happy. Which means staying with chancellor-winters and lily. And making a life and a home, right here with you and dominic.

Hope was devastated. And in a twist that none of us saw coming, least of all me, she decided to forgive you and she rehired you and here we are months later. Her line is having its greatest resurgence and you are the lead designer. So, the credit goes to you.\" said by Liam\n\"Uh, thanks. But honestly, it\u2013 it doesn\u2019T.

That is what you want to do, is talk?\" said by Ridge\n\"Yeah, I do.\" said by Brooke\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Ridge\n\"You\u2019ve seen me in a lot less, ridge.\" said by Brooke\n\"Not lately.\" said by Ridge\n\"Well, thanks to thomas and his phony cps call. Sorry.\" said by Brooke\n\"No, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2013 I can\u2019t believe I thought that was real.\" said by Ridge\n\"But you did. You took off after taylor. You went to aspen and I followed.\" said by Brooke\n\"I should have just stayed and we could\u2019ve talked and figured it out.\" said by Ridge\n\"Ridge, come on.\" said by Brooke\n\"What? Why\u2013 why can\u2019t you just say it? You owe me that.\" said by Ridge\n\"Okay. I\u2019ll say whatever it is you need to hear me say so we can get through this.\" said by Brooke\n\"What I need to hear is the truth from you.\" said by Ridge\n\"I love you and I don\u2019t want to lose you and that is the truth.\" said by Brooke\n\"That\u2019s not all of it. Why can\u2019t you take some responsibility and just say it. Say it to me.\" said by Ridge\n\"Say what?\" said by Brooke\n\"Instead, I didn\u2019t say anything. I just ran. And everything changed forever.\" said by Ridge\n\"Well, I wouldn\u2019t say everything. We\u2019re here together, now. Do me a favor. Don\u2019t tell taylor about this. I mean it. Don\u2019T.\" said by Brooke\n\"Okay. Don\u2019t tell her about what? You coming down here in this little number? Is that what you mean?\" said by Ridge\n\"Yeah. That. Ah, I don\u2019t understand why you can\u2019t stay here, you know? Just seems silly\u2013\" said by Brooke\n\"Yeah.\" said by Ridge\n\"With all this love that we have between us.\" said by Brooke\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Ridge\n\"But maybe that just means we\u2019re maturing. Relating on a different level.\" said by Brooke\n\"Yeah, maybe.\" said by Ridge\n\"Yeah. So\u2026 are you gonna spend the night at eric\u2019s?\" said by Brooke\n\"I\u2013 I guess.\" said by Ridge\n\"It\u2019s probably the best thing to do.\" said by Brooke\n\"Huh?\" said by Ridge\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Brooke\n\"Oh, so this is good night now?\" said by Ridge\n\"Yep. Good night, ridge.\" said by Brooke\n\"Good night, logan.\" said by Ridge\n\"Ugh. Whenever you call me logan, oh, it just kills me.\" said by Brooke\n\"Can I, um\u2026\" said by Ridge\n\"What?\" said by Brooke\n\"Can I have my jacket back? See you.\" said by Ridge\n\"Mm.\" said by Brooke\n\"Mom.\" said by Hope\n\"What are you doing? And what are you wearing? Put that on. You\u2019re supposed to be friends with taylor. How could you? Why give your family just any eggs\" said by Hope\n\"I remember those days. My head buried in the design for hours and hours.\" said by Ridge\n\"I got all these wild ideas going on in my head. I got to get them on paper as quickly as possible.\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah. May I? Do you mind?\" said by Ridge\n\"No. Come on. Ah. It\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s coming together. It\u2019s not finished yet though.\" said by Thomas\n\"It\u2019s confident. There\u2019s boldness in your vision. It\u2019s coming out in your hand for sure.\" said by Ridge\n\"Yeah. It\u2019s like, um\u2013 it\u2019s like I\u2019m not even thinking about it. Everything\u2019s just flowing right through me onto the page.\" said by Thomas\n\"That\u2019s when you know that you got something.\" said by Ridge\n\"Yeah?\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah.\" said by Ridge\n\"Oh.\" said by Thomas\n\"Okay. No, no, no, it\u2019s all right. I just\u2013 look, it\u2019s my opinion if you think you can draw the eye a little further down, that\u2019s always a good idea, but that\u2019s up to you. It\u2019s\u2013 uh, it\u2019s yours. It\u2019s good. You\u2019re good. In the right path. Shows in your work.\" said by Ridge\n\"I really appreciate that. I can\u2019t tell you how much your support means to me. I didn\u2019t know how you were gonna react finding out that steffy just brought me back on.\" said by Thomas\n\"I didn\u2019t know either. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. I love you. Keep your head on straight. You can do anything.\" said by Ridge\n\"Hopefully, what i can do is make hope with the future\u2019s next\u2013 next line a massive success.\" said by Thomas\n\"And what about outside of work? How\u2019s that going?\" said by Ridge\n\"Um. Do you mind if I ask you the same question first? I was over at steffy\u2019s and, um, mom was there. She\u2013 she told us you had dinner with brooke. How\u2019d that go?\" said by Thomas\n\"You knew ridge was gonna be here. You, liam and the kids, you were invited to dinner, but you had other plans.\" said by Brooke\n\"It looks like you did too.\" said by Hope\n\"What are you talking about?\" said by Brooke\n\"Oh, please. Mom, I was right there. I saw it. I mean the candles, the flirting, the giggling. I mean, you wearing that. I mean, really, mom? When is it going to stop?\" said by Hope\n\"Ridge and I were just talking.\" said by Brooke\n\"Oh, please, you expect me to buy that? I mean, I have eyes, mom, and I\u2019ve seen this play out time and time again because this\u2013 this is what you do. You just jump from man to man. And the more inappropriate, the better.\" said by Hope\n\"Stop it. That is not fair.\" said by Brooke\n\"You know what is not fair? Having to put up with it for as long as I can remember. Oh, gosh. Mom, this is\u2013 this is just what you do. But I\u2013 I have not made your mistakes. No. I have a good husband and a beautiful family, and I have a great marriage. Nothing like you, mom. I\u2019m not.\" said by Hope\n\"You\u2019re concerned that brooke broke her promise to your mom. Well, she did not.\" said by Ridge\n\"Good. I mean, their bond is pretty awesome.\" said by Thomas\n\"Man, I\u2019m aware of that.\" said by Ridge\n\"But they\u2013 they\u2019ve really been there for each other, you know? And I think that mom, weird to say, but I think that she actually got brooke to see that I\u2019ve changed. You know, I think that their relationship really is a good thing.\" said by Thomas\n\"Mm-hmm. And you don\u2019t want me to mess it up.\" said by Ridge\n\"I\u2019m not\u2013 I\u2019m not the person who can go around telling people what to do. I\u2019m just\u2013 I\u2019m just asking\u2013\" said by Thomas\n\"Asking what my intentions are. I get it. Well, son, I don\u2019t know what the future holds.\" said by Ridge\n\"Me either. Think I\u2019m kind of in that same place. I\u2019m not thinking about the future. I\u2019m in the present and you know, making sure I\u2019m not turning into the person that I was in the past. I manipulated people. I hurt people and I\u2019m never gonna do that again.\" said by Thomas\n\"Glad to hear it.\" said by Ridge\n\"Believe it.\" said by Thomas\n\"I do believe it. I believe in you. I\u2019m proud of you. But it\u2019s okay to look ahead. There are possibilities.\" said by Ridge\n\"Here at work?\" said by Thomas\n\"Here at work and life. Are you dating anybody or?\" said by Ridge\n\"Uh, um, no, I don\u2019t really have time. I\u2019ve been focused on this.\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah. Okay. All right. You interested in somebody?\" said by Ridge\n\"Ah, I get it. No. Hope and I, we are\u2013 we\u2019re just working together on the line. We\u2019re co-parenting douglas and I\u2013 I just want to make sure that I earn back her trust and I\u2019m not gonna do anything to derail that.\" said by Thomas\n\"I come up here wanting to talk to you for a minute and what do I find? I find you and ridge together with you dressed like that. It\u2019s like you can\u2019t even control your impulses with them. I mean not with him, not with my dad, not with anyone.\" said by Hope\n\"Hope, you need to calm down. What is going on with you? I\u2019ve never seen you like this. Nothing happened between ridge and me, but obviously something is going on with you.\" said by ", "answer": "Brooke"}

Oh, my god. How\u2013 how was she? How did she seem?\" said by Lauren\n\"Oh, you know, same old Phyllis.

It must have been just so surreal.\" said by Lauren\n\"Well, that\u2019s one word for it. Behold, behold.\" said by Michael\n\"What?\" said by Lauren\n\"What your best pal walked in on, not to mention, myself, barely clothed.\" said by Michael\n\"This is so romantic. The candles, the flowers, and ooh, look at this. My favorite Champagne. You put a lot of effort into this.\" said by Lauren\n\"You are so worth it.\" said by Michael\n\"Ah, and then Phyllis crashes this?\" said by Lauren\n\"Yeah.

Yeah, definitely.\" said by Kyle\n\"Listen, this was something really fun that happened. No more, no less.

You mean with Cameron Kirsten? How\u2019d you hear about that?\" said by Nick\n\"Faith told me when she was letting me know that she was headed back to Michigan. Oh, my god, it\u2019s horrible. Look, I know that this might sound bad, but I\u2019m glad that he\u2019s dead.\" said by Summer\n\"That\u2019s not bad at all. Cameron meant business. He was determined to take out as many of us as possible.\" said by Nick\n\"In a sewer? I\u2013\" said by Summer\n\"It\u2019s just like his mind. Sitting over in that cell, rotting away, obsessing about Sharon.

You okay?\" said by Summer\n\"I don\u2019t know if you heard this or not, but I\u2019m taking some time away from Newman Enterprises. It\u2019s not my call, but with everything that\u2019s happened, maybe it\u2019s for the best. Also, Sally lost the baby.\" said by Nick\n\"Dad, when?\" said by Summer\n\"The day Faith got kidnapped.

Looking over her shoulder, the rest of her life is no choice.\" said by Lauren\n\"Or she could put her faith in me, which seems a no-brainer.\" said by Michael\n\"Honey, she\u2019s scared.\" said by Lauren\n\"As well she should be. Do you know what she told me? \u201cLet me think about it.\u201d Before she ate the last strawberry and vamoosed. Now, all I can do is, wait. Wait!\" said by Michael\n\"I hope she makes the right choice because I really miss my friend.\" said by Lauren\n\"Me too.

I mean, she\u2019s been through so much.\" said by Lauren\n\"That\u2019s exactly what you said. She\u2019s worried and afraid and hiding behind a big old wall of bravado.\" said by Michael\n\"Hm. That\u2019s our Phyllis.\" said by Lauren\n\"It was incredible to see her, but at the same time, uh, it was heartbreaking.\" said by Michael\n\"I wish I could go back in time and just talk her out of that insane scheme.\" said by Lauren\n\"No, no, no, listen to me. Phyllis got herself into that jam, and I intend to get her out of it, but she\u2019s gonna have to at least pay for some of her crimes. And her life will never be the same.\" said by Michael\n\"Don\u2019t be so sure. Diane played dead for many years. Came back and look at her life now.\" said by Lauren\n\"Another toast? How many is that?\" said by Diane\n\"I\u2019ve lost count.\" said by Jack\n\"That\u2019s my favorite number.\" said by Diane\n\"To your resilience. No matter what life throws you, you never let it keep you down.\" said by Jack\n\"I\u2019ll drink to that.\" said by Diane\n\"I mean that. I really do admire that you have your problems like anyone else, your insecurities, your worries, your frustrations. You never let it derail you. Not Ashley\u2019s resistance and ugliness, not Phyllis eluding the law after the abominable things she did to you.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, one thing that does worry me is that Kyle came here to sleep to get even farther away from Summer, it\u2013 it hurts my heart.\" said by Diane\n\"Yeah, mine too.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. But still, you and I had some steep mountains to climb to get to this point and I\u2013 you know, I have to hope that things will work out for them, too.\" said by Diane\n\"I really believe they will. But they may have to learn the hard way about love and forgiveness.\" said by Jack\n\"You know, we\u2019re lucky, Jack. One good thing about getting older is that we\u2019ve been around long enough to know that struggle is just a part of life.\" said by Diane\n\"Thinking about the kids again?\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. You know, you take the bad with the good and you cherish what you have when you have it. It\u2019s a lesson I failed to learn \u2019til I had lost everything. Or I should say I threw it away with both hands, but I was\u2013 I was younger then, I\u2013 I made a lot of mistakes.\" said by Diane\n\"Didn\u2019t we all?\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. But having you back in my life, it, uh, it makes me want to be better. To\u2013 to be a better person. I mean, I\u2019m so grateful for every moment that we have and I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m not taking any of it for granted.\" said by Diane\n\"I think luck, I think fate play a part in all of this. How lucky we are that life brought us back together when we could really be partners.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. I\u2019ll try not to ruin things this time.\" said by Diane\n\"No, I think we are both walking into this marriage with our eyes wide open. You are not perfect. God knows I am not perfect\u2013\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, hey, hey, hey, watch what you say about my fianc\u00e9. He\u2019s pretty perfect. Okay, can you, um, can you allow me one moment of pettiness? I take great pride in knowing that Phyllis and Ashley are still stuck in the past. They\u2019re still dwelling on old grievances. I actually feel sorry for them.\" said by Diane\n\"You know what? I don\u2019t find that petty at all. I absolutely agree.\" said by Jack\n\"You hungry? Maybe you want to order room service or go out.\" said by Kyle\n\"I have to be honest with you. I really do have a huge day tomorrow.

I want to save my family, and the abbott legacy, which, by the way, used to be jack\u2019s reason for existing until diane hijacked his brain.\" said by Ashley\n\"Do you really believe that diane is after jabot?\" said by Tucker\n\"Yes. She\u2019s not marrying jack because she loves him, she wants access to respectability, to money, to power.\" said by Ashley\n\"And jabot is her ticket?\" said by Tucker\n\"Yes, she will convince jack to give her her position that she\u2019s not qualified for, and she\u2019ll use it to claw her way to the top, which is why I\u2013 you know, as I told you, I spoke to the board.\" said by Ashley\n\"So, your idea is to weaponize the board against jack in order to save jack?\" said by Tucker\n\"Whatever.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s the only way.\" said by Ashley\n\"How\u2019s our girl?\" said by Nick\n\"She\u2019s awake, and, um, on high alert. She\u2019s snuggling with borgnine, I think he makes her feel a little safer. But now that we\u2019re back home, she\u2019s gonna try to get some sleep.\" said by Sharon\n\"This is crazy.

Why give your family just any eggs\" said by Sharon\n\"I\u2019ve already alerted ranch security. If we bring my dad in on this, it\u2019s gonna turn into a whole different situation, and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for that.\" said by Nick\n\"Well\u2026 your dad does have resources that we don\u2019t have access to.\" said by Sharon\n\"I know, but if we ask for his help, he\u2019s gonna want something in return.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, his family is in danger. He would do whatever it takes to protect them.\" said by Sharon\n\"He absolutely will, but I\u2019m telling you, he will use it as leverage to get something he wants from me, like\u2026 make me work with adam at mccall, which he\u2019s already tried to do and it\u2019s never gonna happen.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, I think you\u2019re overreacting.\" said by Sharon\n\"[ Sighs ] Am I? He hates my relationship with sally. We already have the police on this, sharon.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, you said yourself, they\u2019ve come up with nothing on cameron so far.\" said by Sharon\n\"I do hate the waiting.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, I know. You\u2019re horrible at it. Nick. If you take matters into your own hands, I don\u2019t know if we will be so lucky as we were last time. It\u2019s a miracle that we\u2019re actually still here after what went down in that plane.\" said by Sharon\n\"I know.\" said by Nick\n\"We should have worked with victor from the start last time, instead of waiting until I was framed for frank\u2019s murder. This time, we know who cameron is, we know what he\u2019s capable of, and we need to be reaching out for all the support we can get. We need your father.\" said by Sharon\n\"If I\u2019m gonna ride shotgun on this thing, we need to analyze every angle.\" said by Tucker\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Ashley\n\"Like, when things don\u2019t go according to plan. \u2018Cause jack, if nothing else, is beloved by all. Yes, he is.\" said by Tucker\n\"Mm.\" said by Ashley\n\"And it\u2019s gonna take real artistry to convince the board that he\u2019s unfit. And billy\u2019s on his side. And traci, well, she just wants to get along with everyone. What about kyle? I don\u2019t see us getting his vote. And do you want to bring abby through the ringer?\" said by Tucker\n\"Okay, okay, you\u2019re right. I know, there\u2019s parts of this plan that require some serious finessing, but nobody finesses better than you. Right?\" said by Ashley\n\"Mm-hmm. But if you\u2013 if you come at the king and you miss\u2026 jack would be lionized, he\u2019d be untouchable, and diane would be right there with him.

Not only on a personal level, but I trusted him implicitly in business. One of the few people I ever trusted, it was neil winters. Now, we can talk about a lot of his accomplishments, but one thing stands out to me as a father who\u2019s concerned about family, is how he dealt with raising devon and lily. Every parent hopes to pass on to his offspring a solid foundation with which the children who go out into the world and deal with all the slings and arrows. Often outrageous fortune. Neil did that. The fact that both devon and lily are here tonight, honoring the memory of the man who raised them, says everything about my friend.

You\u2019re my daughter. I mean, don\u2019t you wish that things could go back to how we used to be? Maybe we could just go somewhere and have some coffee and just talk. Just\u2026talk. You\u2019re the light of my life. Do I need to remind you of that? Alright, well, I\u2019m not gonna take \u201cno\u201d for an answer. I\u2019m not gonna do that. I\u2019m gonna park myself on your sofa, and I\u2019m not moving.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Come in.\" said by Victor\n\"Hi.\" said by Ashley\n\"Ashley. Thank you for coming.\" said by Victor\n\"Sure. Uh, your text was kind of vague. Why did you want to meet with me?\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah. It\u2019s a business matter. Tucker mccall came to us and made a proposal. He suggested that perhaps we would buy his company.\" said by Victor\n\"He was carrying around a serious amount of debt. He was looking to unload mccall, and then suddenly and mysteriously somebody bought up the debt.\" said by Victoria\n\"Fascinating. What does that have to do with me?\" said by Ashley\n\"We were just wondering who might have the financial wherewithal and the desire to make such a deal.\" said by Victor\n\"My mother shared a theory on who that someone might be.\" said by Victoria\n\"Who is it?\" said by Ashley\n\"You.\" said by Victor\n\"Hey.\" said by Tucker\n\"Hello.\" said by Devon\n\"Thank you for coming.\" said by Tucker\n\"Like I said on the phone, you got 30 minutes to say whatever you want to say to me. And try not to lie.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay. Yes, you made your time limit very clear. Eh. And as much as I deserve your fury, I think once you\u2019ve heard what I have to say that ultimately you\u2019ll be glad that you decided to meet with me. So, I\u2019m here with a proposition that could change your life. Want luxury hair repair that doesn\u2019t cost $50?\" said by Tucker\n\"Stark not only beat the charges, but he had the nerve to show his face in genoa city again? When did this happen? How long have you known?\" said by Kyle\n\"We only found out ourselves a couple days ago when we ran into him here, actually. And then yesterday he had a package delivered to the house.\" said by Diane\n\"What kind of package?\" said by Kyle\n\"No, it\u2019s okay. It was \u2014 it was harmless. But he clearly sent it to rattle us and send a message that he was back and that he was planning to mess with me.\" said by Diane\n\"The man is a menace. He\u2019s sending potentially dangerous packages to our home where our family lives? Can\u2019t the police do anything about this?\" said by Kyle\n\"Unfortunately, he is considered an innocent man right now. That won\u2019t last too long \u2019cause we all know he\u2019s anything but innocent. But chance knows he\u2019s back in town, knows he has an agenda, and unfortunately has lost patience with your mother and me.\" said by Jack\n\"Why is that?\" said by Kyle\n\"Stark is convinced that we are the ones that set him up, and chance appears to agree with him.\" said by Jack\n\"What are you saying? The gcpd is just going to ignore that a known criminal is in town sending potentially dangerous packages to our house?\" said by Kyle\n\"I will tell you what chance told us. The police are not going to get involved unless there is an actual threat. The package turned out to be a book, a memento of his time with diane in L.A. The police can hardly arrest him for that, and there isn\u2019t enough evidence that he\u2019s the one that put it there in the first place.\" said by Jack\n\"The man\u2019s presence is a threat.\" said by Kyle\n\"I agree. That is why security has been beefed up and they are on full alert. I assure you the abbott home is safe and secure.\" said by Jack\n\"But jack suggested that we go away in order to not be able to run into him or get caught up in any of his insidious mind games.\" said by Diane\n\"You\u2019re letting him run you out of town again.\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, honestly, i don\u2019t see it like that. And you shouldn\u2019t, either.\" said by Diane\n\"Your mother\u2019s right. We are leaving the house so that stark isn\u2019t tempted to find other ways to come at us.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, and it\u2019s not all doom and gloom. I mean, jack and I are going to use this time for ourselves, to get away from everything and celebrate our reunion.\" said by Diane\n\"Look, a little time away will give us some perspective, and maybe we\u2019ll come up with another way to handle things. But right now the jet awaits and we\u2019ve got to be going. With any luck, stark will get bored and move on while we are having a romantic getaway.\" said by Jack\n\"I appreciate your, um, well-intentioned, albeit, uh, forceful invitation, but, mom, I don\u2019t have time to have coffee. I\u2019ve got to get to the office.\" said by Summer\n\"The office? This is more important than work. Come on. It\u2019s more important than work. You only have one mom. Okay?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Mom, of course I wish things were different.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay, good, good. Okay. That\u2019s enough.\" said by Phyllis\n\"I\u2019m sorry. I just \u2014 I really don\u2019t have the time or the energy to get into it with you right now. And, you know, just so you know, I\u2019ve talked to daniel since the last time we saw each other, and he filled me in on all of the fallout from you butting into his life, too.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh. Wow. So, this is how it\u2019s gonna be? You and daniel against me, talking together, commiserating against me?\" said by Phyllis\n\"I\u2019m not gonna speak for daniel, but I can\u2019t just brush aside my feelings. You interfering with stark \u2014 that could have put us all in serious danger. And you interfering in daniel\u2019s life, both professionally and personally, could have ruined his deal with chancellor-winters and caused irreparable damage in his relationship with heather.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay, got it, got it, got it. I mean, all I\u2019m hearing from you is \u201ccould have, could have, could have.\u201d It didn\u2019t happen. It certainly didn\u2019t happen. Why do you and your brother refuse to see that?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Because it\u2019s not the point! It\u2019s not the point. Mom, this is just another example of how you choose to operate. And it doesn\u2019t matter how many times you promise that you\u2019re gonna make it right or that you\u2019re gonna change. It\u2019s really \u2014 it\u2019s actually \u2014 it\u2019s pointless. And, honestly, I just \u2014 I can\u2019t keep showing up for it.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay, this is completely unfair. Do you know that all a mother wants to do is protect her child? That\u2019s all I want to do. I want to protect you and daniel. I want to protect you from diane. I want to help daniel fix his relationship with heather, who i don\u2019t like, but I want to help him fix it and fix his relationship with his daughter. Wh\u2013 why is that wrong?\" said by Phyllis\n\"That.\" said by Summer\n\"Now, why would you think that I would buy tucker\u2019s debt? And if I did, why do you care either way?\" said by Ashley\n\"After learning that his debt had been acquired, tucker pulled out of a deal to sell mccall to newman.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh. Okay. Well, that answers why you care, but why would you think I would do such a thing?\" said by Ashley\n\"You and tucker have a long history. Maybe your scheme to get information out of him about diane \u2014 maybe it brought back some of those old feelings. Or maybe you got sentimental and you bought his story that he was a changed man.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, come on. Victoria, I\u2019m not some doe-eyed ingenue that\u2019s gonna just fall for tucker\u2019s dumb lines.\" said by Ashley\n\"She is far too smart to believe anything that tucker mccall has to say, right?\" said by Victor\n\"Exactly.\" said by Ashley\n\"And I seriously doubt she harbors any illusions about that man having changed.\" said by ", "answer": "Victor"}

Hope and i vowed to be a team at work and his parents.\" said by Thomas\n\"He must be so happy.\" said by Steffy\n\"He is.

Hope, that\u2019s great.\" said by Steffy\n\"I know. I know you know it\u2019s been really tough for me with him away.\" said by Hope\n\"Oh, yeah. I mean, I can only imagine. But I told you this is only temporary. Like, this is wonderful. Okay, so we\u2019ll\u2013 we\u2019ll reach out to the judge and we\u2019ll figure everything out.\" said by Steffy\n\"Yeah. We actually\u2013 we have a call in already.\" said by Hope\n\"Wow. Okay. Okay. So many changes around here. Speaking of changes, how does liam feel now that you\u2019re working with thomas? I\u2019m sure it took a bit of convincing.\" said by Steffy\n\"Well, he actually doesn\u2019t know yet. When asthma symptoms strike, airways narrow.\" said by Hope\n\"Well, look, I should get going. Hope\u2019s probably gonna be home soon, huh?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Yep. Maybe. Who knows? She might stay at the office and see if she can figure out how to salvage her line without thomas.\" said by Liam\n\"Look, if she can\u2019t, she\u2019ll find something else to do.

Any updates?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Okay, so what do you think? Should we take the hemline up a little bit or do you wanna leave it where it is?\" said by Thomas\n\"You know what? I think in order to show off the shoes, we should bring up the hemline in the front just a little.\" said by Hope\n\"Of course, that was, um\u2026 that was my instinct as well.\" said by Thomas\n\"Of course it was.\" said by Hope\n\"There\u2019s no doubt, you two make magic together.\" said by Petra\n\"I agree. Hope and thomas are great business partners.\" said by Steffy\n\"Look, obviously, I know you\u2019ve been struggling with the idea of hope working so closely with thomas.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Oh, I\u2019m struggling? Have I been struggling? Like I\u2019ve been struggling in school or like I struggle for the driver\u2019s test\u2013\" said by Liam\n\"I know.\" said by Wyatt\n\"That\u2019s very diplomatic of you.

Did\u2013\" said by Liam\n\"Yes.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Not technically, but that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not gonna be something. I mean, this is how thomas works, right? It\u2019s like nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. And then, oh my god, he was obsessed with hope the whole time, right? I just don\u2019t\u2013 I don\u2019t want her and douglas dealing with that again.\" said by Liam\n\"I feel for you, man. I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m sorry.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Well, don\u2019t, because that\u2019s who hope is and she\u2019s very trusting and that\u2019s one of the things I admire about her, and paradoxically, it also creates a huge blind spot, which is why I\u2019m keeping my eyes peeled in her stead. Uh, make sure nobody takes advantage of it, including and especially \u201ctom*S.\u201d\" said by Liam\n\"I\u2013 I must say, R.J. Really has talent. I mean, this is incredible.

Looking for thomas? He\u2019s in a meeting with hope and steffy.\" said by Ridge\n\"I am actually looking for thomas, but okay, fine. I\u2013 I\u2013 I love that everyone is getting along. I\u2013 I love it. The three of us, our daughters. You know what? We\u2019re finally acting like the extended family we should have been all along.\" said by Taylor\n\"Mm.\" said by Brooke\n\"Right?\" said by Taylor\n\"Yeah.\" said by Brooke\n\"I don\u2019t know. I still think maybe we should raise the waistline a little bit, you know, and make it more marketable to a broader audience?\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah. Create a better silhouette. Okay. Yeah, great. Petra, thank you so much. You have been wonderful as usual.\" said by Thomas\n\"You should see me after work. Really, though. Any time.\" said by Petra\n\"I\u2019ll remember that.\" said by Thomas\n\"Well, congratulations, both of you. Looks like hope for the future is back on track. Hopefully that will be reflected when the preorders are released today.\" said by Steffy\n\"[ Sighs ] Yeah, I\u2019m kinda nervous about that.\" said by Hope\n\"Not me. We\u2019re gonna kill it.\" said by Thomas\n\"Well, of course you aren\u2019t, you weren\u2019t here when hope for the future was in a downward spiral. And believe me when I tell you, it was not fun.

Right?\" said by Liam\n\"All right, it\u2019s okay.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Liam\n\"I think deacon\u2019s surprising a lot of people lately.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Yeah. But not hope. Because she always believed in her dad and she\u2019s all too happy to rub in our faces that she was right about him.\" said by Liam\n\"Yeah. Well, let\u2019s just hope that she\u2019s right about thomas and that he\u2019s got a handle on things. You know what I mean? But I do think it\u2019s a good idea to keep a watchful eye on him.\" said by Wyatt\n\"I went and talked to him.\" said by Liam\n\"What?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Yeah.\" said by Liam\n\"What did he say?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Uh, what did he say? What do you think he said? He\u2013 he admitted that he\u2019s made mistakes in the past but he\u2019s not that guy anymore. He\u2019s been working on himself. He\u2019s a changed man. He\u2019s definitely, definitely, definitely not obsessed with hope. And I don\u2019t have to worry. You know, it\u2019s all that.\" said by Liam\n\"So, you believe him.\" said by Wyatt\n\"You know, this is kind of like a\u2013 a dawn of a new era. Both our families standing together, supporting each other.\" said by Taylor\n\"Well, what makes me happy is that our daughters followed in our footsteps and ended their rivalry. Maybe they\u2019ll become best friends, like we are.\" said by Brooke\n\"Wouldn\u2019t that be something?\" said by Taylor\n\"It would.\" said by Brooke\n\"I guess that makes you guys trailblazers, right? Because our families are finally together and not fighting anymore.\" said by Ridge\n\"And you know what? I\u2013 I know that you don\u2019t fully believe in thomas yet, but I think in time you will. He really is in a good place.\" said by Taylor\n\"I hope he is. For your sakes, as his parents, and for\u2013 for hope, too. She has invested a lot in thomas.\" said by Brooke\n\"Hope, I\u2013 I can\u2019t tell you how much your faith and your belief in me has meant. It\u2019s incredible. After everything that I did. I hurt you and your mom and I even brought our son into it, and it\u2013 it pains me that I did that, but I did and\u2026 you somehow were able to see past that and see a future that didn\u2019t involve thomas becoming that person, but being a much better person, and you granted me this opportunity to come back and help design for this line, which I love so much and I know means so much to you. And I just\u2013 thank you for that.\" said by Thomas\n\"Thomas, you have to stop thanking me. I mean, you\u2019re doing it basically every time you put a pen to a piece of paper and create a new design. But that, that\u2019s you. That\u2019s all you. I mean, thomas, this collection wouldn\u2019t be the same without you, and we know that\u2019s the truth. Uh, look, I think those preorder numbers are in right now, so I\u2019m gonna go check on them.\" said by Hope\n\"Okay, hold on. Hold on.\" said by Thomas\n\"Okay.\" said by Hope\n\"What?\" said by Thomas\n\"You are just doing an amazing job, you really are. And I can see that you are turning your life around. Um\u2026\" said by Steffy\n\"It seems like there\u2019s a \u201cbut\u201d coming.\" said by Thomas\n\"I just watch you and hope working together. I see how devoted you are to the success of hope for the future, and I know you\u2019ve been focused on it for months, working with hope to save the line.\" said by Steffy\n\"That\u2019s the goal.\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah, but what about the personal side? I love you, thomas. So, I have to ask. Are you still fixated on hope?\" said by Steffy\n\"Listen, the fact of the matter is thomas has shown us all, more than once, how unstable he is. And I just\u2013 I don\u2019t\u2013 I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t want hope getting caught up in all the crazy.\" said by Liam\n\"But she\u2019s still, like, on the lookout, right?

And yes, I do believe in him. But if he was playing as I\u2013\" said by Taylor\n\"Which, he\u2019s done before.\" said by Liam\n\"Yeah, he has. Boy, he was good at it, wasn\u2019t he? And as good as he was at it, I am now better at spotting his tells. And he is\u2013 he is still making progress with them.\" said by Taylor\n\"I mean, yeah, that\u2019s good. That\u2013 that is good. That\u2019s a good thing. But can we\u2013 elephant in the room? Taylor, you\u2019re a psychiatrist. But in this context you\u2019re not just a psychiatrist. You\u2019re also thomas\u2019 mother. So, how\u2013\" said by Liam\n\"How could i be unbiased?\" said by Taylor\n\"Yes.\" said by Liam\n\"That is\u2013 that is a fair question. You know, um, I wouldn\u2019t be fighting so hard for thomas if I wasn\u2019t absolutely certain he\u2019d changed. You know, I\u2013 I have a lot more invested in thomas getting better than you do. He\u2019s my son.\" said by Taylor\n\"So this is about hope. What about her?\" said by Ridge\n\"It\u2019s about hope. It\u2019s about, uh, hope for the future. And\u2026 have you seen the preorder numbers?\" said by Thomas\n\"I have not.\" said by Ridge\n\"Okay. Well. They came in.\" said by Thomas\n\"Okay.\" said by Ridge\n\"And\u2026 let me see. Here you go. They exceeded our expectations.\" said by Thomas\n\"Well, this is amazing. You should be really happy.\" said by Ridge\n\"Well, hope is ecstatic.\" said by Thomas\n\"And she should be happy too, because her line\u2019s been struggling a little bit.\" said by Ridge\n\"Uh, well, you know, a lot has changed since then.\" said by Thomas\n\"Really? The only thing that\u2019s changed is she has a new lead designer.\" said by Ridge\n\"Yeah. And I\u2013 I\u2019m really lucky to be here.\" said by Thomas\n\"Luck has nothing to do with it. You did the work. You worked on yourself. You worked on your craft, and\u2026 here we are. Son, I am so proud of you.\" said by Ridge\n\"You should be proud of hope too.\" said by Thomas\n\"Okay. I\u2019m so proud of her too. She did what she did to save her line. She did everything she had to.\" said by Ridge\n\"It\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s not just that, though. It\u2019s not just her doing what she had to. Like, she, she\u2026 after everything I did, she\u2026 was able to forgive me and that\u2019S\u2026\" said by Thomas\n\"That\u2019s what she does. She gives second chances. It\u2019s nice.\" said by Ridge\n\"It\u2019s not just what someone does. This is\u2026 after everything I did, that\u2019s a new level of forgiveness. And I, I don\u2019t know. Look, I\u2026 me being back, it can affect her marriage with liam.\" said by Thomas\n\"I think they\u2019re fine.\" said by Ridge\n\"Maybe they are, but liam doesn\u2019t trust me. He doesn\u2019t have any reason\u2013\" said by Thomas\n\"What are you doing right now? What is this? You should be over the moon. You just showed me these numbers. You should be doing backflips. Instead, you\u2019re standing here doing\u2026 this. What\u2019s going on?\" said by Ridge\n\"Misbehaving? Steffy, this\u2013 this is an overreaction. You are reading too much into what you saw.\" said by Hope\n\"Am I? I want to believe that\u2019s the case.\" said by Steffy\n\"It is.\" said by Hope\n\"I hope to god it is. I hope you\u2019re being honest with me and yourself. Thomas has been acting like a gentleman. He has been behaving himself. He has not crossed any lines with you. He is making strides in his life.\" said by Steffy\n\"I know that. I have seen the work that he has done. I believe that he is a changed man.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah, he\u2019s been fighting those demons and he\u2019s winning. Why can\u2019t you be sensitive to that?\" said by Steffy\n\"I am. I am proud of him, steffy.\" said by Hope\n\"Really? Because what I just walked in on, what I just saw, was you laying it on thick. You flirting with my brother. Saying all the things that you were saying, looking into his eyes, and caressing his hands. You were flirting with him. Wow, I can\u2019t even believe I am saying this. Are you actually turning into your mother? My a1c was up here; now, it\u2019s down with rybelsus.\" said by Steffy\n\"Has anyone ever told you you worry too much?\" said by Thomas\n\"All the time. I\u2019m not worried about you. Not anymore.\" said by Ridge\n\"Really? You mean that?\" said by Thomas\n\"Oh, I mean that. It\u2019s who you are. You, you did it. You fixed whatever the problem was. And you\u2019re back. You\u2019re a great father to your son. Your skills are improving all the time. And I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve said it, and I\u2019m gonna say it again. I\u2019m gonna keep repeating it. I am so proud of you.\" said by Ridge\n\"You know I\u2019m actually kind of proud of me too.\" said by Thomas\n\"Good! You should be! Because you earned this.\" said by Ridge\n\"I, I appreciate that. I, um, I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\" said by Thomas\n\"So where is hope? I want to congratulate her too.\" said by Ridge\n\"She\u2019s over in the design office.\" said by Thomas\n\"She has to be so impressed with you.\" said by Ridge\n\"Yeah. You know, dad, um\u2026 I\u2013 I\u2019m glad that hope has brought herself to forgiving me and, and the rest of the family is moving in that direction, but\u2026 it means the world to me that you are willing to give me another chance, and\u2013 and forgive me. And\u2026 I promise, I know that I\u2019ve\u2013 I\u2019ve done some dark things in the past, but, um\u2026 I am never gonna become that person again. You have my word.\" said by Thomas\n\"I do actually appreciate your concern for hope. I do.\" said by Liam\n\"Well, I appreciate hope\u2019s capacity for forgiveness. She didn\u2019t have to allow thomas to come back to be her lead designer, but she did.\" said by Taylor\n\"Yeah. But she also didn\u2019t forget about all the things that he\u2019s done in the past, like none of us have.\" said by Liam\n\"No, but\u2026 she was willing to trust that thomas wouldn\u2019t revert to his old ways. And he hasn\u2019T.\" said by Taylor\n\"Yet. That we know of. That doesn\u2019t mean he hasn\u2019t or couldn\u2019T. And if that does happen\u2013\" said by ", "answer": "Liam"}

She\u2019s looking for answers that just aren\u2019t there and because she can\u2019t find them in real life, she\u2019s making them up in her head.

Can I ask you though, what are you doing here? Shouldn\u2019t you be out looking for stark\u2019s killer?\" said by Summer\n\"It\u2019s not supposed to be public knowledge yet. Yeah, I guess word must be getting out that his death wasn\u2019t an accident.\" said by Chance\n\"Hard to keep that kind of thing quiet.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah. Well, I am just consulting on this case. His body was found in pheasant lake. It\u2019s outside my jurisdiction.\" said by Chance\n\"You\u2019ll know more about stark than anyone in that area.

I don\u2019t just pop up random places, whip out a magnifying glass like sherlock holmes.\" said by Chance\n\"From what I\u2019ve seen, your method is usually to watch. The brooding look in your eye.

You know, I mean, I\u2019m mad about what happened to mom too, but summer, she\u2019s got some serious rage and it\u2019s not helping her cope with the loss.\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, I mean, there\u2019s no right way to grieve or to help someone through it.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah. More than anything, I just want for my sister to be okay.

You know, you need each other right now. You\u2019re going through the same thing.\" said by Lily\n\"We both want mom back so bad. We\u2019re both seeing her in our dreams. And now summer is seeing her while she\u2019s awake.\" said by Daniel\n\"Look, the mind is a powerful thing. It makes sense that you would wanna try to undo her death somehow.\" said by Lily\n\"Unfortunately, that\u2019s not happening.\" said by Daniel\n\"No, but it doesn\u2019t stop the heart from wishing that it was.\" said by Lily\n\"Can\u2019t argue with that.\" said by Daniel\n\"Look, I know from experience that losing someone is soul crushing. And it\u2019s not gonna go away for a long time.

When were you gonna tell me what you\u2019ve been hiding?\" said by Kyle\n\"Jack, I really hope that just because diane is not declared a murderer doesn\u2019t mean that she won\u2019t send your life down to rack and ruin.\" said by Victor\n\"Oh, victor, I am far too happy with diane\u2019s freedom and jabot\u2019s latest profit projections to let you get to me today.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, isn\u2019t that nice?\" said by Victor\n\"And you know me, I\u2019m not one to pat myself on the back, but I will take some credit for the profit margins off the men\u2019s product line. You know the one that you dropped the ball on, adam?\" said by Billy\n\"You must be very proud. Grooming products for men. It\u2019s like you\u2019re starting a revolution, billy.\" said by Adam\n\"We are shooting for the moon these days, adam. With billy by my side and diane free and happy, nothing\u2019s stopping us.\" said by Jack\n\"Do me a favor, jack and just keep diane jenkins grubby hands away from my wife\u2019s jewelry. That would be a move in the right direction.\" said by Victor\n\"On that note?\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah.\" said by Jack\n\"Enjoy your breakfast.\" said by Adam\n\"Thank you.\" said by Billy\n\"Okay. You two are good to relax now. I got an officer taking your cat in for examination. Two others searching the property. I would like to ask you a couple questions.\" said by Chance\n\"You guys okay?\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2019m fine. Just a little shaken up, that\u2019s all.\" said by Faith\n\"Yeah, me too, but we\u2019re gonna be fine, okay? We\u2019ll be all right.\" said by Sharon\n\"What happened?\" said by Nick\n\"Faith was on her way to the tack house when she found the cat that she brought home from college just laying on the front doorstep, dead.\" said by Sharon\n\"Poor borgnine.\" said by Faith\n\"Do you know how old the cat was or if he had any signs of illness?\" said by Chance\n\"I don\u2019t know his exact age, but he was in good health. I took him to the vet right before I left for break. He had all his shots and a full exam.\" said by Faith\n\"Okay. Well, we\u2019re gonna get our forensics team to examine him, see if we can find out exactly what happened, okay?\" said by Chance\n\"That\u2019s good. But I\u2019m pretty sure I know what those results are gonna say.\" said by Nick\n\"So do I. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind about what happened, nick. This was cameron\u2019s doing.\" said by Sharon\n\"That bastard could still be on the ground somewhere.\" said by Nick\n\"We got that covered. Don\u2019t worry about it.\" said by Chance\n\"I\u2019m gonna go find him myself.\" said by Nick\n\"There\u2019s no need. I got a full team searching the property. Let the professionals handle it.\" said by Chance\n\"Nobody knows this property better than me. I know where to look.\" said by Nick\n\"Nick. Nick!\" said by Chance\n\"So, what\u2019s up?\" said by Billy\n\"You sound suspicious.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, something\u2019s going on. I can tell by the way you were grandstanding with victor. Not everything is perfect right now, is it?\" said by Billy\n\"We have had our share of triumphs lately, but there has been a recent very troubling development.\" said by Jack\n\"What is that?\" said by Billy\n\"I assume you haven\u2019t spoken with ashley recently?\" said by Jack\n\"No, not lately. Why?\" said by Billy\n\"She made quite an announcement last night at the house.\" said by Jack\n\"Good news? Bad news?\" said by Billy\n\"She and tucker are planning on getting married as soon as possible.\" said by Jack\n\"Just so you know, tucker, I happen to have had private meetings with nate up in my own suite.\" said by ", "answer": "Audra"}
{"content": "\"Look, I am not saying this to spread rumors or talk badly about hope.\" said by Steffy\n\"I don\u2019t think you are, it\u2019s just not true.\" said by Liam\n\"You say things feel weird when hope and thomas are together.\" said by Steffy\n\"Yeah, but not like that.\" said by Liam\n\"I\u2019m just telling you what I saw.\" said by Steffy\n\"No, what you\u2019re doing is trying to protect your brother.\" said by Liam\n\"Yes, I am. He has dedicated himself to writing his life, regaining our trust, and I\u2019m not gonna let anyone interfere with that. So, if you have any concerns about hope and thomas, if you have any suspicions, it\u2019s not because of thomas. I think it\u2019s hope. It\u2019s hope.\" said by Steffy\n\"Okay. So, if we incorporate the belt design, then that would draw the attention down. What do you think? Hope?\" said by Thomas\n\"Hm. What? Oh.\" said by Hope\n\"This is just\u2013 isn\u2019t working at all, is it?\" said by Thomas\n\"There are individual elements that, uh, I like, but it\u2019s just not gelling together for some reason and I\u2019m just too tired to figure it out right now.\" said by Hope\n\"Are you, um, are you still thinking about your phone call with liam?\" said by Thomas\n\"Yes. I mean, he knows we\u2019re working on this collection and yes, there are going to be some late nights, but I just don\u2019t\u2013 like, there\u2019s no reason for him to get so upset and practically hang up on me.\" said by Hope\n\"You know, I\u2013 I\u2019m not sure who\u2019s more hurt about this, my son or me.\" said by Taylor\n\"Taylor.\" said by Brooke\n\"Hm.\" said by Taylor\n\"Hope didn\u2019t mean to hurt either one of you and neither did I. And if we knew that thomas was gonna overhear that conversation\u2013\" said by Brooke\n\"She still would\u2019ve said all those awful things about thomas.\" said by Taylor\n\"No, you don\u2019t understand. She was trying to make a point. She was trying to get through to me by going overboard.\" said by Brooke\n\"Why was she going overboard? I\u2013 are you\u2013 are you saying\u2013 are you saying that she didn\u2019t mean it?\" said by Taylor\n\"No, not the way it sounded. Really, she feels terrible.\" said by Brooke\n\"It\u2019s still doesn\u2019t make any sense. Why would hope feel the need to reassure you that nothing\u2019s going on? You must think that there is.\" said by Taylor\n\"Okay.\" said by Taylor\n\"Uh, look, let\u2019s sit for a second. I really don\u2019t want this to cause tension between us. I don\u2019T. I mean, hope already talked to thomas and she apologized.\" said by Brooke\n\"Yes and thomas graciously accepted her apology and they\u2013 they put it behind them.\" said by Taylor\n\"Okay. Well, maybe you and I can do the same thing.\" said by Brooke\n\"Yeah. Yeah, we can. We can. But first, I just\u2013 I just need to understand, um, why hope would say those things for your benefit? Because it\u2013 it\u2013 it\u2013 it doesn\u2019t make sense to me. Why would she say that unless you thought something was going on, which means there\u2019s something that you\u2019re not sharing with me. What is it?\" said by Taylor\n\"I\u2019m trying to be understanding. I\u2019m sensitive to liam\u2019s feelings.\" said by Hope\n\"You\u2019ve always taken his concerns seriously.\" said by Thomas\n\"Thank you. I mean, it\u2019s like no matter how many times I reassure him about us, he still opposes us working together. And it\u2019s just\u2013 it\u2019s exhausting. I have plans. I\u2013 I have things that I want to accomplish and it would be nice if my husband supported me in that and instead it\u2019s like he\u2019s just looking for something to go wrong. And it\u2019s just\u2013 it\u2019s wearing me down.\" said by Hope\n\"So what does that even mean? Hope\u2019s the problem. What does that mean?\" said by Liam\n\"It could explain why you\u2019re feeling so anxious and uncomfortable that you don\u2019t believe me.\" said by Steffy\n\"It\u2019s not even that. It\u2019s just what you\u2019re saying doesn\u2019t make sense.\" said by Liam\n\"It doesn\u2019t make sense if you continue to blame thomas. Liam, I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t wanna hurt you, but I can\u2019t allow you to continue blaming thomas for your wife\u2019s feelings.\" said by Steffy\n\"For thomas. You\u2019re\u2013 you\u2019re\u2013 you\u2019re saying hope has feelings for thomas.\" said by Liam\n\"Yeah, she does.\" said by Steffy\n\"Taylor, come on. You\u2019ve gotta believe me. Hope feels awful about this. And so do I. And she is genuinely sorry for everything that she said.\" said by Brooke\n\"For your benefit. Are you really that worried about hope\u2019s marriage that\u2013 that she had to absolutely trash my son in order to reassure you?\" said by Taylor\n\"Well, actually, I am worried about their marriage. This has been a struggle for liam.\" said by Brooke\n\"Sounds like a liam problem to me. This has nothing to do with thomas. Nothing at all. There\u2019s no reason that\u2013 that hope should have gone after him the way that she did. I am so tired of having to constantly defend my son to everyone. I really am, but I will continue to do it until you and liam and everyone else realize that my son is not a threat. Especially not to hope and liam\u2019s marriage.\" said by Taylor\n\"I just want liam to respect my decision.\" said by Hope\n\"To work with me?\" said by Thomas\n\"Well, and to save the line and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing here. All these late nights and long hours. I mean, we\u2019re giving this line our all.\" said by Hope\n\"I don\u2019t think he wants to stand in the way of that.\" said by Thomas\n\"Well, he clearly doesn\u2019t trust me.\" said by Hope\n\"I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\" said by Thomas\n\"That\u2019s how it feels.\" said by Hope\n\"It\u2019s me that he doesn\u2019t trust.\" said by Thomas\n\"Mm-mm. He clearly doesn\u2019t trust my judgment and that is what is frustrating. He doesn\u2019t think I know what\u2019s best for me.\" said by Hope\n\"He\u2019s just being a little protective, okay? He\u2019s not doubtful of you. He\u2019s devoted to you and everyone knows that you\u2019re committed to him.\" said by Thomas\n\"The\u2013 the\u2013 so the\u2013 here\u2019s the thing. There\u2013 there is nobody more generous and\u2013 and\u2013 and forgiving than hope. So\u2013 so maybe you\u2019re just picking up on the fact that she cares genuinely about everyone, including thomas.\" said by Liam\n\"Hope\u2019s feelings might go beyond that. Liam, you need to understand things have changed.\" said by Steffy\n\"I don\u2019t know what that means, steffy. Changed how? Like what? Did something happen?\" said by Liam\n\"I saw it. They were working in the office. Hope thought they were alone and it was the way she was looking at him, touching him. The feeling she has for him are obvious. I\u2019m not making this up. I saw with my own eyes.\" said by Steffy\n\"You know, I\u2013 I think I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m just\u2013 I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m feeling angry right now. Disappointed maybe that you\u2019ve kept how\u2013 how you feel about thomas from me because brooke I\u2013 I thought that we had a\u2013 a\u2013 a real friendship.\" said by Taylor\n\"We do.\" said by Brooke\n\"Hm. I\u2013 I can\u2019t help it because this whole thing is making my mind race. I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m wondering, you know, if you\u2013 if you\u2019re keeping all of this from me, what else are you keeping from me? So, is there anything else I deserve to know? Anything happen with ridge?\" said by Taylor\n\"What? No.\" said by Brooke\n\"All right. I just had to ask.\" said by Taylor\n\"I don\u2019t wanna be at odds with you. Can\u2019t we just drop this?\" said by Brooke\n\"Yeah. Yep. Yep. We can drop it. I think it would just\u2013 it would help a lot if, uh, if you could just believe in thomas.\" said by Taylor\n\"Uh, yeah. Well, I guess I have some thinking to do.\" said by Brooke\n\"Yeah.\" said by Taylor\n\"But the last thing I would want is for this situation to cause permanent damage.\" said by Brooke\n\"So, this isn\u2019t working either?\" said by Thomas\n\"Oh, it\u2019s just\u2013 it\u2019s me. I\u2013 I can\u2019t focus right now.\" said by Hope\n\"No, it sucks. Look, I\u2019ll\u2013 I\u2019ll keep working at it and I\u2019ll\u2013 I\u2019ll get back to you with any changes.\" said by Thomas\n\"No, I thought we could fix this together, but clearly I can\u2019t fix anything right now.\" said by Hope\n\"Okay. Wait, hold on. We\u2019ll just\u2013 we\u2019ll take another crack at it in the morning.\" said by Thomas\n\"Oh, we need to get this done now.\" said by Hope\n\"You can\u2019t\u2013 you can\u2019t force it, hope.\" said by Thomas\n\"Okay. All right. You know what? Fine, fine. I\u2019m still upset. I\u2019m upset. I\u2019m upset because liam is treating you unfairly. You\u2013 you\u2019ve done nothing, but\u2013 but try to prove yourself and\u2013 and you\u2019ve been understanding and respectful and it\u2019s just\u2013\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah, look, after everything that I\u2019ve done in the past, I sort of understand him being on guard.\" said by Thomas\n\"I get that, but how long do you have to keep proving yourself for? I mean, what? That has to go on forever? You shouldn\u2019t have to defend yourself.\" said by Hope\n\"I don\u2019t know. Look, it doesn\u2019t bother me that much talking about my past. It\u2019s what\u2019s made me into the person I am and I\u2019m kinda proud of the\u2013 the changes I\u2019ve made.\" said by Thomas\n\"Then you are a bigger, better person than me because I am tired of justifying myself or my choices or what I choose to do in my career and quite frankly, I\u2019m tired of it. And you know what, thomas? I\u2019ve had enough. So, I\u2019m going to go home and I\u2019m going to clear this up with liam once and for all.\" said by Hope\n\"You\u2019re wrong, steffy. You\u2019re wrong. I\u2019m sorry.\" said by Liam\n\"It\u2019s what I saw.\" said by Steffy\n\"Yeah. Well, then what you saw doesn\u2019t mean what you think it does. I made the exact same mistake when\u2013 when hope fell off that pedestal, when thomas caught her. I thought I was walking in on something, like something was going on, but\u2013 but it wasn\u2019T. And it isn\u2019T.\" said by ", "answer": "Liam"}

I am basing this off of declining sales and I don\u2019t want my grandfather and zende splitting their focus on your line and couture.\" said by Steffy\n\"Hope for the future is more than just a clothing line, steffy. It is about the communities that it reaches out to.

How important it\u2019s been to the success of forrester creations. Unfortunately, we\u2019ve hit\u2026 some crossroads. It\u2019s time to decide what will become of hope for the future.

I kind of thought you were saving it for our anniversary.\" said by Liam\n\"Saving it for a special occasion. Which this is. A toast. To what really matters. I\u2013 I know I have been pretty focused on work lately, but at the end of the day, nothing matters more to me than this family. My handsome husband. Our beautiful children. This house that we\u2019ve made a home. So, here\u2019s to us.\" said by Hope\n\"To us.\" said by Liam\n\"Honey, what\u2019s going on? Hmm? A situation at work? Is it something I can help with?\" said by Finn\n\"No. But it\u2019s really sweet of you to offer. And I\u2019m not entirely sure if it\u2019s even a situation or\u2026 maybe I\u2019m reading too much into it. God, I hope so, because there\u2019s so much riding on the line.\" said by Steffy\n\"A while ago you were worried about hope for the future. And whether or not thomas should work on the line again. Does this have anything to do with that? With hope and your brother?\" said by Finn\n\"Yeah.\" said by Steffy\n\"Hope and I are doing really well now. As co-parents, as coworkers. I mean, look, we\u2019ve got a strong and solid and platonic relationship.\" said by Thomas\n\"And you\u2019ve accepted that\u2019s just all it\u2019s ever gonna be?\" said by R.J.\n\"Yeah. Look, I\u2013 I get it. She\u2019s your sister. You\u2019re protective. I know exactly how that feels. You love her.\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah, of course. I mean, she\u2019s amazing. She deserves the best.\" said by R.J.\n\"She does.\" said by Thomas\n\"You thought that was you for a long time, didn\u2019t you, thomas?\" said by R.J.\n\"Look, I came back from new york and I was a single dad. I\u2013 I didn\u2019t know how to fill my son\u2019s life and\u2013 and\u2013 and he needed a mother and he connected with hope. And it was a beautiful thing and she really, really filled that role in his life. And for that I will always love her.\" said by Thomas\n\"I get it. Hope is a very caring, kind person. But she\u2019s married to someone else now, thomas.\" said by R.J.\n\"I get that. And I didn\u2019t respect that marriage in the past. I did a lot of things that hurt a lot of people. Especially in our family and\u2026 I don\u2019t know how, but at some point, I was able to earn back some of their forgiveness. I don\u2019t think I deserve it. But I think I finally got to the point where I realize in myself, I\u2013 I\u2019m not that person anymore. So, I can promise you, hope and her marriage to liam, they have nothing to worry about.\" said by Thomas\n\"I hope you know\u2026 how much this means to me. How you\u2019ve invested in us, I-in our marriage. Um, \u2019cause I admit, I\u2013 you know, I was worried when you said that you would work with thomas again. I just kind of assumed it would put a strain on the relationship, especially with you spending the majority of your time at\u2013 at the office. But, you know\u2013\" said by Liam\n\"Liam, can we\u2013\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah?\" said by Liam\n\"\u2014 Maybe not talk about thomas? Tonight is supposed to be about us.\" said by Hope\n\"Yes. Yes. That\u2019s way better, way better topic. Us. Uh, um, much more interesting.\" said by Liam\n\"Yeah. And, uh, sexier, too.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah. Yeah.\" said by Liam\n\"So, this problem weighing on you, it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s about hope for the future, isn\u2019t it?\" said by Finn\n\"Not only is my husband incredibly sexy, he is very perceptive. I\u2013 no, seriously, you are, like, the smartest man I know.\" said by Steffy\n\"So, that means I\u2019m right.\" said by Finn\n\"The line is doing well.

I\u2019m the one who forced us into court.\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah, and douglas chose to go live with steffy.\" said by Hope\n\"Right, because he didn\u2019t want to be caught in the middle between us.

Well, what do you think?\" said by Taylor\n\"It\u2019s the right move. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have suggested it. Hope and thomas are a great team. She needs to have him back on her line. But it is\u2013 it\u2019s complicated because if he does come back on board, I have to wonder. How\u2019s liam gonna react? Is he gonna be okay with it?\" said by Steffy\n\"Listen, I\u2019m all for second chances, but not everybody deserves one.

I just wanted my parents to be together.

You\u2019ve hurt me. You\u2019ve hurt douglas. And you\u2019ve hurt your own family. And look, I get that today, that this\u2013 this whole thing was not some setup, that you are telling the truth.\" said by Hope\n\"I am.\" said by Thomas\n\"So what am\u2013 what am I supposed to do, thomas? How am I supposed to believe you again? I mean, do you really want things to be different?\" said by Hope\n\"Yes.\" said by Thomas\n\"You know, I think it\u2019s a good sign that\u2013 that hope and thomas are still in there talking.\" said by Taylor\n\"Maybe. But this isn\u2019t a simple yes or no for hope. As much as she wants to save her line, having thomas back might be a non-starter. For many reasons.\" said by Steffy\n\"Yeah, liam probably being the biggest one.\" said by Taylor\n\"Oh, yes, he is very protective of hope and their family.\" said by Steffy\n\"Yeah, he certainly wouldn\u2019t encourage hope to say yes.\" said by Taylor\n\"Oh, god, I can\u2019t imagine that happening.\" said by Steffy\n\"But if hope did say yes\u2026 I think it might cause some problems in their marriage.\" said by Taylor\n\"I just, I don\u2019t get it. Why would you want to be with someone you know you can\u2019t trust?\" said by Liam\n\"I told you. No one betrays me.\" said by Bill\n\"What makes you think sheila won\u2019t try? Because she values her freedom? That\u2019s self-preservation. That\u2019s not loyalty. The\u2013 everything you\u2019ve given to this woman, good god! I mean, you\u2019ve protected her, you\u2019ve given her run of the house, you\u2013 you have prioritized her over everyone. Everyone in your life. What\u2019s the end game here, dad?

When you have chronic kidney disease.\" said by Deacon\n\"You understand where I\u2019m coming from?\" said by Hope\n\"You have every reason to be skeptical, but I have been working on myself. I am actually working with a professional now. Not just my mom, as\u2013 as great as she is, but someone who\u2019s purely objective. Like you\u2013 you remember, just before I made this last mistake, that we were working so well together! And I hope we can again.\" said by Thomas\n\"You are asking me to take a very big risk here.\" said by Hope\n\"I am, but I promise, I will not let you down.\" said by Thomas\n\"Come in!\" said by Hope\n\"Sorry to interrupt, but if you two are gonna take a while, I need my tablet.\" said by Steffy\n\"So, um\u2026 any news?\" said by Taylor\n\"Well, she hasn\u2019t turned me down yet.\" said by Thomas\n\"That\u2019s good. I\u2019m not trying to put pressure on you, but I\u2019m gonna have to take action on hope for the future. If it\u2019s not gonna happen, I need to know.\" said by Steffy\n\"Uh, look, I\u2019m still trying to wrap my head around all this. I was not expecting this today. But thomas, the point you made earlier about douglas and how much it would mean to our son to see us working well together? I mean, something to consider.\" said by Hope\n\"He\u2013 he loves coming here and watching you both work together.\" said by Taylor\n\"Yeah, he does, and he would be thrilled. But there are other, uh, outside factors to consider. This decision will affect your family, especially liam. So, if you are willing to bring thomas back on board at hope for the future, how do you think liam will react to this?\" said by Steffy\n\"You\u2019ve been telling everybody that sheila carter\u2019s the love of your life, but is that even true? Or are you just doing this to get a reaction? To prove that you don\u2019t need anyone, and you can bend the whole world to your will? I mean, be honest, is that why you started wearing the sword necklace again? Just to show what you\u2019re capable of? That you can do things that mere mortals just can\u2019t? Like taming sheila carter?\" said by Liam\n\"I didn\u2019t tame her.\" said by Bill\n\"Well, good, I\u2019m glad you recognize that, \u2019cause she\u2019s a lunatic and she can\u2019t be controlled.\" said by Liam\n\"Neither can I.\" said by Bill\n\"There you are. That\u2019s my dad. That\u2019s the dollar bill spencer we all know and love.

Pretending like\u2013 like we don\u2019t know you, like we couldn\u2019t possibly understand this bizarre relationship you have, with\u2013 with sheila. Like\u2013 like, you\u2019re giving us all the cold shoulder. I get why you would be fed up! I get why you would be tired of being rejected and lectured. You\u2019re the boss. You\u2019re the one who makes the rules, and here you are, and you\u2019re back in control, and there is nothing that any of us can do about it. Is that what this is? Is this just dollar bill spencer flexing his muscles? I don\u2019t think so! I wish it were true, but\u2026 you wouldn\u2019t throw everything away just to prove a point. You\u2019re more pragmatic than that. Sheila matters, I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know why.\" said by Liam\n\"Oh!\" said by Deacon\n\"Me, too. To just hold you in my arms again, even\u2013 even if I can\u2019t stay.\" said by Sheila\n\"We\u2019re just gonna have to make the most of the time we have.\" said by Deacon\n\"Oh, god. Oh.\" said by Sheila\n\"You are crazy. I never met a woman like you before. Hi, I\u2019m katie, I\u2019ve lost 110 pounds\" said by Deacon\n\"I imagine you\u2019ll want to talk to liam if you\u2019re considering working with thomas again.\" said by Steffy\n\"Oh. Yep, that is definitely a discussion that will need to happen.\" said by Hope\n\"So, you\u2019re not ruling it out?\" said by Thomas\n\"Thomas, this is a big decision that affects many people in my life, and while yes, there is douglas to consider, there is also my mom, and liam, and they are going to have some very strong opinions on the matter.\" said by Hope\n\"But they know how much hope for the future means to you, so.\" said by ", "answer": "Taylor"}

We can go back to our lives as normal.\" said by Diane\n\"I know you\u2019re expecting a pat on the back, but I\u2019m still not happy about how all this went down.\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, I\u2019ve explained to you \u2014\" said by Jack\n\"No, you changed the plan at the last second, adding a ton of risk.\" said by Kyle\n\"The risk of any complications at this point are very slim.\" said by Jack\n\"You hope.\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, now that Jeremy has violated his parole and committed this new crime, he will go back to prison.\" said by Diane\n\"Can you guarantee that? I mean, do we even know how good his lawyer is? What if he has a solid alibi for the time of the burglary?\" said by Summer\n\"It was still worth the risk. Look, I had to do this. Diane was continuing this charade with Stark and getting in more and more danger. Look, the only way this would work is if we moved fast. And we managed to protect the entire family.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Sighs ] You also broke more laws and you lied to the police. I\u2019m sorry, but are we really supposed to be happy about that?\" said by Summer\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Diane\n\"Is everything okay?\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah. Yeah. I\u2019m just thinking about a case. Nikki and Victor\u2019s apartment in Chicago was broken into.\" said by Chance\n\"[ Gasps ] What?\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah.\" said by Chance\n\"Is everyone okay?\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah. No one was there at the time. A necklace was taken, though.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, if this happened out of the state, why were you involved?\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, the perp is a man named Jeremy Stark. He\u2019s a paroled ex-con, and he has connections to certain people here in Genoa City, most notably Diane Jenkins.\" said by Chance\n\"[ Gasps ] You know, there\u2019s been a lot of speculation about what she was doing those years in California.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, because Stark was staying here, Chicago PD reached out for assistance. He\u2019s considered a flight risk, so they wanted him picked up ASAP. So I went to the hotel, searched his room, arrested him, and took him back to Chicago.\" said by Chance\n\"And when did this happen?\" said by Sharon\n\"Last night.\" said by Chance\n\"Did he have the necklace?\" said by Sharon\n\"Yep. Along with other evidence in the room that linked him to the crime.\" said by Chance\n\"Sounds pretty cut and dried.\" said by Sharon\n\"Doesn\u2019t it, though?\" said by Chance\n\"Except something\u2019s not sitting right with you.\" said by Sharon\n\"No, it\u2019s not.\" said by Chance\n\"Hey, son. I\u2019m looking for Kyle.\" said by Victor\n\"Why?\" said by Adam\n\"What do you mean, why? To finish the discussion about Summer and Harrison.\" said by Victor\n\"No, you\u2019re not.\" said by Adam\n\"What do you mean, I\u2019m not?\" said by Victor\n\"After I saw you at Society with your heads together, you already admitted that I was the topic du jour.\" said by Adam\n\"You were mentioned in passing, son.\" said by Victor\n\"You know, when we were talking, you actually said you were interested in how I\u2019m doing here at Jabot. So, why don\u2019t you level with me for once and just tell me what is really going on?\" said by Adam\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Sally\n\"Good morning!\" said by Chloe\n\"Mnh, no, it isn\u2019t.\" said by Sally\n\"Wow. This pregnancy is really laying you out today.\" said by Chloe\n\"Oh, my god. Morning sickness is no joke. Does everyone feels this bad?\" said by Sally\n\"I did. Every time. And I think with Bella, it was worse. But I got through it, and so will you, which is why I brought some tried-and-true remedies that worked for me when I was pregnant. And hopefully they\u2019ll get you back on your feet in time for this meeting with Jill so you look a little less\u2026green.\" said by Chloe\n\"Oh, my god, I cannot believe I feel this rotten, on today of all days. We\u2019ve been working so hard on this pitch.\" said by Sally\n\"You are tough. You can do this. I know you can.\" said by Chloe\n\"Hey, Sally, it\u2019s me!\" said by Nick\n\"[ Sighing ]\" said by Sally\n\"I know that Diane\u2019s been trying really hard to make a fresh start, so to have this guy show up from her past and threaten all that\u2026\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, Stark\u2019s a bad guy. There\u2019s no question there. I mean, the guy just got paroled after serving 6 years of a 10-year sentence for large-scale money laundering. He\u2019s never been charged with burglary, though. There we are.\" said by Chance\n\"So, it\u2019s his change in M.O. that\u2019s giving you pause?\" said by Sharon\n\"I mean, the pieces fit. You know, on paper, this is a solid arrest, and everybody in Chicago seems satisfied.\" said by Chance\n\"But you don\u2019t.\" said by Sharon\n\"I don\u2019t like how easily all this fell into place. I don\u2019t like that he only took one piece of jewelry, either.\" said by Chance\n\"You know, you\u2019re right. If you\u2019re gonna go to the trouble, why not haul off with everything you can carry?\" said by Sharon\n\"Exactly. And also, why Nikki Newman, hmm? What\u2019s the connection there?\" said by Chance\n\"She\u2019s wealthy and high-profile. Presumably, there\u2019d be a lot there worth stealing.\" said by Sharon\n\"On the way to Chicago, Stark was ranting the whole time about Diane and Jack Abbott. He said they framed him for something he didn\u2019t do to run him out of town. Now, normally, I wouldn\u2019t pay any attention to this, right? Every crook\u2019s innocent. Everyone\u2019s being framed. Everyone has an excuse. But there was something in this guy\u2019s voice. It was like a \u2014 a certain bitterness. I don\u2019t know. It just keeps eating away at me. On top of which, this whole thing feels contrived. It reminds me of when I was dealing with the Newmans after Locke\u2019s death. And everyone has an explanation for everything, all neat and pat.\" said by Chance\n\"I can understand why you\u2019re concerned. It does all sound a bit convenient.\" said by Sharon\n\"Hey, let\u2019s be honest here. Jeremy Stark was a genuine threat to all of us. We had to eradicate him from our lives as quickly as possible.\" said by Jack\n\"Assuming the charges stick. What if he posts bail and comes after Mom in retaliation?\" said by Kyle\n\"Wait. This is Nikki. I called her last night, asking her to talk with me. Please let me handle this.\" said by Jack\n\"Of course.\" said by Diane\n\"Hi, Nikki. Come on in.\" said by Jack\n\"Hi. I got your voicemail, but I thought I would just come on by.\" said by Nikki\n\"Hi.\" said by Summer\n\"What\u2019s going on?\" said by Nikki\n\"I assume you\u2019ve been apprized of what happened in Chicago?\" said by Jack\n\"Of course. Our housekeeper notified us as soon as she realized that my jewelry safe had been opened.\" said by Nikki\n\"Then I assume you also know that the man who broke into your apartment was Jeremy Stark.\" said by Jack\n\"No, I did not know that. Why on earth would he do that?\" said by Nikki\n\"I assume he planned to use the necklace to set Diane up.\" said by Jack\n\"Since he\u2019d somehow gotten it in his head that I had worked with the authorities to turn him in six years ago.\" said by Diane\n\"Well, I knew the Chicago police were following a lead, something about reading glasses being left behind. I did not know that it was tied to Stark. Or you, Diane.\" said by Nikki\n\"You know what? Um, we need to get to work.\" said by Summer\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Kyle\n\"Bye-bye.\" said by Nikki\n\"See you, Nikki.\" said by Kyle\n\"Okay.\" said by Nikki\n\"How is it you know so much about this?\" said by Nikki\n\"Diane and I went to speak with Stark just as chance was taking him into custody.\" said by Jack\n\"Huh. That\u2019s interesting timing. I mean, I have to say, I am very curious why a convicted felon would go all the way to Chicago to steal from me. Do the police have any theories about that? Because I certainly do.\" said by Nikki\n\"Nick. How you doing?\" said by Chloe\n\"I\u2019m good. How are you?\" said by Nick\n\"Just peachy. Um, what can I do for you this fine, beautiful morning?\" said by Chloe\n\"Well, I know you have your big pitch coming up, so I just wanted to come by and wish you both luck.\" said by Nick\n\"Hi.\" said by Nick\n\"Hey.\" said by Sally\n\"Uh, please don\u2019t take offense to this, but you\u2019re not looking your best.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Sighs ] None taken.\" said by Sally\n\"Is it your stomach bug again?\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, you know, that norovirus is going around. It\u2019s a real killer. Ugh, there have just been a few kids in Miles\u2019 class who have had it two or three times already.\" said by Chloe\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s what, uh, Christian\u2019s teacher said, too.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s probably just all the, um, junk food and late nights, you know, getting ready for the meeting.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, but I brought her a bunch of home remedies that should perk her right up. So, um, I think we got it covered. But it was very sweet of you to come by.\" said by ", "answer": "Chloe"}
{"content": "\"So, what\u2019s been your favorite part of the evening so far?\" said by Summer\n\"Mm, besides sharing it with you?\" said by Kyle\n\"Good answer.\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019d have to say walking into this place \u2014 I mean, a brand-new jazz venue tucked inside the athletic club. How cool is that? And your grandparents\u2019 speech.\" said by Kyle\n\"Really?\" said by Summer\n\"Mm. What Victor said about people returning to Genoa City to raise their kids spoke to me.\" said by Kyle\n\"I know what you mean.\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m so glad we moved home.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah, Milan was amazing, but this is always gonna be home.\" said by Summer\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Kyle\n\"Would you care to dance?\" said by Jack\n\"I would.\" said by Diane\n\"Keep in mind, if we dance too close, people are gonna talk, especially those who don\u2019t know we\u2019re back together.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, then let\u2019s give them something to talk about. [ Chuckles ]\" said by Diane\n\"[ Sighs ] I never thought I would see the day.\" said by Lauren\n\"Now, now, be nice.\" said by Michael\n\"[ Chuckling ] Oh, this is me being nice, darling. You know, back when Diane resurrected herself, Jack was adamant. He said to me that he would never let her back into his life, that that door was shut tight.\" said by Lauren\n\"Hurrah for second chances. And even ninth or tenth chances.\" said by Michael\n\"[ Sighs ] I just hope he knows what he\u2019s doing.\" said by Lauren\n\"Jack\u2019s a big boy. This ain\u2019t their first time around, you know.\" said by Michael\n\"Still, it\u2019s Diane.\" said by Lauren\n\"Alright. Personally, I think they look great together.\" said by Michael\n\"Really?\" said by Lauren\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Michael\n\"Because if Phyllis walked in right now and saw them together, all hell would break loose.\u00a0 [ Sighs ]\" said by Lauren\n\"Diane is probably planning on announcing their engagement tonight at the party, with full media coverage. I wouldn\u2019t put it past her if she\u2019s convinced Jack to get down on one knee. I mean, they had their heads together and \u2014\" said by Phyllis\n\"We need to get that ring.\" said by Jeremy\n\"To wreck the moment.\" said by Phyllis\n\"And because it\u2019s the perfect personal item to add to the final touch of the scene we\u2019re setting.\" said by Jeremy\n\"I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s possible. I mean, Jack slipped that ring in his pocket.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Leave that to me.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Baby, it makes me very happy to see most of the family together, doesn\u2019t it?\" said by Victor\n\"Sure does.\" said by Nikki\n\"So, this is how I envisioned a wonderful evening, the Newmans together, celebrating. I love it.\" said by Victor\n\"While Diane keeps digging her claws into Jack deeper and deeper.\" said by Nikki\n\"Well, you know, he has always been afflicted with bad judgment when it comes to Diane Jenkins.\" said by Victor\n\"It\u2019s not too late to save him.\" said by Nikki\n\"Baby, it\u2019s not too late to dance with me, right?\" said by Victor\n\"Ah. I thought you\u2019d never ask.\" said by Nikki\n\"Hmm. Victoria doesn\u2019t seem to be wasting any time.\" said by Audra\n\"Audra, stop.\" said by Elena\n\"I\u2019m just stating a fact. Victoria is someone you\u2019ll want to keep your eyes on.\" said by Audra\n\"If you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019m gonna go join my boyfriend. Hi.\" said by Elena\n\"Hey, beautiful.

Oh, no.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, that fresh air felt nice.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, is that why we went for a stroll \u2014 fresh air? I thought it was to avoid seeing Sally and Nick.\" said by Sharon\n\"Um, that was just a bonus, okay?

Uh, although I do have a strong preference as to who I would like to see make the deal.\" said by Tucker\n\"These are all preliminary ideas, but they\u2019ve been flooding my brain for days, and I would love your input.

I mean, you were already here for the big reveal at the doctor\u2019s office. If you need to go, go.\" said by Sally\n\"I probably should get it out of the way.\" said by Nick\n\"Okay, yeah. Don\u2019t worry about me.\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2019ll call you afterwards.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah. You walking out too?\" said by Sally\n\"No, you can go ahead.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, okay. I\u2019ll call you later.\" said by Nick\n\"Bye.\" said by Sally\n\"You don\u2019t think that there\u2019s miracles, and then you see something like this little girl. Our baby girl.\" said by Adam\n\"Here you go, dad.\" said by Abby\n\"Thank you, sweetheart. There we go. Now, wait a minute. Your mother ran out of here in a hurry. What was that all about?\" said by Victor\n\"[ Sighs ] Uncle jack and mom have turned their home into a war zone over diane, so I was trying to convince her to move out for a while.\" said by Abby\n\"I don\u2019t think your mother can be convinced to move out of her own home.\" said by Victor\n\"You know her so well.\" said by Abby\n\"I don\u2019t blame her being frustrated with people who are defending diane jenkins. My goodness. There you are, son.\" said by Victor\n\"Hey, dad. Hey, abby.\" said by Nick\n\"Hi. Can I get you a coffee or anything?\" said by Abby\n\"Uh, no, thanks.

I was in the middle of something important.\" said by Nick\n\"I just purchased mccall. The deal is finalized.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, there you go. You got what you wanted. That has nothing to do with me, though.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, it does, son, because adam will run it. And the company is in somewhat bad shape. Will take quite some effort to straighten it up.\" said by Victor\n\"Oh, I\u2019m sure. Why are you telling me this?\" said by Nick\n\"I want you to join adam at mccall. Hi, I\u2019m lauren, I lost 67 pounds on golo. Happy mother\u2019s day! Oh my gosh! My mom deserves the best, and the best gifts are from harry and david. Chocolate. Yummy! Cheese. Gouda. Wine. What\u2019s that? It\u2019s from harry and david. Aww. Thank you!\" said by Victor\n\"You cannot be serious. Why on earth would I join adam at mccall? I have a job, dad. A great job, at newman, in the family business. I have zero interest in some consolation prize that you bought for adam just so you can keep him out of trouble.\" said by Nick\n\"I understand your point of view, son. But hear me out. Victoria, your sister, has your mother to back her up. Adam is about to embark upon a very difficult job trying to straighten out that company. I want you to help him.\" said by Victor\n\"Ah, you\u2019ve outdone yourself this time. It\u2019s impressive. But that is never gonna happen.\" said by Nick\n\"You told me the other day that you and adam and sally actually get along for the sake of the child. Why can\u2019t you do the same thing for the sake of family unity?\" said by Victor\n\"Here we are back to me and sally, and this time you even brought up the kid. It\u2019s an all-time low. I don\u2019t have time for this.\" said by Nick\n\"Son, please sit down. I\u2019m not finished yet.\" said by Victor\n\"You know, I have to say, you have been pretty amazing navigating this whole thing.\" said by Sally\n\"Uh, I\u2019ll take that. It definitely hasn\u2019t been easy.\" said by Adam\n\"I know, right?\" said by Sally\n\"But I don\u2019t wanna say anything to upset you or\u2013 or nick. I just\u2026 I wanna stay in my lane.\" said by Adam\n\"The daddy lane.\" said by Sally\n\"[ Chuckles ] That kinda has a nice ring to it, doesn\u2019t it?\" said by ", "answer": "Adam"}

Well, I\u2019d say, that\u2019s even more reason for more after-hour sessions, right?

Can\u2019t we just take the belt off of her?\" said by Sharon\n\"No, it looks like these packs are rigged with sensors, so they could detonate on the spot. Also, wireless.\" said by Chance\n\"What does that mean?\" said by Faith\n\"Well, they could be triggered from a cellular or rf transmission point. The trigger could be anywhere. It might not even be here.\" said by Chance\n\"Okay, so what do we do?\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, before we take this off, the explosives are gonna have to be carefully deactivated.

Well, unfortunately, that happened and you lost consciousness, so they had to make a decision to do a c-section.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay, but the baby\u2019s not supposed to be\u2013 supposed to be born \u2019til at least, 37 weeks.\" said by Sally\n\"Yes.

Think he\u2019ll do that again with this kirsten guy?\" said by Nate\n\"He already has. That\u2019s how he ended up in jail.\" said by Victoria\n\"Right, but this guy is still causing problems. Why don\u2019t they just call the police?\" said by Nate\n\"They did. Chance, general, city police, even my father\u2019s security team, they\u2019re all trying to help.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay.\" said by Nate\n\"It\u2019s so nerve-wracking.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, it sounds like they have a lot of backup.

I feel better already. Thank you.\" said by Victoria\n\"When I was in the military, I had some training in disarming explosives like this.\" said by Chance\n\"Hear that, faith?

That\u2019s great. Thank you. Okay, faith, I understand this is scary, but I\u2019m going to need you to stay very still, all right? I\u2019m going to work as fast as I can, but we\u2019re in this together, okay?\" said by Chance\n\"If the bomb goes off, we both die? I trust you to keep me safe.\" said by Faith\n\"You okay, chance?\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah.\" said by Chance\n\"This isn\u2019t like in spain. You didn\u2019t have a chance to diffuse the explosive then, but you do now.\" said by Sharon\n\"[ Sighs ] Okay, why don\u2019t you two step back just in case?\" said by Chance\n\"No way, man.

I want you to be able to lean on me.\" said by Nate\n\"You just being here, it helps. I don\u2019t want to let my mind go to worst case scenarios.\" said by Victoria\n\"Then don\u2019T.\" said by Nate\n\"You\u2019re right. Until I hear something concrete from nick or my mom, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m not going to waste any time worrying. It\u2019s out of my hands anyway.\" said by Victoria\n\"That is right.\" said by Nate\n\"It\u2019s not like it\u2019s in my control at all. Cameron, he\u2019s a wild card. There\u2019s no telling\u2013\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay, stop, stop. You\u2019re spending time worrying about something you have no control over. And I swear you just said you weren\u2019t going to do that.\" said by Nate\n\"Ah, you\u2019re right. You\u2019re right. It\u2019s just that this situation is a powder keg. And nick landed in jail. He didn\u2019t even lay a hand on cameron. My brother is a very fierce protector, but once that\u2013 that instinct is triggered, I mean, he doesn\u2019t think rationally, he just reacts.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay, nick can be a loose cannon, but those situations involve nick acting alone. But this time, they brought in the authorities. Even a madman like cameron kirsten won\u2019t stand a chance against that much protection.\" said by Nate\n\"How much longer?\" said by Faith\n\"Well, I have to cut the wire connected to the signal receiving antenna from each pack, one by one, so I know it\u2019s tough to be patient, but you\u2019re doing great.\" said by Chance\n\"So you\u2019ve worked on this kind of bomb before?\" said by Faith\n\"I\u2019m sure chance has seen all kinds of things in his military work. Right, chance?\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah. Yeah, I\u2019ve seen similar. Okay. I\u2019m going to cut the first red wire now and what I need you to do is, don\u2019t breathe in too deeply, okay?\" said by Chance\n\"Okay. So, basically, don\u2019t breathe?\" said by Faith\n\"Yeah, basically.\" said by Chance\n\"Ready when you are.\" said by Faith\n\"Okay.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, now that you know it\u2019s the red one\u2026 I mean, unless\u2013\" said by Sharon\n\"Why? You think cameron\u2019s devious enough to change the pattern?\" said by Chance\n\"I love you both so much for being here with me, but if this doesn\u2019t work\u2013\" said by Faith\n\"It\u2019s going to work.\" said by Sharon\n\"I don\u2019t want all of us to die.\" said by ", "answer": "Faith"}

Am I interrupting?\" said by Taylor\n\"Uh no, actually I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re here. Hope was about to tell me if she\u2019s decided or not.\" said by Brooke\n\"Have you decided? Is thomas going to come back and work for hope for the future?\" said by Taylor\n\"So, did dad actually say that like in those words he doesn\u2019t care about the amount, just get the deal done?\" said by Liam\n\"Yeah. Yeah and he\u2019ll sign off on it, no questions asked, he\u2019s gonna let me handle the whole thing, which is fine.\" said by Wyatt\n\"I\u2019ve just never seen him so uninvolved in his own business.\" said by Liam\n\"Exactly. We\u2019ve also never seen him involved with a homicidal maniac before. There\u2019s that. He\u2019s a changed man. What? You disagree?\" said by Wyatt\n\"No, no I don\u2019t disagree, it\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019ve been hearing that phrase a lot lately. A changed man, a changed man. Like really? Does anybody ever really change, like?\" said by Liam\n\"One would hope. Something tells me we\u2019re not talking about dad anymore. What\u2019s going on with you?\" said by Wyatt\n\"You got me.

Is that why you\u2019re here, thomas? Are you back to save the day?\" said by Paris\n\"Well, paris, I would love the opportunity, but it\u2019s all up to hope.\" said by Thomas\n\"Hope should be begging you to come back.\" said by Paris\n\"She wouldn\u2019t have to beg, I\u2019d gladly do it.\" said by Thomas\n\"Well, honestly, the line hasn\u2019t been the same without you, but it\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t been putting in the work. Personally, I mean, you\u2019ve been going to therapy and all that stuff\u2019s rough, but you\u2019re doing it. You\u2019re making amends, you\u2019re improving yourself.\" said by Paris\n\"I appreciate you noticing.\" said by Thomas\n\"Of course, it\u2019s obvious you\u2019ve changed. I see it and hope should see it too. But even if she does see it, there\u2019s still an unfortunate problem. There\u2019s still one person who may not ever accept the fact that you\u2019ve changed, whose opinion she can\u2019t ignore, liam.\" said by Paris\n\"What does thomas have to do with anything, all right? I thought he got booted from\u2013 from forrester?\" said by Wyatt\n\"He did.\" said by Liam\n\"Okay, so then hope doesn\u2019t have to see his stupid face around the office anymore, right?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Well, apparently thomas has the magic touch when it comes to hope for the future and singularly determines whether or not the line is successful or can exist.\" said by Liam\n\"Hold\u2013 hold on, hold on. So, thomas is working on hope\u2019s line again?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Thankfully, no, not anymore.\" said by Liam\n\"I\u2019ve made a decision. Yes, it wasn\u2019t easy, but after talking with liam.\" said by Hope\n\"Liam has no idea the work that thomas is doing to make things right with all of us.\" said by Taylor\n\"Well, we discussed it and liam believes that thomas is being disingenuous.\" said by Hope\n\"I sat in on thomas\u2019s therapy session last night and it\u2019s legit. He is working so hard to become a better person. I\u2013 I would never support this if I\u2013 if I thought he wasn\u2019T. Especially on your line. The friendship that your mom and I have built means so much to me. The years of battles that we have gone through to get to this point. I\u2013 I would never jeopardize it by putting you at risk.\" said by Taylor\n\"I\u2019m sure that hope trusts you. But the question is, can you trust thomas? Can liam? So, what did you decide? Are you willing to allow thomas to work with you again?\" said by Brooke\n\"Can you just find it in your heart to give him another shot? Hi, I\u2019m debra.\" said by Taylor\n\"You\u2019re right, liam\u2019s opinion definitely does matter. Um, which means my chances of being back on hope for the future are slim to none.\" said by Thomas\n\"Oh, hey, try leaning towards slim, all right? Don\u2019t give up yet.\" said by Paris\n\"I\u2019m not.\" said by Thomas\n\"When is she deciding?\" said by Paris\n\"She probably already has. I\u2019d actually better go find out.\" said by Thomas\n\"Well, I think she\u2019s across the hall, if you\u2019re ready to face the music.\" said by Paris\n\"Ha. Uh, wish me luck?\" said by Thomas\n\"Sending all kinds your way.\" said by Paris\n\"So steffy convinced hope to do it or not?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Convinced, I mean, I don\u2019t know about convinced but\u2013 but hope was considering it for a minute there. Thankfully, it didn\u2019t take me too long to bring her back to reality.\" said by Liam\n\"I mean, this doesn\u2019t make any sense. Why would steffy let all be forgiven after everything that thomas has done?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Ah, you know, he\u2019s her brother, unconditional love. She felt obligated to forgive him, yada yada yada. What I don\u2019t understand is how steffy could expect hope to forgive him.\" said by Liam\n\"Hope can\u2019t have thomas designing for her again. You did get through to her about that, right?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Thankfully yes. So, I mean, it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s looking like if thomas does have a future at forrester, it\u2019s not gonna be because he\u2019s working with hope.\" said by Liam\n\"Look, honey, I don\u2019t want to put you on the spot. If you\u2019re not ready to answer, that is fine. Just, it\u2019s a big decision so take your time.\" said by Brooke\n\"No, don\u2019t take too much time. No, steffy is ready to pull your line. I mean, I know you\u2019re worried about liam.\" said by Taylor\n\"Yes, of course. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s not happy about this.\" said by Brooke\n\"No, liam doesn\u2019t want thomas and me working together.\" said by Hope\n\"Okay, but if thomas wasn\u2019t genuinely trying to make things better, I would agree. But he is.\" said by Taylor\n\"Hey. Mom, I had no idea you\u2019d be here.\" said by Thomas\n\"Hi, baby. I\u2013 yeah, I left my tablet here last night. I wanted to grab it before work. And also just seeing if there\u2019s any news.\" said by Taylor\n\"There will be after thomas and I talk\u2026 alone.\" said by Hope\n\"Oh, oh yes, of course, shall we?\" said by Brooke\n\"We shall.\" said by Taylor\n\"Must\u2019ve been quite the conversation with liam, assuming you talked to him.\" said by Thomas\n\"Well, liam is my husband, not going to keep him in the dark.\" said by Hope\n\"I\u2019m guessing that he didn\u2019t take things so well. Okay, look, hope, I wanna work with you, I do. I love what we do together, our line. I want\u2013 I want to create, you know, wonderful designs and\u2013 and bring our visions to life, I do. Not at the expense of your marriage or your relationship. I don\u2019t\u2013 I don\u2019t want to cause any tension between you and liam, so\u2026 if you have to say no, I\u2019ll understand. Hi, I\u2019m angela.\" said by Thomas\n\"I did the right thing, right? Talking hope off that ledge.\" said by Liam\n\"Uh, yeah. Why are you even questioning that?\" said by Wyatt\n\"I\u2019m not. I just, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m starting to wonder if it\u2019s more like a home life is home life and work life is\u2013\" said by Liam\n\"Dude! Nope, nope. Stop right there. No, you did the right thing, okay?\" said by Wyatt\n\"It\u2019s just if she loses her line and it\u2019s because of me\u2026\" said by Liam\n\"No, it\u2019s because she\u2019s not working with thomas. And if that\u2019s the case, then it\u2019s their loss, okay? She\u2019ll figure something else out.\" said by Wyatt\n\"All right, here\u2019s the thing. I\u2013 I have so much respect for hope. She\u2019s so smart. She\u2019s so hard working. You know, she\u2013 she\u2019s strong willed. She doesn\u2019t\u2013 she doesn\u2019t need to be coming home and having me telling her what to do. Like that\u2019s not the role I want in her life.\" said by Liam\n\"But you\u2019re married. Her decisions affect you and your decisions affect her. That\u2019s how it works. Especially when it involves someone you can\u2019t trust like thomas. Okay, you were fully supportive and loving and caring, just like you always are, right? You weren\u2019t bossing her around and acting all caveman like.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Uh yeah, yeah, I think 90% supportive, 10% neanderthal.\" said by Liam\n\"Okay. A little caveman\u2019s okay, but you did the right thing because that\u2019s what a good husband does, that.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Thanks, man. I really\u2013 I really appreciate the support and I hope my\u2013 my beautiful wife appreciates mine. I\u2019m just, bottom line, I did get through to her and she\u2019s not welcoming thomas back to her line, so.\" said by Liam\n\"So, what do you think hope is going to decide?\" said by Taylor\n\"Whoo, I don\u2019t know. Her line means so much to her, but is it really worth the risk? No, that is not a dig to thomas. And I believe your assessment about him. I do. I\u2019ve always wanted him to be happy and healthy.\" said by Brooke\n\"And he is, he is well on his way. But I understand that you\u2019re conflicted and so is hope.\" said by Taylor\n\"She was moved by what you said earlier. So was I.\" said by Brooke\n\"Good. So, were you both moved enough to give thomas another chance to prove himself.\" said by Taylor\n\"Mm, that is the question.\" said by Brooke\n\"I know. I know.\" said by Taylor\n\"Oh, or better yet, you can hang out with your two grandparents.\" said by Paris\n\"Hi, paris. Douglas!\" said by Taylor\n\"Hi, douglas. Oh, group hug.

What is it?\" said by Brooke\n\"Thomas.\" said by Taylor\n\"Thomas.\" said by Brooke\n\"Brooke, the line was doing great when thomas was lead designer.

Well, sorry you\u2019re facing so many challenges right now, \u2019cause you\u2019re a good person, and you\u2019re a selfless person. You do kind and selfless things. Exhibit a, when caroline died. You swooped right in and you became exactly the mother that douglas needed, a mother who would love him, and protect him, and teach him right from wrong while also giving him the space to grow and become his own person. That the kind of investment that\u2019s gonna, douglas is\u2013 he\u2019s going through a thing right now and so for whatever reason, he feels more comfortable at steffy\u2019s, but just as you\u2019re a hero to me, you\u2019re a hero to him twofoldo to him twofold.

And she\u2019s at her cutest possible stage right now. You should have a mother and daughter day, right? You should take her out for ice cream, and eat so much of it that you both get brain freeze.

I\u2019ll try not to be offended.\" said by Deacon\n\"Oh, you know, it\u2019s just that I\u2013 I\u2019ve been feeling this way even\u2013 even before all of this because I know what bill\u2019s drug is with women. I\u2013 it\u2013 it\u2019s all about the excitement of\u2013 of that initial attraction, the endless possibilities, the, you know, I can\u2019t get enough of each other moment. It\u2019s all about the chase. And then she gives in. And she\u2019s his whole world, for that moment. \u2018Til the glow wears off and then reality sets in. And he\u2019s looking for his next fix. What happens when I\u2019m that woman? When I\u2019m the one that he wants to be done with? Do I go back to prison?\" said by Sheila\n\"If bill finds out about you and me, prison might be the safer bet.\" said by Deacon\n\"Bill finding out about us is not an option.

Calling cps\u2026 it was horribly wrong. I mean, my dad told me that you were gonna call cps, and that just gave me that idea, and I thought, \u201cI can get my family back together.\u201d And it kind of worked, right? Because he left you, and he went to my mom, and\u2013 and they were about to get married. The problem is, is that it all started with a lie. And that is horribly wrong. It\u2019s something I never should have done.\" said by Thomas\n\"You see, the problem here is that I\u2019ve heard these heartfelt apologies before. And it does seem like you mean it, but you still cost me my marriage.\" said by Brooke\n\"I did cost you a marriage, but in that, I gained you\" said by Thomas\n\"Me too.\" said by Taylor\n\"I just wish we could have gotten here a little differently, right? You know, I\u2013 I wish you didn\u2019t have to manipulate ridge and me, but here we are, so we\u2019ll just deal with it, and we\u2019ll get past it. The question is, what about my daughter? How do I ever trust you with hope again?\" said by Brooke\n\"You know, all this talk about me and how I\u2019m doing, you sure you doing okay?\" said by Hope\n\"I kinda, uh, feel like you have a lot of stuff on your plate already without me piling on, and so, maybe not.\" said by Liam\n\"Ah, well. See, um, that\u2019s the thing about marriage. Kind of makes it so that your stuff is also my stuff, so. Tell me what\u2019s on your mind.\" said by Hope\n\"It\u2019s my dad, of course.

What, am I\u2013 am I just supposed to leave? Because that is not an option. You know the reality is\u2013 is bill put everything on the line to keep me out of prison.

Is that what friends do for one another?\" said by Michael\n\"Did I lose you to diane? Honestly, are you going to choose diane over me?\" said by Phyllis\n\"I lied to my husband.

I just kept thinking about why I put so much energy into that relationship. And then it finally occurred to me that it was because of what we did to devon.

And since this whole scenario is frankly insane.\" said by Michael\n\"Or it\u2019s more treacherous than you\u2019re even thinking about.

So, what are you up to?\" said by Ashley\n\"I\u2019m not up to anything. I have innocence on my side along with michael, kyle, and jack.\" said by Diane\n\"Kyle, I love you so much. It\u2019s never been my intention to shut you out. It\u2019s just\u2013 I don\u2019t know. My mind has been so jumbled. So, if you could just give me a little bit more time.\" said by Summer\n\"This is hard for me too, summer. Watching you and my mom suffer, feeling powerless to help.

Look I know that my mom is supposedly alive, but there hasn\u2019t been some joyful, miraculous reunion. I don\u2019t\u2013 I don\u2019t get to see her or touch her or talk to her.

Um, I\u2019ll meet you there.\" said by Summer\n\"I am well aware of your thoughts on nate. So, why don\u2019t we just fast forward through that? Oh, I have an idea, new topic. How about how dad\u2019s just handed adam an entire kingdom?\" said by Victoria\n\"[ Sighing ] Why do you even care about that?\" said by Nikki\n\"Because it\u2019s going to end in a disaster.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, so what if it does? It\u2019s no skin off your nose?\" said by Nikki\n\"Mm, I see. So, now you\u2019re rooting for adam.\" said by Victoria\n\"Not at all, but this is important to your father, so why don\u2019t you just let him have it without all the bitter comments?\" said by Nikki\n\"Mccall unlimited would have dovetailed nicely into all of our divisions. I\u2013 I just gave up on it too easily. Just let it fall right into adam\u2019s clutches.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, my god. You sound more like your father every day. Like it\u2019s not enough to want the world, but you want to conquer everything. And your opponent must lose, as if their losing makes your victory even sweeter.\" said by Nikki\n\"Are we still talking about mccall unlimited? Because if this is about nate, I think maybe I should be offended.\" said by Victoria\n\"It was elena\u2019s idea to fly out and confront you. I didn\u2019t send her to los angeles.\" said by Audra\n\"But you made damn sure she knew I wasn\u2019t out there alone. That I was with victoria, even though it was a business trip.\" said by Nate\n\"How was I supposed to know you kept that detail from her? And why did you? Once elena made the decision, who was I to talk her out of it? She was hell bent on finding you.\" said by Audra\n\"Stop trying to justify your actions, audra. You lit the match knowing it would upset her.\" said by Nate\n\"Elena was already suspicious. You\u2019d fallen out of love with her. Oh, don\u2019t deny it. I could read the signs and so could elena. Look, as devastating as this breakup is for her, isn\u2019t it really what\u2019s best for everyone?\" said by Audra\n\"It shouldn\u2019t have gone down like that. She didn\u2019t deserve to be treated this way.\" said by Nate\n\"I suggest you let it go, let her go. Like trust me, elena is gonna be fine without you. You two just weren\u2019t a\u2013 a match, that\u2019s all. And even if this thing didn\u2019t happen with victoria, you know, I doubt your girlfriend would have been able to get behind your new vision for the future.\" said by Audra\n\"Which is what exactly?\" said by Nate\n\"You don\u2019t think I figured it out? I know what you\u2019re up to. Newman media isn\u2019t enough, you want his and her thrones running the kingdom alongside victoria.\" said by Audra\n\"You\u2019ve done an impressive job so far, making the transition from medicine to business. Still, you know, who would have thought you\u2019d rise this far this fast? And yet, you have. And now, you\u2019re completely in with victoria, personally, as well as professionally, while making it seem like it was the boss lady driving it all along. Hm. Well done, you.\" said by Audra\n\"Are you finished?\" said by Nate\n\"Uh, is there more to the story?\" said by Audra\n\"From my vantage point, yes. You seem to have some facts wrong.\" said by Nate\n\"Enlighten me.\" said by Audra\n\"The way things evolved with victoria was not calculated. We had a connection that just exploded. It took us both by surprise, but it\u2019s strong, audra, and it\u2019s real.\" said by Nate\n\"That sounds lovely.\" said by Audra\n\"Last night, I told her she was the most amazing woman I have ever met and that is the truth.\" said by Nate\n\"Uh, I believe you. Yeah, I\u2019ve seen it, felt it in the room when you were both there. I won\u2019t lie, um, I was a little disappointed at first because I felt an attraction to you from the beginning.\" said by Audra\n\"Some people say I don\u2019t have a conscience.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, I know that that\u2019s not true, even though that is the image you like to project. In reality, you are much more considerate than you want people to realize.\" said by Nikki\n\"Just have take your word for that, mom.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay, I know you don\u2019t want to hear this, but I\u2019m going to say it anyway.\" said by Nikki\n\"I\u2019m sure you are. Go ahead.\" said by Victoria\n\"Have you given any thought at all to elena?\" said by Nikki\n\"You know, I have to get to the office. There\u2019s some things that I need to take care of, but please stay. No rush. Finish your coffee.\" said by Victoria\n\"Victoria\u2013\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh, honey, come on.\" said by Nikki\n\"I just keep going back and forth and back and forth with how I feel about all this.\" said by Lauren\n\"Which part?\" said by ", "answer": "Michael"}

That\u2019s the whole\u2013 what are you doing right now?\" said by Liam\n\"Wow, why\u2019d I even say that?\" said by Wyatt\n\"I know.

It\u2019s like, really?\" said by Liam\n\"But you think she\u2019s only seeing what she wants to see and not what\u2019s actually going on.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Yes. You know what I am curious about though?\" said by Liam\n\"Mm?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Is ridge. Right? \u2018Cause\u2013 \u2019cause, when he left town, he and thomas were\u2026 they were not on good terms, and now that he\u2019s back, like I kind of wonder, well, I don\u2019t know? Would he potentially reverse steffy\u2019s decision to bring thomas back to forrester?\" said by Liam\n\"It was steffy\u2019s decision, allowing me to return and I know that you were busy taking down sheila, but I\u2019m sure that you know what was going on with hope\u2019s line.\" said by Thomas\n\"Your design skills are not what got you thrown out.\" said by Ridge\n\"But the part of me that did get me thrown out?

I\u2019m happy you\u2019re choosing yourself.\" said by Hope\n\"I mean, let\u2019s be real. Most of my life, I felt like I\u2019ve needed a man, and usually it\u2019s been the wrong man. And I am not saying that your father is the wrong man. It\u2019s just that my relationship with deacon did cause a lot of problems in my life. I\u2019m just happy you haven\u2019t been drawn to the bad boy like I have. I\u2019m so proud of you, sweetheart.\" said by Brooke\n\"I have tried to take the high road with thomas, so many times.

I really don\u2019T.\" said by Liam\n\"You\u2019re just worried about him spending all day, every day at the office.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Yeah. Which means them spending hours and hours and hours together. Sometimes, well into the evenings, you know?\" said by Liam\n\"Right. But does hope really know how you feel about that?\" said by Wyatt\n\"I mean, at this point, how could she not? It\u2019s just, she\u2019s so hyper focused right now on making hope for the future viable again, that she, you know, that means her putting in those hours.\" said by Liam\n\"Right. And thomas is more than happy to put in those hours with her as well. Yeah. Dude, I\u2013 I feel for you. This sucks.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Can I ask you something? Like objectively?\" said by Liam\n\"Sure.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Do you think that I\u2019m being too controlling? Or\u2013 or\u2013 or overbearing? Or unreasonable here?\" said by Liam\n\"No, quite the opposite, actually. I\u2013 I think you\u2019re being a loving, concerned husband, and you\u2019re just protecting your wife from somebody you don\u2019t trust.\" said by Wyatt\n\"To be clear, I totally trust hope.\" said by Liam\n\"Oh, yeah.\" said by Wyatt\n\"It\u2019s not her. It\u2019s thomas that I think is incapable of real change.\" said by Liam\n\"I get why you\u2019d be skeptical. I have made so many mistakes in the past and\u2013 and I\u2019ve hurt people, and then I hurt people and I apologize, and I say it\u2019s gonna get better and then I get a little bit better, but then I screw up again and then I hurt you again or hurt someone else, and then I apologize again. And all along, what\u2019s kind of amazing, is that you have been there for me. You\u2019ve given me forgiveness over and over again. Most recently, I, like an idiot, called cps on myself. That was my most recent mistake. And I could say that I know exactly why I did it. Actually, I kinda do. It\u2019s\u2013 I wasn\u2019t thinking. I got mad because brooke said something that\u2013 that threatened my relationship with my son. And so, I just acted out, immediately, without thinking anything through. And obviously, I want you and mom to be together too. Steffy and i have always wanted that. I don\u2019t\u2013 I don\u2019t want to sit here and just focus on the past, and keep bringing up all those things. I want to move forward into the future. I want to build a better future. One where you can be actually proud of your son. And I want to make sure that I never, ever let you down again. And more than that, I don\u2019t ever want to let down my son, or my mom, or my sister.\" said by Thomas\n\"Or hope.\" said by Ridge\n\"I know you\u2019ve worked hard to take the best qualities of me and leave the not so good qualities behind. Honey, I look at you and the life that you lead, and I am so amazed. Your principles, your morals. I just admire you so, so much. Really. I do. And also your relationship with liam and how committed you are and how loyal. I mean, sometimes I wonder how you\u2019re even my daughter. Stephanie called me \u201cslut from the valley\u201d for a reason. I worked my way through the forrester men, and then there was deacon and bill, and the list goes on and on.\" said by Brooke\n\"Okay, mom, stop, please. Why are we even talking about this? I hate it when you beat yourself up like this.\" said by Hope\n\"No, no, I\u2019m not. Just there\u2019s no denying that I\u2019ve always desired the wrong man. Honey, I\u2019m just glad you\u2019re not like me that way. Yeah, yeah, yeah\" said by Brooke\n\"I realize the success of hope for the future depends on hope trusting me and respecting me again. And I think we\u2019re actually getting there. I mean, she is the face of the line and she\u2019s brought me back. I am the designer again.\" said by Thomas\n\"And that means you\u2019re gonna spend more time together.\" said by Ridge\n\"Yes. For the purpose of the success of the line. I don\u2019t have those feelings that I used to for her, dad. I promise, I don\u2019T. I have changed. I\u2019ve become a better person, and I know it because I can feel it.\" said by Thomas\n\"I\u2019m glad to hear that. You lied to me. You disappointed me. You broke my heart, but do you think I want to be estranged from my son? I don\u2019T.\" said by Ridge\n\"I want to make a promise to you and I really believe I can come through on it. I want to prove to everyone I\u2019m a better man. More than that, I want to prove to you that I can be a son that you\u2019re proud of. Because dad, I love you so much.\" said by Thomas\n\"Look, obviously you\u2019re gonna be keeping an eye on thomas.\" said by Wyatt\n\"I guess. It\u2019d be a lot easier if I didn\u2019t work halfway across town at spencer.\" said by Liam\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Actually, that doesn\u2019t have to stop me.\" said by Liam\n\"What, wait, whoa. Where you going?\" said by Wyatt\n\"I just want to see for myself, if thomas\u2019 obsessive behavior around my wife really is a thing of the past.

He just wants to walk away. But it seems that some person of interest has come in and bought up all of his debt. I suspect that person is ashley.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay.\" said by Devon\n\"So, my question to you is, did tucker approach you about buying the company and taking control?\" said by Victoria\n\"That\u2019s what you came here to ask me? Why do you care?\" said by Devon\n\"I wonder \u2014 are you aware that your father approached me first about buying his company? Y-you didn\u2019t know that, did you?\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, why would i believe a word that comes out of your mouth anyway?\" said by Devon\n\"I have nothing to gain from lying to you, but clearly tucker thought that he did.\" said by Victoria\n\"Do you plan on telling me what\u2019s behind that self-satisfied smile?\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, yeah, you want to know? It\u2019s these demands you\u2019re making.\" said by Victor\n\"To keep mccall its own entity?\" said by Adam\n\"That was my idea for you to run the company, as well.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, then we are on the same page. Good.\" said by Adam\n\"I just had to close certain doors to make sure that you realized where the hell you belong.\" said by Victor\n\"You know, jack stuck his neck out to give me that job.\" said by Adam\n\"Jack abbott. Good god, man, how did you ever become involved with that guy? Anyway, what was \u2014 what was the final straw?\" said by Victor\n\"[ Chuckles ] Are you really gonna make me do this?\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah. Take your time. Sit down.\" said by Victor\n\"[ Sighs ] I was half-assing it at jabot. My heart wasn\u2019t in it, and i realized that I didn\u2019t belong there.

Do you struggle with occasional nerve aches\" said by Adam\n\"Look, this is one of the most difficult things I\u2019ve ever been through, causing this all-out war between my cousins. Look, I shook the faith they had in the merger and the future of the company. Hell, in me. Watching the devastation that i created, bearing witness to all that pain.

I had a feeling.\" said by Daniel\n\"Look, I don\u2019t expect lily to forgive me overnight \u2014 if she ever does \u2014 and it\u2019s probably gonna take an act of god before devon and I could ever get back to where we were before I started this whole damn thing.\" said by Nate\n\"That still doesn\u2019t answer my question. What do you want me to do about it?\" said by Daniel\n\"Help me put an end to this battle.\" said by Nate\n\"Nate [Laughs] I don\u2019t think \u2014\" said by Daniel\n\"Look, I can only get so close, and neither one of them will listen to me.

He definitely understands what women find appealing.\" said by Paris\n\"Yes. Agreed. But again, his future at the company is, it\u2019s not my call.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah. All I\u2019m saying is fashion is about breaking rules and pushing boundaries, especially a line like yours. Yes, thomas went too far with trying to get his parents back together. I\u2019d never say otherwise. But that kind of passion is what makes his work so exciting and successful.\" said by Paris\n\"So you want me to take him back?\" said by Hope\n\"I can\u2019t tell you what to do, but I know how deeply you care about this line. You poured your heart into hope for the future. You want it to thrive. Do you think you should talk with steffy and see if both thomas and his collection can get a second chance?\" said by Paris\n\"Come on, steffy. We\u2019ve hit rough patches before. You\u2019ve been angry with me, but you\u2019ve always been a person who can support me and be in my corner.\" said by Thomas\n\"Why do you always have to make this so damn hard?\" said by Steffy\n\"I\u2019m sorry. And I know what I did was wrong, but I did it for the right reasons.\" said by Thomas\n\"That is no excuse.\" said by Steffy\n\"You\u2019re right. It\u2019s not an excuse. And that\u2019s why I knew, I knew what was coming and I was ready to take my time in exile.\" said by Thomas\n\"Yet here you are.\" said by Steffy\n\"Yeah, because it\u2019s one thing for me to be punished for my actions, but it\u2019s not okay for hope for the future to be punished. Steffy, you read the review. I can make this better, okay? You need me. Hope for the future needs me. I could\u2019ve waited to tell my doctor my heart\" said by Thomas\n\"I\u2019ll admit losing thomas from the team has been a blow.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah. The reviews for the latest collection weren\u2019t the greatest.\" said by Paris\n\"No, they weren\u2019T. Thomas and I, we\u2013 we\u2013 were good at collaborating with each other. We were wonderful creative partners and I thought that we understood each other. That we had the same vision and goals. But I was wrong. I was wrong. I told everyone that he had changed. I stuck up for him and he let me down. I trusted him with a lot of things that I hold dear, paris. He hurt the people that I love the most. And so, while on the one hand, I swore to never work with thomas again in order to protect my family, in order to do what was best for them. But then, on the other hand, I care about my career. I care about my line and what it means not only to me but to\u2013 to the customers around the world. And I have a responsibility to the people that work for me, for this company. So, I don\u2019t know what to do.\" said by Hope\n\"You know, douglas is welcome here anytime.\" said by Finn\n\"See, I really appreciate that.\" said by Liam\n\"And steffy, she was kinda jealous I got to hang out with him. She really loves her nephew.\" said by Finn\n\"Let her be jealous. No, he\u2013 he\u2013 he loves spending time with all of them.\" said by Liam\n\"It\u2019s great, the way the kids all get along.\" said by Finn\n\"Well, yeah, \u2019cause that\u2019s family, right? That\u2019s the way family should be. I\u2013 I regret the way that douglas came back to hope and me. But man, it\u2019s so nice to have him home.

This actually could work.\" said by Summer\n\"Summer.\" said by Daniel\n\"No, we need to find carson. We need to at least talk to him. All he has to do is tell the police that he saw mom act in self-defense.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, that\u2019s all he has to do, huh?\" said by Daniel\n\"Stark paid him to be an accomplice, so clearly, he can be bought. So, what, I\u2013 I find him, I give him a big bag of money and he says what I want him to say.\" said by Summer\n\"I don\u2019t care how damn busy you are. I wanna know what judge is responsible for today\u2019s arraignments. Exactly. Get back to me. All right? Don\u2019t give me a\u2013 what? Get to it.\" said by Victor\n\"How is that going?\" said by Nikki\n\"All I know is that I want our son out of that jail cell. He doesn\u2019t belong there.\" said by Victor\n\"As soon as cameron showed up in town, I think everybody expected this. I mean, there was bound to be a showdown.\" said by Nikki\n\"Of course there was bound to be a showdown. Question is how to resolve it.\" said by Victor\n\"I think we need to let michael do what he does best. He will get nicholas out as soon as possible. In the meantime, have there been any cameron sightings?\" said by Nikki\n\"Uh-uh. And if that punk knows what\u2019s good for him, he won\u2019t show up anywhere near this house or our family.\" said by Victor\n\"We\u2019ve done what we can. Michael will keep us updated. So, in the meantime, why don\u2019t we focus on our work and let him focus on his?\" said by Nikki\n\"I know you\u2019re trying to distract me. Good idea, too. There\u2019s some business I want to discuss with you.\" said by Victor\n\"Oh, the anderson deal. I have it right here.\" said by Nikki\n\"No. I wanna talk to you about nate hastings. How\u2019s he doing?\" said by Victor\n\"You mean since he has started seeing victoria?\" said by Nikki\n\"No, overall.\" said by Victor\n\"I have to say, very well. He has made good decisions for newman media.\" said by Nikki\n\"Good to know.\" said by Victor\n\"I understand you\u2019ve taken him under your wing.\" said by Nikki\n\"My day was productive. Yours?\" said by Nate\n\"Mine was\u2026 it was extremely productive.\" said by Victoria\n\"Really?\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah.\" said by Victoria\n\"Why do you suppose that is?\" said by Nate\n\"I don\u2019t know. For some odd reason, I was just filled with energy.\" said by Victoria\n\"Mm.\" said by Nate\n\"Maybe it was that private meeting that we squeezed in before we went to the office.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, you mean upstairs in the newman corporate suite?\" said by Nate\n\"I think we got a lot accomplished upstairs.\" said by Victoria\n\"An amazing amount.\" said by Nate\n\"We you usually do, though.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, I\u2019m sorry. I meant to turn my phone off.\" said by Victoria\n\"No, go ahead. It\u2019s fine.\" said by Nate\n\"Sure?\" said by Victoria\n\"Problem?\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, my\u2013 my brother got arrested.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, boy. What\u2019s adam done now?\" said by Nate\n\"No, not\u2013 not adam. Nicholas.\" said by Victoria\n\"Are you serious?\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah. Look, sadly we\u2019re gonna have to cut this short. Excuse me. Can I please get the check?\" said by Victoria\n\"I don\u2019t understand how this can happen. That cameron kirsten freak is a criminal who killed a cat and dad is sitting in jail?\" said by Faith\n\"Michael is a very sharp attorney. He will get your father out of there and out of trouble. Though it may take some time.\" said by Sharon\n\"How much time? I never would\u2019ve agreed to leave town if I\u2019d known that you\u2019d be alone.\" said by Faith\n\"It\u2019s chance.\" said by Chance\n\"How could you arrest my father?\" said by Faith\n\"Hey. How you doing? You hanging in there?\" said by Michael\n\"How do you think I\u2019m doing? Kirsten is lying. These charges are a joke. It\u2019s a setup to get me out of the way so I can\u2019t protect sharon and faith. He\u2019s obviously planning something, which means you have to get me out here now!\" said by Nick\n\"I appreciate the urgency, but you\u2019re not gonna be arraigned \u2019til later today. And frankly, seeing how wound up you are right now, this might be the safest place for you. When migraine strikes, you\u2019re faced with a choice.\" said by Michael\n\"Summer, we are not paying someone to lie to the authorities.\" said by Daniel\n\"I still say\u2013\" said by Summer\n\"No, no, no, no, no. Look, we have broken enough laws already trying to help mom. Let\u2019s not add any more to the list. People have gone to prison for a lot less. You wind up in a cell, how are you gonna help mom do anything?\" said by Daniel\n\"I\u2019m just thinking how mom would think. This is how she would approach things.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah? How\u2019s that working out for her? She has screwed up her life beyond recognition. I mean, even she would tell you not to do this. It\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s crazy, one, and it wouldn\u2019t work.\" said by Daniel\n\"You know what? If that\u2019s your attitude, fine. I don\u2019t need your help.\" said by Summer\n\"What do you mean you think it\u2019s safer for me in here? Are you kidding me?\" said by Nick\n\"Nick! Nick, I am on your side.\" said by Michael\n\"Are you sure about that, michael?\" said by Nick\n\"I know exactly what I\u2019m dealing with. All right? If you\u2019ll recall, I was the first to hear about cameron, how vicious he is. Years ago, sharon told me what happened in denver before she admitted it to anyone else. The man is a disgusting pig, but he\u2019s not stupid. In fact, he\u2019s got you all figured out. You didn\u2019t even touch him, and where are you? In jail. Out of commission. Because cameron anticipated that you\u2019d come for him and he used it like a judo move against you. Pretty damn elegant if you ask me. Now, you are gonna stay in here for an hour or so and calm down while we wait for your arraignment. In the meantime, chance is with sharon, looking out for her. I mean, her own private special forces expert. I\u2019ll even check on her, too, on my way.\" said by Michael\n\"Just make sure that sharon is safe and you keep cameron kirsten away from faith.\" said by Nick\n\"I give you my word. Between chance and me and victor\u2019s security team, there\u2019s gonna be a whole lot of people watching over them.\" said by Michael\n\"And I\u2019m grateful for that, believe me. But I\u2019m afraid that cameron is planning something, and once he puts it in motion, there may be no stopping it.\" said by Nick\n\"Cameron kirsten filed a complaint against your father. His face was beaten. And nick did admit to going to his hotel room, and his hands were bruised, so I had to follow the law.\" said by Chance\n\"Dad punched the wall. It is his word against cameron\u2019S.\" said by Faith\n\"Well, the truth has a way of coming out in court.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, it needs to come out now. Dad shouldn\u2019t be in jail. He shouldn\u2019t have to deal with any of this. And he should be here with mom.\" said by Faith\n\"I understand that this guy is a creep, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. Since nick can\u2019t be with you, I\u2019m here to protect you.\" said by Chance\n\"You are such a wonderful young woman. And I promise you, we will all be together again soon. But if you\u2019re going to catch your flight, you better scoot.\" said by Sharon\n\"I have a plainclothes officer outside in an unmarked car. His name\u2019s officer swift. He\u2019s gonna drive you to the airport and escort you to the gate. I\u2019m gonna stay here with your mother so all bases are covered.\" said by Chance\n\"I hate leaving you with this guy in town.\" said by Faith\n\"I am not afraid of him. And I do not want you worrying about me. You text me from your seat before you take off. Promise me.\" said by Sharon\n\"I will.\" said by Faith\n\"All right. Give me a hug. Okay. Remember to drink water. Stay hydrated. Those planes are very dry.\" said by Sharon\n\"[ Chuckling ] Okay. Hydrate. Got it.\" said by Faith\n\"Come on. I\u2019ll walk you out.\" said by Chance\n\"I love you. Bye.\" said by Faith\n\"I love you. Safe flighT. And we\u2019re done.\" said by Sharon\n\"I really appreciate you coming by. But shouldn\u2019t you be out there looking for cameron?\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, I got my team and victor\u2019s guys on high alert. I\u2019m gonna stay put, if that\u2019s okay? I\u2019m sure as hell not gonna leave you here alone. Plus i told nick I\u2019d look after you. So, just feel free to ignore me and go back to business.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, I can\u2019t just putter around you like you\u2019re the furniture.\" said by Sharon\n\"Ah, sure you can. I\u2019ll blend right in. You\u2019ll be mistaking me for an old ottoman in no time.\" said by Chance\n\"[ Laughing ] Somehow I doubt that.\" said by Sharon\n\"It\u2019s nice to hear you laugh again.\" said by Chance\n\"Well\u2026 you\u2019re a positive influence.

I wanna be as confident as you are that thomas is just fine around hope.\" said by Liam\n\"It\u2019s just that history suggests otherwise? I understand your hesitation.\" said by Steffy\n\"Well, yeah, I mean, like, it wasn\u2019t even that long ago that you had to take a hard line with the guy, like you kicked him out of the company.\" said by Liam\n\"I did, yeah, I promised thomas that he wouldn\u2019t be working on hope\u2019s line. He wasn\u2019t even allowed here in this building. If I thought thomas was the same man he used to be, lying and manipulating, I would not expose hope to that kind of trauma. And I\u2013 and I wouldn\u2019t put her or your marriage in harm\u2019s way.\" said by Steffy\n\"I know. You really think he\u2019s changed?\" said by Liam\n\"Yeah, I do.\" said by Steffy\n\"It\u2019s just, like, he\u2019s made this claim before, you know that he\u2019s all better now and we know what happened then or what always happens. I\u2019m not, I\u2013 I sound like I\u2019m not trying to trash your brother. In fact, I\u2019m really happy that you\u2019re confident about him. I just\u2026 okay, let\u2019s say this is legit, right? And he really is working on himself. He\u2019s trying to be a better man. Things can go wrong. Like what if it doesn\u2019t last? What\u2013 what\u2013 what does that mean for hope then?

You can only say things like that if it comes from love?\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah.\" said by Johnny\n\"Ah. You two still gaming together?\" said by Billy\n\"We haven\u2019t played much lately.\" said by Johnny\n\"Too much homework?\" said by Billy\n\"Not for me. Also, when I try to talk to him at school, it\u2019s like, I don\u2019t know, like he\u2019s avoiding me.\" said by Johnny\n\"Really? Why? Why do you think that is?\" said by Billy\n\"Don\u2019t know. Maybe there\u2019s something going on that no one\u2019s told me about.\" said by Johnny\n\"[ Sighs ] Yeah. Look, um\u2026 your uncle adam is having another baby. A girl.\" said by Billy\n\"With sally?\" said by Johnny\n\"Yes, with sally. Which, you know, gets a little awkward because your uncle nick is dating sally.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, at least she\u2019s gonna be too little to talk all day long. Unlike some people I know\u2013\" said by Johnny\n\"Easy. You are talking about my daughter, young man.\" said by Billy\n\"Mm. Well, maybe connor\u2019s getting the better deal with his sister. When he gets here I\u2019ll offer him to trade.\" said by Johnny\n\"Trade what?\" said by Connor\n\"You ready? Don\u2019t be nervous. Oh, look who it is.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, my gosh! Will you look at this handsome little man?\" said by Harmony\n\"Dominic\u2026\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, my gosh.\" said by Harmony\n\"\u2026I want you to meet your grandma.\" said by Devon\n\"Well, hello.\" said by Harmony\n\"Say hi.\" said by Devon\n\"How are you? Aren\u2019t you just the cutest little thing! Oh, my god! [ Laughs ]\" said by Harmony\n\"Say hello. You wanna hold him?\" said by Devon\n\"Yes.\" said by Harmony\n\"Yeah?\" said by Devon\n\"Ah. Oh, my god. We are gonna have the best time today. Do you know that? Look at your cute little outfit. Look at your dinosaur that matches your dinosaur. Aren\u2019t you just the most precious thing in the world?\" said by Harmony\n\"Say, \u201cthank you, grandma.\u201d\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, you are all mine today. You are. Yes, you are. Will you look at this face?\" said by Harmony\n\"I know.\" said by Devon\n\"This face. Ah, it reminds you how the world is just a wondrous place. Full of miracles. Yes, it is. Want luxury hair repair that doesn\u2019t cost $50?\" said by Harmony\n\"Sorry we kept you guys waiting.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Oh, that\u2019s all right. It\u2019s all right. Is everything good?\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s good.\" said by Chelsea\n\"So, what are we trading?\" said by Connor\n\"Well, I was just telling johnny that you are expecting a new baby sister.\" said by Billy\n\"Welcome to the big brothers club.\" said by Johnny\n\"Right. Whoop-de-doo.\" said by Connor\n\"Oh, here\u2019s the good news. She\u2019s not living under your roof and she\u2019ll be too little to talk, so\u2026\" said by Johnny\n\"I\u2019m not hungry. I just wanna go home.\" said by Connor\n\"Really? This is the first time this kid\u2019s ever turned down a snack.\" said by Chelsea\n\"You know, there are benefits to having a sister. There are. Why don\u2019t you fill him in? Tell\u2013 tell the young man all the great things.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, first time she burps the way you taught her to, that\u2019s cool. Also, you can take your broccoli from your plate and just put it on her plate\u2013\" said by Johnny\n\"Okay. You\u2019re done. Cut off.\" said by Billy\n\"Hey, I speak the truth.\" said by Johnny\n\"Don\u2019t listen to anything he says.\" said by Billy\n\"What can we get you, sweetheart? Do you want a pizza?\" said by Chelsea\n\"I\u2019m in.\" said by Johnny\n\"What do you want, buddy?\" said by Billy\n\"Nothing.\" said by Connor\n\"Nothing like nothing on your pizza or just like nothing at all?\" said by Billy\n\"Nothing! At all.\" said by Connor\n\"You know, you\u2019re definitely gonna have to visit a lot more often \u2019cause dominic clearly is in love with you. You wore him out.\" said by Devon\n\"[ Laughs ] That\u2019s the joy of being a grandmother, you know? It\u2019s a different kind of love.\" said by Harmony\n\"Yeah, I guess so.\" said by Devon\n\"You know it makes me think of my own mother? God, she used to love you up.\" said by Harmony\n\"Oh, I remember. I was very lucky. I\u2019ve had a lot of incredible people in my life.\" said by Devon\n\"Yes. And you\u2019re making every single one of them incredibly proud.\" said by Harmony\n\"Yeah.\" said by Devon\n\"Especially as a dad.\" said by Harmony\n\"Well, that means everything to me. So, thank you.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. And now you\u2019ve got tucker on your side.\" said by Harmony\n\"Mm.\" said by Devon\n\"I mean, it\u2019s good of him to be making the effort, I suppose.\" said by Harmony\n\"Yeah. It\u2019s better late than never.\" said by Devon\n\"You gotta give the guy some credit, right?\" said by Harmony\n\"Do I?\" said by Devon\n\"[ Sighs ] Listen, okay? The sad and awful truth is, is not everybody\u2019s cut out to be a parent. Okay? And\u2013 or takes to it as naturally as neil did. And by the time most people figure that out about themselves, it\u2019s too late. You\u2019re lucky to have had him.\" said by Harmony\n\"Yeah. I\u2026 having neil as a role model has changed my whole world. I wanna ask you a question, though.\" said by Devon\n\"Ask away.\" said by Harmony\n\"I know I kinda put you on the spot the other night when I asked your opinion about me changing my last name.\" said by Devon\n\"You mean like all those people standing around? What would I have said if it was just the two of us?\" said by Harmony\n\"Yeah, something like that.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay. Well, here\u2019s your chance.\" said by Harmony\n\"Okay. Are you really okay with me doing that? And going by devon winters?\" said by Devon\n\"I feel like I\u2019ve been called into the principal\u2019s office. What\u2019s my offense? Was that your half a grapefruit I ate this morning?\" said by Tucker\n\"What is your excuse for what you did to diane?\" said by Jack\n\"You\u2019re gonna have to be more specific.\" said by Tucker\n\"Trying to convince her to leave town right after I managed to get a judge to allow us to post bail. Why would you put her freedom in jeopardy?\" said by Jack\n\"Is that how she framed it? That\u2019s not wholly accurate. I just helped her face facts.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, and what are the facts according to tucker mccall?\" said by Jack\n\"Well, the evidence is starting to pile up against her, jack. And she\u2019s got her checkered past to contend with also. So, I merely illustrated her choices, which are, according to tucker mccall, uh, to re-traumatize you and her son by putting you both through a very public trial, which will most likely lead to her conviction, or she can leave.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, so, did you give her this little pep talk at ashley\u2019s behest?\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. No. No, not at all. You know, diane and I have a history of our own, and I care about her.\" said by Tucker\n\"She does not need you to tell her what she is up against.\" said by Jack\n\"I don\u2019t think you\u2019re quite getting what I\u2019m talking about here. She has to convince not only a judge, but half the people in this town, and her daughter-in-law, that she is blameless in this. And if you think that coming back to genoa city has earned diane anything but sneers and whispers, think again. And now she\u2019s charged with murder. And you think I\u2019m a bad guy for telling her to get out while she can? I used to wait to run my dishwasher\" said by Tucker\n\"As if that matters. Well, it matters to you, of course. But, jack, you know as well as I do, the people in this town never let go of anything. And this stain on diane is just gonna trickle down all the way to harrison.\" said by Tucker\n\"What are you talking about?\" said by ", "answer": "Jack"}

It gets me every time.\" said by Abby\n\"It gets me the same too.\" said by Devon\n\"Well, you seem preoccupied. What is that? Work?\" said by Abby\n\"Uh, yeah, it is. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve just been playing catch up with lily out of town visiting charlie in new york, so I\u2019ve had more work on my plate, but it\u2019s all good.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh. Well, I love that you\u2019re excited to go back to chancellor-winters. I think it\u2019s a blessing the way everything worked out.\" said by Abby\n\"What do you mean by that?\" said by Devon\n\"Well, you know, I know tucker\u2019s on his best behavior right now, but I think it\u2019s good that you didn\u2019t buy his company and get wrapped up in him and mccall.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah, I agree with you. I\u2019m very happy that tucker\u2019s company is someone else\u2019s problem.\" said by Devon\n\"I dug up a little background on mccall\u2019s subsidiaries. There are a lot of vulnerable, weak spots. We should be able to find something we could take advantage of.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, I\u2019m really impressed. I love a business partner who is proactive and takes initiative.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, thank you. But you deserve all the credit. You have a way of inspiring the best in me.\" said by Nate\n\"Sorry to interrupt.

How do you do?\" said by Tucker\n\"Still in genoa city I see.\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah. Surprised?\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, you know, I heard you were sticking around despite your declaration that you were running off to greener pastures.\" said by Audra\n\"As\u2013 as you said, genoa city does have its appeal.\" said by Tucker\n\"I doubt it\u2019s the town\u2019s charm that kept you here. And I double doubt you decided to spend your newly rudderless, company-less existence playing pickleball.\" said by Audra\n\"Don\u2019t be so sure. I have a pretty good backhand.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, I can only assume the reason you\u2019re here is because you\u2019re still pining for the love of your life, ashley. And yet, um, where is she?\" said by Audra\n\"You\u2019re so funny. I can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re trying to convince me you\u2019re not jealous and you\u2019re actually are. Or you\u2019re not jealous in the least, but you\u2019d like to give me the impression that you\u2019re covering intense jealousy.\" said by Tucker\n\"So this textile company that victor signed over to marchetti is performing very well. Definitely helping out the bottom line. Kyle did a fantastic job getting that under the umbrella. Next would be the new line, jabot men\u2019s grooming collection.

What\u2019d you say?\" said by Jack\n\"I said what\u2019s the point in having coffee and talking about business when the only thought you have is on diane? Don\u2019t tell me this is a permanent condition.\" said by Billy\n\"I apologize. I have been distracted lately, but we\u2019re working on something that\u2019s going to really help her case.\" said by Jack\n\"Help how?\" said by Billy\n\"I can\u2019t get into the details right now, but suffice to say I am more hopeful than ever that we can clear diane\u2019s name.\" said by Jack\n\"That is good news. I\u2019m happy to hear that.\" said by Billy\n\"Which means I can officially get focused again on jabot. So, what can I take off your plate?

And dominic, we have a very busy morning together and then I have to go to society, and you just said that you have to cover for lily at work, so.\" said by Abby\n\"I know.

You cannot keep looking at me like that.\" said by Abby\n\"What\u2019s gonna happen?\" said by Devon\n\"We\u2019re not gonna get anything productive done today.\" said by Abby\n\"Well, we could actually be very productive, but it seems like you\u2019re kicking me out. I guess the honeymoon phase is over, huh?\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, no, no, no, no.\" said by Abby\n\"No?\" said by Devon\n\"No. The honeymoon phase has just begun. Hm. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t feel bad about kicking you out \u2019cause we have so much time to make lots and lots and lots of love. But right now you gotta go.\" said by Abby\n\"I gotta go?\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah, you gotta go.\" said by Abby\n\"I\u2019ll go. Bye.\" said by Devon\n\"Goodbye.\" said by Abby\n\"I love you.\" said by Devon\n\"I love you.\" said by Abby\n\"Love you more. Whoa. What\u2019s with all these boxes in the hallway?\" said by Devon\n\"I have no idea.\" said by Abby\n\"Looks like nate and elena are moving.\" said by Devon\n\"I think you should increase your marketing budget on those podcasts to maximize awareness and drive more audience interests.\" said by Victoria\n\"Right. Sounds good. Well, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I will get that in the works.\" said by Nate\n\"We need to talk about some budget issues with some of our newest acquisitions.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, really? Is that what you\u2019re so anxious to discuss with me? The budget issues?\" said by Victoria\n\"Yes, vic. Actually, that is why I\u2019m here.\" said by Nick\n\"Because I get the feeling that you actually want to turn this into another lecture.\" said by Victoria\n\"Why? Because I just happen to walk in on you and nate yet again?\" said by Nick\n\"Walk in? On what? Some chemistry? Oh, how dare we.\" said by Victoria\n\"I didn\u2019t say that.\" said by Nick\n\"No, no, you don\u2019t have to say much. You just glare at me and grit your teeth. You know, I\u2019m actually impressed you were able to hold back for so long. You obviously didn\u2019t hold your opinion back from dad. He was more than happy to interrogate me after you riled him all up.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, it\u2019s not like mom wasn\u2019t gonna tell him about it anyway. And what\u2019s the deal? Is your new hot relationship with nate a big secret? Well, elena knows about it and she\u2019s certainly not keeping it to herself.\" said by Nick\n\"It\u2019s not a secret. But I would\u2019ve appreciated the opportunity to share the news myself instead of being blindsided by dad.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay. You have a point. Maybe I did speak out of turn, but my concern is for the company right now.\" said by Nick\n\"Really? Well, then please explain to me again how it was perfectly fine for you to see sally while she was working here, but me seeing nate is somehow a recipe for disaster?\" said by Victoria\n\"You just love bringing up sally, don\u2019t you? Trying to compare what was happening with us and what is going on with you and nate. But you refuse to acknowledge one big difference.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, yeah? And what exactly is that?\" said by Victoria\n\"Sally was never gunning for my job.\" said by Nick\n\"Are you suggesting that I\u2019m jealous of what your puppy adoration of a woman who clearly doesn\u2019t feel the same way about you?\" said by Audra\n\"I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re not up to speed on current events, in that case.

Good for you, tucker.\" said by Audra\n\"Speaking of unrequited, how are things going with nate? You still banging your head against that wall?\" said by Tucker\n\"Actually, uh, things are going surprisingly well. You know, I\u2019d hope for a bit more, um, entertainment, but that was at first. Now, the situation as it stands, could work out better than I planned.\" said by Audra\n\"That\u2019s a fantastic way to look at it. I\u2019m surprised though because I know how much you like to be entertained. And you\u2019re at your most productive when you\u2019re mixing quite a bit of pleasure with your business.\" said by Tucker\n\"Nope. I am keeping things strictly business. You know, nate is hungry, smart, decisive. He\u2019s exactly the kind of partner that I need and want at this stage of my career. He\u2019s the right ticket to get me where I wanna be.\" said by Audra\n\"[Indistinct], Baby.\" said by Tucker\n\"Hm. You know, as opposed to a man who\u2019s only occasionally useful, mildly charming, but indecisive and weak willed and then lost everything he has in an embarrassing fashion.\" said by Audra\n\"Maybe you\u2019ve forgotten who you\u2019re talking to here. And what kind of milk?\" said by Tucker\n\"A coup. I cannot believe ashley is planning on making this move. It\u2019s not possible.\" said by Jack\n\"I said might be planning a coup. And coup is my word, not hers. But I know she floated the idea of convening the board in order to take a certain action against you.\" said by Billy\n\"I know she\u2019s upset about diane. I just never thought she would go so far as to make this move.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, she\u2019s concerned about the way diane has wormed her way back into your life in record time, despite a very checkered past. She\u2019s concerned about the undue influence that your fianc\u00e9e seems to have over you.\" said by Billy\n\"I\u2013 I thought her threats were just, you know, something she\u2019d blurted out in the heat of the moment, an intimidating tactic she had no intention of following through.\" said by ", "answer": "Jack"}

I mean\u2026 it makes sense why you were gone for so long.\" said by Steffy\n\"So, so bill, he\u2026he was never in love with sheila.\" said by Finn\n\"No! It was all part of the plan, and it worked.\" said by Ridge\n\"This is unbelievable.\" said by Hope\n\"So, how long had this been going on?\" said by Liam\n\"Well, when I reunited steffy and finn in monaco, and sheila got away, I knew she would keep turning up. Something had to be done. And then she escaped custody.\" said by Bill\n\"We all thought she died after that.\" said by Wyatt\n\"I never bought that absurd bear-mauling story. So I came up with a plan. One that would eliminate sheila from our lives once and for all.\" said by Bill\n\"Wow.

Sheila really did have a heart attack.\" said by Taylor\n\"What?\" said by Brooke\n\"Yeah.\" said by Taylor\n\"We all thought she was faking.\" said by Brooke\n\"Well, of course we did, because sheila. But no, she, she had a heart attack, and she survived.\" said by Taylor\n\"God. There\u2019s so much to talk about with all of this. But now that we have a moment alone, there are things that we need to discuss. Ridge is back.\" said by Brooke\n\"So, did you have any idea that ridge was back in L.A.?\" said by Taylor\n\"None. It was odd that he sort of fell out of touch.\" said by Brooke\n\"Yeah, yeah, it was. But you know, he, he told us he was gonna go off and do some soul searching, and, for ridge, that could take a while.\" said by Taylor\n\"And we could always reach him if we needed to. Bill and ridge, getting along. An unexpected pairing.\" said by Brooke\n\"Yeah, it is. I\u2019d say more unexpected than us.\" said by Taylor\n\"Speaking of, we really need to talk about ridge being back, and what that means for us, moving forward.\" said by Brooke\n\"I\u2019m not sure which is harder to believe, you faking a relationship with sheila all this time, or are you working together with ridge?\" said by Hope\n\"[ Chuckles ] Well, we had a common goal. Protecting our families.\" said by Bill\n\"I can\u2019t even put into words what a relief this is. Like, I hate you for putting us all through this, but at the same time, I\u2019m so happy you didn\u2019t lose your damn mind and fall in love with sheila.\" said by Liam\n\"Yeah, and I don\u2019t understand. If she was already in custody, why did you get her out?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Yeah. Why not just let her rot in prison?\" said by Liam\n\"Because she had to be arrested on a charge she couldn\u2019t beat, or get out early for good behavior. That had to be murder one.\" said by Bill\n\"Murder one?\" said by Wyatt\n\"So there were two guys who died in a very mysterious way, but they had one thing in common. You know what that is?\" said by Ridge\n\"Sheila.\" said by Steffy\n\"Sheila. Their murders were never solved, but baker was convinced that sheila had something to do with it. So, the only thing we had to do, is get her to confess.\" said by Ridge\n\"That\u2019s no easy task.\" said by Finn\n\"No. But bill did everything in his power to make sure that she would trust him, and she did. And admitted to one of the murders.\" said by Ridge\n\"One of them?\" said by Steffy\n\"Allegedly the other one was an accident.\" said by Ridge\n\"You believe her?\" said by Finn\n\"It doesn\u2019t matter if I believe her or not. The point is we just needed one to put her away.\" said by Ridge\n\"Okay, wait, wait. Everything that, that happened with mom, the blackmail, like, I\u2019m sure the police and the fbi heard about this.\" said by Steffy\n\"Alright, so bill made a deal with him to get her exonerated.\" said by Ridge\n\"Oh my god. That\u2019s amazing. So you, so you\u2019re telling me that we don\u2019t have to look over our shoulder for sheila ever again.\" said by Steffy\n\"No, you\u2019re safe.\" said by Ridge\n\"Because of you.\" said by Steffy\n\"Nahhhh. What\u2019s the #1 retinol brand\" said by Ridge\n\"I just can\u2019t believe you actually got sheila to, to admit to first degree murder.\" said by Liam\n\"I wasn\u2019t sure it would happen, but it did, and crystal clear for the audio.\" said by Bill\n\"That is amazing.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah.\" said by Bill\n\"She had to be stopped. Permanently. I couldn\u2019t let her terrorize our families ever again.\" said by Bill\n\"So let me make sure I got this straight here. For months, you and sheila were living together.\" said by Wyatt\n\"I think you know this part of the story, wyatt. Do you need a pop-up book version?\" said by Bill\n\"You had to make sure that she\u2026 she thought that she was the only one who understood you, right? That you loved her, that you wanted to marry her. But it didn\u2019t matter what anybody else thought, including your family.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Check on all the above. If she didn\u2019t buy it, think it was legitimate, she would have run or worse, stabbed me in the back when I was sleeping.\" said by Bill\n\"Right. So what are we talking, like, romantic nights? You know, long, like, cuddle sessions here by the fire? Bonding. Like, you know, sharing secrets.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Wow. You know, it\u2019s almost like you were there with us, wyatt.\" said by Bill\n\"Maybe we could, um, like I\u2019m actually getting physically ill.\" said by Liam\n\"So, so like, I mean, when the lights turned out and you guys go to go upstairs.\" said by Wyatt\n\"What are you doing right now?\" said by Liam\n\"Trying to see how far he had to go. And I wanna see you throw up. What?\" said by Wyatt\n\"I had to go as far as you could imagine, wyatt, and further than that.\" said by Bill\n\"Oh, god.\" said by Liam\n\"She had to completely buy my\u2026 my devotion.\" said by Bill\n\"You, like, you just put it all\u2026 you, you, you took one for the team.\" said by Wyatt\n\"I did it for everyone, wyatt. Gave it my all.\" said by Bill\n\"Oh jeez, why did I\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry. I, I retract that question.\" said by Wyatt\n\"You asked.\" said by Bill\n\"I need a drink. I apologize. I walked into that.\" said by Wyatt\n\"That explains the police officer outside sheila\u2019s hospital door.\" said by Finn\n\"Yeah. Yet, we assumed it was just security through bill. But I did find it odd that bill wasn\u2019t there. The supposed love of his life has a heart attack, and he\u2019s not by her side? He\u2019s not barking orders at doctors? The two of them, they have been inseparable.\" said by Steffy\n\"Well, now this all makes sense.\" said by Finn\n\"Does it? You do get that bill and sheila were never together, right? How could they be? I\u2019m sorry.\" said by Ridge\n\"Oh, no, don\u2019t be. Look, I\u2019m well aware who sheila is and what she\u2019s capable of. I got the scar to prove it. I\u2019m just grateful for you and bill for making sure that she\u2019s locked away and never see daylight again.\" said by Finn\n\"We can move on with our lives.\" said by Ridge\n\"This whole time that ridge was away, you know, he\u2019s been keeping an eye on sheila, making sure that we\u2019re safe. But bill, he\u2019s the one that\u2019s had to do all the dirty work, you know. Pretending that he was in love with sheila.\" said by Taylor\n\"Oooof. He had to live with her. He had to sleep with her. All to protect his family. It was strange. It wasn\u2019t the bill I knew. When he was with her, he couldn\u2019t even speak. Sheila had to speak for him. It was like he was under a spell. It turned out it was the other way around. He was calling the shots.\" said by Brooke\n\"Yeah. Yeah, he was. But, you know, I was thinking about that. I wonder\u2026 I wonder how it affected him mentally, you know? Just, oh, god, I\u2019d love to get him on my couch. Let me\u2013\" said by Taylor\n\"Ohhhhh.\" said by Brooke\n\"Shrink couch.\" said by Taylor\n\"Okay.\" said by Brooke\n\"Yeah.\" said by Taylor\n\"Well, I don\u2019t think he would get on your shrink couch and talk about his \u201cfeelings.\u201d\" said by Brooke\n\"No, I\u2019m sure that he wouldn\u2019T. You know. But, you know what? We should do something for them. For bill and ridge, you know? They\u2019re kinda like superheroes. We can throw them a batman and robin theme party.\" said by Taylor\n\"Oh! [ Laughing ] That would be fun, actually. It\u2019d be good. I think that would help, kind of, get them back into life, you know.\" said by Brooke\n\"Yeah.\" said by Taylor\n\"You know\u2026 ridge went away to\u2026 try to figure out life and what he wants. So I think he\u2019ll have some things to say to us.\" said by Brooke\n\"I know. I\u2013 whatever it is, it doesn\u2019t matter. I wanna keep it separate from what you and I have built. Brooke, it\u2019s really important to me, our friendship. It really is. I don\u2019t want to lose it. Good food tastes better with a dollop of daisy\" said by Taylor\n\"Let me, let me just ask you this, your professional opinion. You think this heart attack was real?\" said by Ridge\n\"Yeah, she almost died.\" said by Finn\n\"Would have, if finn hadn\u2019t saved her.\" said by Steffy\n\"You saved her?

I think we both just realized that when two people think they\u2019re right, they stop listening.\" said by Lily\n\"And so I decided to pay attention to what lily was actually asking of me. And I did what I knew our dad would want me to do if he were here.\" said by Devon\n\"And I think we both realized, too, that we were heading down a path where we were really damaging our relationship.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah.

Chance has him tomorrow, so i have to wait until then to see him, but \u2014 I don\u2019t know. Some stupid visitation agreement or something.\" said by Nina\n\"Yeah, no, I know it\u2019s hard. But from what I understand, chance is handling it pretty well. Speaking of which, where is he?\" said by Christine\n\"Oh, he\u2019s on some big stakeout or something? I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll be here later. Geez. Police work, right? It never ends.\" said by Nina\n\"Mm-hmm. Yeah. I know about that.\" said by Christine\n\"So, where\u2019s paul?

Honoring neil, the excitement.\" said by Esther\n\"Oh, we\u2019re so glad you could be here.\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh, me too. Mrs. C would have loved every minute of this, from the planning to the designing to greeting every guest at the door.\" said by Esther\n\"And the very last to leave.\" said by Nikki\n\"[ Laughs ] Boy, she sure knew how to throw a party. She brought out the best in people.\" said by Esther\n\"Mm. I can see her now in an incredible gown, making her way through the crowd.\" said by Nikki\n\"Yeah.

I just wanna make sure we\u2019re paying attention to the deal points. Not let any of the details get lost in our excitement over the acquisition.\" said by Nate\n\"I would never let that happen, nor would my legal team.

Boy or girl, really makes no difference. I mean, beyond the basics.

And the rest of it, you just figure out as they grow up.\" said by Sharon\n\"Oh, I hope that is true.\" said by Adam\n\"You sound doubtful.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, having a girl, I have been thinking a lot about my mom.

You are always a good dad to connor.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yep. It\u2019s easier. He\u2019s a boy. You know, I start with the obvious, just don\u2019t be like me or my father.\" said by Adam\n\"I think you\u2019re selling yourself short. You\u2019ll be just as good of a dad to a baby girl.\" said by Sharon\n\"I agree. Oh, I haven\u2019t seen this little nugget since mariah and tessa first brought her home.\" said by Sally\n\"That\u2019s right. You two were here that day.

You don\u2019t sound surprised or overly concerned.\" said by Nick\n\"Are you?\" said by Victor\n\"Yes, I am. It\u2019s wrong on many different levels. I mean, this guy went from chief of surgery to now running newman media in how much time? He tried and failed to take over his own family\u2019s company and now he\u2019s here. He\u2019s got this thing with vic. It\u2019s not right. It\u2019s not safe for her, dad, or newman enterprises.\" said by Nick\n\"So how do you feel about elena moving out and moving on?\" said by Victoria\n\"Like I said, it was inevitable. We had grown in different directions, had different priorities.\" said by Nate\n\"That doesn\u2019t make it easy.\" said by Victoria\n\"I\u2019m not gonna say I don\u2019t feel responsible for what happened because I do. Sometimes, the guilt is intense.\" said by Nate\n\"You know, we\u2019ve talked about this before. Sometimes when relationships fail, it\u2019s not usually just one person\u2019s fault.\" said by Victoria\n\"It\u2019s true. We drifted apart once I left my job at the hospital. Once we didn\u2019t have that in common, it was tough. That bond was a big part of our relationship.\" said by Nate\n\"Yes, exactly. People change, they grow in different directions. You can\u2019t blame yourself for that.\" said by Victoria\n\"But I gotta own that I cheated on her. And I feel awful for the pain that I caused her. And now that people are starting to find out about us breaking up, that wound is gonna keep getting reopened. There are gonna be questions about why.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, yes. And when people find out that I am the why, does that mean you\u2019re gonna change your mind about us?\" said by Victoria\n\"Absolutely not. My mind\u2019s made up. My a1c was up here; now, it\u2019s down with rybelsus.\" said by Nate\n\"So, anyone who questions why you and elena broke up, that\u2019s gonna be your response?\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, these lips can be persuasive.\" said by Nate\n\"Very.\" said by Victoria\n\"Look, I\u2019m not proud of how things went down with elena, but that\u2019s for me to work out. I don\u2019t want you to think I hold you responsible.\" said by Nate\n\"Mm. I\u2019m a little\u2013 little bit responsible.\" said by Victoria\n\"For being irresistible.\" said by Nate\n\"Do you wanna get outta here? Let\u2019s go get a drink.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah.\" said by Nate\n\"All right.\" said by Victoria\n\"Gosh, I never imagined in a million years I\u2019d see them on a dance floor together. I\u2019ll tell you this.\" said by Devon\n\"[ Laughs ] I know.\" said by Ashley\n\"I am surprised that you\u2019re out so late and dancing nonetheless.\" said by Abby\n\"Are you insinuating that I\u2019m old?\" said by Tucker\n\"No, I\u2019m just saying, I don\u2019t know.

But, uh, all that kid energy really invigorated me.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, spend a week with dominic banging on one of those little drums and we\u2019ll see how you feel about it.\" said by Abby\n\"Is that a challenge from you?

And are you finally ready to tell me what\u2019s actually going on?\" said by Elena\n\"Hi, mom.\" said by Mariah\n\"Well, hey. What are you doing here?\" said by Sharon\n\"There\u2019s the maternal warmth I was looking for?\" said by Mariah\n\"No, i am being maternal. It was just A\u2026reflex because I know that you hate leaving tessa and the baby at home, and who could blame you? But I\u2019m always glad to see you.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, I am going to be heading home soon, but I just wanted to come here, pick up some treats and some much needed coffee on my way back from jabot.\" said by Mariah\n\"The office? Why? I thought you were on parental leave.\" said by Sharon\n\"I am, but, uh, with diane\u2019s arrest, I just thought I could put in a few hours at work.

Oh.\" said by Abby\n\"My gosh.\" said by Mariah\n\"Welcome home. How are you and tessa doing?\" said by Abby\n\"Uh, we are exhausted, but deliriously happy.\" said by Mariah\n\"Well, I remember the feeling. When can I meet little aria? If you ever want to sneak in a nap, I can totally babysit.\" said by Abby\n\"I\u2019m going to take you up on that. Uh, how are you? I know we haven\u2019t spoken since the divorce finalized.\" said by Mariah\n\"Uh, I\u2019m\u2013I\u2019m okay. You know, it can be a little complicated, but it\u2019s not all bad, which probably sounds terrible under the circumstances.\" said by Abby\n\"If you and chance weren\u2019t happy, I\u2026 I totally understand, you know? And eventually, you\u2019ll both move on with your lives.\" said by Mariah\n\"About that, um\u2026 I have some news, and I wanted you to hear it from me directly. It\u2019s something I didn\u2019t see coming until it happened.\" said by Abby\n\"So this feels very decadent, but what the hell? We\u2019re celebrating, right?\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah.\" said by Tucker\n\"Cheers.\" said by Ashley\n\"Cheers. Mm. I have orange juice if you\u2019d prefer.\" said by Tucker\n\"Would you please just tell me what happened when devon finally came around? Take it slow. Tell me the story.\" said by Ashley\n\"Sadly, that\u2019s one thing I can\u2019t offer you. Devon has decided to go back to chancellor-winters rather than take over mccall.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, that\u2019S\u2026 that\u2019s very disappointing.\" said by Ashley\n\"I\u2019m sorry. Sorry that I couldn\u2019t pull off the one task you gave me.\" said by Tucker\n\"Why are we drinking champagne? I mean\u2026\" said by Ashley\n\"I\u2019m hoping we can toast to us. I\u2019m appealing to your better angels, ashley. I haven\u2019t given up on becoming the man that you want and deserve.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, you\u2019re certainly taking your defeat in stride.\" said by Ashley\n\"Hmm. Actually, I was really stung by devon\u2019s rejection. Actually, no, not stung. I was hurt because it\u2019s been my dream to have my son take over my company and continue my legacy. But while I am disappointed for myself, I\u2019m very happy for devon and lily, because they have this really strong bond that\u2019s rare and to be cherished.\" said by Tucker\n\"You\u2019re so upbeat and magnanimous about the whole thing.\" said by Ashley\n\"And don\u2019t be so surprised. I am capable of both those things. And I think I have reason to be positive \u2019cause I give myself a little credit for devon\u2019s current happiness.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, that\u2019s a shock. You give yourself credit? Why is that?\" said by Ashley\n\"For providing him an alternative. Because when I laid out the possibility that he might sever ties with chancellor-winters and lily to take over mccall, I\u2019d like to think that inspired lily to make peace. So in a way, I did devon a service, and I\u2019m proud of that. And I hope you can be proud of me, too.\" said by Tucker\n\"Nate and I went over your langston report, and we have decided to make an offer to buy the company.\" said by Victoria\n\"That\u2019s great news.\" said by Audra\n\"I have some notes, and nate will email you the details, if he hasn\u2019t already.\" said by Victoria\n\"Uh, this is the first I\u2019m hearing about it. Uh, when did you two exactly decide to greenlight the deal?\" said by Audra\n\"Yesterday.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh.\" said by Audra\n\"You know, uh\u2026\" said by Victoria\n\"Understood. I just like to stay on top of things, like I imagine you do.\" said by Audra\n\"You\u2019ve made that abundantly clear. You\u2019re always going above and beyond, aren\u2019t you?\" said by Victoria\n\"[Chuckles] Is\u2013is that a compliment or a criticism? Look, I hope I didn\u2019t offend you during our last meeting when I talked about my own ambitions.\" said by Audra\n\"I don\u2019t offend easily.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, if there\u2019s any question, let me go on the record now. I am absolutely a team player.\" said by Audra\n\"That\u2019s good. Very good. I respect ambition, but I respect loyalty even more.\" said by Victoria\n\"I plan to emulate nate in that regard.\" said by Audra\n\"Meaning?\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, you know, just that nate\u2019s really putting in the hours and working day and night to satisfy you. There\u2019s no doubt where his loyalty lies.\" said by Audra\n\"I wasn\u2019t trying to avoid you or your questions last night. You got called into that emergency at the hospital. There wasn\u2019t much time for talking.\" said by Nate\n\"Okay. Well, we\u2019re both here now, so why is nick upset with you?\" said by Elena\n\"Truth is, he\u2019s never been thrilled that I took the job to run newman media.\" said by Nate\n\"Because victoria got rid of sally against his wishes?\" said by Elena\n\"And due to the way I left chancellor-winters. He felt like I sold out my family for a better job at newman.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh. Didn\u2019t realize you guys had such a frank conversation about it. Although I can see why he might have felt that way.\" said by Elena\n\"Because you felt the same way.\" said by Nate\n\"Luckily, we were able to get through it.\" said by Elena\n\"And I was hoping, uh, nick and I could as well. I told him I would try my best to gain his trust, you know, work hard to prove myself to him. But I guess that second chance isn\u2019t going to happen now.\" said by Nate\n\"Why? What happened yesterday?\" said by Elena\n\"[Sighs] Nick\u2019s emotions are running hot because of phyllis\u2019 death, and he might have heard something at newman that set him off.\" said by Nate\n\"Like what?\" said by Elena\n\"I\u2019m not exactly sure, but victoria loops me in on things more often than nick would like, and that doesn\u2019t sit well with him.\" said by Nate\n\"So you\u2019re saying your access to victoria is causing more problems between you?\" said by Elena\n\"Yeah, and there\u2019s nothing I could do about it. I have to take my cues from my boss.\" said by Nate\n\"Right. So let\u2019s talk about you and victoria. There are times, I wonder\u2026\" said by Elena\n\"Devon asked me to move in with him. And after some thought, dom and I moved into his penthouse yesterday.\" said by Abby\n\"Wow. [Laughs] Uh\u2026yeah, that\u2026that is, uh\u2026 that\u2019s big news. Sorry, I just need a minute to kind of wrap my head around that.\" said by Mariah\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s been most people\u2019s reaction. Sharon, you don\u2019t seem surprised.\" said by Abby\n\"Oh. Uh\u2026 well, chance mentioned it.\" said by Sharon\n\"Right. Yeah. I\u2019m\u2013I know the two of you have become friends. Um\u2026 I\u2019m really happy that he has someone to talk to. He doesn\u2019t want to discuss things with me recently, which I don\u2019t blame him for, so\u2026\" said by Abby\n\"Abby, you know that I love you and devon and chance. I\u2019m in all of your corners. I just didn\u2019t know that you and devon were so serious already. Just, it does seem a little fast.\" said by Mariah\n\"I totally get that. Yes, it does seem fast, but\u2026 I don\u2019t know. It\u2026 it just feels right. After talking to chance, of course, and he didn\u2019t object. I know this can\u2019t be easy for him, but he has been very mature, and he has handled things very civilly.\" said by Abby\n\"Well, it\u2019s probably been difficult for him, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s just going to continue to do what\u2019s best for dom.\" said by ", "answer": "Mariah"}

There\u2019s no secret that he wants you back now that this whole sheila saga is over.\" said by Carter\n\"Does that bother you?\" said by Katie\n\"It makes sense. Bill wasn\u2019t bill when he was with her, but now that he\u2019s himself again, he wants his life back. Any man would.\" said by Carter\n\"It always still amazes that after all this time worrying and wondering what life-threatening thing that sheila was going to pull next, she is finally out of our lives for good.\" said by Hope\n\"Well, it was something that had to be done.\" said by Deacon\n\"Well, of course it had to be done, after all the chaos that she\u2019s caused in everyone\u2019s life.

Bill said that he was able to confront sheila to tell her exactly what he thought of her and that taylor deserved the same opportunity and I agree. She lost a lot because of sheila.\" said by Katie\n\"Yeah, she almost lost her daughter. She shot finn and steffy in cold blood. Yeah, I can imagine taylor has a few things to get off her chest.\" said by Carter\n\"Yeah, and sheila is a captive audience.\" said by Katie\n\"Hm.

They have to.\" said by Steffy\n\"Well, imagine if they don\u2019t, the repercussions.\" said by Finn\n\"Don\u2019t even go there.\" said by Steffy\n\"Well, this has to be the worst-case scenario for liam. I mean, it\u2019s hope and thomas.\" said by Finn\n\"Yeah, but luckily, nothing else happened. It was just a kiss.\" said by Steffy\n\"Which is bad enough.\" said by Finn\n\"Right. Well, maybe we shouldn\u2019t read too much into it.\" said by Steffy\n\"I guess we\u2019re just gonna to have to wait and see how this all plays out.\" said by Finn\n\"Yeah, I\u2019m just praying that liam realizes this was a fleeting moment and hope just got caught up in the fairy tale.\" said by Steffy\n\"Well, let\u2019s hope that their marriage can survive what happened in rome.\" said by Finn\n\"Liam.

You haven\u2019t said it. \u201cLiam, please let me explain\u201d? I don\u2019t know how to do that. How do I let you explain this? There\u2019s no explanation for this.\" said by Liam\n\"No, you\u2019re right.\" said by Hope\n\"After everything that he\u2019s done to us, after all the times that he\u2019s targeted you.

You initiated, not thomas. You. You wanted it, and I gotta live with it. I don\u2019t get to purge that from my head. I don\u2019t\u2013 sorry, I\u2019m feeling a little sick. Just give me a moment.

You were working behind the scenes to try to push me me towards hollis or deacon.\" said by Brooke\n\"Oh, my god, would\u2013 would you stop? You know that isn\u2019t true. Hollis was just for fun. And deacon\u2013\" said by Taylor\n\"And you went to ridge and you told him not to have anything to do with me. Meanwhile, you were throwing yourself at him.\" said by Brooke\n\"Yes, that was\u2013 that was after I started putting all the pieces together, brooke. When I started to realize that you had not been honest or transparent with me about a few things. You continued to lie to me about what was building between you and ridge.\" said by Taylor\n\"Everything that you\u2019re doing and saying right now, this is just a justification for doing what you did\u2013 pushing me to these other men, anybody besides ridge.\" said by Brooke\n\"It\u2019s not true. I didn\u2019t have some calculated scheme to just set you up with men.\" said by Taylor\n\"Keep saying that. I don\u2019t believe it.\" said by Brooke\n\"I don\u2019t care what you believe. Because this whole time you\u2019ve just been playing your old dusty destiny card to get exactly what you want, and that\u2019s ridge.\" said by Taylor\n\"Thomas, can we talk about how you absolutely crushed it? Dude, hope for the future has been trending all week, and that\u2019s all you and hope, man.\" said by Rj\n\"I really appreciate that, and I appreciate your support, you posting about the event, that\u2019s awesome.\" said by Thomas\n\"No problem, man. Whatever I can do to help.\" said by Rj\n\"You know, he\u2019s right. Every look was a masterpiece.\" said by Ridge\n\"Yeah, it was pretty awesome, the whole experience.\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah.\" said by Ridge\n\"Well, I\u2019m sure the whole trip to rome is something you\u2019re never gonna forget.\" said by Rj\n\"Liam. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry.\" said by Hope\n\"You\u2019re sorry? You have no idea, do you? I was so excited to surprise you, to see you, take you on the stella maris for the weekend.\" said by Liam\n\"We can still do that.\" said by Hope\n\"I don\u2019t think you understand. You knew\u2026 how I felt for months. You knew what it meant to me. You knew what it would do to me. You knew how much it would hurt me. And you blew me off and you blew me off and you blew me off over and over and over again. You told me there was nothing to worry about. I don\u2019t know what to do, now that I know I can\u2019t trust you anymore. I don\u2019t know what to say. Everything I knew to be true, everything I believed in, everything I thought you stood for\u2013 honesty, integrity, family.

You were the one throwing yourself at ridge. And, oh, yeah, you invited yourself to italy when you had no reason to be there.\" said by Brooke\n\"No reason. This was a huge moment for thomas and I wanted to be there for my kids.\" said by Taylor\n\"Okay. What about all those dinners that we shared together? The movie nights, sharing popcorn in our pjs?

They would be a huge client. I mean, they have tons of offices and restaurants and hotels, all kinds of properties that could use interior design.

That way, chloe and I have specific recommendations we can give to jill and impress her all over again.\" said by Sally\n\"That\u2019s excellent thinking. Where are all these properties?

I mean, you weren\u2019t planning on staying in this hotel forever, were you?\" said by Adam\n\"Well, no. I mean, obviously, I would like more room. I just haven\u2019t gotten around to, you know, beginning the process, calling realtors, looking at properties.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, yeah, I mean, i understand it\u2019s the beginning stages.

I know your folks moved around a lot when you were a kid and they never gave you a place to call home. But you and our child \u2014 you can have a nursery to read bedtime stories.

I know that it\u2019s a lot to ask, but could you please not tell grandpa about this?

I mean, for me to know and not tell him\u2026\" said by Nikki\n\"I know. I know. I know. It was really unfair for me to dump all of this on you, but i just \u2014 I needed to talk to somebody who would be just as horrified as I am, but the thing is, if grandpa confronts dad about this before he\u2019s ready, it\u2019s gonna cause this huge conflict. And nobody wants that, right?\" said by Summer\n\"Wow. As rationalizations go, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s a bit of a stretch, summer. But\u2026alright. For the sake of the baby. It\u2019s not healthy to have stress during pregnancy.\" said by Nikki\n\"Thank you.\" said by Summer\n\"I wish that nicholas would tell victor already, but he\u2019s probably too embarrassed and upset, doesn\u2019t want to talk about it.\" said by Nikki\n\"This is the thing, grandma. He\u2019s not wallowing in self-pity. Dad is actually still seeing sally.\" said by Summer\n\"They\u2019re not breaking up?\" said by Nikki\n\"[ Exhales sharply ] I guess this thing with adam was a one-time occasion and sally doesn\u2019t have any desire to get back together with him.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, no, sure. Why should she? She can have nicholas.\" said by Nikki\n\"I actually think that I\u2019m the most upset about all of this. And I kind of blew up at sally. I told her how selfish I thought she was being and how she\u2019s using my dad. And then dad came over and told me how wrong I was and how this hasn\u2019t changed his feelings for sally at all.\" said by Summer\n\"Unbelievable. He is too noble for his own good.\" said by Nikki\n\"I know, right? It\u2019s like he can\u2019t see what\u2019s going on, and it kills me.\" said by Summer\n\"Trust me. I know exactly how you feel.\" said by Nikki\n\"I wish that this could all work out for dad. I really do but when I play it out in my head, there\u2019s really only one word that could sum it up.\" said by Summer\n\"\u201cDisaster.\u201d I mean, how can he think that they can stay together when she is having his brother\u2019s child?

You\u2013 you actually have both of us here, and good timing, and we just finished up with the meeting.\" said by Hope\n\"Hey.\" said by Thomas\n\"Apologies, but I\u2019m afraid we\u2019re having some mechanical issues.\" said by Trevor\n\"Come on.\" said by Hope\n\"I know. Look, I\u2013 I know you want to get home to liam, I just\u2026 feel terrible. No two bodies are the same.\" said by Thomas\n\"I can\u2019t believe this. I mean, of course! Of course the jet is having mechanical issues when I happen to be here with you. I mean, liam is going to love this.\" said by Hope\n\"Okay, but it\u2019s a non-issue if I can get you on a commercial flight, right?\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah, except I don\u2019t see any that are available and you\u2019ve been on hold forever, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good thing or a bad thing.\" said by Hope\n\"We\u2019ll know soon enough.\" said by Thomas\n\"[ Sighs ] Thank you, for trying to help me get home.\" said by Hope\n\"You\u2019re welcome. But\u2013 but don\u2019t worry about this, I know that you want to get home to liam and the family, but\u2026 think about what we just did today. I mean, we were supposed to impress those buyers, and we did, and that\u2019s great for the line.\" said by Thomas\n\"Oh, yeah. Hell yeah, we did.\" said by Hope\n\"It\u2019s amazing teamwork.\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah, it was almost like we were finishing each other\u2019s sentences.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah, like one mind and two voices. It\u2019s weird.\" said by Thomas\n\"Oh, I don\u2019t know. I was\u2013 I was having so much fun, I forgot to be nervous.\" said by Hope\n\"Oh. You don\u2019t have to be. Not when I\u2019m around. Yeah, I\u2019m here. What does that mean? All right, yeah. Thank you very much. Okay. Okay, so, um, bad news. Uh, by the time you got to the airport, there\u2019s only one more flight out tonight, and it\u2019s fully booked.\" said by Thomas\n\"Dammit!\" said by Hope\n\"I know, I\u2019m sorry.\" said by Thomas\n\"No, no, it is fine, it is no one\u2019s fault, it\u2019s just, I had already texted liam after the meeting that I would be home soon, and that\u2019s what he will be expecting. Me, walking through the door, not spending the night here with you. Oh, this isn\u2019t good.\" said by Hope\n\"Look, I\u2013 I get why you\u2019re wary of thomas. His past, and I understand why you don\u2019t like the idea of hope and thomas jetting off together.\" said by Steffy\n\"I mean, yeah. From where I\u2019m sittin\u2019, it\u2019s just a recipe for disaster, but who am I kidding? I don\u2019t like them together in any context, so\u2013\" said by Liam\n\"Look, I don\u2019t know how many times I need to reassure you. But thomas has changed. He\u2019s focused on work. Saving hope for the future with designs only he can create. And they make a fantastic team. I think you need to think about that. Be a little thankful.\" said by Steffy\n\"Ah\u2013 well, meeting\u2019s over and hope\u2019s on her way home, and I\u2019m definitely thankful for that, so\u2013\" said by Liam\n\"Thanks.\" said by Hope\n\"So\u2026 yeah, I can\u2019t wait for you to get home so we can celebrate properly.\" said by Liam\n\"Um, well, me\u2013 me too, but unfortunately, there is a bit of a problem.\" said by Hope\n\"I, uh\u2013 I thought that the buyers loved it.\" said by Liam\n\"The jet is having mechanical issues.\" said by Hope\n\"Oh. Uh, all right. Well, hey. It\u2019s a good thing you figured that out when you\u2019re still on the ground. Right? \u2018Cause, \u2018um\u2026 uh, so what, you just gonna fly commercial, or\u2026\" said by Liam\n\"Well, see, that\u2019s the thing. By the time I get to the airport, there\u2019s only one flight out, and it\u2019s already fully booked.\" said by Hope\n\"Oh. Um\u2026 so what are you saying exactly? Just, are you\u2013 you\u2019re stuck, you\u2019re gonna be spending the night in san francisco with thomas?\" said by Liam\n\"Well, hopefully they will be able to fix the problem, and then we can make it home tonight.\" said by Hope\n\"Seriously?\" said by Liam\n\"I know. I know. I know. But fingers crossed, hopefully I will be able to make it home tonight, still, somehow. I just\u2013 I really, really want to see you and the kids. Um, but I\u2013 I do have to get going. Um, but I will\u2013 I will keep you posted. Okay? I love you, liam.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah, I love you, too.\" said by Liam\n\"Hope and thomas are spending the night in san francisco?\" said by Steffy\n\"Okay. Uh, while you were talking to liam, I decided to go ahead and order us some room service.\" said by Thomas\n\"Oh, good call. I am starving.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah, that, uh, pitch meeting kind of worked up an appetite. Ni\u00e7oise salad, right?\" said by Thomas\n\"[ Laughs ] Yep. You know me so well.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah.\" said by Thomas\n\"Thank you.\" said by Hope\n\"I\u2019m sorry you have to be here. Was liam upset?\" said by Thomas\n\"If I just hadn\u2019t texted him I would be home soon, then I wouldn\u2019t have set that expectation. Then it wouldn\u2019t look so bad, and then\u2013 you know what? No. We had a great day here, and I don\u2019t want to ruin that, so I am going to think positively and not stress, and the jet is going to be fixed. And in the meantime, all I can do is wait, so that is what I am going to try to do.\" said by Hope\n\"Waiting. Not really my strong suit.\" said by Thomas\n\"[ Laughs ] Oh, tell me about it.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah. You\u2019re being a really good sport about all of this.\" said by Thomas\n\"Well, so are you.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah, this isn\u2019t that terrible for me. I get a night in san francisco. I can go grab some sushi, and then head back to the hotel and keep working. You need to get home to your fam\u2013\" said by Thomas\n\"Hey. Hey hey. No, no, no. No more work for you. You did enough today. All right? So, if\u2013 if we are actually stuck here, then I say we should just enjoy that dinner that you ordered for us, and just\u2026 bask in the glory of our success.\" said by Hope\n\"Okay. Yeah. That\u2019s actually a really good idea. I\u2019m gonna go ahead and order myself a room, then. Just in case.\" said by Thomas\n\"Isn\u2019t it so funny how I never really liked the idea of hope and thomas going on a trip together?\" said by Liam\n\"Hey, there\u2019s still a chance they could\u2013 they could get home tonight.\" said by ", "answer": "Steffy"}

I mean, considering what happened here.\" said by Victor\n\"For me, it\u2019s just a bar with a good bourbon selection and good music.\" said by Tucker\n\"That\u2019s a really cavalier description of this place.\" said by Victor\n\"I can tell you that phyllis would feel the same way if it were me in the morgue.\" said by Tucker\n\"Uh-huh.\" said by Victor\n\"Anyway, you ready to talk business?\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah.

It was like just as I got to her, suddenly I was back in my house in savannah. It was\u2013 it was just like before I came back to genoa city. Heather wasn\u2019t there, lucy wasn\u2019t there. I mean, the house, it\u2013 it just felt bigger. Emptier. Really lonely.\" said by Daniel\n\"I know. I had that happen when my dad died. It\u2019s like I would wake up and think for a second that he was back and\u2013\" said by Lily\n\"It actually happened.\" said by Daniel\n\"Really?\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah. It was the day at the memorial. There was this woman there who must have been her height. I\u2013 I saw her like just real quick from the side, but I mean, I still had to do a double take. Obviously, it wasn\u2019t her, but you know, for a minute there gave me hope. And then, it\u2019s just back to reality. That kind of crushed me.\" said by Daniel\n\"I know. I\u2019m sorry. But listen, once you get through this wave of grief, you\u2019re gonna have random moments that remind you of your mom and it\u2019s gonna help keep her spirit alive.\" said by Lily\n\"I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re here.

You know, if you wanna pretend like what happened here between the two of us, it didn\u2019t happen, then I\u2019d understand.\" said by Daniel\n\"Here you go. Cheers to you because you\u2019ve been burning the candle on both ends.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah. I\u2019m doing everything I can to help my parents. I\u2019m fielding media requests and whatever else I can do to help my dad free up his time because he needs to be spending it proving my mother\u2019s innocence.\" said by Kyle\n\"Have you talked to her lately?\" said by Billy\n\"Briefly. At the arraignment. Dad went to visit her this afternoon. She told him not to come back. She doesn\u2019t want us to visit her, supposedly for her own good.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019m sorry, man. That\u2019s tough.\" said by Billy\n\"I\u2019m hoping she\u2019ll change her mind. She needs to know we\u2019re in this together, doing everything we can to get her out of there.\" said by Kyle\n\"Look, it\u2019s good that you\u2019re supporting her and of course, you would and jack for that matter, but you cannot neglect your own life in the process. You know, you\u2019re telling me that this situation is affecting your marriage. Take it from the king of failed relationships, you\u2019ve got to fix that problem before it\u2019s too late. You cannot lose summer.\" said by Billy\n\"Maybe this is not a good day to take jabs at diane. I thought on maybe some basic human level, you might actually sympathize with her plight.\" said by Jack\n\"Why would I?\" said by Ashley\n\"She\u2019s being locked up for a crime she didn\u2019t commit. That doesn\u2019t resonate with you? At least you know what it feels like to be wrongly accused.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, I do, indeed, because of diane. And just for the record, I think she\u2019s rightfully accused.\" said by Ashley\n\"Wow. You take some pleasure in saying that, don\u2019t you? Like you won something. You are wrong. She is innocent and she is suffering and because she has been denied bail, she refuses to even see me.\" said by Jack\n\"Okay, well that\u2019s the wisest decision she\u2019s ever made. Listen to her and move on, please.\" said by Ashley\n\"Even if you actually believe diane was guilty of murder, the level of spite in this conversation is outrageous. She was framed, ash.\" said by Jack\n\"You keep saying that. But the way I see it, she had every reason to want phyllis out of the picture so she could have everything. So she could have the loving relationship, the job at marchetti, the home in the abbott mansion and your ring on her finger.\" said by Ashley\n\"I have no reservations about selling my company. I\u2019m done with this town and I\u2019m done with mccall unlimited. It used to be my passion, now it\u2019s just a burden I no longer wish to carry.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, my god. How touching, tucker. You expecting my sympathy or what?\" said by Victor\n\"I think I know you a little better than that.\" said by Tucker\n\"All right. If it makes you feel better, I just want you to know that your company will continue to thrive, you know. Although, I may change its name.\" said by Victor\n\"I couldn\u2019t care less what you call it. I just\u2013 I\u2019m looking forward to it not being my problem anymore.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, then why don\u2019t you put that pen to paper.\" said by Victor\n\"Just for due diligence, I would like to look it over one last time.\" said by Tucker\n\"Do I need to remind you that you are the one who came running to me?\" said by Victor\n\"Mm. I know that. And I\u2019m gonna sign it soon. You have my word.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, in that case, I\u2019m looking forward to the confirmation of your signature.\" said by Victor\n\"Summer moved into a guest room.\" said by Kyle\n\"Uh-oh. Separate rooms is the first step towards separate lives. Are you two fighting?\" said by Billy\n\"That\u2019s the thing. We\u2019d almost be better if we were. She\u2019s just completely shut down. She said she\u2019s moved rooms because she didn\u2019t want to wake me with her tossing and turning. But I think she can\u2019t bear to look at me. She\u2019s convinced my mother killed hers.\" said by Kyle\n\"That\u2019s a relationship dilemma I\u2019ve never dealt with.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah. And the only solution I see is to clear my mother\u2019s name, not only for her innocence but for my marriage. Summer is so inside her head right now.\" said by Kyle\n\"What do you mean by that?\" said by Billy\n\"She only comes out of her room when she wants to spend time with harrison. And when she does, she puts on a good front, laughing and smiling and reading stories. But once she\u2019s alone again, she completely shuts down.\" said by Kyle\n\"Sounds like she\u2019s dealing with grief in her own way.\" said by Billy\n\"I get that. And I want her to have all the space and time she needs, but I\u2019m not so sure she can heal on her own. So, I don\u2019t know what to do because if I can\u2019t talk to her, I can\u2019t help her. And every time we do talk, it only makes things worse. The only solution I see is to clear my mother\u2019s name.\" said by Kyle\n\"I hear you. But you\u2019re dead wrong.\" said by Billy\n\"Why did I even start this conversation with you?\" said by Kyle\n\"Because you need someone to talk to and I\u2019m the only one here. You may not like my advice and I can\u2019t force you to listen to me, but there\u2019s a better way to help summer.\" said by Billy\n\"You seem to think I accepted everything diane said without any doubt. I had my doubts. I expressed them. I took a good look at them and I set them aside. Here\u2019s what I believe. Diane is not capable of committing what she\u2019s been accused of.\" said by ", "answer": "Jack"}

Just like I was last night when we spoke on the phone.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, you did that thing where you politely blow me off because you don\u2019t want me to worry about you, so I figured the best thing I can do is just crash your place and eyeball you and see how you\u2019re doing. So, how are you?\" said by Nick\n\"Um, it\u2019s a little intense sometimes. Little noises or flashes of light just send me right back into the nightmare.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, she was my first phone call this morning. Uh, she sounds good, you know? She\u2019s happy to be back with her friends. She sounds strong. Wish my other daughter was just as great.

Anybody who tries to stop her or tries to help her ends up getting burned, and far too often it is someone she loves.

I told her it wasn\u2019t necessary, but she insisted.\" said by Nick\n\"For how long?\" said by Sharon\n\"Seems indefinite.\" said by Nick\n\"Okay, well, being that it\u2019s your sister, I have to assume that she\u2019s just concerned about you and everything that you\u2019ve been dealing with.\" said by Sharon\n\"I have a feeling her concern isn\u2019t very sisterly.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, you can always come back to work at the coffee house.\" said by Sharon\n\"Oh, that is a tempting offer.\" said by Nick\n\"And I\u2019ll throw in all the free coffee you can drink.\" said by Sharon\n\"Okay.\" said by Nick\n\"You know what? I have to get to work.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah.\" said by Nick\n\"Hey. This isn\u2019t my shampoo. This is from an out-of-state law firm. That doesn\u2019t sound good.\" said by Sharon\n\"Which part shouldn\u2019t have happened?\" said by Kyle\n\"The division of this family. Traci had to stage an intervention to stop immediate warfare. I don\u2019t know how successful she was. I think at best we have a temporary detente.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, d\u00e9tentes are overrated.\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, I understand your pain. That phyllis would use her daughter to help her out of this mess of her own making. That she would force summer to choose between her husband and her mother. It\u2019s just more damage to this family courtesy of that woman and her hatred.\" said by Jack\n\"Summer was no victim. She was right in step with her mother. She chose phyllis over and over. Saw my mother get charged with murder, saw us in pain, still, she did nothing.\" said by Kyle\n\"Summer made a mistake.\" said by Jack\n\"It wasn\u2019t that long ago that she was furious at me because I lied to her about working with victor to get adam out of jabot.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah, that I remember quite well.\" said by Jack\n\"She was furious. I lied. She could barely get past the fact that I have violated our trust, and I own that mistake, but now she has done exactly the same thing, lying on top of lying. See, this time, it wasn\u2019t about a job at a company. It was about my mother\u2019s life. Her entire future.\" said by Kyle\n\"And she wants to make amends now.\" said by Jack\n\"How? She let me believe she was grieving her mother. Let my mom face the possibility of life in prison. Let me tie myself in knots trying to support my mother. I was desperate to help summer. Desperate. And she shut me out. Disregarded my love, disregarded my feelings for her and my mother.\" said by Kyle\n\"There\u2019s no doubt about it, she was wrong, but are you so hurt that you won\u2019t get past what has happened?\" said by Jack\n\"It is not about hurt. I don\u2019t know who she is anymore. Or maybe I\u2019m just finally seeing she really is her mother\u2019s daughter. Summer did whatever she needed to get what she wanted. Knowing she\u2019s capable of that and so easily, I don\u2019t see how I can trust her again.\" said by Kyle\n\"But don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a little harsh?\" said by Jack\n\"Summer and i are separating dad. I told her to move out.\" said by Kyle\n\"Your mother\u2019s future is still pretty much up in the air. And more than a lot of it depends on phyllis.\" said by Michael\n\"You\u2019re gonna help her, right?\" said by Summer\n\"Of course I will. I\u2019m committed to bringing phyllis back. She has that special type of mayhem we all need in our life. But your mother is a stubborn woman. Even with the odds against her, she insists that things play out on her terms. And that is just something I can\u2019t promise.\" said by Michael\n\"And that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t stick around?\" said by Summer\n\"It\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t try. I begged her to turn herself in. I ran up and down the list of reasons why it\u2019d be the least stupid thing she could do. I told her we love her, we miss her. We\u2019re ready to fight for her.\" said by Michael\n\"And she still refused.\" said by Summer\n\"She\u2019s afraid. Christine is at the end of all this. Phyllis is convinced that christine will hit her with every charge in the book and even a few extra just for kicks. The only commitment I could get from your mom is that she would think about it and examine her options.\" said by Michael\n\"Even if there are legal consequences, I mean, it\u2019s got to be better than all of this craziness. The uncertainty.\" said by Summer\n\"I would like this all to be over so I could see you smile again.\" said by Michael\n\"As much as I love my mom and I want her to come home\u2026 I\u2013 I\u2013 I still can\u2019t believe that she did this to us. To me, I mean, even if we figure out all of her problems, there\u2019s still going to be collateral damage.\" said by Summer\n\"What, uh, specific collateral damage are we talking about?\" said by Michael\n\"I might need a lawyer myself.

Why put off the inevitable?\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, is this really what you want? You\u2019re ready to give up on your marriage?\" said by Jack\n\"Summer chose to do that when she decided to betray everything I thought we had and\u2013 and so damn easily. Who knows? Maybe if she hadn\u2019t gotten caught, she would still be lying to me.\" said by Kyle\n\"Oh, you\u2019re in pain.

Steffi, why are you asking if I think thomas is hot?\" said by Hope\n\"I\u2019m trying to save hope for the future and it is my job to make sure that happens. You and thomas are gonna be working very closely together and it\u2019s gonna be intense. You\u2019re gonna be bouncing ideas off of each other, inspiring each other, being swept up in the moment.\" said by Steffy\n\"Are you asking this for me or for thomas?\" said by Hope\n\"I already talked to thomas about it.\" said by Steffy\n\"What, seriously?\" said by Hope\n\"I just want to make sure that there was no issue. He assured me there isn\u2019T. My brother is making significant changes in his life and I know he\u2019s not obsessed with you anymore.\" said by Steffy\n\"Okay, good. I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m thrilled for him, but steffy, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m married and I am fully committed to liam.\" said by Hope\n\"I get that. I\u2019m not questioning that.\" said by Steffy\n\"Okay. So then where is this coming from?\" said by Hope\n\"I just want you to be honest and realistic with yourself and your attraction to thomas.\" said by Steffy\n\"You\u2019re what I need. I love you, sheila.\" said by Bill\n\"Well, this could get real interesting real fast.\" said by Ridge\n\"We\u2019re set up for all of it.\" said by Chen\n\"Hey!\" said by Bill\n\"Hey! There he is.\" said by Sheila\n\"Did you miss me?\" said by Bill\n\"Always.\" said by Sheila\n\"Well, just because I\u2019ve shared all of me with you doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t still have a couple of tricks up my sleeve.\" said by Bill\n\"[ Laughs ] Oh.

So he\u2019s going to be in our lives forever.\" said by Brooke\n\"There\u2019s so much going on. Some good, some\u2026 horrifying like sheila carter still being on the loose thanks to bill spencer?

Off somewhere licking his wounds instead of being here to protect his family.\" said by Stephen\n\"In all fairness, I\u2019m the one who told ridge to go away and figure out what he wants out of us.\" said by Brooke\n\"And he doesn\u2019t know how to cut a trip short? I\u2019m gonna give him a call. Give him a piece of my mind.\" said by Stephen\n\"Oh, dad! Come on.

Yes.\" said by Ridge\n\"Well, that\u2019s not gonna help, is it?

Are you talking about you and dominic?\" said by Devon\n\"Well, I was referring to the empanadas, but, yes, us too.\" said by Abby\n\"No, they were delicious. But nothing beats spending time with you and our little guy. Just looking into his face always puts things back into perspective. So I appreciate you bringing him over here.\" said by Devon\n\"Well, he loves you, and you certainly wore him out, because he has not made a peep since you put him down.\" said by Abby\n\"I \u2014 right.\" said by Devon\n\"Doesn\u2019t it make you want to be a kid again?\" said by Abby\n\"No.\" said by Devon\n\"No?\" said by Abby\n\"It\u2019s not \u2014 not me. No. But today did remind me of why I\u2019m fighting so hard to get my company back and why I\u2019m considering buying mccall, because it\u2019s not for me at all. It\u2019s for our son\u2019s future.\" said by Devon\n\"Look, I \u2014 I know where you\u2019re coming from, but you don\u2019t have to wrestle back your company for dominic. Who knows? He might not even want to be a part of the business when he gets older. He\u2019s going to be his own person, create his own career, his own path.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah, I know. I know. And I would never force him to do anything he doesn\u2019t want to do. But I just mean, I want him to be proud of me.

When I saw you earlier, you made it seem like you came to meet with vick to talk about the mccall deal.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s how i clear my head these days \u2014 scotch and strategizing about newman media. Business is sometimes a good distraction from your personal life.

And did he have an explanation?\" said by Abby\n\"He did, yeah. And it made some sense. But the more I think about it, I realize that it doesn\u2019t really matter that he went to newman first, \u2019cause he pulled that offer. As long as he\u2019s being sincere about what he\u2019s offering me.\" said by Devon\n\"Well, sincerity is always in question when it comes to tucker.\" said by Abby\n\"Right, right. I just \u2014 I feel like my reasons for wanting to buy the company are more important than whatever his reasons are for trying to sell it.\" said by Devon\n\"And what are those reasons?\" said by Abby\n\"Oh, just the safety-net argument. You know, in case things don\u2019t go well with this lawsuit and getting back hamilton-winters, obviously getting the company back is my priority. But I have to be smart. You know? And I have to consider whether there\u2019s a benefit to rebuilding a company with tucker.\" said by Devon\n\"Look, I know that i have been the one that was kind of pushing this whole mccall-tucker thing, but, honestly, I-I don\u2019t know if I can fully trust tucker, and I would never want you to get burned again.\" said by Abby\n\"We did riff off each other pretty well when we were talking about our ideas for fixing the company.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay, well, I guess it\u2019s great to be on the same page as the person running the company before you, but it\u2019s not like you would be moving forward, working together. I mean\u2026\" said by Abby\n\"Well, there\u2019s another element to this whole thing. He said that if I were to buy the company, he\u2019d want to come on and take an advisory role and report to me.\" said by Devon\n\"Wait, so, he would want to take a lesser position?\" said by Abby\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Devon\n\"How do you feel about that?\" said by Abby\n\"It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s probably a sign that he\u2019s being honest about wanting to actually fix things between us, \u2019cause I know he doesn\u2019t like to take orders from anybody.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah, agreed. That\u2019s true. Um, I guess it shows that he\u2019s trying to form a connection. But I mean, that\u2019s if we are giving him the benefit of the doubt.\" said by Abby\n\"Right.

Having been privy to Chancellor-Winters\u2019 legal contracts, I can tell you those things are ironclad. Yeah, I don\u2019t think Daniel can get out of his unless the company decides to release him. You know, and if Lily\u2019s reaction to Phyllis shopping around his idea was any indication, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s gonna happen, which means we\u2019d be wasting time, energy, resources by going after it.\" said by Audra\n\"Mm. Exactly how much access did you have to Chancellor-Winters\u2019 legal contracts, when it comes to projects like Daniel\u2019s?\" said by Nate\n\"Why would you take it upon yourself to go to Nate to pitch my project to him when I explicitly told you that I wasn\u2019t ready to give up on the deal with Lily and Chancellor-Winters?\" said by Daniel\n\"Okay, well, you said that that company was putting your project on hold.\" said by Phyllis\n\"When I told you that things were shaky over there, I thought I was confiding in my mother and not some opportunist who was gonna go and shop my idea behind my back.\" said by Daniel\n\"\u201cOpportunist\u201d? Seriously? That\u2019s how you see me? Listen, I just went to Newman Media \u2019cause, you know, I was doing it as an exploratory thing, you know, to sort of whet their appetite. And I think I did. We need to have alternatives if this thing crashes in. I mean, we need to have a backup plan.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Okay, you need to stop talking like this is ours. This is my platform, mine alone. And I\u2019m not gonna trust virtual strangers with my dream project. [ Sighs ]\" said by Daniel\n\"All right, listen, Daniel, the Newmans are hardly strangers. Nick was your stepfather.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Well, nonetheless, I\u2019m wary of getting involved with any Newman-run company. I mean, I got to tell you, the worst part about this is you shared privileged information. I mean, I poured my heart out to you and Dad. I told you how much this project means to me, why I need this so bad, and not just on a professional level. I mean, I can\u2019t just ignore the fact that you have compromised my intellectual property. Now any person or any company that you spoke with about it \u2014 they can take my ideas and they can run with them before I ever get Omege Sphere off the ground.\" said by Daniel\n\"Okay. Okay. I\u2019m sorry. I \u2014 I \u2014 listen, I only spoke to Nate and \u2014 and his COO because, uh, it seems like Chancellor-Winters is shelving this project indefinitely. And I know what that does to you. Listen, I want to see your vision come to fruition. And I didn\u2019t say anything risky to Nate. I didn\u2019t say anything risky. Really. I didn\u2019t even talk to the rest of the Newmans about it.\" said by Phyllis\n\"What about Tucker McCall?\" said by Daniel\n\"What about Tucker McCall? I mean, Tucker just overheard me leaving a message for Nate. Honestly, Tucker \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t give him a sip of water if he was in the middle of a desert.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Hmm. Okay. So, you only shared information with the man who sold out his cousins to give Newman the opportunity to acquire a majority holding of Chancellor-Winters. That\u2019s great. No, I just never thought that you would go and do this with Nate without asking me first. I \u2014 I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s my mistake for thinking the best of you.\" said by Daniel\n\"What? You don\u2019t mean that. Daniel. Okay, I\u2019m sorry. Oh, my gosh. I overreacted. Give me a break. I care about this project for you. I just want the best for you. That\u2019s all.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Fair enough. But if my platform ever needs a new home, which it doesn\u2019t yet, it\u2019s my call who we go with, okay? My call. And if I\u2019m being honest with you, right now, if I had to choose, Tucker looks like the better option instead of Newman Media.\" said by Daniel\n\"So, what made you think that the podcast might not be a good idea?\" said by Billy\n\"[ Sighs ] I had my therapy session with Dr. Malone. I told her my idea, and she thinks it\u2019s too soon to venture into something so personal and intimate.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Mm.\" said by Billy\n\"Reliving the trauma of my suicide attempt before I\u2019ve finished processing it could be a potential minefield for me.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, I\u2019m sure that was disappointing, but I \u2014 I understand what she\u2019s saying.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, I was disappointed\u2026until I talked it through with Dr. Malone. She said that it\u2019s actually a really good thing that I wanted to do the podcast. It means I\u2019m focused on my recovery and I am trying to pay it forward and I\u2019m focusing on the future, which is something I couldn\u2019t say a few months ago. So\u2026 all of this is about my recovery, right? So [Sighs] How can I be disappointed?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Hmm.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, now, I asked Michael Baldwin to look into Tucker McCall\u2019s claim that he was a reformed man when he landed in Genoa City.\" said by Victor\n\"What did he find out?\" said by Victoria\n\"Apparently, McCall\u2019s lavish lifestyle \u2014 spending money left and right \u2014 has put his company under a mountain of debt.\" said by Victor\n\"How is that possible? The last we knew, he was selling off parts of his company in order to secure capital to buy out Chancellor-Winters\u2019 stock. I mean, you would think he would have some liquid assets available.\" said by Nikki\n\"That\u2019s what we all assumed, but then he took out a number of short-term loans. That\u2019s how short he was of his agenda.\" said by Victor\n\"Could just be a desperation move to stabilize his empire.\" said by Nick\n\"But those debts are coming due. So I think what he\u2019s doing \u2014 he\u2019s looking for a lucrative company to keep him afloat.\" said by Victor\n\"I told you I didn\u2019t know the details of Daniel\u2019s deal. My insider info was limited to things pertaining directly to the IPO, nothing connected with development or creative planning.\" said by Audra\n\"You never heard anything around the office?\" said by Nate\n\"Uh, I knew Lily and Devon were discussing building an entire gaming division around the idea Daniel was developing. I was also aware that they were preparing a press release towards the end of my tenure with them. Since it never came out, I\u2019m assuming they hit a standstill.\" said by Audra\n\"Hmm. Interesting.\" said by Nate\n\"Why are you asking me all this? Are you thinking of poaching Daniel from Chancellor-Winters? Or stealing his idea?\" said by Audra\n\"No. No, I\u2019m just curious. I would definitely like to know what\u2019s going on at Chancellor-Winters that would make this project so precarious. I\u2019m sure it has something to do with Devon. His inability to collaborate or take chances is probably bringing the entire company to its knees.\" said by Nate\n\"Why do you still care so much about your family\u2019s company? If I remember correctly, you were quite adamant about putting your time there behind you.\" said by ", "answer": "Audra"}

I don\u2019t need any of your negativity surrounding my friendship with billy.\" said by Chelsea\n\"It\u2019s not the friendship that I\u2019m worried about. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s gone past the \u201cwe\u2019re just friends\u201d part.\" said by Adam\n\"Maybe it has.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Flowers and chelsea\u2019s favorite pastries. You must be headed upstairs.\" said by Sharon\n\"I am, yeah. She\u2019s making lunch. You know, I don\u2019t want to show up empty-handed. That would be in poor form.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, look at you, billy abbott. When did you become so thoughtful?\" said by Sharon\n\"[ Chuckles ] It\u2019s a box of pastries and a grocery-bought bouquet of flowers. It\u2019s not a big deal, sharon.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, it is often the small, thoughtful gestures that speak volumes.\" said by Sharon\n\"I feel like there\u2019s more to that statement.\" said by Billy\n\"I think it\u2019s really admirable, the way that you have stepped up for chelsea. You have been instrumental in her reclaiming her life.\" said by Sharon\n\"But\u2026?\" said by Billy\n\"I do worry. Obviously, the bond between you two is growing stronger.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, it is, but isn\u2019t it supposed to?\" said by Billy\n\"Yes, ordinarily. But you two came together under extraordinary circumstances, and chelsea has made great stride in her recovery, but she\u2019s still in a fragile state, billy.\" said by Sharon\n\"Hey. Did you work from home this morning?\" said by Kyle\n\"I did.\" said by Summer\n\"Sorry I didn\u2019t wake you. I went into the office early to conference with milan, and after my late night last night, it feels like I haven\u2019t seen you in forever. What\u2019s wrong?\" said by Kyle\n\"Do you really want to know?\" said by Summer\n\"Well, when you say it like that, I\u2019m not so sure anymore.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s wrong. Sally freakin\u2019 spectra.\" said by Summer\n\"I ran into summer yesterday\u2026and it was pretty uncomfortable.\" said by Sally\n\"[ Exhales heavily ] You told her?\" said by Nick\n\"Everything.\" said by Sally\n\"Everything?\" said by Nick\n\"Everything.\" said by Sally\n\"You told her all of it? You\u2019re pregnant. It\u2019s adam\u2019S. We\u2019re still together.\" said by Nick\n\"Mm-hmm. Yeah. All of it. I don\u2019t know. I-I\u2019m sorry. Really, I just thought it would be a good thing. But she just accused me of creating chaos wherever I go.\" said by Sally\n\"Sorry she said that to you.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, well, the worst part is she\u2019s not wrong. I mean, this whole thing is a mess. (Phyllis) oooh, hearts\" said by Sally\n\"I don\u2019t want to overstep, billy.\" said by Sharon\n\"I know you don\u2019T. Look, you\u2019ve been nothing but respectful towards chelsea throughout her recuperation. And, uh, it\u2019s obvious you come from a place of concern.\" said by Billy\n\"Yes, I do. And I\u2019m not chelsea\u2019s therapist, but I do have some thoughts.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, I always appreciate your input. You\u2019ve always been a big help. So, don\u2019t stop now.\" said by Billy\n\"What if you don\u2019t like what I have to say?\" said by Sharon\n\"I\u2019m still gonna listen. Look, you\u2019re a trained professional, okay? I\u2019m a fool with some flowers and some \u2014 some baked goods. But we\u2019re both concerned about chelsea, and, uh, the big difference being you actually have the experience to help.\" said by Billy\n\"Okay, so, from my objective point of view, I do worry about her dependency on you. I know that you\u2019ve made a deep commitment to helping her get through this crisis, and you have lived up to that and more. But I\u2019m here all day. I see how often you come through here to go up and check in on her. And I imagine your relationship has gotten pretty close.\" said by Sharon\n\"We\u2019re good friends. Maybe a little bit more, but i feel like that\u2019s a natural progression.\" said by Billy\n\"Of course.\" said by Sharon\n\"Look, sharon, I would never do anything consciously to jeopardize chelsea\u2019s progress.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, it doesn\u2019t have to be conscious in order to be harmful.\" said by Sharon\n\"So, you think our friendship is hurting her?\" said by Billy\n\"I think that you are too close to the situation to be aware of any of the potential dangers. She\u2019s still in a very vulnerable state, billy.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yes, but she is getting better.\" said by Billy\n\"How much of that is because you\u2019re around? We all know that a new romance is enough to buoy anyone\u2019s mood.\" said by Sharon\n\"That\u2019s a good thing, isn\u2019t it?\" said by Billy\n\"Ordinarily, yes, it can, but\u2026it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s artificially lifting her spirits. And chelsea needs to get through this on her own. It\u2019s the only way that she\u2019s going to come out the other side stronger than she was before. I\u2019m not saying that her dependency on you is causing her to regress. It\u2019s just something for you to be aware of.\" said by Sharon\n\"Hey. How you doing?\" said by Daniel\n\"Good. How are you?\" said by Lily\n\"Oh. I\u2019m good. I\u2019m good. Thank you for meeting with me.\" said by Daniel\n\"Of course. So, thankfully, jill has agreed to move forward with omega sphere even while we get everything at the company sorted out.\" said by Lily\n\"Right. Good. Well, I owe you for that. I know you\u2019ve been fighting for this, so thank you.\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, of course I have. I believe in you, and I believe in the project. And that\u2019s why I feel like, no matter what has happened with heather and no matter how you feel about it, this venture is way too important to walk away from. You\u2019ve put too much time and energy into it.\" said by Lily\n\"I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\" said by Daniel\n\"Daniel, I mean it, okay? This is not just a beautiful gift for your daughter. You\u2019re creating something impactful. And it\u2019s a way to reinvent yourself, just like heather and lucy told you.\" said by Lily\n\"You know I can be a little slow on the uptake sometimes. Plus, I needed to do some wallowing after they left. So, thank you for being patient with me.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah, of course. I mean, look, it was kind of like hanging out with eeyore, but, you know\u2026\" said by Lily\n\"And I\u2019m glad that you can ridicule me for it. It just makes me feel so much better about myself.\" said by Daniel\n\"Good. Good. Laughter means that you\u2019re moving on.\" said by Lily\n\"And, again, I\u2019m grateful to you for that.\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, you know who i owe a big thank-you to.
