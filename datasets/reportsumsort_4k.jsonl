{"content": "U.S. Government Accountability Office Affordable Housing: HUD Could Improve Use of Data for the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program GAO-23-106628 Report to Congressional Committees July 24, 2023\nWhy This Matters\n Demand for affordable housing throughout the U.S. continues to outpace supply. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and other federal agencies administer a number of programs that focus on increasing the supply of affordable housing. One of these is HUD\u2019s Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP). Some Members of Congress have raised questions about the information HUD collects on SHOP and how it uses information to inform program decisions.1 The joint explanatory statement regarding the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 provides for GAO to evaluate various aspects of SHOP.2 This report examines how HUD collects and uses data for SHOP, including to inform program decisions.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022  SHOP is a competitive federal grant program that awards funds to eligible nonprofit organizations to help develop affordable housing units for purchase by low-income families. \u2022  HUD collects some data from SHOP grantees. However, HUD has not used these data, or data on market conditions, to inform key program decisions, such as setting the limit on the amount of SHOP funds grantees can spend on each housing unit. \u2022  Our analysis of market data shows that costs for certain eligible SHOP activities have increased over time; however, HUD has changed the per-unit spending limit only twice since the program\u2019s inception. \u2022  We recommend that HUD use project-level and market data to inform its administration of SHOP. By analyzing these data in a systematic way, HUD could make better-informed program decisions.\nWhat is SHOP?\nSHOP is a competitive federal grant program that awards funds to eligible grantees to help develop affordable homes for low-income families. The program uses a self-help model in which low-income individuals and families contribute their \u201csweat equity\u201d\u2014nonmonetary investment of labor\u2014to help build housing they will buy.3 Grantees must be national or regional public or private nonprofit organizations or consortia that have the capacity and experience to provide self-help housing homeownership opportunities. Grantees may use SHOP funds to pay for the cost of the following activities that set the stage for housing construction:\n\u2022  Land acquisition. Acquiring land on which to build the home. \u2022  Infrastructure improvements. The installation, construction, or improvement of utilities or other infrastructure.4 Grantees must leverage other financial resources to develop SHOP-funded projects, such as funding from private lenders, foundations, and state or local agencies. In December 2015, the administration and oversight of SHOP was moved from HUD\u2019s Office of Affordable Housing Programs to the Office of Rural Housing and Economic Development. According to HUD officials, this office assumed responsibility for the program because of its experience administering competitive grant programs and creating housing and economic opportunities in rural and underserved areas.\nHow does HUD implement SHOP?\nHUD does the following to implement SHOP: Per-unit spending limit. When HUD solicits SHOP grant applications each year, it sets a limit on the amount of SHOP funds grantees can spend\u2014on average\u2014 for an individual housing unit.5 Since fiscal year 2022, the per-unit spending limit has been $25,000.6 Production requirements. Each year, HUD uses a grantee\u2019s award amount and the per-unit spending limit to determine the minimum number of units the grantee is required to complete, according to officials. Under SHOP, grantees must develop a specific and reasonable number of homes with the grant amount, taking into consideration costs and economic conditions of the areas in which the homes will be developed.7 This number must be at least 30 homes. Funding categories. For fiscal year 2022, HUD instituted three funding categories: national organizations (which were awarded $6 million), regional organizations ($3.5 million), and consortium organizations ($3 million). Award process. HUD announces annual SHOP grant award opportunities through notices of funding opportunity and awards funds to grantees through a competitive process. HUD evaluates applicants through a rating system, awarding points in five categories: applicant experience and capacity, extent of need for affordable homeownership housing and SHOP funds, soundness of approach to carrying out proposed SHOP activities, leveraging other resources, and program monitoring and evaluation plans. Since the Office of Rural Housing and Economic Development began administering SHOP in December 2015, HUD has awarded funds to five private nonprofit grantees: Community Frameworks, Habitat for Humanity, the Housing Assistance Council, Tierra Del Sol, and most recently the Community Resources and Housing Development Corporation in fiscal year 2022 (see table 1).8\nHousing\nFigure 1: Congressional Appropriations for the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program, Fiscal Years 1998\u20132023\nNote: This figure depicts budget authority for certain years in which the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s budget justification did not separately list an appropriation. Per-unit spending limit. Since fiscal year 1998, HUD has changed the per-unit spending limit twice. The limit was $10,000 from fiscal years 1998 through 2003, $15,000 from fiscal years 2004 through 2021, and it has been $25,000 since fiscal year 2022. Unit production. The minimum number of housing units HUD required SHOP grantees to complete declined from 2,354 in fiscal year 1998 to 537 in 2020.9 According to HUD officials, the number of units required decreased in most cases because of reductions in SHOP funding. HUD also measures how many SHOP units are \u201cconveyed,\u201d which the agency has defined as the transfer of title\u2014that is, ownership\u2014to a SHOP-eligible homebuyer.10 The number of SHOP units conveyed declined from 1,749 units in fiscal year 1998 to 478 units in 2016 (see fig. 2). Because grantees have multiple years to develop and convey units, all grants for fiscal year 2016 and after were still open. Therefore, lots acquired and units conveyed may not reflect final unit counts.11\nFigure 2: Units Conveyed, Lots Acquired, and Minimum Units Required through the Self- Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP) by Fiscal Year, 1998\u20132020\nNote: This figure reflects units required and conveyed using funding appropriated for a given fiscal year, not the fiscal year in which the units were actually completed or conveyed. HUD data on units conveyed and lots acquired include some open SHOP grants across fiscal years, including all grants made with funding from fiscal year 2016 and later. This means that the number of units conveyed and lots acquired in the figure may not reflect final unit counts because grantees have multiple years to develop and convey units and HUD is still closing out grants. According to HUD\u2019s fiscal year 2020 notice of funding opportunity, SHOP grantees have 6 years to develop and convey units developed with SHOP funds. In addition, this figure includes data on the four main grantees, but does not include all grantees that have received SHOP funds since 1998.\nWhat information does HUD collect from grantees and how is it used?\nHUD collects the following information from each grantee, either annually or semiannually, at the aggregate level: \u2022  Number of lots acquired \u2022  Number of units constructed \u2022  Number of units conveyed \u2022  Number of units developed in rural areas \u2022  Number of units developed in urban areas \u2022  Number of units that are accessible \u2022  Number of sweat equity hours executed \u2022  Amount expended on land acquisition \u2022  Amount expended on infrastructure improvements \u2022  Amount of leveraged funds used from non-SHOP sources\nAccording to officials, HUD increased the data points collected from grantees when the office assumed responsibility for SHOP in 2016. Additionally, HUD requires grantees to provide some project-level information as part of its semiannual and annual reporting requirements. For example, grantees must provide information on the construction status, unit characteristics, and income composition of the homeowners in SHOP-funded units.\nHUD officials said the project-level information from grantees is generally collected as part of HUD\u2019s grant agreement process, and is not stored or maintained in a spreadsheet or database that would enable HUD to analyze project-level information across grantees.\nTo what extent has HUD used data to for SHOP?\nHUD generally has not used data to inform SHOP policy decisions. Instead, HUD historically has made program decisions for SHOP based on appropriations and inform policy decisions    grantee requests, according to officials. For example: \u2022  HUD has used SHOP\u2019s appropriation and the per-unit spending limit to determine the minimum number of units to be completed by grantees. Specifically, to determine the minimum for each grantee, HUD divides the grant amount (excluding the administrative cost allowance) by the per-unit spending limit. \u2022   HUD raised the per-unit spending limit from $10,000 to $15,000 in 2004 and to $25,000 in 2022. According to HUD officials, HUD made the most recent change in response to grantees\u2019 requests and in the context of rising land costs. Although HUD provided a retroactive analysis of the 2022 change, the agency did not demonstrate any analysis of SHOP project-level or market data conducted before it made changes to the per- unit-spending limit. Analyzing detailed data could better position HUD to make informed decisions about SHOP. For example: \u2022   By analyzing market data, HUD could determine whether the per-unit spending limit is keeping pace with increases in applicable costs, such as the cost of acquiring land for SHOP projects. For example, although national land prices increased approximately 60 percent between 2012 and 2019 (see fig. 3), HUD did not raise the per-unit spending limit during this time.12\nFigure 3: Changes to the Land Value of a Quarter Acre Lot, Calendar Years 2012\u20132019\n\u2022  By analyzing project-level geographic location data, HUD could examine the extent to which SHOP projects are in line with statutory goals for geographic diversity. HUD has not used project-level data for this purpose; however, we obtained data from grantees to illustrate the geographic distribution of SHOP units (see fig. 4).\nFigure 4: Geographic Location of Units Assisted by SHOP, Fiscal Years 2011\u20132020\nNote: This map shows 5,577 SHOP units, including those conveyed, in progress, or planned. For one grantee, geographic location reflects each affiliate\u2019s office locations and not the exact location of constructed units. HUD\u2019s strategic plan includes a strategic objective on enhancing grants management, with a strategy to analyze HUD\u2019s grants through oversight and data collection activities. HUD\u2019s strategic plan also includes an objective to leverage data as a strategic asset.13 Additionally, SHOP\u2019s governing statute includes a goal to develop homes on a geographically diverse basis, including areas with high housing costs, rural areas, and areas underserved by other homeownership opportunities. HUD officials told us that collecting additional data presents an administrative burden to the agency, and they were unable to provide us with project-level information that could be analyzed across grantees. However, as part of our analysis, we obtained project-level data from grantees, suggesting that grantees have information readily available that would assist HUD in making informed program decisions. HUD officials did not explain why they could not demonstrate any analysis of market data before making changes to the per-unit spending limit in fiscal years 2004 and 2022. However, HUD recently conducted a retroactive analysis of market data, such as land costs, that officials said supported the 2022 change. HUD included the analysis in a briefing provided to certain congressional committees in May 2023. Officials also noted that although they have not been able to conduct an independent evaluation of SHOP, they intend to increase analyses and work with HUD\u2019s Office of Policy Development and Research to identify which data points may be helpful in making program decisions and create a plan to do so.14\nBy not assessing market data prior to making policy decisions, HUD cannot ensure that its policy decisions related to program costs reflect market conditions, such as changes in land costs. Additionally, by not systematically analyzing SHOP project-level data, HUD may be missing opportunities to assess the achievement of statutory goals, such as ensuring geographic diversity within the program.\nConclusions\nSHOP has helped low-income individuals and families become homeowners at a time when demand for affordable housing continues to outpace supply. HUD makes program decisions that affect the number and location of housing units. However, HUD has not analyzed information on market changes or the project- level information it collects from grantees to inform its key program decisions. For example, without analyzing information on market changes, HUD does not have reasonable assurance that the per-unit spending limit is informed by market conditions. In addition, without analyzing project-level information from grantees, HUD may be missing information relevant to its statutory obligations, which include ensuring that homes are developed on a national and geographically diverse basis. Systematically analyzing this information would better position HUD to understand external factors that affect grantees and to monitor its achievement of program goals.\nRecommendation for Executive Action\nThe Secretary of HUD should ensure that the Director of the Office of Rural Housing and Economic Development systematically analyzes relevant market and project-level data to inform program decisions for SHOP, including any per- unit spending limit that HUD establishes. (Recommendation 1)\nAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\nWe provided a draft of this report to HUD for review and comment. In its written comments, which are reproduced in appendix I, HUD neither agreed nor disagreed with our recommendation. HUD also provided technical comments that we incorporated, as appropriate. In its response to our draft report, HUD noted that it had enhanced its collection and analysis of SHOP data over the last 5 years, including engaging its Office of Policy Development and Research to develop a framework for analyzing costs. The report acknowledges these efforts. HUD also noted that it analyzed market data in its decision-making. However, as noted in our draft report, the agency did not demonstrate market data analysis conducted prior to increasing the per-unit spending limit.\nHow GAO Did This Study\nTo inform all of our work, we reviewed SHOP\u2019s governing statute, HUD guidance documents, HUD\u2019s annual notices of funding opportunity, and available HUD data, and we interviewed HUD officials who administer SHOP. To describe SHOP trends, we reviewed additional HUD documentation, including congressional budget justifications. We also reviewed HUD data on grant amounts, the minimum number of required units, and total conveyed units for fiscal years 1998 through 2020 (the most recent data available at the time of our review). To determine the reliability of HUD\u2019s data, we performed electronic testing for missing values and obvious errors and discussed the data with HUD officials. We determined the data were sufficiently reliable for reporting grant amounts and units required and conveyed for fiscal years 1998\u20132020. To assess the extent to which HUD analyzes data to inform SHOP decisions, we reviewed HUD documentation and data. We also interviewed HUD officials to obtain information on how HUD collects and stores SHOP data and whether and how HUD uses project and market data to inform SHOP decisions.\nIn addition, we reviewed project-level data from four SHOP grantees on the location of SHOP units for fiscal years 2011\u20132020. To determine the reliability of project-level grantee data, we performed electronic testing for missing values and obvious errors and discussed the data with each grantee. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for reporting approximate locations of SHOP units, including those conveyed, in progress, or planned, between 2011 and 2020. We also reviewed Federal Housing Finance Agency data on national average land prices for 2012\u20132019 to illustrate how market data could be analyzed to inform SHOP decisions. To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed related documentation and we reviewed the data for completeness. We found these data to be sufficiently reliable for reporting the change in national average land prices between 2012 and 2019. We conducted this performance audit from January 2023 to July 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nList of Addressees\nThe Honorable Brian Schatz Chair The Honorable Cindy Hyde-Smith Ranking Member Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies United States Senate\nThe Honorable Tom Cole Chair The Honorable Mike Quigley Ranking Member Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies House of Representatives\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and other interested parties.\nGAO Contact Information\nFor more information contact: Jill Naamane, NaamaneJ@gao.gov, (202) 512- 8678.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and other federal agencies administer a number of programs that focus on increasing the supply of affordable housing.

In December 2015, the administration and oversight of SHOP was moved from HUD\u2019s Office of Affordable Housing Programs to the Office of Rural Housing and Economic Development. According to HUD officials, this office assumed responsibility for the program because of its experience administering competitive grant programs and creating housing and economic opportunities in rural and underserved areas.\nHow does HUD implement SHOP?\nHUD does the following to implement SHOP: Per-unit spending limit. When HUD solicits SHOP grant applications each year, it sets a limit on the amount of SHOP funds grantees can spend\u2014on average\u2014 for an individual housing unit.5 Since fiscal year 2022, the per-unit spending limit has been $25,000.6 Production requirements.

Under SHOP, grantees must develop a specific and reasonable number of homes with the grant amount, taking into consideration costs and economic conditions of the areas in which the homes will be developed.7 This number must be at least 30 homes. Funding categories. For fiscal year 2022, HUD instituted three funding categories: national organizations (which were awarded $6 million), regional organizations ($3.5 million), and consortium organizations ($3 million). Award process. HUD announces annual SHOP grant award opportunities through notices of funding opportunity and awards funds to grantees through a competitive process. HUD evaluates applicants through a rating system, awarding points in five categories: applicant experience and capacity, extent of need for affordable homeownership housing and SHOP funds, soundness of approach to carrying out proposed SHOP activities, leveraging other resources, and program monitoring and evaluation plans. Since the Office of Rural Housing and Economic Development began administering SHOP in December 2015, HUD has awarded funds to five private nonprofit grantees: Community Frameworks, Habitat for Humanity, the Housing Assistance Council, Tierra Del Sol, and most recently the Community Resources and Housing Development Corporation in fiscal year 2022 (see table 1).8\nHousing\nFigure 1: Congressional Appropriations for the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program, Fiscal Years 1998\u20132023\nNote: This figure depicts budget authority for certain years in which the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s budget justification did not separately list an appropriation.

HUD also measures how many SHOP units are \u201cconveyed,\u201d which the agency has defined as the transfer of title\u2014that is, ownership\u2014to a SHOP-eligible homebuyer.10 The number of SHOP units conveyed declined from 1,749 units in fiscal year 1998 to 478 units in 2016 (see fig. 2). Because grantees have multiple years to develop and convey units, all grants for fiscal year 2016 and after were still open. Therefore, lots acquired and units conveyed may not reflect final unit counts.11\nFigure 2: Units Conveyed, Lots Acquired, and Minimum Units Required through the Self- Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP) by Fiscal Year, 1998\u20132020\nNote: This figure reflects units required and conveyed using funding appropriated for a given fiscal year, not the fiscal year in which the units were actually completed or conveyed. HUD data on units conveyed and lots acquired include some open SHOP grants across fiscal years, including all grants made with funding from fiscal year 2016 and later. This means that the number of units conveyed and lots acquired in the figure may not reflect final unit counts because grantees have multiple years to develop and convey units and HUD is still closing out grants. According to HUD\u2019s fiscal year 2020 notice of funding opportunity, SHOP grantees have 6 years to develop and convey units developed with SHOP funds.

To describe SHOP trends, we reviewed additional HUD documentation, including congressional budget justifications. We also reviewed HUD data on grant amounts, the minimum number of required units, and total conveyed units for fiscal years 1998 through 2020 (the most recent data available at the time of our review). To determine the reliability of HUD\u2019s data, we performed electronic testing for missing values and obvious errors and discussed the data with HUD officials. We determined the data were sufficiently reliable for reporting grant amounts and units required and conveyed for fiscal years 1998\u20132020. To assess the extent to which HUD analyzes data to inform SHOP decisions, we reviewed HUD documentation and data. We also interviewed HUD officials to obtain information on how HUD collects and stores SHOP data and whether and how HUD uses project and market data to inform SHOP decisions.\nIn addition, we reviewed project-level data from four SHOP grantees on the location of SHOP units for fiscal years 2011\u20132020. To determine the reliability of project-level grantee data, we performed electronic testing for missing values and obvious errors and discussed the data with each grantee. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for reporting approximate locations of SHOP units, including those conveyed, in progress, or planned, between 2011 and 2020. We also reviewed Federal Housing Finance Agency data on national average land prices for 2012\u20132019 to illustrate how market data could be analyzed to inform SHOP decisions. To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed related documentation and we reviewed the data for completeness. We found these data to be sufficiently reliable for reporting the change in national average land prices between 2012 and 2019. We conducted this performance audit from January 2023 to July 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nList of Addressees\nThe Honorable Brian Schatz Chair The Honorable Cindy Hyde-Smith Ranking Member Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies United States Senate\nThe Honorable Tom Cole Chair The Honorable Mike Quigley Ranking Member Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies House of Representatives\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and other interested parties.\nGAO Contact Information\nFor more information contact: Jill Naamane, NaamaneJ@gao.gov, (202) 512- 8678.

{"content": "U.S. Government Accountability Office Affordable Housing: HUD Could Improve Use of Data for the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program GAO-23-106628 Report to Congressional Committees July 24, 2023\nWhy This Matters\n Demand for affordable housing throughout the U.S. continues to outpace supply. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and other federal agencies administer a number of programs that focus on increasing the supply of affordable housing. One of these is HUD\u2019s Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP). Some Members of Congress have raised questions about the information HUD collects on SHOP and how it uses information to inform program decisions.1 The joint explanatory statement regarding the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 provides for GAO to evaluate various aspects of SHOP.2 This report examines how HUD collects and uses data for SHOP, including to inform program decisions.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022  SHOP is a competitive federal grant program that awards funds to eligible nonprofit organizations to help develop affordable housing units for purchase by low-income families. \u2022  HUD collects some data from SHOP grantees. However, HUD has not used these data, or data on market conditions, to inform key program decisions, such as setting the limit on the amount of SHOP funds grantees can spend on each housing unit. \u2022  Our analysis of market data shows that costs for certain eligible SHOP activities have increased over time; however, HUD has changed the per-unit spending limit only twice since the program\u2019s inception. \u2022  We recommend that HUD use project-level and market data to inform its administration of SHOP. By analyzing these data in a systematic way, HUD could make better-informed program decisions.\nWhat is SHOP?\nSHOP is a competitive federal grant program that awards funds to eligible grantees to help develop affordable homes for low-income families. The program uses a self-help model in which low-income individuals and families contribute their \u201csweat equity\u201d\u2014nonmonetary investment of labor\u2014to help build housing they will buy.3 Grantees must be national or regional public or private nonprofit organizations or consortia that have the capacity and experience to provide self-help housing homeownership opportunities. Grantees may use SHOP funds to pay for the cost of the following activities that set the stage for housing construction:\n\u2022  Land acquisition. Acquiring land on which to build the home. \u2022  Infrastructure improvements. The installation, construction, or improvement of utilities or other infrastructure.4 Grantees must leverage other financial resources to develop SHOP-funded projects, such as funding from private lenders, foundations, and state or local agencies. In December 2015, the administration and oversight of SHOP was moved from HUD\u2019s Office of Affordable Housing Programs to the Office of Rural Housing and Economic Development. According to HUD officials, this office assumed responsibility for the program because of its experience administering competitive grant programs and creating housing and economic opportunities in rural and underserved areas.\nHow does HUD implement SHOP?\nHUD does the following to implement SHOP: Per-unit spending limit. When HUD solicits SHOP grant applications each year, it sets a limit on the amount of SHOP funds grantees can spend\u2014on average\u2014 for an individual housing unit.5 Since fiscal year 2022, the per-unit spending limit has been $25,000.6 Production requirements. Each year, HUD uses a grantee\u2019s award amount and the per-unit spending limit to determine the minimum number of units the grantee is required to complete, according to officials. Under SHOP, grantees must develop a specific and reasonable number of homes with the grant amount, taking into consideration costs and economic conditions of the areas in which the homes will be developed.7 This number must be at least 30 homes. Funding categories. For fiscal year 2022, HUD instituted three funding categories: national organizations (which were awarded $6 million), regional organizations ($3.5 million), and consortium organizations ($3 million). Award process. HUD announces annual SHOP grant award opportunities through notices of funding opportunity and awards funds to grantees through a competitive process. HUD evaluates applicants through a rating system, awarding points in five categories: applicant experience and capacity, extent of need for affordable homeownership housing and SHOP funds, soundness of approach to carrying out proposed SHOP activities, leveraging other resources, and program monitoring and evaluation plans. Since the Office of Rural Housing and Economic Development began administering SHOP in December 2015, HUD has awarded funds to five private nonprofit grantees: Community Frameworks, Habitat for Humanity, the Housing Assistance Council, Tierra Del Sol, and most recently the Community Resources and Housing Development Corporation in fiscal year 2022 (see table 1).8\nHousing\nFigure 1: Congressional Appropriations for the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program, Fiscal Years 1998\u20132023\nNote: This figure depicts budget authority for certain years in which the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s budget justification did not separately list an appropriation. Per-unit spending limit. Since fiscal year 1998, HUD has changed the per-unit spending limit twice. The limit was $10,000 from fiscal years 1998 through 2003, $15,000 from fiscal years 2004 through 2021, and it has been $25,000 since fiscal year 2022. Unit production. The minimum number of housing units HUD required SHOP grantees to complete declined from 2,354 in fiscal year 1998 to 537 in 2020.9 According to HUD officials, the number of units required decreased in most cases because of reductions in SHOP funding. HUD also measures how many SHOP units are \u201cconveyed,\u201d which the agency has defined as the transfer of title\u2014that is, ownership\u2014to a SHOP-eligible homebuyer.10 The number of SHOP units conveyed declined from 1,749 units in fiscal year 1998 to 478 units in 2016 (see fig. 2). Because grantees have multiple years to develop and convey units, all grants for fiscal year 2016 and after were still open. Therefore, lots acquired and units conveyed may not reflect final unit counts.11\nFigure 2: Units Conveyed, Lots Acquired, and Minimum Units Required through the Self- Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP) by Fiscal Year, 1998\u20132020\nNote: This figure reflects units required and conveyed using funding appropriated for a given fiscal year, not the fiscal year in which the units were actually completed or conveyed. HUD data on units conveyed and lots acquired include some open SHOP grants across fiscal years, including all grants made with funding from fiscal year 2016 and later. This means that the number of units conveyed and lots acquired in the figure may not reflect final unit counts because grantees have multiple years to develop and convey units and HUD is still closing out grants. According to HUD\u2019s fiscal year 2020 notice of funding opportunity, SHOP grantees have 6 years to develop and convey units developed with SHOP funds. In addition, this figure includes data on the four main grantees, but does not include all grantees that have received SHOP funds since 1998.\nWhat information does HUD collect from grantees and how is it used?\nHUD collects the following information from each grantee, either annually or semiannually, at the aggregate level: \u2022  Number of lots acquired \u2022  Number of units constructed \u2022  Number of units conveyed \u2022  Number of units developed in rural areas \u2022  Number of units developed in urban areas \u2022  Number of units that are accessible \u2022  Number of sweat equity hours executed \u2022  Amount expended on land acquisition \u2022  Amount expended on infrastructure improvements \u2022  Amount of leveraged funds used from non-SHOP sources\nAccording to officials, HUD increased the data points collected from grantees when the office assumed responsibility for SHOP in 2016. Additionally, HUD requires grantees to provide some project-level information as part of its semiannual and annual reporting requirements. For example, grantees must provide information on the construction status, unit characteristics, and income composition of the homeowners in SHOP-funded units.\nHUD officials said the project-level information from grantees is generally collected as part of HUD\u2019s grant agreement process, and is not stored or maintained in a spreadsheet or database that would enable HUD to analyze project-level information across grantees.\nTo what extent has HUD used data to for SHOP?\nHUD generally has not used data to inform SHOP policy decisions. Instead, HUD historically has made program decisions for SHOP based on appropriations and inform policy decisions    grantee requests, according to officials. For example: \u2022  HUD has used SHOP\u2019s appropriation and the per-unit spending limit to determine the minimum number of units to be completed by grantees. Specifically, to determine the minimum for each grantee, HUD divides the grant amount (excluding the administrative cost allowance) by the per-unit spending limit. \u2022   HUD raised the per-unit spending limit from $10,000 to $15,000 in 2004 and to $25,000 in 2022. According to HUD officials, HUD made the most recent change in response to grantees\u2019 requests and in the context of rising land costs. Although HUD provided a retroactive analysis of the 2022 change, the agency did not demonstrate any analysis of SHOP project-level or market data conducted before it made changes to the per- unit-spending limit. Analyzing detailed data could better position HUD to make informed decisions about SHOP. For example: \u2022   By analyzing market data, HUD could determine whether the per-unit spending limit is keeping pace with increases in applicable costs, such as the cost of acquiring land for SHOP projects. For example, although national land prices increased approximately 60 percent between 2012 and 2019 (see fig. 3), HUD did not raise the per-unit spending limit during this time.12\nFigure 3: Changes to the Land Value of a Quarter Acre Lot, Calendar Years 2012\u20132019\n\u2022  By analyzing project-level geographic location data, HUD could examine the extent to which SHOP projects are in line with statutory goals for geographic diversity. HUD has not used project-level data for this purpose; however, we obtained data from grantees to illustrate the geographic distribution of SHOP units (see fig. 4).\nFigure 4: Geographic Location of Units Assisted by SHOP, Fiscal Years 2011\u20132020\nNote: This map shows 5,577 SHOP units, including those conveyed, in progress, or planned. For one grantee, geographic location reflects each affiliate\u2019s office locations and not the exact location of constructed units. HUD\u2019s strategic plan includes a strategic objective on enhancing grants management, with a strategy to analyze HUD\u2019s grants through oversight and data collection activities. HUD\u2019s strategic plan also includes an objective to leverage data as a strategic asset.13 Additionally, SHOP\u2019s governing statute includes a goal to develop homes on a geographically diverse basis, including areas with high housing costs, rural areas, and areas underserved by other homeownership opportunities. HUD officials told us that collecting additional data presents an administrative burden to the agency, and they were unable to provide us with project-level information that could be analyzed across grantees. However, as part of our analysis, we obtained project-level data from grantees, suggesting that grantees have information readily available that would assist HUD in making informed program decisions. HUD officials did not explain why they could not demonstrate any analysis of market data before making changes to the per-unit spending limit in fiscal years 2004 and 2022. However, HUD recently conducted a retroactive analysis of market data, such as land costs, that officials said supported the 2022 change. HUD included the analysis in a briefing provided to certain congressional committees in May 2023. Officials also noted that although they have not been able to conduct an independent evaluation of SHOP, they intend to increase analyses and work with HUD\u2019s Office of Policy Development and Research to identify which data points may be helpful in making program decisions and create a plan to do so.14\nBy not assessing market data prior to making policy decisions, HUD cannot ensure that its policy decisions related to program costs reflect market conditions, such as changes in land costs. Additionally, by not systematically analyzing SHOP project-level data, HUD may be missing opportunities to assess the achievement of statutory goals, such as ensuring geographic diversity within the program.\nConclusions\nSHOP has helped low-income individuals and families become homeowners at a time when demand for affordable housing continues to outpace supply. HUD makes program decisions that affect the number and location of housing units. However, HUD has not analyzed information on market changes or the project- level information it collects from grantees to inform its key program decisions. For example, without analyzing information on market changes, HUD does not have reasonable assurance that the per-unit spending limit is informed by market conditions. In addition, without analyzing project-level information from grantees, HUD may be missing information relevant to its statutory obligations, which include ensuring that homes are developed on a national and geographically diverse basis. Systematically analyzing this information would better position HUD to understand external factors that affect grantees and to monitor its achievement of program goals.\nRecommendation for Executive Action\nThe Secretary of HUD should ensure that the Director of the Office of Rural Housing and Economic Development systematically analyzes relevant market and project-level data to inform program decisions for SHOP, including any per- unit spending limit that HUD establishes. (Recommendation 1)\nAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\nWe provided a draft of this report to HUD for review and comment. In its written comments, which are reproduced in appendix I, HUD neither agreed nor disagreed with our recommendation. HUD also provided technical comments that we incorporated, as appropriate. In its response to our draft report, HUD noted that it had enhanced its collection and analysis of SHOP data over the last 5 years, including engaging its Office of Policy Development and Research to develop a framework for analyzing costs. The report acknowledges these efforts. HUD also noted that it analyzed market data in its decision-making. However, as noted in our draft report, the agency did not demonstrate market data analysis conducted prior to increasing the per-unit spending limit.\nHow GAO Did This Study\nTo inform all of our work, we reviewed SHOP\u2019s governing statute, HUD guidance documents, HUD\u2019s annual notices of funding opportunity, and available HUD data, and we interviewed HUD officials who administer SHOP. To describe SHOP trends, we reviewed additional HUD documentation, including congressional budget justifications. We also reviewed HUD data on grant amounts, the minimum number of required units, and total conveyed units for fiscal years 1998 through 2020 (the most recent data available at the time of our review). To determine the reliability of HUD\u2019s data, we performed electronic testing for missing values and obvious errors and discussed the data with HUD officials. We determined the data were sufficiently reliable for reporting grant amounts and units required and conveyed for fiscal years 1998\u20132020. To assess the extent to which HUD analyzes data to inform SHOP decisions, we reviewed HUD documentation and data. We also interviewed HUD officials to obtain information on how HUD collects and stores SHOP data and whether and how HUD uses project and market data to inform SHOP decisions.\nIn addition, we reviewed project-level data from four SHOP grantees on the location of SHOP units for fiscal years 2011\u20132020. To determine the reliability of project-level grantee data, we performed electronic testing for missing values and obvious errors and discussed the data with each grantee. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for reporting approximate locations of SHOP units, including those conveyed, in progress, or planned, between 2011 and 2020. We also reviewed Federal Housing Finance Agency data on national average land prices for 2012\u20132019 to illustrate how market data could be analyzed to inform SHOP decisions. To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed related documentation and we reviewed the data for completeness. We found these data to be sufficiently reliable for reporting the change in national average land prices between 2012 and 2019. We conducted this performance audit from January 2023 to July 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nList of Addressees\nThe Honorable Brian Schatz Chair The Honorable Cindy Hyde-Smith Ranking Member Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies United States Senate\nThe Honorable Tom Cole Chair The Honorable Mike Quigley Ranking Member Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies House of Representatives\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and other interested parties.\nGAO Contact Information\nFor more information contact: Jill Naamane, NaamaneJ@gao.gov, (202) 512- 8678.

{"content": "U.S. Government Accountability Office Affordable Housing: HUD Could Improve Use of Data for the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program GAO-23-106628 Report to Congressional Committees July 24, 2023\nWhy This Matters\n Demand for affordable housing throughout the U.S. continues to outpace supply. The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and other federal agencies administer a number of programs that focus on increasing the supply of affordable housing. One of these is HUD\u2019s Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP). Some Members of Congress have raised questions about the information HUD collects on SHOP and how it uses information to inform program decisions.1 The joint explanatory statement regarding the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 provides for GAO to evaluate various aspects of SHOP.2 This report examines how HUD collects and uses data for SHOP, including to inform program decisions.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022  SHOP is a competitive federal grant program that awards funds to eligible nonprofit organizations to help develop affordable housing units for purchase by low-income families. \u2022  HUD collects some data from SHOP grantees. However, HUD has not used these data, or data on market conditions, to inform key program decisions, such as setting the limit on the amount of SHOP funds grantees can spend on each housing unit. \u2022  Our analysis of market data shows that costs for certain eligible SHOP activities have increased over time; however, HUD has changed the per-unit spending limit only twice since the program\u2019s inception. \u2022  We recommend that HUD use project-level and market data to inform its administration of SHOP. By analyzing these data in a systematic way, HUD could make better-informed program decisions.\nWhat is SHOP?\nSHOP is a competitive federal grant program that awards funds to eligible grantees to help develop affordable homes for low-income families. The program uses a self-help model in which low-income individuals and families contribute their \u201csweat equity\u201d\u2014nonmonetary investment of labor\u2014to help build housing they will buy.3 Grantees must be national or regional public or private nonprofit organizations or consortia that have the capacity and experience to provide self-help housing homeownership opportunities. Grantees may use SHOP funds to pay for the cost of the following activities that set the stage for housing construction:\n\u2022  Land acquisition. Acquiring land on which to build the home. \u2022  Infrastructure improvements. The installation, construction, or improvement of utilities or other infrastructure.4 Grantees must leverage other financial resources to develop SHOP-funded projects, such as funding from private lenders, foundations, and state or local agencies. In December 2015, the administration and oversight of SHOP was moved from HUD\u2019s Office of Affordable Housing Programs to the Office of Rural Housing and Economic Development. According to HUD officials, this office assumed responsibility for the program because of its experience administering competitive grant programs and creating housing and economic opportunities in rural and underserved areas.\nHow does HUD implement SHOP?\nHUD does the following to implement SHOP: Per-unit spending limit. When HUD solicits SHOP grant applications each year, it sets a limit on the amount of SHOP funds grantees can spend\u2014on average\u2014 for an individual housing unit.5 Since fiscal year 2022, the per-unit spending limit has been $25,000.6 Production requirements. Each year, HUD uses a grantee\u2019s award amount and the per-unit spending limit to determine the minimum number of units the grantee is required to complete, according to officials. Under SHOP, grantees must develop a specific and reasonable number of homes with the grant amount, taking into consideration costs and economic conditions of the areas in which the homes will be developed.7 This number must be at least 30 homes. Funding categories. For fiscal year 2022, HUD instituted three funding categories: national organizations (which were awarded $6 million), regional organizations ($3.5 million), and consortium organizations ($3 million). Award process. HUD announces annual SHOP grant award opportunities through notices of funding opportunity and awards funds to grantees through a competitive process. HUD evaluates applicants through a rating system, awarding points in five categories: applicant experience and capacity, extent of need for affordable homeownership housing and SHOP funds, soundness of approach to carrying out proposed SHOP activities, leveraging other resources, and program monitoring and evaluation plans. Since the Office of Rural Housing and Economic Development began administering SHOP in December 2015, HUD has awarded funds to five private nonprofit grantees: Community Frameworks, Habitat for Humanity, the Housing Assistance Council, Tierra Del Sol, and most recently the Community Resources and Housing Development Corporation in fiscal year 2022 (see table 1).8\nHousing\nFigure 1: Congressional Appropriations for the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program, Fiscal Years 1998\u20132023\nNote: This figure depicts budget authority for certain years in which the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s budget justification did not separately list an appropriation. Per-unit spending limit. Since fiscal year 1998, HUD has changed the per-unit spending limit twice. The limit was $10,000 from fiscal years 1998 through 2003, $15,000 from fiscal years 2004 through 2021, and it has been $25,000 since fiscal year 2022. Unit production. The minimum number of housing units HUD required SHOP grantees to complete declined from 2,354 in fiscal year 1998 to 537 in 2020.9 According to HUD officials, the number of units required decreased in most cases because of reductions in SHOP funding. HUD also measures how many SHOP units are \u201cconveyed,\u201d which the agency has defined as the transfer of title\u2014that is, ownership\u2014to a SHOP-eligible homebuyer.10 The number of SHOP units conveyed declined from 1,749 units in fiscal year 1998 to 478 units in 2016 (see fig. 2). Because grantees have multiple years to develop and convey units, all grants for fiscal year 2016 and after were still open. Therefore, lots acquired and units conveyed may not reflect final unit counts.11\nFigure 2: Units Conveyed, Lots Acquired, and Minimum Units Required through the Self- Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP) by Fiscal Year, 1998\u20132020\nNote: This figure reflects units required and conveyed using funding appropriated for a given fiscal year, not the fiscal year in which the units were actually completed or conveyed. HUD data on units conveyed and lots acquired include some open SHOP grants across fiscal years, including all grants made with funding from fiscal year 2016 and later. This means that the number of units conveyed and lots acquired in the figure may not reflect final unit counts because grantees have multiple years to develop and convey units and HUD is still closing out grants. According to HUD\u2019s fiscal year 2020 notice of funding opportunity, SHOP grantees have 6 years to develop and convey units developed with SHOP funds. In addition, this figure includes data on the four main grantees, but does not include all grantees that have received SHOP funds since 1998.\nWhat information does HUD collect from grantees and how is it used?\nHUD collects the following information from each grantee, either annually or semiannually, at the aggregate level: \u2022  Number of lots acquired \u2022  Number of units constructed \u2022  Number of units conveyed \u2022  Number of units developed in rural areas \u2022  Number of units developed in urban areas \u2022  Number of units that are accessible \u2022  Number of sweat equity hours executed \u2022  Amount expended on land acquisition \u2022  Amount expended on infrastructure improvements \u2022  Amount of leveraged funds used from non-SHOP sources\nAccording to officials, HUD increased the data points collected from grantees when the office assumed responsibility for SHOP in 2016. Additionally, HUD requires grantees to provide some project-level information as part of its semiannual and annual reporting requirements. For example, grantees must provide information on the construction status, unit characteristics, and income composition of the homeowners in SHOP-funded units.\nHUD officials said the project-level information from grantees is generally collected as part of HUD\u2019s grant agreement process, and is not stored or maintained in a spreadsheet or database that would enable HUD to analyze project-level information across grantees.\nTo what extent has HUD used data to for SHOP?\nHUD generally has not used data to inform SHOP policy decisions. Instead, HUD historically has made program decisions for SHOP based on appropriations and inform policy decisions    grantee requests, according to officials. For example: \u2022  HUD has used SHOP\u2019s appropriation and the per-unit spending limit to determine the minimum number of units to be completed by grantees. Specifically, to determine the minimum for each grantee, HUD divides the grant amount (excluding the administrative cost allowance) by the per-unit spending limit. \u2022   HUD raised the per-unit spending limit from $10,000 to $15,000 in 2004 and to $25,000 in 2022. According to HUD officials, HUD made the most recent change in response to grantees\u2019 requests and in the context of rising land costs. Although HUD provided a retroactive analysis of the 2022 change, the agency did not demonstrate any analysis of SHOP project-level or market data conducted before it made changes to the per- unit-spending limit. Analyzing detailed data could better position HUD to make informed decisions about SHOP. For example: \u2022   By analyzing market data, HUD could determine whether the per-unit spending limit is keeping pace with increases in applicable costs, such as the cost of acquiring land for SHOP projects. For example, although national land prices increased approximately 60 percent between 2012 and 2019 (see fig. 3), HUD did not raise the per-unit spending limit during this time.12\nFigure 3: Changes to the Land Value of a Quarter Acre Lot, Calendar Years 2012\u20132019\n\u2022  By analyzing project-level geographic location data, HUD could examine the extent to which SHOP projects are in line with statutory goals for geographic diversity. HUD has not used project-level data for this purpose; however, we obtained data from grantees to illustrate the geographic distribution of SHOP units (see fig. 4).\nFigure 4: Geographic Location of Units Assisted by SHOP, Fiscal Years 2011\u20132020\nNote: This map shows 5,577 SHOP units, including those conveyed, in progress, or planned. For one grantee, geographic location reflects each affiliate\u2019s office locations and not the exact location of constructed units. HUD\u2019s strategic plan includes a strategic objective on enhancing grants management, with a strategy to analyze HUD\u2019s grants through oversight and data collection activities. HUD\u2019s strategic plan also includes an objective to leverage data as a strategic asset.13 Additionally, SHOP\u2019s governing statute includes a goal to develop homes on a geographically diverse basis, including areas with high housing costs, rural areas, and areas underserved by other homeownership opportunities. HUD officials told us that collecting additional data presents an administrative burden to the agency, and they were unable to provide us with project-level information that could be analyzed across grantees. However, as part of our analysis, we obtained project-level data from grantees, suggesting that grantees have information readily available that would assist HUD in making informed program decisions. HUD officials did not explain why they could not demonstrate any analysis of market data before making changes to the per-unit spending limit in fiscal years 2004 and 2022. However, HUD recently conducted a retroactive analysis of market data, such as land costs, that officials said supported the 2022 change. HUD included the analysis in a briefing provided to certain congressional committees in May 2023. Officials also noted that although they have not been able to conduct an independent evaluation of SHOP, they intend to increase analyses and work with HUD\u2019s Office of Policy Development and Research to identify which data points may be helpful in making program decisions and create a plan to do so.14\nBy not assessing market data prior to making policy decisions, HUD cannot ensure that its policy decisions related to program costs reflect market conditions, such as changes in land costs. Additionally, by not systematically analyzing SHOP project-level data, HUD may be missing opportunities to assess the achievement of statutory goals, such as ensuring geographic diversity within the program.\nConclusions\nSHOP has helped low-income individuals and families become homeowners at a time when demand for affordable housing continues to outpace supply. HUD makes program decisions that affect the number and location of housing units. However, HUD has not analyzed information on market changes or the project- level information it collects from grantees to inform its key program decisions. For example, without analyzing information on market changes, HUD does not have reasonable assurance that the per-unit spending limit is informed by market conditions. In addition, without analyzing project-level information from grantees, HUD may be missing information relevant to its statutory obligations, which include ensuring that homes are developed on a national and geographically diverse basis. Systematically analyzing this information would better position HUD to understand external factors that affect grantees and to monitor its achievement of program goals.\nRecommendation for Executive Action\nThe Secretary of HUD should ensure that the Director of the Office of Rural Housing and Economic Development systematically analyzes relevant market and project-level data to inform program decisions for SHOP, including any per- unit spending limit that HUD establishes. (Recommendation 1)\nAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\nWe provided a draft of this report to HUD for review and comment. In its written comments, which are reproduced in appendix I, HUD neither agreed nor disagreed with our recommendation. HUD also provided technical comments that we incorporated, as appropriate. In its response to our draft report, HUD noted that it had enhanced its collection and analysis of SHOP data over the last 5 years, including engaging its Office of Policy Development and Research to develop a framework for analyzing costs. The report acknowledges these efforts. HUD also noted that it analyzed market data in its decision-making. However, as noted in our draft report, the agency did not demonstrate market data analysis conducted prior to increasing the per-unit spending limit.\nHow GAO Did This Study\nTo inform all of our work, we reviewed SHOP\u2019s governing statute, HUD guidance documents, HUD\u2019s annual notices of funding opportunity, and available HUD data, and we interviewed HUD officials who administer SHOP. To describe SHOP trends, we reviewed additional HUD documentation, including congressional budget justifications. We also reviewed HUD data on grant amounts, the minimum number of required units, and total conveyed units for fiscal years 1998 through 2020 (the most recent data available at the time of our review). To determine the reliability of HUD\u2019s data, we performed electronic testing for missing values and obvious errors and discussed the data with HUD officials. We determined the data were sufficiently reliable for reporting grant amounts and units required and conveyed for fiscal years 1998\u20132020. To assess the extent to which HUD analyzes data to inform SHOP decisions, we reviewed HUD documentation and data. We also interviewed HUD officials to obtain information on how HUD collects and stores SHOP data and whether and how HUD uses project and market data to inform SHOP decisions.\nIn addition, we reviewed project-level data from four SHOP grantees on the location of SHOP units for fiscal years 2011\u20132020. To determine the reliability of project-level grantee data, we performed electronic testing for missing values and obvious errors and discussed the data with each grantee. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for reporting approximate locations of SHOP units, including those conveyed, in progress, or planned, between 2011 and 2020. We also reviewed Federal Housing Finance Agency data on national average land prices for 2012\u20132019 to illustrate how market data could be analyzed to inform SHOP decisions. To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed related documentation and we reviewed the data for completeness. We found these data to be sufficiently reliable for reporting the change in national average land prices between 2012 and 2019. We conducted this performance audit from January 2023 to July 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nList of Addressees\nThe Honorable Brian Schatz Chair The Honorable Cindy Hyde-Smith Ranking Member Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies United States Senate\nThe Honorable Tom Cole Chair The Honorable Mike Quigley Ranking Member Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies House of Representatives\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and other interested parties.\nGAO Contact Information\nFor more information contact: Jill Naamane, NaamaneJ@gao.gov, (202) 512- 8678.

{"content": "CYBERSECURITY HIGH-RISK SERIES: Challenges in Securing Federal Systems and Information n\n Overview Federal agencies and our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures\u2014such as energy, transportation systems, communications, and financial services\u2014are dependent on technology systems to carry out fundamental operations and to process, maintain, and report vital information. The security of these systems and data is also vital to safeguarding individual privacy and protecting the nation\u2019s security, prosperity, and well-being. However, risks to these essential technology systems are increasing\u2014in particular, malicious actors are becoming more willing and capable of carrying out cyberattacks. Such attacks could result in serious harm to human safety, national security, the environment, and the economy. Agencies and critical infrastructure owners and operators must protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their systems and effectively respond to cyberattacks. We have designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area since 1997. We expanded this high-risk area in 2003 to include protection of critical cyber infrastructure. In 2015, we expanded it again to include protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information. This is the second in a series of four reports that lay out the main cybersecurity areas the federal government should urgently address. It focuses on securing federal systems and information.1 We have made 712 recommendations in public reports since 2010 in this area. About 150 of these recommendations were not implemented as of December 2022. Until these are fully implemented, federal agencies will be more limited in their ability to protect private and sensitive data entrusted to them. For more information on this report and others in this series, visit https://www.gao.gov/cybersecurity.\nWhat actions should be taken to improve the implementation of government-wide cybersecurity initiatives?  The CISA Act of 2018 (the act) established CISA within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to advance the mission of protecting federal civilian agencies\u2019 networks from cyber threats and to enhance the security of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure.2 The act also assigned five key cybersecurity responsibilities to CISA, including securing federal information and systems, coordinating federal efforts to secure and protect against critical infrastructure risk, and carrying out emergency communication stakeholder outreach (see figure 1).\nFigure 1: Five Key Responsibilities Assigned to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency\nTo implement these responsibilities, CISA undertook a three-phased organizational transformation initiative aimed at unifying the agency, improving mission effectiveness, and enhancing the workplace experience. Also, since its establishment, CISA has been reorganizing offices and functions previously organized under the department\u2019s National Protection and Programs Directorate and aligning its new organizational structure with its mission. In March 2021, we reported that CISA had completed 37 of 94 planned implementation tasks. Critical transformation tasks such as finalizing the mission-essential functions of CISA\u2019s divisions and defining incident management roles and responsibilities across the agency had not yet been completed. We also reported that the agency had not established an updated overall deadline for completing its transformation initiative. Until CISA establishes updated milestones and an overall deadline for its efforts, and expeditiously carries out these plans, the agency will be hindered in meeting the goals of its organizational transformation initiative. Consequently, this could impair the agency\u2019s ability to identify and respond to cyber incidents. \uf0d8   We recommended that CISA establish expected completion dates, plans for developing performance measures, and an overall deadline for the completion of the transformation initiative, as well as develop a strategy for comprehensive workforce planning. DHS agreed with our recommendations. As of December 2022, it had not yet implemented any of them.\nWhat actions can be taken to address weaknesses in federal agency information\nSince 2020, we have reported on government-wide and multiple individual agencies\u2019 management of the information security risk to their systems and data. The individual agencies we reviewed were the U.S. Secret Service, the Department of Defense (DOD), the U.S National Institutes of Health (NIH), and the Federal Communications Commission. Key examples include: security programs?\n To protect federal information and systems, the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA) requires federal agencies to develop, document, and implement information security programs. Congress included a provision in FISMA for GAO to periodically report on agencies\u2019 implementation of the act. In March 2022, we reported on the information security programs of 23 federal civilian agencies, including annually required program reviews to be conducted by agency IGs. Among other things, we noted that IGs determined that 16 (or 70 percent) of the 23 agencies had ineffective programs for fiscal year 2020.3 Figure 2 shows the number of  the 23 agencies that IGs rated as effective and not effective between fiscal years 2017 and 2020.\nFigure 2: Number of the 23 Civilian Agencies with Effective and Not Effective Agency-Wide Information Security Programs, as Reported by Inspectors General for Fiscal Years 2017-2020\n We found that OMB\u2019s guidance to IGs on conducting agency evaluations was not always clear, leading to inconsistent application and reporting by IGs. Further, we reported that the binary effective/not effective scale resulted in imprecise ratings that did not clearly distinguish among the differing levels of agencies\u2019 performance. By clarifying its guidance and enhancing its rating scale, OMB could help ensure a more consistent approach and nuanced picture of agencies\u2019 cybersecurity programs. \uf0d8   We recommended that OMB, in consultation with others, clarify its guidance to IGs and create a more precise overall rating scale. OMB did not concur with our recommendations, stating, in part, that they want to provide IGs with the flexibility to adapt their reviews. GAO maintains that the recommendations are warranted, but they had not yet been implemented as of December 2022.\nNIH's duties include researching infectious diseases and administering over $30 billion a year in research grants. NIH uses IT systems containing sensitive data to carry out its mission. In December 2021, we reported that NIH implemented information security controls\u2014 both for its security program and selected systems\u2014intended to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its systems and information. However, we identified numerous control and program deficiencies in core security functions. These issues related to identifying risk, protecting systems from threats and vulnerabilities, detecting and responding to cyber security events, and recovering system operations. Until NIH resolves the associated control and program deficiencies, its information systems and information will remain at increased risk of misuse, improper disclosure or modification, and destruction. \uf0d8   We recommended that NIH address these deficiencies, which resulted in 66 recommendations related to the security program and 153 recommendations related to system controls. As of December 2022, NIH had implemented about 71 percent of the total 219 recommendations. However, it had not yet implemented 15\nof Personnel Management; the Small Business Administration; the Social Security Administration; and the U.S. Agency for International Development. We did not include the Department of Defense because our scope was the civilian agencies. of the 66 on the information security program and 49 of the 153 on control deficiencies for selected systems.\nsystems?\nWhat actions can be taken to enhance the federal response to cyber incidents targeting federal Beginning as early as January 2019, a threat actor breached the computing networks at SolarWinds\u2014a Texas-based network management software company. Since the company\u2019s software was widely used in the federal government, this incident allowed the threat actor to breach several federal agencies\u2019 networks that used the software (see figure 3). In March 2021, Microsoft reported the exploitation or misuse of vulnerabilities to gain access to versions of the Microsoft Exchange Server that federal agencies hosted and used. Federal agencies formed Cyber Unified Coordination Groups to investigate the incidents.4\nFigure 3: Analysis of How a Threat Actor Exploited SolarWinds Orion Software\n In January 2022, we reported that the Cyber Unified Coordination Group agencies identified that information sharing and limited evidence collection led to challenges in coordinating and responding to the SolarWinds and Microsoft Exchange incidents. For example, we reported that an official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence told us that information sharing among law enforcement, private sector, and intelligence groups was difficult and time consuming, as there were different classification levels for information. In addition, the National Security Council, with input from the Cyber Unified Coordination Group agencies, conducted a review of the SolarWinds incident. The review identified that (1) aligning technology investments with operational priorities, (2) improving public-private engagement, and (3) improving threat intelligence acquisition, sharing, and use among federal agencies may help with preventing and responding to future cybersecurity incidents. If implemented effectively, the areas from the National \nSecurity Council review could help address several challenges identified for both the SolarWinds and Microsoft Exchange incidents. We did not make any recommendations in this report, but we maintain that addressing these challenges should remain a priority.\n DOD and our nation's defense industrial base\u2014which includes entities outside the federal government that provide goods or services critical to meeting U.S. military requirements\u2014are dependent on information systems to carry out their operations. These systems continue to be susceptible to cyber incidents as cybersecurity threats have evolved and become more sophisticated (see figure 4).\nFigure 4: Cyber Incidents Reported by Department of Defense's Cybersecurity Service Providers from Calendar Years 2015 through 2021\n In November 2022, we reported that DOD has taken steps to combat these attacks and the number of cyber incidents had declined in recent years. However, we found that the department (1) had not fully implemented its processes for managing cyber incidents, (2) did not have complete data on cyber incidents that staff report, and (3) did not document whether it notifies individuals whose personal data is compromised in a cyber incident. For example, DOD's system for reporting all incidents often contained incomplete information, and DOD could not always demonstrate that it had notified appropriate leadership of relevant critical incidents. Without addressing these deficiencies, DOD cannot ensure its leadership has an accurate understanding of the department's cybersecurity posture. In addition, according to officials, DOD has not yet decided whether the defense industrial base\u2019s cyber incidents detected by cybersecurity service providers should be shared with all relevant stakeholders, such as the Department of Defense Chief Information Officer, Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security, and Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency. Until DOD examines whether this information should be shared with all relevant parties, opportunities could be lost to identify system threats and improve system weaknesses. \uf0d8   We recommended that the Department of Defense improve the sharing of defense industrial base-related cyber incident information and document when affected individuals are notified of a PII breach of their data. DOD concurred with our recommendations; however, it had not yet implemented these recommendations as of December 2022.\nChris Businsky Source (cover photo): GAO analysis; images: Gorodenkoff/stock. adobe.com.", "answer": [0, 1, 4, 2, 3], "summaries": ["Challenges in securing federal systems and information pose high risks to cybersecurity.", "We have reported on the management of information security risk in government-wide and individual federal agencies, including the U.S. Secret Service, Department of Defense, National Institutes of Health, and Federal Communications Commission.

In addition, according to officials, DOD has not yet decided whether the defense industrial base\u2019s cyber incidents detected by cybersecurity service providers should be shared with all relevant stakeholders, such as the Department of Defense Chief Information Officer, Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security, and Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency.

Gribben Commissioner Bureau of the Fiscal Service Department of the Treasury\nManagement Report: Continued Improvements Needed in the Bureau of the Fiscal Service\u2019s Information System Controls Related to the Schedule of Federal Debt\nDear Mr. Gribben:\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the U.S. government,1 we audited and reported on the fiscal year 2022 and 2021 Schedules of Federal Debt managed by the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Bureau of the Fiscal Service.2 As part of our audit, we assessed key controls over Fiscal Service financial information systems that are relevant to the Schedules of Federal Debt.3\nAs we reported in connection with our audits of the fiscal year 2022 and 2021 Schedules of Federal Debt, Fiscal Service maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting relevant to the Schedule of Federal Debt as of September 30, 2022, based on criteria established under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3512(c), (d), commonly known as the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act. Those controls provided reasonable assurance that Fiscal Service would prevent, or detect and correct, misstatements material to the Schedules of Federal Debt on a timely basis.\nBecause of Fiscal Service\u2019s progress in addressing information system internal control deficiencies we reported as of September 30, 2021,4 we determined that Fiscal Service sufficiently addressed control deficiencies in security management, access controls, and configuration management such that we no longer consider the remaining control deficiencies in information system controls, individually or collectively, to represent a significant deficiency as of September 30, 2022.5\nObjectives, Scope, and Methodology\nThe objectives of this report are to provide (1) any information system control deficiencies identified during our fiscal year 2022 audit of the Schedule of Federal Debt and (2) the status of Fiscal Service\u2019s corrective actions to address recommendations related to information system control deficiencies identified in our prior reports that were open as of September 30, 2021.\nWe performed this work in connection with our audits of the Schedules of Federal Debt for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2022, and 2021, and of Fiscal Service\u2019s internal control over financial reporting relevant to the Schedule of Federal Debt as of September 30, 2022.\nAs part of our audits, we evaluated key information system controls over financial systems Fiscal Service maintained and operated that are relevant to the Schedule of Federal Debt. We also determined the status of corrective actions Fiscal Service had taken to address recommendations related to information system control deficiencies identified in our prior reports that remained open as of September 30, 2021. A full discussion of our scope and methodology is included in our November 2022 report on the audit of the fiscal year 2022 Schedule of Federal Debt.6 During the course of our work, we communicated our findings to Fiscal Service management.\nWe performed our audit in accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our findings and recommendations in our separately issued LIMITED OFFICIAL USE ONLY report.\nThis report is a public version of a LIMITED OFFICIAL USE ONLY report that we issued concurrently.7 Fiscal Service deemed much of the information in our concurrently issued report to be sensitive information, which must be protected from public disclosure. Therefore, this report omits sensitive information about the information system control deficiencies we identified. Although the information provided in this report is more limited, the report addresses the same objectives as the LIMITED OFFICIAL USE ONLY report and uses the same methodology.\nDeficiencies Identified in Fiscal Service\u2019s Information System Controls Related to the Schedule of Federal Debt\nDuring our fiscal year 2022 audit of the Schedule of Federal Debt, we identified recurring conditions associated with the remaining information system control deficiencies. However, we did not identify any new reportable financial information system control deficiencies relevant to the Schedule of Federal Debt. Therefore, we are not making any new recommendations.\nStatus of Corrective Actions Taken on Recommendations from Prior Reports\nDuring our audit of the fiscal year 2022 Schedule of Federal Debt, we assessed Fiscal Service\u2019s corrective actions to address 23 recommendations related to control deficiencies identified in our prior reports that were open as of September 30, 2021. We determined that corrective actions were complete for eight recommendations and in process for the remaining 15 open recommendations. Specifically, additional actions are needed to resolve six recommendations related to security management, one recommendation related to access controls, and eight recommendations related to configuration management. In the LIMITED OFFICIAL USE ONLY report, we communicated detailed information regarding actions Fiscal Service took to address recommendations that were open as of September 30, 2021.\nFiscal Service continues to make progress in remediating internal control deficiencies underlying open recommendations. However, these remaining information system control deficiencies increase the risk of unauthorized access to, modification of, or disclosure of sensitive data and programs and disruption of critical operations. Fiscal Service mitigated the potential effect of these deficiencies on financial reporting for fiscal year 2022 with compensating management and reconciliation controls designed to detect potential misstatements on the Schedule of Federal Debt. It will be important for Fiscal Service management to continue focusing efforts on timely addressing the remaining recommendations, some of which have been open for several years, related to these information system control deficiencies.\nAgency Comments\nFiscal Service provided comments on the separately issued LIMITED OFFICIAL USE ONLY report. In those comments, Fiscal Service stated that it is committed to having effective internal controls for its information technology systems. Fiscal Service further stated that it understands the need for consistent management commitment to ensure that the open prior year findings are addressed. Additionally, Fiscal Service cited planned corrective actions to address the remaining open information systems control deficiencies and stated that it will continue to execute these actions to ensure the effectiveness of information security controls. We plan to follow up to determine the status of actions taken to address these deficiencies during our audit of the fiscal year 2023 Schedule of Federal Debt.\n- - - - -\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Inspector General of the Department of the Treasury, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.

Overview\nSince its inception in 1935, Social Security has become a major source of income for millions of Americans.1 In January 2023, over 57 million retirees and other individuals received Social Security benefits.2 For many retirees, Social Security makes up a substantial percentage of their overall retirement income.

Unless action is taken, the program is projected to be unable to pay full scheduled benefits in 10 years.4 The sooner actions are taken to address these financial challenges, the more gradually changes can be phased Source\u0000 GAO.   \u0000  GAO\u000023\u000010\u0000\u0000\u00007   in and workers would have more time to adjust to any changes and factor them into their retirement plans. This is the first in a series of three reports that are intended to briefly outline (1) why policymakers need to address OASI\u2019s financial challenges, (2) criteria for evaluating options for reforming OASI, and (3) major types of reform that have been proposed. This first report focuses on OASI\u2019s financial challenges and draws on our past work examining Social Security and the nation\u2019s fiscal health as well as on data and projections from the 2023 Social Security Trustees Report.5\nII.  Why is Social Security Important?\nSocial Security is considered the bedrock of the U.S. retirement system. The Social Security Act was enacted in 1935, in part, to help ensure that older Americans would have adequate income in retirement and not have to depend on welfare. Social Security provides cash benefits based on lifetime wages. These cash benefits replace a portion of an individual\u2019s earnings that are lost due to their retirement or death. For nearly 90 years, many American workers and their families have counted Social Security cash benefits help on these benefits to pay their bills and maintain their standard of living in retirement. keep people out of poverty. Many Social Security beneficiaries rely on its benefits for the majority of their income while retired. In 2023, Social Security benefits will replace just over 71 percent of pre- retirement earnings for newly entitled beneficiaries with relatively low career average earnings of about $15,900 per year\u2014these beneficiaries will receive about $11,300 in benefits for the year.6 Social Security benefits also represent a substantial percentage of some workers\u2019 total retirement income, ranging from 83 percent of income for the lowest income quintile (with a median income of about $14,400 per year) to 30 Source\u0000 GAO.   \u0000  GAO\u000023\u000010\u0000\u0000\u00007   percent for the fourth income quintile (with a median income of just over $81,500 per year) in 2017.7 Of those receiving benefits in January 2023, 74 percent were retired workers who received an average annual benefit of nearly $22,000.\nIII.  How Are Benefits Calculated?\nMonthly Social Security retirement benefits generally are calculated using the highest 35 years\u2019 worth of wage-indexed earnings on which the worker paid Social Security payroll taxes. Family members may also receive benefits, which are based on the primary worker\u2019s benefit amount. For example, spouses who survive a worker may be eligible for benefits. Benefits are calculated in three steps (see fig. 1):\n Figure 1: Summary of Steps to Calculate Social Security Retirement Benefits\ncareer ear\u0000i\u0000\u0000s for \u0000a\u0000e\nA\u0000\u0000ust eac\u0000 year of a \u0000or\u0000er\u0000s \u0000se a \u0000ro\u0000ressi\u0000e formula to \u0000ro\u0000t\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000e\u0000 ta\u0000e t\u0000e \u0000i\u0000\u0000est 3\u0000           calculate t\u0000e i\u0000itial mo\u0000t\u0000ly               \u0000a\u0000e a\u0000\u0000ustme\u0000ts to accou\u0000t years of a\u0000\u0000uste\u0000 ear\u0000i\u0000\u0000s                 \u0000e\u0000efit amou\u0000t\u0000 \u0000\u0000o\u0000\u0000 as                    for \u0000arious ot\u0000er factors\u0000 \u0000i\u0000clu\u0000i\u0000\u0000 \u0000eroes\u0000 a\u0000\u0000                     t\u0000e \u0000rimary \u0000\u0000sura\u0000ce                       suc\u0000 as t\u0000ose relati\u0000\u0000 to a\u0000era\u0000e t\u0000em\u0000                              Amou\u0000t \u0000\u0000\u0000A\u0000\u0000                               retireme\u0000t a\u0000e\u0000\nSTEP                                       STEP                                        STEP 1                                          2                                           3\nbenefits reflect the general rise in the  monthly benefit amount is the sum of to reflect wage growth. \u0000\u0000itial mo\u0000t\u0000ly \u0000e\u0000efit amou\u0000t 3\u0000000 2\u0000\u000000 32\u0000 1\u0000\u000000 1\u0000000 \u00000\u0000 0\nThis ensures that a worker\u0000s future       As the figure below shows, the initial      Retireme\u0000t a\u0000e\u0000 For retired workers, Social Security pays unreduced standard of living that occurred          three separate percentages of portions      benefits at full retirement age, which is during the worker\u0000s career.

Workers and employers pay a payroll tax, and the amount of that tax that is allocated to the OASI Trust Fund is 10.6 percent (5.3 percent of covered earnings from workers and the same amount from employers) of wages and self-employment income.8 The amount of a worker\u2019s earnings subject Most of Social Security's revenues to payroll taxes is capped. For 2023, this cap\u2014referred to as \u201cmaximum taxable earnings\u201d\u2014is $160,200. Social Security\u2019s other sources of revenue include income taxes attributable to Social Security benefits and interest income on the Trust Fund assets. SSA uses these sources of revenue to pay for the benefits of all Social Security beneficiaries.\nSource\u0000 GAO.   \u0000  GAO\u000023\u000010\u0000\u0000\u00007\nFigure 2: Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Revenue Sources as a Percentage of Total Revenue, Calendar Year 2022 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000ercent of revenue from taxation of benefits 6\u00000\u0000 \u0000ercent of revenue from interest\n \u0000ercent of revenue from payroll taxes \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n Source\u0000 GAO analysis of data from the 2023 Social Security Trustees\u0000 Report.  \u0000  GAO\u000023\u000010\u0000\u0000\u00007 Note: Some individuals may have to pay federal income taxes on their Social Security benefits. For example, individual income tax filers pay tax on up to 50 percent of their benefits if their income (defined as the sum of modified adjusted gross income, certain tax-exempt interest income, and half of their Social Security benefits) is between $25,000 and $34,000 (between $32,000 and $44,000 for a married couple filing jointly). OASI Trust Fund assets are invested in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. Thus, Social Security receives interest income from these investments.\nV.  What Is the Dilemma? reserves in 10 years.\nThe Trustees estimate the OASI Trust Fund will deplete its reserves in 10 years. OASI\u2019s costs, which are mostly benefit payments, have exceeded its tax revenues since 2010 (see fig. 3). Since 2021, costs have exceeded total income (including interest) and are expected to continue exceeding income throughout the Social Security's retirement trust Trustees\u2019 75-year projection period. SSA has drawn on accumulated surpluses in fund is projected to run out of   the OASI Trust Fund to make up the difference between cost and income.9 If this trend continues and no action is taken, the OASI Trust Fund will deplete its reserves and Social Security will be unable to pay full scheduled benefits. Specifically, using the Social Security Trustees\u2019 middle or \u201cintermediate\u201d set of assumptions, which represents the Trustees\u2019 best estimates of the future course of the population and economy, the OASI Trust Fund reserves are projected to become depleted in 2033. At that point, if no action is taken, program revenue would be sufficient to pay retirees just 77 percent of their scheduled benefits. However, because the Social Security Act does not provide a procedure for paying less than Source\u0000 GAO.   \u0000  GAO\u000023\u000010\u0000\u0000\u00007  full benefits it is difficult to know how this would unfold.\nFigure 3: Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Costs Are Projected to Continue Exceeding Revenues through Calendar Year 2100\n\u0000erce\u0000ta\u0000e of ta\u0000a\u0000le \u0000ayroll\nFor more information, contact Tranchau to the contact listed above, Michael Collins (Assistant Director), Sherwin Chapman (Analyst in Charge), Ted Burik, Charlotte Cable, Charles Ford, Mark Glickman, Laura Hoffrey, Barbara Steel, to this publication.

This first report focuses on OASI\u2019s financial challenges and draws on our past work examining Social Security and the nation\u2019s fiscal health as well as on data and projections from the 2023 Social Security Trustees Report.5\nII.  Why is Social Security Important?\nSocial Security is considered the bedrock of the U.S. retirement system. The Social Security Act was enacted in 1935, in part, to help ensure that older Americans would have adequate income in retirement and not have to depend on welfare. Social Security provides cash benefits based on lifetime wages. These cash benefits replace a portion of an individual\u2019s earnings that are lost due to their retirement or death. For nearly 90 years, many American workers and their families have counted Social Security cash benefits help on these benefits to pay their bills and maintain their standard of living in retirement. keep people out of poverty. Many Social Security beneficiaries rely on its benefits for the majority of their income while retired. In 2023, Social Security benefits will replace just over 71 percent of pre- retirement earnings for newly entitled beneficiaries with relatively low career average earnings of about $15,900 per year\u2014these beneficiaries will receive about $11,300 in benefits for the year.6 Social Security benefits also represent a substantial percentage of some workers\u2019 total retirement income, ranging from 83 percent of income for the lowest income quintile (with a median income of about $14,400 per year) to 30 Source\u0000 GAO.   \u0000  GAO\u000023\u000010\u0000\u0000\u00007   percent for the fourth income quintile (with a median income of just over $81,500 per year) in 2017.7 Of those receiving benefits in January 2023, 74 percent were retired workers who received an average annual benefit of nearly $22,000.\nIII.  How Are Benefits Calculated?\nMonthly Social Security retirement benefits generally are calculated using the highest 35 years\u2019 worth of wage-indexed earnings on which the worker paid Social Security payroll taxes. Family members may also receive benefits, which are based on the primary worker\u2019s benefit amount. For example, spouses who survive a worker may be eligible for benefits. Benefits are calculated in three steps (see fig. 1):\n Figure 1: Summary of Steps to Calculate Social Security Retirement Benefits\ncareer ear\u0000i\u0000\u0000s for \u0000a\u0000e\nA\u0000\u0000ust eac\u0000 year of a \u0000or\u0000er\u0000s \u0000se a \u0000ro\u0000ressi\u0000e formula to \u0000ro\u0000t\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000e\u0000 ta\u0000e t\u0000e \u0000i\u0000\u0000est 3\u0000           calculate t\u0000e i\u0000itial mo\u0000t\u0000ly               \u0000a\u0000e a\u0000\u0000ustme\u0000ts to accou\u0000t years of a\u0000\u0000uste\u0000 ear\u0000i\u0000\u0000s                 \u0000e\u0000efit amou\u0000t\u0000 \u0000\u0000o\u0000\u0000 as                    for \u0000arious ot\u0000er factors\u0000 \u0000i\u0000clu\u0000i\u0000\u0000 \u0000eroes\u0000 a\u0000\u0000                     t\u0000e \u0000rimary \u0000\u0000sura\u0000ce                       suc\u0000 as t\u0000ose relati\u0000\u0000 to a\u0000era\u0000e t\u0000em\u0000                              Amou\u0000t \u0000\u0000\u0000A\u0000\u0000                               retireme\u0000t a\u0000e\u0000\nSTEP                                       STEP                                        STEP 1                                          2                                           3\nbenefits reflect the general rise in the  monthly benefit amount is the sum of to reflect wage growth. \u0000\u0000itial mo\u0000t\u0000ly \u0000e\u0000efit amou\u0000t 3\u0000000 2\u0000\u000000 32\u0000 1\u0000\u000000 1\u0000000 \u00000\u0000 0\nThis ensures that a worker\u0000s future       As the figure below shows, the initial      Retireme\u0000t a\u0000e\u0000 For retired workers, Social Security pays unreduced standard of living that occurred          three separate percentages of portions      benefits at full retirement age, which is during the worker\u0000s career.

The amount of taxable earnings included in the benefit formula is capped. Specifically, a person claiming benefits at age 62 after 40 years of earning the maximum-taxable earnings would have a maximum AIME equal to $12,427 in 2023.\nIV.

Workers and employers pay a payroll tax, and the amount of that tax that is allocated to the OASI Trust Fund is 10.6 percent (5.3 percent of covered earnings from workers and the same amount from employers) of wages and self-employment income.8 The amount of a worker\u2019s earnings subject Most of Social Security's revenues to payroll taxes is capped. For 2023, this cap\u2014referred to as \u201cmaximum taxable earnings\u201d\u2014is $160,200. Social Security\u2019s other sources of revenue include income taxes attributable to Social Security benefits and interest income on the Trust Fund assets. SSA uses these sources of revenue to pay for the benefits of all Social Security beneficiaries.\nSource\u0000 GAO.   \u0000  GAO\u000023\u000010\u0000\u0000\u00007\nFigure 2: Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Revenue Sources as a Percentage of Total Revenue, Calendar Year 2022 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000ercent of revenue from taxation of benefits 6\u00000\u0000 \u0000ercent of revenue from interest\n \u0000ercent of revenue from payroll taxes \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n Source\u0000 GAO analysis of data from the 2023 Social Security Trustees\u0000 Report.  \u0000  GAO\u000023\u000010\u0000\u0000\u00007 Note: Some individuals may have to pay federal income taxes on their Social Security benefits. For example, individual income tax filers pay tax on up to 50 percent of their benefits if their income (defined as the sum of modified adjusted gross income, certain tax-exempt interest income, and half of their Social Security benefits) is between $25,000 and $34,000 (between $32,000 and $44,000 for a married couple filing jointly). OASI Trust Fund assets are invested in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. Thus, Social Security receives interest income from these investments.\nV.  What Is the Dilemma? reserves in 10 years.\nThe Trustees estimate the OASI Trust Fund will deplete its reserves in 10 years. OASI\u2019s costs, which are mostly benefit payments, have exceeded its tax revenues since 2010 (see fig. 3). Since 2021, costs have exceeded total income (including interest) and are expected to continue exceeding income throughout the Social Security's retirement trust Trustees\u2019 75-year projection period. SSA has drawn on accumulated surpluses in fund is projected to run out of   the OASI Trust Fund to make up the difference between cost and income.9 If this trend continues and no action is taken, the OASI Trust Fund will deplete its reserves and Social Security will be unable to pay full scheduled benefits. Specifically, using the Social Security Trustees\u2019 middle or \u201cintermediate\u201d set of assumptions, which represents the Trustees\u2019 best estimates of the future course of the population and economy, the OASI Trust Fund reserves are projected to become depleted in 2033. At that point, if no action is taken, program revenue would be sufficient to pay retirees just 77 percent of their scheduled benefits. However, because the Social Security Act does not provide a procedure for paying less than Source\u0000 GAO.   \u0000  GAO\u000023\u000010\u0000\u0000\u00007  full benefits it is difficult to know how this would unfold.\nFigure 3: Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Costs Are Projected to Continue Exceeding Revenues through Calendar Year 2100\n\u0000erce\u0000ta\u0000e of ta\u0000a\u0000le \u0000ayroll\nFor more information, contact Tranchau to the contact listed above, Michael Collins (Assistant Director), Sherwin Chapman (Analyst in Charge), Ted Burik, Charlotte Cable, Charles Ford, Mark Glickman, Laura Hoffrey, Barbara Steel, to this publication.

Workers and employers pay a payroll tax, and the amount of that tax that is allocated to the OASI Trust Fund is 10.6 percent (5.3 percent of covered earnings from workers and the same amount from employers) of wages and self-employment income.8 The amount of a worker\u2019s earnings subject Most of Social Security's revenues to payroll taxes is capped. For 2023, this cap\u2014referred to as \u201cmaximum taxable earnings\u201d\u2014is $160,200. Social Security\u2019s other sources of revenue include income taxes attributable to Social Security benefits and interest income on the Trust Fund assets. SSA uses these sources of revenue to pay for the benefits of all Social Security beneficiaries.\nSource\u0000 GAO.   \u0000  GAO\u000023\u000010\u0000\u0000\u00007\nFigure 2: Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Revenue Sources as a Percentage of Total Revenue, Calendar Year 2022 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000ercent of revenue from taxation of benefits 6\u00000\u0000 \u0000ercent of revenue from interest\n \u0000ercent of revenue from payroll taxes \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\n Source\u0000 GAO analysis of data from the 2023 Social Security Trustees\u0000 Report.  \u0000  GAO\u000023\u000010\u0000\u0000\u00007 Note: Some individuals may have to pay federal income taxes on their Social Security benefits. For example, individual income tax filers pay tax on up to 50 percent of their benefits if their income (defined as the sum of modified adjusted gross income, certain tax-exempt interest income, and half of their Social Security benefits) is between $25,000 and $34,000 (between $32,000 and $44,000 for a married couple filing jointly). OASI Trust Fund assets are invested in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. Thus, Social Security receives interest income from these investments.\nV.  What Is the Dilemma? reserves in 10 years.\nThe Trustees estimate the OASI Trust Fund will deplete its reserves in 10 years. OASI\u2019s costs, which are mostly benefit payments, have exceeded its tax revenues since 2010 (see fig. 3). Since 2021, costs have exceeded total income (including interest) and are expected to continue exceeding income throughout the Social Security's retirement trust Trustees\u2019 75-year projection period. SSA has drawn on accumulated surpluses in fund is projected to run out of   the OASI Trust Fund to make up the difference between cost and income.9 If this trend continues and no action is taken, the OASI Trust Fund will deplete its reserves and Social Security will be unable to pay full scheduled benefits. Specifically, using the Social Security Trustees\u2019 middle or \u201cintermediate\u201d set of assumptions, which represents the Trustees\u2019 best estimates of the future course of the population and economy, the OASI Trust Fund reserves are projected to become depleted in 2033. At that point, if no action is taken, program revenue would be sufficient to pay retirees just 77 percent of their scheduled benefits.

My testimony today summarizes the findings from our February 2023 report entitled Critical Infrastructure Protection: Time Frames to Complete DHS Efforts Would Help Sector Risk Management Agencies Implement Statutory Responsibilities.1 That report examined new responsibilities for SRMAs and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s role in coordinating SRMA activities.2 3\nEvents have demonstrated how disruption or destruction of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure could have debilitating effects. In particular, the 2021 cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline disrupted the nation\u2019s largest fuel pipeline, and an extreme weather event in Texas caused widespread power and water outages.4 Such events also illustrate how the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure assets and systems are often interconnected with critical infrastructure in other sectors and the internet, making them more vulnerable to attack. Protecting critical infrastructure is a national security priority because it provides essential functions\u2013\u2013such as supplying water, generating energy, and producing food\u2013\u2013that underpin American society.\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2018 assigned the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) the responsibility to coordinate a national effort to secure and protect against critical infrastructure risks.5 As such, the Secretary of Homeland Security designated the Director of CISA as the national coordinator for critical infrastructure security and resilience. CISA provides a variety of cyber and infrastructure security capabilities and services to federal and non- federal organizations, including assessments and analysis, capacity building, expertise and guidance, and security operations (e.g., incident response).\nAt the federal level, SRMAs are responsible for leading, facilitating, or supporting the security and resilience programs and associated activities within their designated critical infrastructure sector.6 The private sector owns and operates the majority of critical infrastructure. Therefore, it is vital that the public and private sectors work together to protect assets and systems.\nThe William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21 NDAA) includes a provision for GAO to report on the effectiveness of SRMAs in carrying out responsibilities set forth in the act. Our February 2023 report and my statement today addresses (1) how the FY21 NDAA changed sector risk management agency responsibilities, and the actions these agencies reported taking to address them; and (2) the extent to which CISA identified and undertook efforts to help sector risk management agencies implement their responsibilities set forth in the FY21 NDAA.\nTo address these objectives, we analyzed the FY21 NDAA and relevant policy directives, collected written responses from SRMAs for all 16 sectors using a standardized information collection tool, reviewed other \nDHS documents, and interviewed CISA officials.7 Additional information about our scope and methodology can be found in our February 2023 report. Our work was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.\nFY21 NDAA Expanded SRMA Responsibilities, and Agencies Have Actions Underway to Address Them\nThe FY21 NDAA expanded SRMA responsibilities previously outlined in Presidential Policy Directive-21 (PPD-21) and added risk assessment and emergency preparedness as responsibilities not previously included in the directive for SRMAs.8 Specifically, prior to the FY21 NDAA, PPD-21 included the following four SRMA responsibilities: (1) serve as a federal interface for the prioritization and coordination of sector-specific activities; (2) carry out incident management responsibilities; (3) provide, support, or facilitate technical assistance and consultations for sectors to support risk management activities; and (4) support the Secretary of Homeland Security by sharing information on sector-specific critical infrastructure. The FY21 NDAA expanded the sector coordination, incident management, risk management, and information sharing responsibilities found in PPD-21 by adding specific activities for SRMAs to carry out within these areas. For example, the FY21 NDAA requires SRMAs to conduct sector coordination activities, including serving as the day-to-day federal interface for the prioritization and coordination of sector-specific activities; serving as federal government coordinating council chair; and participating in cross-sector coordinating councils, as appropriate.\nExpanded responsibilities. In response to the expanded responsibilities required by the FY21 NDAA described above, some SRMAs reported having actions underway to address these responsibilities. SRMA officials for four of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors reported adapting activities related to sector coordination, incident management, risk management, or information sharing to address their responsibilities in the act. For example, as SRMA in the healthcare and public health sector, Department of Health and Human Services officials reported coordinating an effort to analyze the department\u2019s existing cyber authorities to identify and mitigate any gaps, as well as developing a cyber-incident response plan.\nAdditionally, some SRMA officials also reported that activities they established prior to the enactment of the FY21 NDAA already address the responsibilities outlined in the act. For example, SRMA officials from the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency, representing the energy sector and water and wastewater systems sector respectively, reported that they already address the responsibilities outlined in the FY21 NDAA.\nFinally, as an SRMA for eight of the 16 sectors, CISA described established activities that address sector coordination, incident management, risk management, and information sharing. Specifically, CISA officials reported that CISA\u2019s Stakeholder Engagement Division focuses on developing relationships with industry and government in CISA\u2019s sectors by meeting with Sector Coordinating Councils and issuing advisories and analysis reports to partners.\nAdded responsibilities. To address the added risk assessment and emergency preparedness responsibilities required by the FY21 NDAA, SRMA officials for five of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors described how they plan to take new actions to address the risk assessment responsibilities outlined in the FY21 NDAA. For example, as SRMA in the communications sectors, DHS officials reported plans to develop and maintain a communications risk register that includes cybersecurity risks to emergency communications infrastructure. SRMA officials for 15 of the\n16 critical infrastructure sectors also stated that they had conducted risk assessment activities prior to their inclusion in the FY21 NDAA.9\nWith regard to emergency preparedness responsibilities, SRMA officials for six of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors described how they plan to take new actions to address the emergency preparedness responsibilities outlined in the FY21 NDAA. For example, as SRMA in the financial services sector, Department of the Treasury officials reported enhancing a tabletop exercise program, developing a functional exercise platform to improve cybersecurity exercises, and refining incident management and crisis communication toolkits. SRMA officials for all 16 critical infrastructure sectors also stated that they had conducted emergency preparedness activities prior to their inclusion in the FY21 NDAA.\nImplementation challenges. SRMA officials cited two challenges in implementing their responsibilities: (1) the voluntary nature of private sector participation in SRMA activities and (2) limited or no dedicated resources for SRMA duties. According to SRMA officials, these challenges pre-dated the enactment of the FY21 NDAA. Additional challenges SRMA officials identified included coordination issues related to inaccurate SRMA point-of-contact lists and government coordinating council and sector coordinating council membership lists, and limited technical cybersecurity expertise. Our past work describing other DHS functions has highlighted the importance of maintaining accurate and up- to-date contact information for the sharing of information.10\nParticipation in SRMA critical infrastructure protection efforts is voluntary, which SRMA officials for 11 critical infrastructure sectors reported as a challenge to conducting their responsibilities. For example, they reported that this affected their ability to stay apprised of issues in the sector and to collect information. SRMA officials reported that these challenges existed prior to the FY21 NDAA and they generally expected them to continue.\nSRMA officials also stated that they face challenges because they have limited or no dedicated resources to implement their responsibilities. SRMA officials for 13 of the 16 sectors, including those with and without dedicated resources for SRMA activities, stated that they planned to request additional resources to help them implement their FY21 NDAA responsibilities.\nCISA Has Identified and Undertaken Efforts to Help SRMAs, but Does Not Have Milestones and Complete Them\nCISA has identified and undertaken some efforts that could help SRMAs implement their FY21 NDAA responsibilities. In November 2021, CISA reported on several ongoing and planned efforts to help SRMAs implement these responsibilities and to clarify federal roles and responsibilities for cybersecurity and infrastructure security actions across the federal government.11 In addition, CISA officials described various efforts to help SRMAs implement their FY21 NDAA responsibilities, including: Timelines to Define maturity and effectiveness metrics. CISA officials told us in October 2022 they expect to develop a methodology and metrics to measure the maturity and effectiveness of SRMAs in implementing responsibilities outlined in the FY21 NDAA. For example, in its November 2021 report, CISA recommended that the Federal Senior Leadership Council conduct a sector-by-sector assessment of SRMA partnership participation.12 CISA officials told us in March 2022 that these efforts could include both standardized metrics to measure effectiveness across all sectors, and sector-specific metrics.\nDevelop standardized budget guidance. In its November 2021 report, CISA officials identified a need to develop a baseline cost estimation tool for SRMAs.13 According to the report, this tool would provide SRMAs a baseline estimate of resource needs, and could be tailored to each\nSRMA. CISA also proposed implementing a consistent resource request process across the SRMAs, which could help address the challenges associated with their resource limitations, as previously discussed. According to CISA officials, this budget formulation tool would allow SRMAs to request sufficient resources to implement their FY21 NDAA responsibilities.\nCreate sector liaison positions. In August 2022, CISA officials told us they created liaison positions focused on fostering CISA\u2019s relationship with SRMAs. According to CISA officials, these liaisons will help CISA respond to the responsibilities outlined in the FY21 NDAA by enhancing communication and coordination with SRMAs, triaging information in response to incidents, and responding to requests for information.\nEnhance the Federal Senior Leadership Council. The Federal Senior Leadership Council provides a forum for coordination and communication among agencies with critical infrastructure responsibilities, including SRMAs. The council coordinates implementation of SRMA responsibilities as well as other initiatives related to protecting critical infrastructure. According to CISA officials, the Federal Senior Leadership Council is intended to be one of the primary ways CISA will coordinate actions to implement the FY21 NDAA across the federal government.\nDevelop a standardized feedback process. CISA officials told us in June 2022 that they are developing a process to conduct standardized surveys of critical infrastructure stakeholders and plan to use the results to conduct assessments. They said surveys allow them to measure the outcome of sector efforts by collecting information from partners on their intent to take action based on the information, tools, or capabilities provided to them, which they said is important due to the voluntary nature of sector partnerships.\nUpdate the 2013 National Plan and sector-specific plans. CISA officials told us in March 2022 that the updated National Infrastructure Protection Plan (National Plan) will clarify SRMA responsibilities in response to the FY21 NDAA. The National Plan is a key guidance document that provides the overarching national approach for critical infrastructure protection. CISA officials stated that the National Plan will be the \u201ccornerstone\u201d to guide SRMAs as they implement their responsibilities. According to CISA officials, the updated National Plan will: (1) include a revised approach to critical infrastructure protection, (2) provide information on SRMA responsibilities set forth in the FY21 NDAA, (3) clarify federal roles and responsibilities for sector risk management, and (4) outline how government and industry should coordinate to identify and mitigate threats to critical infrastructure. The 2013 update of the National Plan responded to new policy in PPD-21, including an explicit provision that DHS update the National Plan to implement the new directive. CISA officials told us they would not make further updates to the National Plan until the review of PPD-21 is completed.\nFurther, CISA officials stated in October 2022 they plan to provide additional guidance to SRMAs on how they should update their sector- specific plans. CISA officials told us that the updated sector-specific plans should describe how the sector will implement the updated National Plan, along with efforts tailored to the sector\u2019s unique characteristics. CISA officials told us they expected to issue an updated sector-specific plan template 3 to 6 months after the release of the updated National Plan for SRMAs to use in collaboration with their sector partners. Further, they told us that the sector-specific plans would likely take 1 year to develop.\nAlthough CISA has identified and started a number of efforts to help SRMAs implement their FY21 NDAA responsibilities, CISA does not have milestones and timelines to complete its efforts. According to selected characteristics from GAO\u2019s Key Questions to Assess Agency Reform Efforts, government reform efforts should have milestones and timelines to track implementation progress, which can also provide transparency about the progress of reforms.14\nCISA officials said they had not established milestones and timelines to complete CISA\u2019s efforts because the agency has prioritized defining its own role as national coordinator. For example, as of October 2022, CISA officials said they were in the process of developing ways to implement CISA\u2019s new authorities under the FY21 NDAA, which requires SRMAs to carry out their responsibilities in coordination with the CISA Director and consistent with DHS strategic guidance.\nWe recognize that CISA\u2019s efforts to address its FY21 NDAA responsibilities are linked to its efforts to mature in its role as national coordinator. However, SRMA officials for all 16 critical infrastructure sectors reported that CISA had not yet provided guidance to help the agencies implement their FY21 NDAA responsibilities. Establishing milestones and timelines, and updating them when necessary, to  accomplish its efforts to support SRMAs, would help ensure CISA completes them in a timely manner.\nWe recommended, and DHS concurred, that the Director of CISA establish milestones and timelines for its efforts to provide guidance and improve coordination and information sharing that would help SRMAs implement their FY21 NDAA responsibilities, and ensure the milestones and timelines are updated through completion.15 As of March 2023, the agency has not yet implemented the recommendation. CISA officials stated that the Administration\u2019s Homeland and Critical Infrastructure Resilience Interagency Policy Committee is in the process of updating PPD-21. Once it is completed, CISA will work to establish the milestones and timelines needed to develop guidance on improving coordination and information sharing.\nHowever, as of March 2023, CISA had not developed milestones and timelines to complete its efforts. CISA officials stated that they could not provide a specific timeline for issuing the updated National Plan until the Administration completes a review of PPD-21. CISA officials stated that the Federal Senior Leadership Council has started the Sector Analysis Working Group, which is an interagency consensus-based group that will recommend a new sector designation structure and corresponding SRMA designations. CISA officials reiterated that they plan to issue guidance on improving coordination and information sharing.\nChairman Garbarino, Ranking Member Swalwell, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.

Our work was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.\nFY21 NDAA Expanded SRMA Responsibilities, and Agencies Have Actions Underway to Address Them\nThe FY21 NDAA expanded SRMA responsibilities previously outlined in Presidential Policy Directive-21 (PPD-21) and added risk assessment and emergency preparedness as responsibilities not previously included in the directive for SRMAs.8 Specifically, prior to the FY21 NDAA, PPD-21 included the following four SRMA responsibilities: (1) serve as a federal interface for the prioritization and coordination of sector-specific activities; (2) carry out incident management responsibilities; (3) provide, support, or facilitate technical assistance and consultations for sectors to support risk management activities; and (4) support the Secretary of Homeland Security by sharing information on sector-specific critical infrastructure. The FY21 NDAA expanded the sector coordination, incident management, risk management, and information sharing responsibilities found in PPD-21 by adding specific activities for SRMAs to carry out within these areas. For example, the FY21 NDAA requires SRMAs to conduct sector coordination activities, including serving as the day-to-day federal interface for the prioritization and coordination of sector-specific activities; serving as federal government coordinating council chair; and participating in cross-sector coordinating councils, as appropriate.\nExpanded responsibilities. In response to the expanded responsibilities required by the FY21 NDAA described above, some SRMAs reported having actions underway to address these responsibilities. SRMA officials for four of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors reported adapting activities related to sector coordination, incident management, risk management, or information sharing to address their responsibilities in the act. For example, as SRMA in the healthcare and public health sector, Department of Health and Human Services officials reported coordinating an effort to analyze the department\u2019s existing cyber authorities to identify and mitigate any gaps, as well as developing a cyber-incident response plan.\nAdditionally, some SRMA officials also reported that activities they established prior to the enactment of the FY21 NDAA already address the responsibilities outlined in the act. For example, SRMA officials from the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency, representing the energy sector and water and wastewater systems sector respectively, reported that they already address the responsibilities outlined in the FY21 NDAA.\nFinally, as an SRMA for eight of the 16 sectors, CISA described established activities that address sector coordination, incident management, risk management, and information sharing. Specifically, CISA officials reported that CISA\u2019s Stakeholder Engagement Division focuses on developing relationships with industry and government in CISA\u2019s sectors by meeting with Sector Coordinating Councils and issuing advisories and analysis reports to partners.\nAdded responsibilities. To address the added risk assessment and emergency preparedness responsibilities required by the FY21 NDAA, SRMA officials for five of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors described how they plan to take new actions to address the risk assessment responsibilities outlined in the FY21 NDAA. For example, as SRMA in the communications sectors, DHS officials reported plans to develop and maintain a communications risk register that includes cybersecurity risks to emergency communications infrastructure. SRMA officials for 15 of the\n16 critical infrastructure sectors also stated that they had conducted risk assessment activities prior to their inclusion in the FY21 NDAA.9\nWith regard to emergency preparedness responsibilities, SRMA officials for six of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors described how they plan to take new actions to address the emergency preparedness responsibilities outlined in the FY21 NDAA. For example, as SRMA in the financial services sector, Department of the Treasury officials reported enhancing a tabletop exercise program, developing a functional exercise platform to improve cybersecurity exercises, and refining incident management and crisis communication toolkits. SRMA officials for all 16 critical infrastructure sectors also stated that they had conducted emergency preparedness activities prior to their inclusion in the FY21 NDAA.\nImplementation challenges. SRMA officials cited two challenges in implementing their responsibilities: (1) the voluntary nature of private sector participation in SRMA activities and (2) limited or no dedicated resources for SRMA duties. According to SRMA officials, these challenges pre-dated the enactment of the FY21 NDAA. Additional challenges SRMA officials identified included coordination issues related to inaccurate SRMA point-of-contact lists and government coordinating council and sector coordinating council membership lists, and limited technical cybersecurity expertise. Our past work describing other DHS functions has highlighted the importance of maintaining accurate and up- to-date contact information for the sharing of information.10\nParticipation in SRMA critical infrastructure protection efforts is voluntary, which SRMA officials for 11 critical infrastructure sectors reported as a challenge to conducting their responsibilities. For example, they reported that this affected their ability to stay apprised of issues in the sector and to collect information. SRMA officials reported that these challenges existed prior to the FY21 NDAA and they generally expected them to continue.\nSRMA officials also stated that they face challenges because they have limited or no dedicated resources to implement their responsibilities. SRMA officials for 13 of the 16 sectors, including those with and without dedicated resources for SRMA activities, stated that they planned to request additional resources to help them implement their FY21 NDAA responsibilities.\nCISA Has Identified and Undertaken Efforts to Help SRMAs, but Does Not Have Milestones and Complete Them\nCISA has identified and undertaken some efforts that could help SRMAs implement their FY21 NDAA responsibilities. In November 2021, CISA reported on several ongoing and planned efforts to help SRMAs implement these responsibilities and to clarify federal roles and responsibilities for cybersecurity and infrastructure security actions across the federal government.11 In addition, CISA officials described various efforts to help SRMAs implement their FY21 NDAA responsibilities, including: Timelines to Define maturity and effectiveness metrics. CISA officials told us in October 2022 they expect to develop a methodology and metrics to measure the maturity and effectiveness of SRMAs in implementing responsibilities outlined in the FY21 NDAA. For example, in its November 2021 report, CISA recommended that the Federal Senior Leadership Council conduct a sector-by-sector assessment of SRMA partnership participation.12 CISA officials told us in March 2022 that these efforts could include both standardized metrics to measure effectiveness across all sectors, and sector-specific metrics.\nDevelop standardized budget guidance. In its November 2021 report, CISA officials identified a need to develop a baseline cost estimation tool for SRMAs.13 According to the report, this tool would provide SRMAs a baseline estimate of resource needs, and could be tailored to each\nSRMA. CISA also proposed implementing a consistent resource request process across the SRMAs, which could help address the challenges associated with their resource limitations, as previously discussed. According to CISA officials, this budget formulation tool would allow SRMAs to request sufficient resources to implement their FY21 NDAA responsibilities.\nCreate sector liaison positions. In August 2022, CISA officials told us they created liaison positions focused on fostering CISA\u2019s relationship with SRMAs. According to CISA officials, these liaisons will help CISA respond to the responsibilities outlined in the FY21 NDAA by enhancing communication and coordination with SRMAs, triaging information in response to incidents, and responding to requests for information.\nEnhance the Federal Senior Leadership Council. The Federal Senior Leadership Council provides a forum for coordination and communication among agencies with critical infrastructure responsibilities, including SRMAs. The council coordinates implementation of SRMA responsibilities as well as other initiatives related to protecting critical infrastructure. According to CISA officials, the Federal Senior Leadership Council is intended to be one of the primary ways CISA will coordinate actions to implement the FY21 NDAA across the federal government.\nDevelop a standardized feedback process. CISA officials told us in June 2022 that they are developing a process to conduct standardized surveys of critical infrastructure stakeholders and plan to use the results to conduct assessments. They said surveys allow them to measure the outcome of sector efforts by collecting information from partners on their intent to take action based on the information, tools, or capabilities provided to them, which they said is important due to the voluntary nature of sector partnerships.\nUpdate the 2013 National Plan and sector-specific plans. CISA officials told us in March 2022 that the updated National Infrastructure Protection Plan (National Plan) will clarify SRMA responsibilities in response to the FY21 NDAA. The National Plan is a key guidance document that provides the overarching national approach for critical infrastructure protection. CISA officials stated that the National Plan will be the \u201ccornerstone\u201d to guide SRMAs as they implement their responsibilities. According to CISA officials, the updated National Plan will: (1) include a revised approach to critical infrastructure protection, (2) provide information on SRMA responsibilities set forth in the FY21 NDAA, (3) clarify federal roles and responsibilities for sector risk management, and (4) outline how government and industry should coordinate to identify and mitigate threats to critical infrastructure. The 2013 update of the National Plan responded to new policy in PPD-21, including an explicit provision that DHS update the National Plan to implement the new directive. CISA officials told us they would not make further updates to the National Plan until the review of PPD-21 is completed.\nFurther, CISA officials stated in October 2022 they plan to provide additional guidance to SRMAs on how they should update their sector- specific plans. CISA officials told us that the updated sector-specific plans should describe how the sector will implement the updated National Plan, along with efforts tailored to the sector\u2019s unique characteristics. CISA officials told us they expected to issue an updated sector-specific plan template 3 to 6 months after the release of the updated National Plan for SRMAs to use in collaboration with their sector partners. Further, they told us that the sector-specific plans would likely take 1 year to develop.\nAlthough CISA has identified and started a number of efforts to help SRMAs implement their FY21 NDAA responsibilities, CISA does not have milestones and timelines to complete its efforts. According to selected characteristics from GAO\u2019s Key Questions to Assess Agency Reform Efforts, government reform efforts should have milestones and timelines to track implementation progress, which can also provide transparency about the progress of reforms.14\nCISA officials said they had not established milestones and timelines to complete CISA\u2019s efforts because the agency has prioritized defining its own role as national coordinator. For example, as of October 2022, CISA officials said they were in the process of developing ways to implement CISA\u2019s new authorities under the FY21 NDAA, which requires SRMAs to carry out their responsibilities in coordination with the CISA Director and consistent with DHS strategic guidance.\nWe recognize that CISA\u2019s efforts to address its FY21 NDAA responsibilities are linked to its efforts to mature in its role as national coordinator. However, SRMA officials for all 16 critical infrastructure sectors reported that CISA had not yet provided guidance to help the agencies implement their FY21 NDAA responsibilities. Establishing milestones and timelines, and updating them when necessary, to  accomplish its efforts to support SRMAs, would help ensure CISA completes them in a timely manner.\nWe recommended, and DHS concurred, that the Director of CISA establish milestones and timelines for its efforts to provide guidance and improve coordination and information sharing that would help SRMAs implement their FY21 NDAA responsibilities, and ensure the milestones and timelines are updated through completion.15 As of March 2023, the agency has not yet implemented the recommendation. CISA officials stated that the Administration\u2019s Homeland and Critical Infrastructure Resilience Interagency Policy Committee is in the process of updating PPD-21. Once it is completed, CISA will work to establish the milestones and timelines needed to develop guidance on improving coordination and information sharing.\nHowever, as of March 2023, CISA had not developed milestones and timelines to complete its efforts. CISA officials stated that they could not provide a specific timeline for issuing the updated National Plan until the Administration completes a review of PPD-21. CISA officials stated that the Federal Senior Leadership Council has started the Sector Analysis Working Group, which is an interagency consensus-based group that will recommend a new sector designation structure and corresponding SRMA designations. CISA officials reiterated that they plan to issue guidance on improving coordination and information sharing.\nChairman Garbarino, Ranking Member Swalwell, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.

My testimony today summarizes the findings from our February 2023 report entitled Critical Infrastructure Protection: Time Frames to Complete DHS Efforts Would Help Sector Risk Management Agencies Implement Statutory Responsibilities.1 That report examined new responsibilities for SRMAs and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s role in coordinating SRMA activities.2 3\nEvents have demonstrated how disruption or destruction of the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure could have debilitating effects. In particular, the 2021 cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline disrupted the nation\u2019s largest fuel pipeline, and an extreme weather event in Texas caused widespread power and water outages.4 Such events also illustrate how the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure assets and systems are often interconnected with critical infrastructure in other sectors and the internet, making them more vulnerable to attack. Protecting critical infrastructure is a national security priority because it provides essential functions\u2013\u2013such as supplying water, generating energy, and producing food\u2013\u2013that underpin American society.\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2018 assigned the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) the responsibility to coordinate a national effort to secure and protect against critical infrastructure risks.5 As such, the Secretary of Homeland Security designated the Director of CISA as the national coordinator for critical infrastructure security and resilience. CISA provides a variety of cyber and infrastructure security capabilities and services to federal and non- federal organizations, including assessments and analysis, capacity building, expertise and guidance, and security operations (e.g., incident response).\nAt the federal level, SRMAs are responsible for leading, facilitating, or supporting the security and resilience programs and associated activities within their designated critical infrastructure sector.6 The private sector owns and operates the majority of critical infrastructure. Therefore, it is vital that the public and private sectors work together to protect assets and systems.\nThe William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21 NDAA) includes a provision for GAO to report on the effectiveness of SRMAs in carrying out responsibilities set forth in the act.

In particular, the 2021 cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline disrupted the nation\u2019s largest fuel pipeline, and an extreme weather event in Texas caused widespread power and water outages.4 Such events also illustrate how the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure assets and systems are often interconnected with critical infrastructure in other sectors and the internet, making them more vulnerable to attack. Protecting critical infrastructure is a national security priority because it provides essential functions\u2013\u2013such as supplying water, generating energy, and producing food\u2013\u2013that underpin American society.\nThe Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Act of 2018 assigned the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) the responsibility to coordinate a national effort to secure and protect against critical infrastructure risks.5 As such, the Secretary of Homeland Security designated the Director of CISA as the national coordinator for critical infrastructure security and resilience. CISA provides a variety of cyber and infrastructure security capabilities and services to federal and non- federal organizations, including assessments and analysis, capacity building, expertise and guidance, and security operations (e.g., incident response).\nAt the federal level, SRMAs are responsible for leading, facilitating, or supporting the security and resilience programs and associated activities within their designated critical infrastructure sector.6 The private sector owns and operates the majority of critical infrastructure. Therefore, it is vital that the public and private sectors work together to protect assets and systems.\nThe William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21 NDAA) includes a provision for GAO to report on the effectiveness of SRMAs in carrying out responsibilities set forth in the act. Our February 2023 report and my statement today addresses (1) how the FY21 NDAA changed sector risk management agency responsibilities, and the actions these agencies reported taking to address them; and (2) the extent to which CISA identified and undertook efforts to help sector risk management agencies implement their responsibilities set forth in the FY21 NDAA.\nTo address these objectives, we analyzed the FY21 NDAA and relevant policy directives, collected written responses from SRMAs for all 16 sectors using a standardized information collection tool, reviewed other \nDHS documents, and interviewed CISA officials.7 Additional information about our scope and methodology can be found in our February 2023 report. Our work was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.\nFY21 NDAA Expanded SRMA Responsibilities, and Agencies Have Actions Underway to Address Them\nThe FY21 NDAA expanded SRMA responsibilities previously outlined in Presidential Policy Directive-21 (PPD-21) and added risk assessment and emergency preparedness as responsibilities not previously included in the directive for SRMAs.8 Specifically, prior to the FY21 NDAA, PPD-21 included the following four SRMA responsibilities: (1) serve as a federal interface for the prioritization and coordination of sector-specific activities; (2) carry out incident management responsibilities; (3) provide, support, or facilitate technical assistance and consultations for sectors to support risk management activities; and (4) support the Secretary of Homeland Security by sharing information on sector-specific critical infrastructure. The FY21 NDAA expanded the sector coordination, incident management, risk management, and information sharing responsibilities found in PPD-21 by adding specific activities for SRMAs to carry out within these areas. For example, the FY21 NDAA requires SRMAs to conduct sector coordination activities, including serving as the day-to-day federal interface for the prioritization and coordination of sector-specific activities; serving as federal government coordinating council chair; and participating in cross-sector coordinating councils, as appropriate.\nExpanded responsibilities. In response to the expanded responsibilities required by the FY21 NDAA described above, some SRMAs reported having actions underway to address these responsibilities. SRMA officials for four of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors reported adapting activities related to sector coordination, incident management, risk management, or information sharing to address their responsibilities in the act. For example, as SRMA in the healthcare and public health sector, Department of Health and Human Services officials reported coordinating an effort to analyze the department\u2019s existing cyber authorities to identify and mitigate any gaps, as well as developing a cyber-incident response plan.\nAdditionally, some SRMA officials also reported that activities they established prior to the enactment of the FY21 NDAA already address the responsibilities outlined in the act. For example, SRMA officials from the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency, representing the energy sector and water and wastewater systems sector respectively, reported that they already address the responsibilities outlined in the FY21 NDAA.\nFinally, as an SRMA for eight of the 16 sectors, CISA described established activities that address sector coordination, incident management, risk management, and information sharing. Specifically, CISA officials reported that CISA\u2019s Stakeholder Engagement Division focuses on developing relationships with industry and government in CISA\u2019s sectors by meeting with Sector Coordinating Councils and issuing advisories and analysis reports to partners.\nAdded responsibilities. To address the added risk assessment and emergency preparedness responsibilities required by the FY21 NDAA, SRMA officials for five of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors described how they plan to take new actions to address the risk assessment responsibilities outlined in the FY21 NDAA. For example, as SRMA in the communications sectors, DHS officials reported plans to develop and maintain a communications risk register that includes cybersecurity risks to emergency communications infrastructure. SRMA officials for 15 of the\n16 critical infrastructure sectors also stated that they had conducted risk assessment activities prior to their inclusion in the FY21 NDAA.9\nWith regard to emergency preparedness responsibilities, SRMA officials for six of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors described how they plan to take new actions to address the emergency preparedness responsibilities outlined in the FY21 NDAA. For example, as SRMA in the financial services sector, Department of the Treasury officials reported enhancing a tabletop exercise program, developing a functional exercise platform to improve cybersecurity exercises, and refining incident management and crisis communication toolkits. SRMA officials for all 16 critical infrastructure sectors also stated that they had conducted emergency preparedness activities prior to their inclusion in the FY21 NDAA.\nImplementation challenges. SRMA officials cited two challenges in implementing their responsibilities: (1) the voluntary nature of private sector participation in SRMA activities and (2) limited or no dedicated resources for SRMA duties. According to SRMA officials, these challenges pre-dated the enactment of the FY21 NDAA. Additional challenges SRMA officials identified included coordination issues related to inaccurate SRMA point-of-contact lists and government coordinating council and sector coordinating council membership lists, and limited technical cybersecurity expertise. Our past work describing other DHS functions has highlighted the importance of maintaining accurate and up- to-date contact information for the sharing of information.10\nParticipation in SRMA critical infrastructure protection efforts is voluntary, which SRMA officials for 11 critical infrastructure sectors reported as a challenge to conducting their responsibilities. For example, they reported that this affected their ability to stay apprised of issues in the sector and to collect information. SRMA officials reported that these challenges existed prior to the FY21 NDAA and they generally expected them to continue.\nSRMA officials also stated that they face challenges because they have limited or no dedicated resources to implement their responsibilities. SRMA officials for 13 of the 16 sectors, including those with and without dedicated resources for SRMA activities, stated that they planned to request additional resources to help them implement their FY21 NDAA responsibilities.\nCISA Has Identified and Undertaken Efforts to Help SRMAs, but Does Not Have Milestones and Complete Them\nCISA has identified and undertaken some efforts that could help SRMAs implement their FY21 NDAA responsibilities. In November 2021, CISA reported on several ongoing and planned efforts to help SRMAs implement these responsibilities and to clarify federal roles and responsibilities for cybersecurity and infrastructure security actions across the federal government.11 In addition, CISA officials described various efforts to help SRMAs implement their FY21 NDAA responsibilities, including: Timelines to Define maturity and effectiveness metrics. CISA officials told us in October 2022 they expect to develop a methodology and metrics to measure the maturity and effectiveness of SRMAs in implementing responsibilities outlined in the FY21 NDAA. For example, in its November 2021 report, CISA recommended that the Federal Senior Leadership Council conduct a sector-by-sector assessment of SRMA partnership participation.12 CISA officials told us in March 2022 that these efforts could include both standardized metrics to measure effectiveness across all sectors, and sector-specific metrics.\nDevelop standardized budget guidance. In its November 2021 report, CISA officials identified a need to develop a baseline cost estimation tool for SRMAs.13 According to the report, this tool would provide SRMAs a baseline estimate of resource needs, and could be tailored to each\nSRMA. CISA also proposed implementing a consistent resource request process across the SRMAs, which could help address the challenges associated with their resource limitations, as previously discussed. According to CISA officials, this budget formulation tool would allow SRMAs to request sufficient resources to implement their FY21 NDAA responsibilities.\nCreate sector liaison positions. In August 2022, CISA officials told us they created liaison positions focused on fostering CISA\u2019s relationship with SRMAs. According to CISA officials, these liaisons will help CISA respond to the responsibilities outlined in the FY21 NDAA by enhancing communication and coordination with SRMAs, triaging information in response to incidents, and responding to requests for information.\nEnhance the Federal Senior Leadership Council. The Federal Senior Leadership Council provides a forum for coordination and communication among agencies with critical infrastructure responsibilities, including SRMAs. The council coordinates implementation of SRMA responsibilities as well as other initiatives related to protecting critical infrastructure. According to CISA officials, the Federal Senior Leadership Council is intended to be one of the primary ways CISA will coordinate actions to implement the FY21 NDAA across the federal government.\nDevelop a standardized feedback process. CISA officials told us in June 2022 that they are developing a process to conduct standardized surveys of critical infrastructure stakeholders and plan to use the results to conduct assessments. They said surveys allow them to measure the outcome of sector efforts by collecting information from partners on their intent to take action based on the information, tools, or capabilities provided to them, which they said is important due to the voluntary nature of sector partnerships.\nUpdate the 2013 National Plan and sector-specific plans. CISA officials told us in March 2022 that the updated National Infrastructure Protection Plan (National Plan) will clarify SRMA responsibilities in response to the FY21 NDAA. The National Plan is a key guidance document that provides the overarching national approach for critical infrastructure protection. CISA officials stated that the National Plan will be the \u201ccornerstone\u201d to guide SRMAs as they implement their responsibilities. According to CISA officials, the updated National Plan will: (1) include a revised approach to critical infrastructure protection, (2) provide information on SRMA responsibilities set forth in the FY21 NDAA, (3) clarify federal roles and responsibilities for sector risk management, and (4) outline how government and industry should coordinate to identify and mitigate threats to critical infrastructure. The 2013 update of the National Plan responded to new policy in PPD-21, including an explicit provision that DHS update the National Plan to implement the new directive. CISA officials told us they would not make further updates to the National Plan until the review of PPD-21 is completed.\nFurther, CISA officials stated in October 2022 they plan to provide additional guidance to SRMAs on how they should update their sector- specific plans. CISA officials told us that the updated sector-specific plans should describe how the sector will implement the updated National Plan, along with efforts tailored to the sector\u2019s unique characteristics. CISA officials told us they expected to issue an updated sector-specific plan template 3 to 6 months after the release of the updated National Plan for SRMAs to use in collaboration with their sector partners. Further, they told us that the sector-specific plans would likely take 1 year to develop.\nAlthough CISA has identified and started a number of efforts to help SRMAs implement their FY21 NDAA responsibilities, CISA does not have milestones and timelines to complete its efforts. According to selected characteristics from GAO\u2019s Key Questions to Assess Agency Reform Efforts, government reform efforts should have milestones and timelines to track implementation progress, which can also provide transparency about the progress of reforms.14\nCISA officials said they had not established milestones and timelines to complete CISA\u2019s efforts because the agency has prioritized defining its own role as national coordinator. For example, as of October 2022, CISA officials said they were in the process of developing ways to implement CISA\u2019s new authorities under the FY21 NDAA, which requires SRMAs to carry out their responsibilities in coordination with the CISA Director and consistent with DHS strategic guidance.\nWe recognize that CISA\u2019s efforts to address its FY21 NDAA responsibilities are linked to its efforts to mature in its role as national coordinator. However, SRMA officials for all 16 critical infrastructure sectors reported that CISA had not yet provided guidance to help the agencies implement their FY21 NDAA responsibilities. Establishing milestones and timelines, and updating them when necessary, to  accomplish its efforts to support SRMAs, would help ensure CISA completes them in a timely manner.\nWe recommended, and DHS concurred, that the Director of CISA establish milestones and timelines for its efforts to provide guidance and improve coordination and information sharing that would help SRMAs implement their FY21 NDAA responsibilities, and ensure the milestones and timelines are updated through completion.15 As of March 2023, the agency has not yet implemented the recommendation. CISA officials stated that the Administration\u2019s Homeland and Critical Infrastructure Resilience Interagency Policy Committee is in the process of updating PPD-21. Once it is completed, CISA will work to establish the milestones and timelines needed to develop guidance on improving coordination and information sharing.\nHowever, as of March 2023, CISA had not developed milestones and timelines to complete its efforts. CISA officials stated that they could not provide a specific timeline for issuing the updated National Plan until the Administration completes a review of PPD-21. CISA officials stated that the Federal Senior Leadership Council has started the Sector Analysis Working Group, which is an interagency consensus-based group that will recommend a new sector designation structure and corresponding SRMA designations. CISA officials reiterated that they plan to issue guidance on improving coordination and information sharing.\nChairman Garbarino, Ranking Member Swalwell, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.

{"content": "United States Government Accountability Office\n Testimony\nBefore  the Subcommittee on Disability\nAssistance  and Memorial Affairs,\n Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs, House of  Representatives\nFor Release on Delivery Expected at 10 a.m. ET Thursday, July 27, 2023 VA DISABILITY EXAMS Opportunities Remain to Improve Program Planning and Oversight\nStatement of Elizabeth Curda, Director, Education, Workforce, and Income Security\nGAO-23-106939\nLetter\nLetter\n Chairman Luttrell, Ranking Member Pappas, and Members of the Subcommittee:\nI am pleased to be here today to discuss the findings from our recent work on Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability medical examinations. As you know, VA often relies on disability medical exams to determine whether veterans are eligible for disability compensation. Two groups of disability medical examiners conduct these exams: examiners employed by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and examiners working for vendors contracted by the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA). Together, these examiners perform more than 1 million disability exams per year.\nIn April 2020, VA suspended in-person exams for several months due to safety concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic.1 This suspension contributed to a growth in backlogged exam requests, from approximately 158,000 in March 2020 to about 357,000 by December 2020.2 In January 2021, the Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020 was enacted. This Act includes several provisions related to disability medical exams.3 For example, the Act granted certain types of VBA-contracted examiners temporary authority to conduct exams in states other than those in which they hold a license (known as license portability).4 The Act also required VA to suspend efforts to eliminate VA examiner positions until the number of backlogged exam requests is no greater than it was on March 1, 2020.5 \nMy remarks today are based primarily on our June 2023 report and related updates from VA.6 This testimony summarizes our findings related to (1) VA\u2019s management of exam workloads between VBA contracted examiners and VHA examiners, and (2) VA\u2019s use of available flexibilities to help meet exam demand.\nFor our June 2023 report, we reviewed VHA guidance to its medical facilities related to examiner staffing and exam workloads, and VHA\u2019s communication to facilities regarding its expected future role in conducting exams. We also reviewed information VBA provided to its contracted exam vendors on the use of license portability for conducting disability exams, as well as vendor-reported data on exams conducted under license portability and via telehealth. Additionally, we interviewed officials from VHA, VBA, five selected medical facilities, and three contracted exam vendors. In that report, we also assessed the status of a related prior GAO recommendation on exam workload allocation. More information on our scope and methodology is available in our June 2023 report.\nWe conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nBackground\nVA\u2019s process for allocating disability exams between VHA facilities and VBA\u2019s contracted exam vendors is dependent on VHA facilities\u2019 current capacity to conduct exams (see fig. 1). When assigning a disability exam, VBA claims processors will first seek to route an exam request to a VHA facility. If the facility does not have capacity, a claims processor will send the request to a contracted exam vendor, who will assign it to a contracted examiner.\nFigure 1: VA Disability Exam Allocation Process as of February 2023\n VA increasingly has transferred its disability exam workload from VHA- employed examiners to VBA\u2019s contracted examiners. In fiscal year 2017, VHA examiners completed over 700,000 exams, compared to roughly 600,000 completed by VBA\u2019s contracted examiners. In fiscal year 2020, VHA completed fewer than 335,000 exams, while VBA\u2019s contracted examiners completed nearly 1.1 million.7 We reported in 2021 that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, VA planned to transfer additional exam workload from VHA facilities to VBA\u2019s contracted examiners.\nUnder license portability, a VBA-contracted examiner licensed in one state may legally conduct an exam in another state in which they are not licensed. Specifically, the Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020 granted temporary license portability for VBA-contracted nurse practitioners, physician assistants, audiologists, and psychologists conducting disability exams.8 This temporary license portability is scheduled to expire on\nJanuary 5, 2024. VBA contracted examiners who are physicians have had permanent license portability since 2016.9\nAdditional Actions Needed to Plan for Disability Exam Workloads and Clarify VHA Facilities\u2019 Examiner Staffing Requirements\nPlanning for exam workloads. We reported in June 2023 that VBA had not fully implemented our recommendations from March 2021 to apply sound planning practices to its increased use of contracted disability examiners.10 In 2021, we found that VBA had not developed a documented strategy and goals for allocating exams between contracted examiners and VHA medical facilities, timelines for any further transfer of exam workload to contracted examiners, and an assessment of potential risks associated with increased reliance on contracted examiners.11 We recommended that VBA, in consultation with VHA, use sound planning practices to develop and document such plans. VBA developed a plan that incorporates some of the sound planning practices we identified, but other information is missing. For example, the plan does not include information on potential volumes or timeframes for future transfers of disability exam workloads from VHA medical centers to contracted examiners, or detailed assessments of potential risks associated with VA\u2019s increased reliance on contracted examiners. To fully address the recommendation, VBA needs to develop more detailed plans incorporating the sound planning practices we identified. In July 2023, VBA officials said the agency is updating its exam workload plan to incorporate these sound planning practices. Officials estimated this process would be completed by September 2023.\nClarifying VHA facilities\u2019 examiner needs. During the course of our review for the June 2023 report, we also found that VHA did not clearly communicate with medical facilities in a timely manner regarding its expected future role in conducting disability exams. In June 2022, VA  reported to Congress that over the 5 years beginning in fiscal year 2023, VHA facilities would develop internal plans to return their disability exam workload to the levels they maintained prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.12 VHA notified its Veterans Integrated Services Networks in July 2022 that the enactment of the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 likely would double the VHA exam workload to approximately 500,000 exams by fiscal year 2025.13 However, VHA did not provide information to its medical facilities on how they were expected to help meet the demand.\nDuring our interviews with selected facilities in August 2022, officials differed in their interpretations of VHA\u2019s future role in completing exams. Officials at three facilities said they were unsure whether VHA would maintain their exam workloads in the future, or whether more or all of the exams would shift to VBA contractors. It was not until February 2023, after we made officials aware that some facilities remained uncertain about their future role in conducting exams, that VHA communicated to facilities that they will continue to conduct exams and should develop plans to meet workload demands.\nFurther, VHA did not provide clear guidance to its medical facilities that would address the requirement to temporarily halt efforts to eliminate examiner positions. As noted above, in January 2021, legislation was enacted that required VA to temporarily suspend efforts to eliminate disability examiner positions.14 In response to this provision, between January 2021 and April 2022, VHA issued several guidance memos to its facilities instructing them to increase exam capacity, halt any programmatic changes to their disability exam services, and pause any elimination of disability examiner positions. VHA\u2019s guidance also stated that facilities should prioritize critical and essential healthcare services.\nVHA\u2019s guidance, however, did not define a \u201cprogrammatic change to exam services\u201d or \u201cdisability examiner position.\u201d Consequently, officials\u2019 interpretations of VHA\u2019s guidance memos varied at the selected facilities. For example, officials at one facility said that to avoid making a programmatic change to their exam services, they were not supposed to eliminate examiner positions from their organizational chart, but could leave these positions vacant as examiners retired or left. Officials at another facility said the guidance left them leeway to continue moving away from conducting disability exams and prioritize clinical care. VHA officials said the statutory requirement precludes facilities from making significant reductions in disability exam staff or eliminating their disability exam programs. However, the guidance VHA issued to facilities was not this specific.\nWithout clearer guidance, VHA cannot be confident that facilities\u2019 recruitment and retention plans align with its intent and facilities may not be well positioned to address veterans\u2019 exam needs. As a result, we recommended that VHA clarify the guidance it provided to medical facilities. VHA officials said the agency plans to complete this clarification by November 2023.\nVA Used Available Meet Exam Demand, but Inaccuracies in VBA\u2019s Guidelines and Inadequate Monitoring Led to Ineligible Examiners\nVA used available flexibilities to help meet demand for disability exams by leveraging the use of telehealth and license portability. Flexibilities to Help Telehealth Exams. VBA\u2019s vendors and VHA increased their use of telehealth to meet exam demand during the pandemic. Vendors rarely used telehealth before the COVID-19 pandemic, according to VBA and vendor officials. In April 2020, when in-person contracted exams were temporarily suspended, vendors began increasing their use of telehealth, according to VBA officials.15 VHA officials also reported increasing the agency\u2019s use of telehealth for disability exams during the pandemic. Telehealth was most commonly used for mental health exams, according to our data analysis and interviews.\nUsing License Portability\nVA officials and officials from VBA\u2019s vendors said using telehealth to conduct exams, when appropriate, provided a range of benefits. For example, officials told us that telehealth allowed for safer exams during the pandemic, helped provide exams to veterans who otherwise would be difficult to reach, and allowed some veterans to avoid traveling long distances for in-person exams. VA officials also reported some challenges with providing telehealth exams, especially with the use of telehealth technology, but told us they were generally able to manage them.\nLicense Portability. Additionally, officials from VBA\u2019s contracted exam vendors said they leveraged the temporary expansion of license portability to increase their capacity to provide exams across state lines through telehealth and in-person exams. Vendors used mobile clinics through which examiners traveled between states to conduct exams and also temporarily stationed individual examiners in states other than where they were licensed. VBA and vendor officials reported that the temporary expansion of license portability helped expand their exam reach to rural and high-need areas and increase veterans\u2019 access to specialists and experienced examiners.\nWe found that the guidelines on license portability issued by VBA contained some inaccuracies and information that could cause confusion for the contracted exam vendors. In particular, VBA\u2019s performance work statement for its three vendors, which provides instructions for conducting contracted disability exams, inaccurately listed dentists as eligible for license portability and included the term \u201cetc.\u201d following the list of examiner types eligible for license portability.16 However, the law granting temporary license portability for VBA contracted examiners specifies the eligible types of health care professionals and does not include dentists (see fig. 2).\nFigure 2: Comparison between Law Authorizing Temporary License Portability and VBA Guidelines\n VBA officials told us that dentists and non-listed providers are not eligible under this law. However, we found that two of VBA\u2019s three vendors used dentists to conduct exams under license portability, which the vendors confirmed. Our review of vendor-reported data submitted to VBA also showed that one vendor was using optometrists to conduct exams in states other than where they were licensed, which VBA officials confirmed should not occur.\nVBA officials said that in November 2022, they requested that VA\u2019s contracting office update the performance work statement to remove dentists from the list of eligible examiners.17 In January 2023, VBA issued a guidance memo to its vendors informing them that dentists are not eligible for license portability. Additionally, in March 2023, VBA officials said they requested that \u201cetc.\u201d be removed from the performance work statement, and in April 2023 VBA issued a guidance memo informing vendors that the \u201cetc.\u201d does not extend eligibility to other types of examiners.18\nWe also found that VBA did not adequately monitor vendors\u2019 use of license portability. VBA was unaware that some vendors were using dentists and optometrists to conduct exams in states other than where they were licensed.19 In December 2022, VBA began monitoring vendor- reported data on the types of examiners using license portability, according to VBA officials. However, VBA had not yet developed formal procedures or documentation for its monitoring process. We recommended that VBA develop and document such formal procedures. In June 2023, VBA finalized formal, written procedures to guide this new monitoring process.\nIn addition, although VBA confirmed that ineligible examiners conducted disability exams under license portability, VBA has not fully assessed the extent to which this occurred and any potential effect on veterans\u2019 claims. VBA officials said they believe there is little-to-no risk to veterans\u2019 claims. However, VBA has not conducted a formal assessment to support this position. We recommended that VBA work with its vendors to identify which exams were completed by ineligible examiners, assess any potential risks to veterans\u2019 claims, and develop and implement a corrective action plan to address any identified issues. In July 2023, VBA officials said they started a formal risk assessment and expected to complete it by August 2023.\nIn conclusion, as VA continues to address a backlog of disability medical exams and expected influx of new requests, it is important that the agency consider its ability to meet this demand through both VBA\u2019s contracted examiners and VHA examiners. Fully incorporating sound planning practices into VBA\u2019s plan for the allocation of future exam workloads would better position VA to ensure that veterans receive quality exams in a timely manner. Additionally, VHA facilities continue to play an important role in providing exams, but unclear guidance on halting the elimination of disability examiner positions and what constitutes changes to exam services could result in suboptimal capacity to perform exams.\nAdditionally, VA\u2019s expanded use of telehealth and license portability provide opportunities to meet veterans\u2019 exam needs. While VBA has taken steps to improve its guidance and oversight on the use of license portability for contracted disability exams, it has not yet completed a formal assessment of exams that were erroneously completed under license portability and any potential risks to veteran claim decisions. Completing such an assessment will help VBA to identify and take any  necessary corrective actions to ensure veterans\u2019 claims have been properly decided.\nChairman Luttrell, Ranking Member Pappas, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.

{"content": "United States Government Accountability Office\n Testimony\nBefore  the Subcommittee on Disability\nAssistance  and Memorial Affairs,\n Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs, House of  Representatives\nFor Release on Delivery Expected at 10 a.m. ET Thursday, July 27, 2023 VA DISABILITY EXAMS Opportunities Remain to Improve Program Planning and Oversight\nStatement of Elizabeth Curda, Director, Education, Workforce, and Income Security\nGAO-23-106939\nLetter\nLetter\n Chairman Luttrell, Ranking Member Pappas, and Members of the Subcommittee:\nI am pleased to be here today to discuss the findings from our recent work on Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability medical examinations. As you know, VA often relies on disability medical exams to determine whether veterans are eligible for disability compensation. Two groups of disability medical examiners conduct these exams: examiners employed by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and examiners working for vendors contracted by the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA). Together, these examiners perform more than 1 million disability exams per year.\nIn April 2020, VA suspended in-person exams for several months due to safety concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic.1 This suspension contributed to a growth in backlogged exam requests, from approximately 158,000 in March 2020 to about 357,000 by December 2020.2 In January 2021, the Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020 was enacted. This Act includes several provisions related to disability medical exams.3 For example, the Act granted certain types of VBA-contracted examiners temporary authority to conduct exams in states other than those in which they hold a license (known as license portability).4 The Act also required VA to suspend efforts to eliminate VA examiner positions until the number of backlogged exam requests is no greater than it was on March 1, 2020.5 \nMy remarks today are based primarily on our June 2023 report and related updates from VA.6 This testimony summarizes our findings related to (1) VA\u2019s management of exam workloads between VBA contracted examiners and VHA examiners, and (2) VA\u2019s use of available flexibilities to help meet exam demand.\nFor our June 2023 report, we reviewed VHA guidance to its medical facilities related to examiner staffing and exam workloads, and VHA\u2019s communication to facilities regarding its expected future role in conducting exams. We also reviewed information VBA provided to its contracted exam vendors on the use of license portability for conducting disability exams, as well as vendor-reported data on exams conducted under license portability and via telehealth. Additionally, we interviewed officials from VHA, VBA, five selected medical facilities, and three contracted exam vendors. In that report, we also assessed the status of a related prior GAO recommendation on exam workload allocation. More information on our scope and methodology is available in our June 2023 report.\nWe conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nBackground\nVA\u2019s process for allocating disability exams between VHA facilities and VBA\u2019s contracted exam vendors is dependent on VHA facilities\u2019 current capacity to conduct exams (see fig. 1). When assigning a disability exam, VBA claims processors will first seek to route an exam request to a VHA facility. If the facility does not have capacity, a claims processor will send the request to a contracted exam vendor, who will assign it to a contracted examiner.\nFigure 1: VA Disability Exam Allocation Process as of February 2023\n VA increasingly has transferred its disability exam workload from VHA- employed examiners to VBA\u2019s contracted examiners. In fiscal year 2017, VHA examiners completed over 700,000 exams, compared to roughly 600,000 completed by VBA\u2019s contracted examiners. In fiscal year 2020, VHA completed fewer than 335,000 exams, while VBA\u2019s contracted examiners completed nearly 1.1 million.7 We reported in 2021 that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, VA planned to transfer additional exam workload from VHA facilities to VBA\u2019s contracted examiners.\nUnder license portability, a VBA-contracted examiner licensed in one state may legally conduct an exam in another state in which they are not licensed. Specifically, the Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020 granted temporary license portability for VBA-contracted nurse practitioners, physician assistants, audiologists, and psychologists conducting disability exams.8 This temporary license portability is scheduled to expire on\nJanuary 5, 2024. VBA contracted examiners who are physicians have had permanent license portability since 2016.9\nAdditional Actions Needed to Plan for Disability Exam Workloads and Clarify VHA Facilities\u2019 Examiner Staffing Requirements\nPlanning for exam workloads. We reported in June 2023 that VBA had not fully implemented our recommendations from March 2021 to apply sound planning practices to its increased use of contracted disability examiners.10 In 2021, we found that VBA had not developed a documented strategy and goals for allocating exams between contracted examiners and VHA medical facilities, timelines for any further transfer of exam workload to contracted examiners, and an assessment of potential risks associated with increased reliance on contracted examiners.11 We recommended that VBA, in consultation with VHA, use sound planning practices to develop and document such plans. VBA developed a plan that incorporates some of the sound planning practices we identified, but other information is missing. For example, the plan does not include information on potential volumes or timeframes for future transfers of disability exam workloads from VHA medical centers to contracted examiners, or detailed assessments of potential risks associated with VA\u2019s increased reliance on contracted examiners. To fully address the recommendation, VBA needs to develop more detailed plans incorporating the sound planning practices we identified. In July 2023, VBA officials said the agency is updating its exam workload plan to incorporate these sound planning practices. Officials estimated this process would be completed by September 2023.\nClarifying VHA facilities\u2019 examiner needs. During the course of our review for the June 2023 report, we also found that VHA did not clearly communicate with medical facilities in a timely manner regarding its expected future role in conducting disability exams. In June 2022, VA  reported to Congress that over the 5 years beginning in fiscal year 2023, VHA facilities would develop internal plans to return their disability exam workload to the levels they maintained prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.12 VHA notified its Veterans Integrated Services Networks in July 2022 that the enactment of the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 likely would double the VHA exam workload to approximately 500,000 exams by fiscal year 2025.13 However, VHA did not provide information to its medical facilities on how they were expected to help meet the demand.\nDuring our interviews with selected facilities in August 2022, officials differed in their interpretations of VHA\u2019s future role in completing exams. Officials at three facilities said they were unsure whether VHA would maintain their exam workloads in the future, or whether more or all of the exams would shift to VBA contractors. It was not until February 2023, after we made officials aware that some facilities remained uncertain about their future role in conducting exams, that VHA communicated to facilities that they will continue to conduct exams and should develop plans to meet workload demands.\nFurther, VHA did not provide clear guidance to its medical facilities that would address the requirement to temporarily halt efforts to eliminate examiner positions. As noted above, in January 2021, legislation was enacted that required VA to temporarily suspend efforts to eliminate disability examiner positions.14 In response to this provision, between January 2021 and April 2022, VHA issued several guidance memos to its facilities instructing them to increase exam capacity, halt any programmatic changes to their disability exam services, and pause any elimination of disability examiner positions. VHA\u2019s guidance also stated that facilities should prioritize critical and essential healthcare services.\nVHA\u2019s guidance, however, did not define a \u201cprogrammatic change to exam services\u201d or \u201cdisability examiner position.\u201d Consequently, officials\u2019 interpretations of VHA\u2019s guidance memos varied at the selected facilities. For example, officials at one facility said that to avoid making a programmatic change to their exam services, they were not supposed to eliminate examiner positions from their organizational chart, but could leave these positions vacant as examiners retired or left. Officials at another facility said the guidance left them leeway to continue moving away from conducting disability exams and prioritize clinical care. VHA officials said the statutory requirement precludes facilities from making significant reductions in disability exam staff or eliminating their disability exam programs. However, the guidance VHA issued to facilities was not this specific.\nWithout clearer guidance, VHA cannot be confident that facilities\u2019 recruitment and retention plans align with its intent and facilities may not be well positioned to address veterans\u2019 exam needs. As a result, we recommended that VHA clarify the guidance it provided to medical facilities. VHA officials said the agency plans to complete this clarification by November 2023.\nVA Used Available Meet Exam Demand, but Inaccuracies in VBA\u2019s Guidelines and Inadequate Monitoring Led to Ineligible Examiners\nVA used available flexibilities to help meet demand for disability exams by leveraging the use of telehealth and license portability. Flexibilities to Help Telehealth Exams. VBA\u2019s vendors and VHA increased their use of telehealth to meet exam demand during the pandemic. Vendors rarely used telehealth before the COVID-19 pandemic, according to VBA and vendor officials. In April 2020, when in-person contracted exams were temporarily suspended, vendors began increasing their use of telehealth, according to VBA officials.15 VHA officials also reported increasing the agency\u2019s use of telehealth for disability exams during the pandemic. Telehealth was most commonly used for mental health exams, according to our data analysis and interviews.\nUsing License Portability\nVA officials and officials from VBA\u2019s vendors said using telehealth to conduct exams, when appropriate, provided a range of benefits. For example, officials told us that telehealth allowed for safer exams during the pandemic, helped provide exams to veterans who otherwise would be difficult to reach, and allowed some veterans to avoid traveling long distances for in-person exams. VA officials also reported some challenges with providing telehealth exams, especially with the use of telehealth technology, but told us they were generally able to manage them.\nLicense Portability. Additionally, officials from VBA\u2019s contracted exam vendors said they leveraged the temporary expansion of license portability to increase their capacity to provide exams across state lines through telehealth and in-person exams. Vendors used mobile clinics through which examiners traveled between states to conduct exams and also temporarily stationed individual examiners in states other than where they were licensed. VBA and vendor officials reported that the temporary expansion of license portability helped expand their exam reach to rural and high-need areas and increase veterans\u2019 access to specialists and experienced examiners.\nWe found that the guidelines on license portability issued by VBA contained some inaccuracies and information that could cause confusion for the contracted exam vendors. In particular, VBA\u2019s performance work statement for its three vendors, which provides instructions for conducting contracted disability exams, inaccurately listed dentists as eligible for license portability and included the term \u201cetc.\u201d following the list of examiner types eligible for license portability.16 However, the law granting temporary license portability for VBA contracted examiners specifies the eligible types of health care professionals and does not include dentists (see fig. 2).\nFigure 2: Comparison between Law Authorizing Temporary License Portability and VBA Guidelines\n VBA officials told us that dentists and non-listed providers are not eligible under this law. However, we found that two of VBA\u2019s three vendors used dentists to conduct exams under license portability, which the vendors confirmed. Our review of vendor-reported data submitted to VBA also showed that one vendor was using optometrists to conduct exams in states other than where they were licensed, which VBA officials confirmed should not occur.\nVBA officials said that in November 2022, they requested that VA\u2019s contracting office update the performance work statement to remove dentists from the list of eligible examiners.17 In January 2023, VBA issued a guidance memo to its vendors informing them that dentists are not eligible for license portability. Additionally, in March 2023, VBA officials said they requested that \u201cetc.\u201d be removed from the performance work statement, and in April 2023 VBA issued a guidance memo informing vendors that the \u201cetc.\u201d does not extend eligibility to other types of examiners.18\nWe also found that VBA did not adequately monitor vendors\u2019 use of license portability. VBA was unaware that some vendors were using dentists and optometrists to conduct exams in states other than where they were licensed.19 In December 2022, VBA began monitoring vendor- reported data on the types of examiners using license portability, according to VBA officials. However, VBA had not yet developed formal procedures or documentation for its monitoring process. We recommended that VBA develop and document such formal procedures. In June 2023, VBA finalized formal, written procedures to guide this new monitoring process.\nIn addition, although VBA confirmed that ineligible examiners conducted disability exams under license portability, VBA has not fully assessed the extent to which this occurred and any potential effect on veterans\u2019 claims. VBA officials said they believe there is little-to-no risk to veterans\u2019 claims. However, VBA has not conducted a formal assessment to support this position. We recommended that VBA work with its vendors to identify which exams were completed by ineligible examiners, assess any potential risks to veterans\u2019 claims, and develop and implement a corrective action plan to address any identified issues. In July 2023, VBA officials said they started a formal risk assessment and expected to complete it by August 2023.\nIn conclusion, as VA continues to address a backlog of disability medical exams and expected influx of new requests, it is important that the agency consider its ability to meet this demand through both VBA\u2019s contracted examiners and VHA examiners. Fully incorporating sound planning practices into VBA\u2019s plan for the allocation of future exam workloads would better position VA to ensure that veterans receive quality exams in a timely manner. Additionally, VHA facilities continue to play an important role in providing exams, but unclear guidance on halting the elimination of disability examiner positions and what constitutes changes to exam services could result in suboptimal capacity to perform exams.\nAdditionally, VA\u2019s expanded use of telehealth and license portability provide opportunities to meet veterans\u2019 exam needs. While VBA has taken steps to improve its guidance and oversight on the use of license portability for contracted disability exams, it has not yet completed a formal assessment of exams that were erroneously completed under license portability and any potential risks to veteran claim decisions. Completing such an assessment will help VBA to identify and take any  necessary corrective actions to ensure veterans\u2019 claims have been properly decided.\nChairman Luttrell, Ranking Member Pappas, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.

In June 2023, VBA finalized formal, written procedures to guide this new monitoring process.\nIn addition, although VBA confirmed that ineligible examiners conducted disability exams under license portability, VBA has not fully assessed the extent to which this occurred and any potential effect on veterans\u2019 claims. VBA officials said they believe there is little-to-no risk to veterans\u2019 claims. However, VBA has not conducted a formal assessment to support this position. We recommended that VBA work with its vendors to identify which exams were completed by ineligible examiners, assess any potential risks to veterans\u2019 claims, and develop and implement a corrective action plan to address any identified issues. In July 2023, VBA officials said they started a formal risk assessment and expected to complete it by August 2023.\nIn conclusion, as VA continues to address a backlog of disability medical exams and expected influx of new requests, it is important that the agency consider its ability to meet this demand through both VBA\u2019s contracted examiners and VHA examiners. Fully incorporating sound planning practices into VBA\u2019s plan for the allocation of future exam workloads would better position VA to ensure that veterans receive quality exams in a timely manner. Additionally, VHA facilities continue to play an important role in providing exams, but unclear guidance on halting the elimination of disability examiner positions and what constitutes changes to exam services could result in suboptimal capacity to perform exams.\nAdditionally, VA\u2019s expanded use of telehealth and license portability provide opportunities to meet veterans\u2019 exam needs. While VBA has taken steps to improve its guidance and oversight on the use of license portability for contracted disability exams, it has not yet completed a formal assessment of exams that were erroneously completed under license portability and any potential risks to veteran claim decisions. Completing such an assessment will help VBA to identify and take any  necessary corrective actions to ensure veterans\u2019 claims have been properly decided.\nChairman Luttrell, Ranking Member Pappas, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.

As you know, VA often relies on disability medical exams to determine whether veterans are eligible for disability compensation. Two groups of disability medical examiners conduct these exams: examiners employed by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and examiners working for vendors contracted by the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA). Together, these examiners perform more than 1 million disability exams per year.\nIn April 2020, VA suspended in-person exams for several months due to safety concerns related to the COVID-19 pandemic.1 This suspension contributed to a growth in backlogged exam requests, from approximately 158,000 in March 2020 to about 357,000 by December 2020.2 In January 2021, the Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020 was enacted. This Act includes several provisions related to disability medical exams.3 For example, the Act granted certain types of VBA-contracted examiners temporary authority to conduct exams in states other than those in which they hold a license (known as license portability).4 The Act also required VA to suspend efforts to eliminate VA examiner positions until the number of backlogged exam requests is no greater than it was on March 1, 2020.5 \nMy remarks today are based primarily on our June 2023 report and related updates from VA.6 This testimony summarizes our findings related to (1) VA\u2019s management of exam workloads between VBA contracted examiners and VHA examiners, and (2) VA\u2019s use of available flexibilities to help meet exam demand.\nFor our June 2023 report, we reviewed VHA guidance to its medical facilities related to examiner staffing and exam workloads, and VHA\u2019s communication to facilities regarding its expected future role in conducting exams. We also reviewed information VBA provided to its contracted exam vendors on the use of license portability for conducting disability exams, as well as vendor-reported data on exams conducted under license portability and via telehealth. Additionally, we interviewed officials from VHA, VBA, five selected medical facilities, and three contracted exam vendors. In that report, we also assessed the status of a related prior GAO recommendation on exam workload allocation. More information on our scope and methodology is available in our June 2023 report.\nWe conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nBackground\nVA\u2019s process for allocating disability exams between VHA facilities and VBA\u2019s contracted exam vendors is dependent on VHA facilities\u2019 current capacity to conduct exams (see fig. 1). When assigning a disability exam, VBA claims processors will first seek to route an exam request to a VHA facility. If the facility does not have capacity, a claims processor will send the request to a contracted exam vendor, who will assign it to a contracted examiner.\nFigure 1: VA Disability Exam Allocation Process as of February 2023\n VA increasingly has transferred its disability exam workload from VHA- employed examiners to VBA\u2019s contracted examiners. In fiscal year 2017, VHA examiners completed over 700,000 exams, compared to roughly 600,000 completed by VBA\u2019s contracted examiners. In fiscal year 2020, VHA completed fewer than 335,000 exams, while VBA\u2019s contracted examiners completed nearly 1.1 million.7 We reported in 2021 that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, VA planned to transfer additional exam workload from VHA facilities to VBA\u2019s contracted examiners.\nUnder license portability, a VBA-contracted examiner licensed in one state may legally conduct an exam in another state in which they are not licensed. Specifically, the Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020 granted temporary license portability for VBA-contracted nurse practitioners, physician assistants, audiologists, and psychologists conducting disability exams.8 This temporary license portability is scheduled to expire on\nJanuary 5, 2024. VBA contracted examiners who are physicians have had permanent license portability since 2016.9\nAdditional Actions Needed to Plan for Disability Exam Workloads and Clarify VHA Facilities\u2019 Examiner Staffing Requirements\nPlanning for exam workloads. We reported in June 2023 that VBA had not fully implemented our recommendations from March 2021 to apply sound planning practices to its increased use of contracted disability examiners.10 In 2021, we found that VBA had not developed a documented strategy and goals for allocating exams between contracted examiners and VHA medical facilities, timelines for any further transfer of exam workload to contracted examiners, and an assessment of potential risks associated with increased reliance on contracted examiners.11 We recommended that VBA, in consultation with VHA, use sound planning practices to develop and document such plans. VBA developed a plan that incorporates some of the sound planning practices we identified, but other information is missing. For example, the plan does not include information on potential volumes or timeframes for future transfers of disability exam workloads from VHA medical centers to contracted examiners, or detailed assessments of potential risks associated with VA\u2019s increased reliance on contracted examiners. To fully address the recommendation, VBA needs to develop more detailed plans incorporating the sound planning practices we identified. In July 2023, VBA officials said the agency is updating its exam workload plan to incorporate these sound planning practices. Officials estimated this process would be completed by September 2023.\nClarifying VHA facilities\u2019 examiner needs. During the course of our review for the June 2023 report, we also found that VHA did not clearly communicate with medical facilities in a timely manner regarding its expected future role in conducting disability exams. In June 2022, VA  reported to Congress that over the 5 years beginning in fiscal year 2023, VHA facilities would develop internal plans to return their disability exam workload to the levels they maintained prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.12 VHA notified its Veterans Integrated Services Networks in July 2022 that the enactment of the Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 likely would double the VHA exam workload to approximately 500,000 exams by fiscal year 2025.13 However, VHA did not provide information to its medical facilities on how they were expected to help meet the demand.\nDuring our interviews with selected facilities in August 2022, officials differed in their interpretations of VHA\u2019s future role in completing exams. Officials at three facilities said they were unsure whether VHA would maintain their exam workloads in the future, or whether more or all of the exams would shift to VBA contractors. It was not until February 2023, after we made officials aware that some facilities remained uncertain about their future role in conducting exams, that VHA communicated to facilities that they will continue to conduct exams and should develop plans to meet workload demands.\nFurther, VHA did not provide clear guidance to its medical facilities that would address the requirement to temporarily halt efforts to eliminate examiner positions. As noted above, in January 2021, legislation was enacted that required VA to temporarily suspend efforts to eliminate disability examiner positions.14 In response to this provision, between January 2021 and April 2022, VHA issued several guidance memos to its facilities instructing them to increase exam capacity, halt any programmatic changes to their disability exam services, and pause any elimination of disability examiner positions. VHA\u2019s guidance also stated that facilities should prioritize critical and essential healthcare services.\nVHA\u2019s guidance, however, did not define a \u201cprogrammatic change to exam services\u201d or \u201cdisability examiner position.\u201d Consequently, officials\u2019 interpretations of VHA\u2019s guidance memos varied at the selected facilities. For example, officials at one facility said that to avoid making a programmatic change to their exam services, they were not supposed to eliminate examiner positions from their organizational chart, but could leave these positions vacant as examiners retired or left. Officials at another facility said the guidance left them leeway to continue moving away from conducting disability exams and prioritize clinical care. VHA officials said the statutory requirement precludes facilities from making significant reductions in disability exam staff or eliminating their disability exam programs. However, the guidance VHA issued to facilities was not this specific.\nWithout clearer guidance, VHA cannot be confident that facilities\u2019 recruitment and retention plans align with its intent and facilities may not be well positioned to address veterans\u2019 exam needs. As a result, we recommended that VHA clarify the guidance it provided to medical facilities. VHA officials said the agency plans to complete this clarification by November 2023.\nVA Used Available Meet Exam Demand, but Inaccuracies in VBA\u2019s Guidelines and Inadequate Monitoring Led to Ineligible Examiners\nVA used available flexibilities to help meet demand for disability exams by leveraging the use of telehealth and license portability. Flexibilities to Help Telehealth Exams. VBA\u2019s vendors and VHA increased their use of telehealth to meet exam demand during the pandemic. Vendors rarely used telehealth before the COVID-19 pandemic, according to VBA and vendor officials. In April 2020, when in-person contracted exams were temporarily suspended, vendors began increasing their use of telehealth, according to VBA officials.15 VHA officials also reported increasing the agency\u2019s use of telehealth for disability exams during the pandemic. Telehealth was most commonly used for mental health exams, according to our data analysis and interviews.\nUsing License Portability\nVA officials and officials from VBA\u2019s vendors said using telehealth to conduct exams, when appropriate, provided a range of benefits. For example, officials told us that telehealth allowed for safer exams during the pandemic, helped provide exams to veterans who otherwise would be difficult to reach, and allowed some veterans to avoid traveling long distances for in-person exams. VA officials also reported some challenges with providing telehealth exams, especially with the use of telehealth technology, but told us they were generally able to manage them.\nLicense Portability. Additionally, officials from VBA\u2019s contracted exam vendors said they leveraged the temporary expansion of license portability to increase their capacity to provide exams across state lines through telehealth and in-person exams. Vendors used mobile clinics through which examiners traveled between states to conduct exams and also temporarily stationed individual examiners in states other than where they were licensed. VBA and vendor officials reported that the temporary expansion of license portability helped expand their exam reach to rural and high-need areas and increase veterans\u2019 access to specialists and experienced examiners.\nWe found that the guidelines on license portability issued by VBA contained some inaccuracies and information that could cause confusion for the contracted exam vendors. In particular, VBA\u2019s performance work statement for its three vendors, which provides instructions for conducting contracted disability exams, inaccurately listed dentists as eligible for license portability and included the term \u201cetc.\u201d following the list of examiner types eligible for license portability.16 However, the law granting temporary license portability for VBA contracted examiners specifies the eligible types of health care professionals and does not include dentists (see fig. 2).\nFigure 2: Comparison between Law Authorizing Temporary License Portability and VBA Guidelines\n VBA officials told us that dentists and non-listed providers are not eligible under this law. However, we found that two of VBA\u2019s three vendors used dentists to conduct exams under license portability, which the vendors confirmed. Our review of vendor-reported data submitted to VBA also showed that one vendor was using optometrists to conduct exams in states other than where they were licensed, which VBA officials confirmed should not occur.\nVBA officials said that in November 2022, they requested that VA\u2019s contracting office update the performance work statement to remove dentists from the list of eligible examiners.17 In January 2023, VBA issued a guidance memo to its vendors informing them that dentists are not eligible for license portability. Additionally, in March 2023, VBA officials said they requested that \u201cetc.\u201d be removed from the performance work statement, and in April 2023 VBA issued a guidance memo informing vendors that the \u201cetc.\u201d does not extend eligibility to other types of examiners.18\nWe also found that VBA did not adequately monitor vendors\u2019 use of license portability. VBA was unaware that some vendors were using dentists and optometrists to conduct exams in states other than where they were licensed.19 In December 2022, VBA began monitoring vendor- reported data on the types of examiners using license portability, according to VBA officials. However, VBA had not yet developed formal procedures or documentation for its monitoring process. We recommended that VBA develop and document such formal procedures. In June 2023, VBA finalized formal, written procedures to guide this new monitoring process.\nIn addition, although VBA confirmed that ineligible examiners conducted disability exams under license portability, VBA has not fully assessed the extent to which this occurred and any potential effect on veterans\u2019 claims. VBA officials said they believe there is little-to-no risk to veterans\u2019 claims. However, VBA has not conducted a formal assessment to support this position. We recommended that VBA work with its vendors to identify which exams were completed by ineligible examiners, assess any potential risks to veterans\u2019 claims, and develop and implement a corrective action plan to address any identified issues. In July 2023, VBA officials said they started a formal risk assessment and expected to complete it by August 2023.\nIn conclusion, as VA continues to address a backlog of disability medical exams and expected influx of new requests, it is important that the agency consider its ability to meet this demand through both VBA\u2019s contracted examiners and VHA examiners. Fully incorporating sound planning practices into VBA\u2019s plan for the allocation of future exam workloads would better position VA to ensure that veterans receive quality exams in a timely manner. Additionally, VHA facilities continue to play an important role in providing exams, but unclear guidance on halting the elimination of disability examiner positions and what constitutes changes to exam services could result in suboptimal capacity to perform exams.\nAdditionally, VA\u2019s expanded use of telehealth and license portability provide opportunities to meet veterans\u2019 exam needs.

Completing such an assessment will help VBA to identify and take any  necessary corrective actions to ensure veterans\u2019 claims have been properly decided.\nChairman Luttrell, Ranking Member Pappas, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.

FAR section 9.504 requires contracting officers to analyze planned acquisitions to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate significant potential OCIs. OCIs, as described in the FAR and bid protest decisions of our Office, can be broadly categorized into three groups:\n\u2022   Biased ground rules OCI: Arises where a firm, as part of its performance of a contract, has, in some sense, set the ground rules for the competition for another government contract.3\n\u2022   Unequal access to information OCI: Exists where a firm has access to nonpublic information as part of its performance of a government contract and where that information may provide the firm with a competitive advantage in a later competition.4\n\u2022   Impaired objectivity OCI: Arises where a firm\u2019s work under one government contract could entail its evaluating itself, either through an assessment of performance under another contract or an evaluation of proposals.5 In addition, FAR section 9.507-1 provides that significant potential OCIs are normally resolved by imposing some restraint, appropriate to the nature of the conflict, on a contractor\u2019s eligibility for future contracts or subcontracts. This section further provides that affected solicitations are to include a provision that:\n\u2022   Invites offerors\u2019 attention to FAR subpart 9.5; \u2022   States the nature of the potential conflict as seen by the contracting officer; \u2022   States the nature of the proposed restraint upon future contractor activities; and\n\u2022   Depending on the nature of the acquisition, states whether the terms of any proposed clause and the application of FAR subpart 9.5 are subject to negotiation. VAAR section 809.507-1(b) supplements the FAR by requiring an OCI solicitation provision\u2014which is specific to the VAAR\u2014in any solicitation for the services listed in FAR section 9.502.6 The services listed in FAR section 9.502 include:\n\u2022   Management support services; \u2022   Consultant or other professional services; \u2022   Contractor performance of or assistance in technical evaluations; or \u2022   Systems engineering and technical direction work performed by a contractor that does not have overall contractual responsibility for development or production.\nPersonal Conflicts of Interest\nFAR subpart 3.11 implements policy on personal conflicts of interest by employees of government contractors.7 FAR section 3.1101 defines a personal conflict of interest as a situation in which a covered employee has a financial interest, personal activity, or relationship that could impair the employee\u2019s ability to act impartially and in the best interest of the government when performing under the contract.8 Under FAR section 3.1102, it is the government\u2019s policy to require contractors to (1) identify and prevent personal conflicts of interest of their covered employees; and (2) prohibit covered employees who have access to nonpublic information by reason of performance on a government contract from using such information for personal gain.9\nVAAR section 803.1103 supplements the FAR by requiring that by use of the clause at FAR section 52.203-16, the contracting officer must require each contractor whose employees perform acquisition functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions to obtain from each covered employee a signed nondisclosure agreement to prohibit disclosure of nonpublic information accessed through performance of the contract.\nChairwoman Kiggans, Chairman Rosendale, Ranking Member Mrvan, Ranking Member Cherfilus-McCormick, and Members of the Subcommittees, this concludes my statement for the record.\nGAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments\nIf you or your staff have any questions about this statement, please contact Shelby S.

FAR section 9.504 requires contracting officers to analyze planned acquisitions to avoid, neutralize, or mitigate significant potential OCIs. OCIs, as described in the FAR and bid protest decisions of our Office, can be broadly categorized into three groups:\n\u2022   Biased ground rules OCI: Arises where a firm, as part of its performance of a contract, has, in some sense, set the ground rules for the competition for another government contract.3\n\u2022   Unequal access to information OCI: Exists where a firm has access to nonpublic information as part of its performance of a government contract and where that information may provide the firm with a competitive advantage in a later competition.4\n\u2022   Impaired objectivity OCI: Arises where a firm\u2019s work under one government contract could entail its evaluating itself, either through an assessment of performance under another contract or an evaluation of proposals.5 In addition, FAR section 9.507-1 provides that significant potential OCIs are normally resolved by imposing some restraint, appropriate to the nature of the conflict, on a contractor\u2019s eligibility for future contracts or subcontracts. This section further provides that affected solicitations are to include a provision that:\n\u2022   Invites offerors\u2019 attention to FAR subpart 9.5; \u2022   States the nature of the potential conflict as seen by the contracting officer; \u2022   States the nature of the proposed restraint upon future contractor activities; and\n\u2022   Depending on the nature of the acquisition, states whether the terms of any proposed clause and the application of FAR subpart 9.5 are subject to negotiation. VAAR section 809.507-1(b) supplements the FAR by requiring an OCI solicitation provision\u2014which is specific to the VAAR\u2014in any solicitation for the services listed in FAR section 9.502.6 The services listed in FAR section 9.502 include:\n\u2022   Management support services; \u2022   Consultant or other professional services; \u2022   Contractor performance of or assistance in technical evaluations; or \u2022   Systems engineering and technical direction work performed by a contractor that does not have overall contractual responsibility for development or production.\nPersonal Conflicts of Interest\nFAR subpart 3.11 implements policy on personal conflicts of interest by employees of government contractors.7 FAR section 3.1101 defines a personal conflict of interest as a situation in which a covered employee has a financial interest, personal activity, or relationship that could impair the employee\u2019s ability to act impartially and in the best interest of the government when performing under the contract.8 Under FAR section 3.1102, it is the government\u2019s policy to require contractors to (1) identify and prevent personal conflicts of interest of their covered employees; and (2) prohibit covered employees who have access to nonpublic information by reason of performance on a government contract from using such information for personal gain.9\nVAAR section 803.1103 supplements the FAR by requiring that by use of the clause at FAR section 52.203-16, the contracting officer must require each contractor whose employees perform acquisition functions closely associated with inherently governmental functions to obtain from each covered employee a signed nondisclosure agreement to prohibit disclosure of nonpublic information accessed through performance of the contract.\nChairwoman Kiggans, Chairman Rosendale, Ranking Member Mrvan, Ranking Member Cherfilus-McCormick, and Members of the Subcommittees, this concludes my statement for the record.\nGAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments\nIf you or your staff have any questions about this statement, please contact Shelby S.

Washington, DC  20548\nMarch 29, 2023\nCongressional Committees\nPatient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute: Review of the Audit of the FY 2022 Financial Statements\nThis report presents the results of our review of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute\u2019s (PCORI) fiscal year (FY) 2022 financial statement audit.1 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) created PCORI in 20102 as a federally funded,3 nonprofit corporation that is neither an agency nor an establishment of the United States government.4 According to PPACA, PCORI\u2019s purpose is to assist patients, clinicians, purchasers, and policymakers in making informed health decisions by advancing the quality and relevance of evidence concerning the manner in which diseases, disorders, and other health conditions can effectively and appropriately be prevented, diagnosed, treated, monitored, and managed through research and evidence synthesis.5\nPPACA requires PCORI to obtain an annual financial statement audit from a private entity with expertise in conducting financial audits, and includes a provision for the Comptroller General of the United States to review the audit and report the results to the Congress annually.6 \nAn independent public accounting firm (IPA) issued an unmodified opinion on PCORI\u2019s FY 2022 and 2021 financial statements. Specifically, the IPA found that PCORI\u2019s financial statements were presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.7 The IPA also reported that for FY 2022, it did not identify any (1) deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting it considered to be material weaknesses8 or (2) reportable noncompliance with selected provisions of laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements it tested. In addition, the IPA reported it conducted its audit and prepared its report in accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards.9 PCORI agreed with the IPA report\u2019s conclusions.\nObjective, Scope, and Methodology\nOur objective was to review the results of PCORI\u2019s FY 2022 financial statement audit. To satisfy this objective, we performed the following procedures:\n\u2022   We read and considered the following with respect to the IPA\u2019s independence, objectivity, and qualifications:\n\u2022   the results of the IPA\u2019s most recent peer review,10 dated December 5, 2022, which indicated a pass rating;11 \u2022   the request for proposal PCORI sent out when seeking an audit organization to conduct the audit of its financial statements; \u2022   the proposal the IPA submitted; \u2022   the IPA\u2019s certification of independence; \u2022   the engagement letter between the IPA and PCORI, which described each of their responsibilities and set forth the audit services\u2019 scope and objectives;12\n\u2022  r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of key audit team members; and \u2022  documentation related to the continuing professional education of the IPA staff members assigned to the PCORI audit.\n\u2022  We analyzed key audit planning documentation focusing on the IPA\u2019s assessment of the risk of material misstatement in PCORI\u2019s financial statements, the audit procedures the IPA developed as a result of this assessment, and the key audit completion documents summarizing the results and conclusions the IPA reached.\n\u2022  We read PCORI\u2019s FY 2022 and 2021 financial statements, the IPA\u2019s audit report on the financial statements, and the IPA\u2019s report on internal control over financial reporting and on compliance. We also met with IPA representatives and PCORI management officials to discuss matters pertinent to our objective.\nOur review of PCORI\u2019s FY 2022 financial statement audit, as differentiated from an audit of the financial statements, was not intended to enable us to express\u2013and we do not express\u2013an opinion on PCORI\u2019s financial statements or conclude on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Further, we do not express an opinion on PCORI\u2019s compliance with laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. The IPA is responsible for its report on PCORI dated February 15, 2023, and the conclusions expressed therein.\nWe conducted this performance audit from January 2023 through March 2023 in accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nNo Significant Issues Identified with the Audit of PCORI\u2019s FY 2022 Financial Statements\nBased on the limited procedures we performed regarding the IPA\u2019s financial audit of PCORI\u2019s FY 2022 financial statements, we did not identify any significant issues that we believe require attention. Had we performed additional procedures, other matters might have come to our attention that we would have reported.\nAgency Comments and Third-Party Views\nWe provided a draft of this report to PCORI and the IPA for review and comment. PCORI\u2019s Chief Financial Officer and an IPA partner responded that they had no comments on the draft report.\n- - - - -\nWe are sending copies of this report to the Executive Director of the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute and other interested parties.

Washington, DC  20548\n June 13, 2023\nThe Honorable Mitch McConnell Minority Leader United States Senate\nThe Honorable Mike Braun United States Senate\nThe Honorable Ted Cruz United States Senate\nThe Honorable Bill Hagerty United States Senate\n BAIL: Information on Whether DOJ Grants Were Used to Fund Cash Bond\nIn U.S. courts, judges generally determine whether defendants charged with a crime should be detained or released. Bail is the process of release and requires a contract between an individual and the court\u2014otherwise known as a bond. Bonds can be financial, such as a cash bond, or non-financial, such as the promise to appear in court.\nThe mission of the Department of Justice (DOJ), in part, is to keep the U.S. safe and to protect civil rights. DOJ awards federal assistance to state and local governments, for-profit and nonprofit organizations, tribal governments, and educational institutions through its many grant programs. Authorizing statutes and annual appropriations establish and fund these programs. DOJ has three grant-making components: the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW), and the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office). These components are responsible for managing and administering the grants they provide to ensure that the recipients implement them consistent with applicable authorizing and appropriations statutes, pertinent regulatory requirements, and the grants\u2019 terms and conditions. For example, these components manage and administer grants by requiring recipients to submit quarterly financial reports and semiannual performance reports, and using these reports to monitor activities paid for with the grant funds.1\nYou asked us to review issues related to nonprofits using federal grant funds to pay cash bond for bail on behalf of individuals. This report discusses the extent to which (1) DOJ grant funds have been awarded to nonprofits and used to pay cash bond for bail, and (2) prohibitions exist in statute or regulation to prevent such use. \nTo identify whether any DOJ grant funds have been awarded to nonprofits and used to pay cash bond for bail, we collected and analyzed grant award data from three DOJ grant systems, including the Grants Management System, JustGrants, and the Performance Measurement Tool.2 The data were from fiscal years 2017 through June 2022 (the date of the most recent complete data available at the time of our searches). For each search result, we analyzed the award data to determine whether grant funds were awarded to a nonprofit and may have been used to pay cash bond for bail. We assessed the availability and reliability of the DOJ data by interviewing DOJ officials familiar with these systems, reviewing available data dictionaries, and reviewing publicly available data on USAspending.gov.3 We determined that the DOJ data were sufficiently reliable for purposes of identifying grants with relevant award descriptions. To identify whether there was additional information on DOJ grants awarded or subawarded to nonprofits that did not appear in the DOJ data, we conducted additional searches in USAspending.gov from fiscal years 2017 through 2022 and reviewed the intended uses of these awards and subawards. We assessed the availability and reliability of the data by reviewing the Department of the Treasury\u2019s documentation regarding the series of validation requirements that all data must meet before it is published to the website.4 We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for purposes of identifying grants with relevant award descriptions. We also interviewed and collected information from DOJ officials, including those from OJP, OVW, and the COPS Office about their knowledge and experience with administering grant funding, including whether any grant funding has been used to pay cash bond for bail. Lastly, we met with selected nonprofits to assess whether they used DOJ grant funding to pay cash bond for bail.\nTo identify whether express prohibitions exist in statute or regulation to prevent the use of DOJ grant funds to pay cash bond for bail, we searched pertinent provisions of the U.S. Code, authorization and reauthorization acts, appropriations acts, and regulations. These provisions provide the authorized purposes and appropriations for key DOJ grant programs.\nFor more information about our scope and methodology, see Enclosure I.\nWe conducted this performance audit from May 2022 to June 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nAvailable Information Does Not Indicate DOJ Grants Were Awarded to Nonprofits to Pay Cash Bond for Bail\nBased on our review of available data and interviews with DOJ officials, we found no information to indicate DOJ awarded grants to nonprofits to pay cash bond for bail or that nonprofit recipients used DOJ grant funds for this purpose. We collected and reviewed data from three relevant DOJ grants management systems and searched publicly available data on USAspending.gov about DOJ awards and subawards, and found no indication that any nonprofits used DOJ grant funds to pay cash bond for bail. DOJ officials also told us that DOJ has not awarded any grants intended specifically to pay cash bond for bail, and they are not aware of any recipients or subrecipients utilizing funds for this purpose. In addition to meeting with DOJ, we met with representatives from three nonprofits that have or support projects that pay cash bond for bail that received DOJ grants or subgrants during fiscal years 2017 through 2022. Officials from all three nonprofits told us that they did not use DOJ funds to pay cash bond for bail and described how they separate their grant and program funds from funds they use to pay cash bond for bail.\nNo Express Prohibitions Exist to Prevent the Use of DOJ Grant Funds to Pay Cash Bond for Bail\nWe did not identify any express prohibitions in federal statutes or regulations on the use of DOJ grants to pay cash bond for bail on behalf of an individual. DOJ officials also confirmed that they are not aware of any such restrictions. While there may be no express prohibitions in federal statutes or regulations on using DOJ grant funds for this purpose, recipients of DOJ grants must use grant funds for the purposes for which DOJ awarded the grant.5 Additionally, under the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, the direct costs of a DOJ grant must be allowable.6 As such, recipients of DOJ grants may not use grant funds to pay cash bond for bail unless it falls within the scope of a DOJ grant program and is an allowable use of funds under that program, regardless of whether express prohibitions exist to prevent such use.\nOfficials at two of three grant-making components, COPS Office and OVW, noted that awarding grant funds to pay cash bond for bail is not within the scope of any of their grant programs. Specifically, COPS Office officials told us that its grant funding must be used in compliance with the COPS Office\u2019s applicable statutory language or in conjunction with enacted appropriations language. Thus, according to these officials, COPS Office grant funds must be used to enhance public safety through the implementation of community policing strategies or for evidence-based school safety programs and technology in and around elementary and secondary schools.7\nAdditionally, OVW officials told us that use of its grant funding to provide assistance to victims must fit within the Violence Against Women Act\u2019s definition of \u201cvictim services,\u201d which includes providing emergency and transitional shelter and crisis intervention, among other things.8\nAccording to officials from DOJ\u2019s third grant-making component, OJP, it is unlikely that costs related to paying cash bond for bail would fit within the scope of any of its current grant programs, with the exception of the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program.9 These officials further stated that paying cash bond for bail on behalf of individuals may be an allowable use of grant funds under the JAG program. Nevertheless, OJP officials told us that they would have to evaluate any proposal to use JAG program funds to pay cash bond for bail against applicable federal requirements. All DOJ grant recipients and subrecipients, including those receiving funds from the JAG program, are responsible for meeting all federal requirements of the federal grants they receive.\nUnder the statute authorizing the JAG program, JAG award funds are to be used to provide additional personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, training, technical assistance, and information systems for criminal justice or civil proceedings.10 Further, according to OJP\u2019s December 2022 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), JAG award funds can be used for, among other things, the activities of pretrial service agencies and pretrial release agencies, and for indigent defense.11 As such, payment of cash bond for bail may potentially fit within the scope of the JAG program and be an allowable use of funds for that program.\nAdditionally, according to OJP documentation and OJP officials, a nonprofit can receive a subaward from a JAG program recipient if the primary purpose of the subaward meets the requirements of one or more JAG program areas under that program\u2019s authorizing statute.12 For example, a nonprofit, in partnership with a local law enforcement agency, could receive a JAG subaward to provide allowable services to designated units of local government. Finally, the authorizing statute for the JAG program prohibits several uses of JAG funds, such as providing funds for security enhancements or equipment to any nongovernmental entity that is not engaged in criminal justice or public safety.13 However, the statute makes no mention of or prohibition against funding cash bond for bail.\nAgency Comments\nWe provided a draft of this report to DOJ for review and comment. DOJ told us that it did not have any comments on the draft report and did not provide any written technical comments.\n------\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Attorney General, and other interested parties.

We then searched for relevant awards on USAspending.gov to obtain additional information about sub-recipients and the intended uses of subawards, if applicable.16 For each subaward, we analyzed the subaward description to determine whether the subrecipient was a nonprofit and may have used grant funds to pay cash bond for bail.\nWe assessed the availability and reliability of the DOJ data by interviewing DOJ officials familiar with these systems, reviewing available data dictionaries for these systems, and reviewing publicly available data on USAspending.gov. We determined that the DOJ data were sufficiently reliable for purposes of identifying grants with relevant award descriptions.\nTo identify whether there was additional information on DOJ grants awarded to nonprofits that did not appear in the DOJ data, we conducted key word searches in USAspending.gov of the terms \u201cbail,\u201d \u201cbail services,\u201d \u201cpretrial,\u201d \u201cindigent defense,\u201d and \u201crelease agencies\u201d for all open and closed grants from fiscal years 2017 through 2022 (the date of the most recent data available at the time of our search).17 For each result, we analyzed the award data to determine whether DOJ awarded grant funds to a nonprofit and may have been used to pay cash bond for bail. We also reviewed information about subrecipients and the intended uses of subawards, if applicable. We assessed the availability and reliability of the data by reviewing the Department of the Treasury\u2019s documentation regarding the series of validation requirements that all data must meet before it is published to the website. These requirements are described on the USAspending.gov website.18 We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for purposes of identifying grants with relevant award descriptions.\nAdditionally, we interviewed and collected information from DOJ officials, including those from DOJ\u2019s Office of Justice Programs (OJP), Office on Violence Against Women (OVW), and the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office) about their knowledge and experience with administering grant funding, including whether any grant funding could be or has been used to pay cash bond for bail.\nLastly, we interviewed representatives from three nonprofits that have or support projects that pay cash bond for bail. To select the nonprofits, we identified a list of nearly 100 nonprofits that pay cash bond for bail through internet searches and a list from the National Bail Fund Network.19 We searched for each of these nonprofits on USAspending.gov and identified three nonprofits that received DOJ grants or subgrants during fiscal years 2017 through 2022.20\nDuring our interviews, we asked representatives from all three nonprofits to discuss how they used or planned to use the grant funds DOJ awarded them. We also learned about each nonprofit\u2019s accounting practices to manage grant and program funds.21 In addition, two of the three nonprofits told us they use separate bank accounts for collecting and distributing funds to pay cash bond for bail. One nonprofit\u2014Community Partners\u2014told us that it uses distinct accounting codes for all of the projects that it fiscally sponsors. We selected the two grants DOJ awarded to Community Partners during our timeframe for further review. We collected and reviewed all award documentation from DOJ\u2019s grant files and all expenditure documentation  from Community Partners for these awards for any indications that Community Partners may have used grant funds to pay cash bond for bail.\nTo identify whether express prohibitions exist in statute or regulation to prevent the use of DOJ grant funds to pay cash bond for bail, we searched pertinent provisions of the U.S. Code, authorization and reauthorization acts, appropriations acts, and regulations. These provisions provide the authorized purposes and appropriations for key DOJ grant programs. We also reviewed relevant DOJ policies and procedures for administering its grant programs, specified in documents such as its grant solicitations and DOJ Grants Financial Guide.22 In addition, we interviewed DOJ officials to obtain their understanding of whether any current restrictions exist on using DOJ grant funds to pay cash bond for bail, and whether using DOJ grant funds in that way is allowable under any of its grant programs.\nWe conducted this performance audit from May 2022 to June 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Washington, DC  20548\n June 13, 2023\nThe Honorable Mitch McConnell Minority Leader United States Senate\nThe Honorable Mike Braun United States Senate\nThe Honorable Ted Cruz United States Senate\nThe Honorable Bill Hagerty United States Senate\n BAIL: Information on Whether DOJ Grants Were Used to Fund Cash Bond\nIn U.S. courts, judges generally determine whether defendants charged with a crime should be detained or released. Bail is the process of release and requires a contract between an individual and the court\u2014otherwise known as a bond. Bonds can be financial, such as a cash bond, or non-financial, such as the promise to appear in court.\nThe mission of the Department of Justice (DOJ), in part, is to keep the U.S. safe and to protect civil rights. DOJ awards federal assistance to state and local governments, for-profit and nonprofit organizations, tribal governments, and educational institutions through its many grant programs. Authorizing statutes and annual appropriations establish and fund these programs. DOJ has three grant-making components: the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW), and the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office). These components are responsible for managing and administering the grants they provide to ensure that the recipients implement them consistent with applicable authorizing and appropriations statutes, pertinent regulatory requirements, and the grants\u2019 terms and conditions. For example, these components manage and administer grants by requiring recipients to submit quarterly financial reports and semiannual performance reports, and using these reports to monitor activities paid for with the grant funds.1\nYou asked us to review issues related to nonprofits using federal grant funds to pay cash bond for bail on behalf of individuals. This report discusses the extent to which (1) DOJ grant funds have been awarded to nonprofits and used to pay cash bond for bail, and (2) prohibitions exist in statute or regulation to prevent such use. \nTo identify whether any DOJ grant funds have been awarded to nonprofits and used to pay cash bond for bail, we collected and analyzed grant award data from three DOJ grant systems, including the Grants Management System, JustGrants, and the Performance Measurement Tool.2 The data were from fiscal years 2017 through June 2022 (the date of the most recent complete data available at the time of our searches). For each search result, we analyzed the award data to determine whether grant funds were awarded to a nonprofit and may have been used to pay cash bond for bail. We assessed the availability and reliability of the DOJ data by interviewing DOJ officials familiar with these systems, reviewing available data dictionaries, and reviewing publicly available data on USAspending.gov.3 We determined that the DOJ data were sufficiently reliable for purposes of identifying grants with relevant award descriptions. To identify whether there was additional information on DOJ grants awarded or subawarded to nonprofits that did not appear in the DOJ data, we conducted additional searches in USAspending.gov from fiscal years 2017 through 2022 and reviewed the intended uses of these awards and subawards. We assessed the availability and reliability of the data by reviewing the Department of the Treasury\u2019s documentation regarding the series of validation requirements that all data must meet before it is published to the website.4 We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for purposes of identifying grants with relevant award descriptions. We also interviewed and collected information from DOJ officials, including those from OJP, OVW, and the COPS Office about their knowledge and experience with administering grant funding, including whether any grant funding has been used to pay cash bond for bail. Lastly, we met with selected nonprofits to assess whether they used DOJ grant funding to pay cash bond for bail.\nTo identify whether express prohibitions exist in statute or regulation to prevent the use of DOJ grant funds to pay cash bond for bail, we searched pertinent provisions of the U.S. Code, authorization and reauthorization acts, appropriations acts, and regulations. These provisions provide the authorized purposes and appropriations for key DOJ grant programs.\nFor more information about our scope and methodology, see Enclosure I.\nWe conducted this performance audit from May 2022 to June 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nAvailable Information Does Not Indicate DOJ Grants Were Awarded to Nonprofits to Pay Cash Bond for Bail\nBased on our review of available data and interviews with DOJ officials, we found no information to indicate DOJ awarded grants to nonprofits to pay cash bond for bail or that nonprofit recipients used DOJ grant funds for this purpose. We collected and reviewed data from three relevant DOJ grants management systems and searched publicly available data on USAspending.gov about DOJ awards and subawards, and found no indication that any nonprofits used DOJ grant funds to pay cash bond for bail. DOJ officials also told us that DOJ has not awarded any grants intended specifically to pay cash bond for bail, and they are not aware of any recipients or subrecipients utilizing funds for this purpose. In addition to meeting with DOJ, we met with representatives from three nonprofits that have or support projects that pay cash bond for bail that received DOJ grants or subgrants during fiscal years 2017 through 2022. Officials from all three nonprofits told us that they did not use DOJ funds to pay cash bond for bail and described how they separate their grant and program funds from funds they use to pay cash bond for bail.\nNo Express Prohibitions Exist to Prevent the Use of DOJ Grant Funds to Pay Cash Bond for Bail\nWe did not identify any express prohibitions in federal statutes or regulations on the use of DOJ grants to pay cash bond for bail on behalf of an individual. DOJ officials also confirmed that they are not aware of any such restrictions. While there may be no express prohibitions in federal statutes or regulations on using DOJ grant funds for this purpose, recipients of DOJ grants must use grant funds for the purposes for which DOJ awarded the grant.5 Additionally, under the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, the direct costs of a DOJ grant must be allowable.6 As such, recipients of DOJ grants may not use grant funds to pay cash bond for bail unless it falls within the scope of a DOJ grant program and is an allowable use of funds under that program, regardless of whether express prohibitions exist to prevent such use.\nOfficials at two of three grant-making components, COPS Office and OVW, noted that awarding grant funds to pay cash bond for bail is not within the scope of any of their grant programs. Specifically, COPS Office officials told us that its grant funding must be used in compliance with the COPS Office\u2019s applicable statutory language or in conjunction with enacted appropriations language. Thus, according to these officials, COPS Office grant funds must be used to enhance public safety through the implementation of community policing strategies or for evidence-based school safety programs and technology in and around elementary and secondary schools.7\nAdditionally, OVW officials told us that use of its grant funding to provide assistance to victims must fit within the Violence Against Women Act\u2019s definition of \u201cvictim services,\u201d which includes providing emergency and transitional shelter and crisis intervention, among other things.8\nAccording to officials from DOJ\u2019s third grant-making component, OJP, it is unlikely that costs related to paying cash bond for bail would fit within the scope of any of its current grant programs, with the exception of the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program.9 These officials further stated that paying cash bond for bail on behalf of individuals may be an allowable use of grant funds under the JAG program. Nevertheless, OJP officials told us that they would have to evaluate any proposal to use JAG program funds to pay cash bond for bail against applicable federal requirements. All DOJ grant recipients and subrecipients, including those receiving funds from the JAG program, are responsible for meeting all federal requirements of the federal grants they receive.\nUnder the statute authorizing the JAG program, JAG award funds are to be used to provide additional personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, training, technical assistance, and information systems for criminal justice or civil proceedings.10 Further, according to OJP\u2019s December 2022 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), JAG award funds can be used for, among other things, the activities of pretrial service agencies and pretrial release agencies, and for indigent defense.11 As such, payment of cash bond for bail may potentially fit within the scope of the JAG program and be an allowable use of funds for that program.\nAdditionally, according to OJP documentation and OJP officials, a nonprofit can receive a subaward from a JAG program recipient if the primary purpose of the subaward meets the requirements of one or more JAG program areas under that program\u2019s authorizing statute.12 For example, a nonprofit, in partnership with a local law enforcement agency, could receive a JAG subaward to provide allowable services to designated units of local government. Finally, the authorizing statute for the JAG program prohibits several uses of JAG funds, such as providing funds for security enhancements or equipment to any nongovernmental entity that is not engaged in criminal justice or public safety.13 However, the statute makes no mention of or prohibition against funding cash bond for bail.\nAgency Comments\nWe provided a draft of this report to DOJ for review and comment. DOJ told us that it did not have any comments on the draft report and did not provide any written technical comments.\n------\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Attorney General, and other interested parties.

We then searched for relevant awards on USAspending.gov to obtain additional information about sub-recipients and the intended uses of subawards, if applicable.16 For each subaward, we analyzed the subaward description to determine whether the subrecipient was a nonprofit and may have used grant funds to pay cash bond for bail.\nWe assessed the availability and reliability of the DOJ data by interviewing DOJ officials familiar with these systems, reviewing available data dictionaries for these systems, and reviewing publicly available data on USAspending.gov.

We then searched for relevant awards on USAspending.gov to obtain additional information about sub-recipients and the intended uses of subawards, if applicable.16 For each subaward, we analyzed the subaward description to determine whether the subrecipient was a nonprofit and may have used grant funds to pay cash bond for bail.\nWe assessed the availability and reliability of the DOJ data by interviewing DOJ officials familiar with these systems, reviewing available data dictionaries for these systems, and reviewing publicly available data on USAspending.gov. We determined that the DOJ data were sufficiently reliable for purposes of identifying grants with relevant award descriptions.\nTo identify whether there was additional information on DOJ grants awarded to nonprofits that did not appear in the DOJ data, we conducted key word searches in USAspending.gov of the terms \u201cbail,\u201d \u201cbail services,\u201d \u201cpretrial,\u201d \u201cindigent defense,\u201d and \u201crelease agencies\u201d for all open and closed grants from fiscal years 2017 through 2022 (the date of the most recent data available at the time of our search).17 For each result, we analyzed the award data to determine whether DOJ awarded grant funds to a nonprofit and may have been used to pay cash bond for bail. We also reviewed information about subrecipients and the intended uses of subawards, if applicable. We assessed the availability and reliability of the data by reviewing the Department of the Treasury\u2019s documentation regarding the series of validation requirements that all data must meet before it is published to the website. These requirements are described on the USAspending.gov website.18 We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for purposes of identifying grants with relevant award descriptions.\nAdditionally, we interviewed and collected information from DOJ officials, including those from DOJ\u2019s Office of Justice Programs (OJP), Office on Violence Against Women (OVW), and the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office) about their knowledge and experience with administering grant funding, including whether any grant funding could be or has been used to pay cash bond for bail.\nLastly, we interviewed representatives from three nonprofits that have or support projects that pay cash bond for bail. To select the nonprofits, we identified a list of nearly 100 nonprofits that pay cash bond for bail through internet searches and a list from the National Bail Fund Network.19 We searched for each of these nonprofits on USAspending.gov and identified three nonprofits that received DOJ grants or subgrants during fiscal years 2017 through 2022.20\nDuring our interviews, we asked representatives from all three nonprofits to discuss how they used or planned to use the grant funds DOJ awarded them. We also learned about each nonprofit\u2019s accounting practices to manage grant and program funds.21 In addition, two of the three nonprofits told us they use separate bank accounts for collecting and distributing funds to pay cash bond for bail. One nonprofit\u2014Community Partners\u2014told us that it uses distinct accounting codes for all of the projects that it fiscally sponsors. We selected the two grants DOJ awarded to Community Partners during our timeframe for further review. We collected and reviewed all award documentation from DOJ\u2019s grant files and all expenditure documentation  from Community Partners for these awards for any indications that Community Partners may have used grant funds to pay cash bond for bail.\nTo identify whether express prohibitions exist in statute or regulation to prevent the use of DOJ grant funds to pay cash bond for bail, we searched pertinent provisions of the U.S. Code, authorization and reauthorization acts, appropriations acts, and regulations. These provisions provide the authorized purposes and appropriations for key DOJ grant programs. We also reviewed relevant DOJ policies and procedures for administering its grant programs, specified in documents such as its grant solicitations and DOJ Grants Financial Guide.22 In addition, we interviewed DOJ officials to obtain their understanding of whether any current restrictions exist on using DOJ grant funds to pay cash bond for bail, and whether using DOJ grant funds in that way is allowable under any of its grant programs.\nWe conducted this performance audit from May 2022 to June 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nEnclosure II: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments\nGAO Contact\nGretta L.

{"content": "441 G St. N.W. Washington, DC  20548\n June 13, 2023\nThe Honorable Mitch McConnell Minority Leader United States Senate\nThe Honorable Mike Braun United States Senate\nThe Honorable Ted Cruz United States Senate\nThe Honorable Bill Hagerty United States Senate\n BAIL: Information on Whether DOJ Grants Were Used to Fund Cash Bond\nIn U.S. courts, judges generally determine whether defendants charged with a crime should be detained or released. Bail is the process of release and requires a contract between an individual and the court\u2014otherwise known as a bond. Bonds can be financial, such as a cash bond, or non-financial, such as the promise to appear in court.\nThe mission of the Department of Justice (DOJ), in part, is to keep the U.S. safe and to protect civil rights. DOJ awards federal assistance to state and local governments, for-profit and nonprofit organizations, tribal governments, and educational institutions through its many grant programs. Authorizing statutes and annual appropriations establish and fund these programs. DOJ has three grant-making components: the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW), and the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS Office). These components are responsible for managing and administering the grants they provide to ensure that the recipients implement them consistent with applicable authorizing and appropriations statutes, pertinent regulatory requirements, and the grants\u2019 terms and conditions. For example, these components manage and administer grants by requiring recipients to submit quarterly financial reports and semiannual performance reports, and using these reports to monitor activities paid for with the grant funds.1\nYou asked us to review issues related to nonprofits using federal grant funds to pay cash bond for bail on behalf of individuals. This report discusses the extent to which (1) DOJ grant funds have been awarded to nonprofits and used to pay cash bond for bail, and (2) prohibitions exist in statute or regulation to prevent such use. \nTo identify whether any DOJ grant funds have been awarded to nonprofits and used to pay cash bond for bail, we collected and analyzed grant award data from three DOJ grant systems, including the Grants Management System, JustGrants, and the Performance Measurement Tool.2 The data were from fiscal years 2017 through June 2022 (the date of the most recent complete data available at the time of our searches). For each search result, we analyzed the award data to determine whether grant funds were awarded to a nonprofit and may have been used to pay cash bond for bail. We assessed the availability and reliability of the DOJ data by interviewing DOJ officials familiar with these systems, reviewing available data dictionaries, and reviewing publicly available data on USAspending.gov.3 We determined that the DOJ data were sufficiently reliable for purposes of identifying grants with relevant award descriptions. To identify whether there was additional information on DOJ grants awarded or subawarded to nonprofits that did not appear in the DOJ data, we conducted additional searches in USAspending.gov from fiscal years 2017 through 2022 and reviewed the intended uses of these awards and subawards. We assessed the availability and reliability of the data by reviewing the Department of the Treasury\u2019s documentation regarding the series of validation requirements that all data must meet before it is published to the website.4 We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for purposes of identifying grants with relevant award descriptions. We also interviewed and collected information from DOJ officials, including those from OJP, OVW, and the COPS Office about their knowledge and experience with administering grant funding, including whether any grant funding has been used to pay cash bond for bail. Lastly, we met with selected nonprofits to assess whether they used DOJ grant funding to pay cash bond for bail.\nTo identify whether express prohibitions exist in statute or regulation to prevent the use of DOJ grant funds to pay cash bond for bail, we searched pertinent provisions of the U.S. Code, authorization and reauthorization acts, appropriations acts, and regulations. These provisions provide the authorized purposes and appropriations for key DOJ grant programs.\nFor more information about our scope and methodology, see Enclosure I.\nWe conducted this performance audit from May 2022 to June 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nAvailable Information Does Not Indicate DOJ Grants Were Awarded to Nonprofits to Pay Cash Bond for Bail\nBased on our review of available data and interviews with DOJ officials, we found no information to indicate DOJ awarded grants to nonprofits to pay cash bond for bail or that nonprofit recipients used DOJ grant funds for this purpose. We collected and reviewed data from three relevant DOJ grants management systems and searched publicly available data on USAspending.gov about DOJ awards and subawards, and found no indication that any nonprofits used DOJ grant funds to pay cash bond for bail. DOJ officials also told us that DOJ has not awarded any grants intended specifically to pay cash bond for bail, and they are not aware of any recipients or subrecipients utilizing funds for this purpose. In addition to meeting with DOJ, we met with representatives from three nonprofits that have or support projects that pay cash bond for bail that received DOJ grants or subgrants during fiscal years 2017 through 2022. Officials from all three nonprofits told us that they did not use DOJ funds to pay cash bond for bail and described how they separate their grant and program funds from funds they use to pay cash bond for bail.\nNo Express Prohibitions Exist to Prevent the Use of DOJ Grant Funds to Pay Cash Bond for Bail\nWe did not identify any express prohibitions in federal statutes or regulations on the use of DOJ grants to pay cash bond for bail on behalf of an individual. DOJ officials also confirmed that they are not aware of any such restrictions. While there may be no express prohibitions in federal statutes or regulations on using DOJ grant funds for this purpose, recipients of DOJ grants must use grant funds for the purposes for which DOJ awarded the grant.5 Additionally, under the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, the direct costs of a DOJ grant must be allowable.6 As such, recipients of DOJ grants may not use grant funds to pay cash bond for bail unless it falls within the scope of a DOJ grant program and is an allowable use of funds under that program, regardless of whether express prohibitions exist to prevent such use.\nOfficials at two of three grant-making components, COPS Office and OVW, noted that awarding grant funds to pay cash bond for bail is not within the scope of any of their grant programs. Specifically, COPS Office officials told us that its grant funding must be used in compliance with the COPS Office\u2019s applicable statutory language or in conjunction with enacted appropriations language. Thus, according to these officials, COPS Office grant funds must be used to enhance public safety through the implementation of community policing strategies or for evidence-based school safety programs and technology in and around elementary and secondary schools.7\nAdditionally, OVW officials told us that use of its grant funding to provide assistance to victims must fit within the Violence Against Women Act\u2019s definition of \u201cvictim services,\u201d which includes providing emergency and transitional shelter and crisis intervention, among other things.8\nAccording to officials from DOJ\u2019s third grant-making component, OJP, it is unlikely that costs related to paying cash bond for bail would fit within the scope of any of its current grant programs, with the exception of the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) program.9 These officials further stated that paying cash bond for bail on behalf of individuals may be an allowable use of grant funds under the JAG program. Nevertheless, OJP officials told us that they would have to evaluate any proposal to use JAG program funds to pay cash bond for bail against applicable federal requirements. All DOJ grant recipients and subrecipients, including those receiving funds from the JAG program, are responsible for meeting all federal requirements of the federal grants they receive.\nUnder the statute authorizing the JAG program, JAG award funds are to be used to provide additional personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, training, technical assistance, and information systems for criminal justice or civil proceedings.10 Further, according to OJP\u2019s December 2022 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), JAG award funds can be used for, among other things, the activities of pretrial service agencies and pretrial release agencies, and for indigent defense.11 As such, payment of cash bond for bail may potentially fit within the scope of the JAG program and be an allowable use of funds for that program.\nAdditionally, according to OJP documentation and OJP officials, a nonprofit can receive a subaward from a JAG program recipient if the primary purpose of the subaward meets the requirements of one or more JAG program areas under that program\u2019s authorizing statute.12 For example, a nonprofit, in partnership with a local law enforcement agency, could receive a JAG subaward to provide allowable services to designated units of local government. Finally, the authorizing statute for the JAG program prohibits several uses of JAG funds, such as providing funds for security enhancements or equipment to any nongovernmental entity that is not engaged in criminal justice or public safety.13 However, the statute makes no mention of or prohibition against funding cash bond for bail.\nAgency Comments\nWe provided a draft of this report to DOJ for review and comment. DOJ told us that it did not have any comments on the draft report and did not provide any written technical comments.\n------\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Attorney General, and other interested parties.

{"content": "CYBERSECURITY HIGH-RISK SERIES: Challenges in Protecting Cyber Critical Infrastructure\n Overview Federal agencies and our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures\u2014such as energy, transportation systems, communications, and financial services\u2014are dependent on technology systems to carry out fundamental operations and to process, maintain, and report vital information. The security of these systems and data is also vital to safeguarding individual privacy and protecting the nation\u2019s security, prosperity, and well-being. However, risks to these essential technology systems are increasing\u2014in particular, malicious actors are becoming more willing and capable of carrying out cyberattacks. Such attacks could result in serious harm to human safety, national security, the environment, and the economy. Agencies and critical infrastructure owners and operators must protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their systems and effectively respond to cyberattacks. We have designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area since 1997. We expanded this high-risk area in 2003 to include protection of critical cyber infrastructure. In 2015, we expanded it again to include protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information. This is the third in a series of four reports that lay out the main cybersecurity areas the federal government needs to urgently address. It focuses on the need to protect cyber critical infrastructure.1 We have made 106 recommendations in public reports since 2010 in this area. About 60 of these recommendations have not been implemented as of December 2022. Until these are fully implemented, key critical infrastructures will continue to have increased cybersecurity risks to their systems and data. For more information on this report and others in this series, visit https://www.gao.gov/cybersecurity.\ninfrastructure?\nWhat actions should be taken to strengthen the federal role in protecting the cybersecurity of critical The U.S. grid\u2019s distribution systems\u2014which carry electricity from transmission systems to consumers and are regulated primarily by states\u2014are increasingly at risk from cyberattacks. Distribution systems are growing more vulnerable, in part because of industrial control systems\u2019 increasing connectivity.2 As a result, threat actors can use multiple techniques to access those systems and potentially disrupt operations (see figure 1).\nFigure 1: Examples of Techniques for Gaining Initial Access to Industrial Control Systems\nWe reported in March 2021 that DOE, as the lead federal agency for the energy sector, developed plans to help combat these threats and implement the national cybersecurity strategy for the grid. However, DOE\u2019s plans did not address distribution systems\u2019 vulnerabilities related to supply chains. As a result, these plans will likely be of limited use in prioritizing federal support to states in addressing grid distribution systems\u2019 cybersecurity. \uf0d8   We recommended that, in developing plans to implement the national cybersecurity strategy for the grid, DOE coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), states, and industry to more fully address risks to the grid\u2019s distribution systems from cyberattacks. DOE agreed with our recommendation; however, it had not yet been implemented as of December 2022.\nIn October 2022, we reported that K-12 schools had experienced significant educational impact due to cybersecurity incidents, such as ransomware attacks. For example, officials from state and local entities reported that the loss of learning following a cyberattack ranged from 3 days to 3 weeks, and recovery time ranged from 2 to 9 months. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (national plan) established Education as the sector risk management agency that is responsible for the protection of the education critical infrastructure subsector. As such, Education and CISA are to coordinate K-12 cybersecurity efforts with federal and nonfederal partners. For example, Education and CISA offer cybersecurity-related products and services to K-12 schools, such as online safety guidance. In addition, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is to provide criminal investigative support. However, the federal agencies had little to no interaction with other agencies and the K-12 community regarding schools\u2019 cybersecurity. This was due, in part, to Education not establishing a government coordinating council, as called for in the national plan. Such a council could facilitate ongoing communication and coordination among federal agencies and with the K-12 community and enable federal agencies to better address the cybersecurity needs of K-12 schools. \uf0d8   We recommended that Education establish a collaborative mechanism, such as an applicable government coordinating council, to coordinate cybersecurity efforts, among other things. Education partially agreed with this recommendation; it remained not implemented as of December 2022.\nThe communications sector is an integral component of the U.S. economy and faces serious physical, cyber-related, and human threats that could affect the operations of local, regional, and national level networks, according to CISA and sector stakeholders (see figure 2). In addition to managing federal coordination during incidents impacting the communications sector, CISA shares information with sector stakeholders to enhance their cybersecurity and improve interoperability, situational awareness, and preparedness for responding to and managing incidents.\nFigure 2: Examples of Potential Security Threats to the Communications Sector\nIn November 2021, we reported that CISA had not assessed the effectiveness of its programs and services supporting the security and resilience of the communications sector. By completing such an assessment, CISA would be better positioned to determine which programs and services are most useful or relevant in supporting the sector\u2019s security and resilience. We also reported that CISA had not updated its 2015 Communications Sector-Specific Plan. CISA officials acknowledged that certain elements of the plan are out of date and agreed the plan should be revised. Developing and issuing a revised plan would help CISA to address emerging threats and risks to the communications sector. \uf0d8   We recommended that CISA assess the effectiveness of its programs and services to support the communications sector and, in coordination with public and private communications sector stakeholders, produce a revised Communications Sector-Specific Plan. CISA agreed with our recommendations; however, neither of them had been implemented as of December 2022.\nOffshore oil and gas infrastructure faces significant and increasing cybersecurity risks in the form of threat actors, vulnerabilities, and potential impacts. In October 2022, we reported that the bureau had long recognized the need to address cybersecurity risks and initiated efforts to do so in 2015, 2020, and 2022. However, the initiatives did not result in substantial action, and the bureau had not yet developed a cybersecurity strategy. To address the lack of progress, the bureau hired a cybersecurity specialist to lead its risk-mitigation initiative in 2022, but bureau officials said the initiative will be paused until the specialist is adequately versed in relevant issues. Absent the immediate development and implementation of an appropriate strategy, the offshore oil and gas infrastructure will remain at significant risk.\n\uf0d8   We recommended that the bureau develop and implement a strategy for its most recent cybersecurity initiative. Such a strategy should include, among other things, a risk assessment, performance measures, and identification of needed resources. The Department of Interior generally agreed with our recommendation; however, it remained not implemented as of December 2022.\nRansomware is a form of malicious software that threat actors use in a multistage attack to encrypt files on a device and render data and systems unusable. These threat actors then demand ransom payments in exchange for restoring access to the locked data and systems (see figure 3).\nFigure 3: Four Stages of a Common Ransomware Attack\nIn September 2022, we reported that CISA, FBI, and Secret Service provide assistance in preventing and responding to ransomware attacks on tribal, state, local, and territorial government organizations. The agencies coordinated through existing mechanisms\u2014such as interagency detailees and field-level staff\u2014and demonstrated coordination on a joint ransomware website, guidance, and alerts. However, respondents identified challenges related to awareness, outreach, and communication. Further, the three agencies had not addressed aspects of six of seven key practices for interagency collaboration in their ransomware assistance to tribal, state, local, and territorial governments. For instance, existing interagency collaboration on ransomware assistance to tribal, state, local, and territorial governments was informal and lacked detailed procedures. \uf0d8   We recommended that DHS and the Department of Justice address identified challenges and incorporate key collaboration practices in delivering services to tribal, state, local, and territorial governments. Both Departments agreed with their respective recommendations; however, the recommendations had not yet been implemented as of December 2022.\nIn 2019, CISA published the National Critical Functions framework, which is a set of 55 critical functions (such as \u201csupply water\u201d) of government and the private sector considered vital to the security, economy, and public health and safety of the nation. According to CISA officials, this framework is intended to better assess how failures in functions across the 16 critical infrastructure sectors may cascade into key systems (such as public water systems) and assets (including infrastructure such as water treatment plants) as shown in figure 4.\nFigure 4: Examples of Critical Infrastructure Systems and Assets That Support the National Critical Function \u201cSupply Water\u201d\nIn March 2022, we reported that CISA planned to integrate the National Critical Functions framework into broader prioritization and risk management efforts. However, the federal and nonfederal critical infrastructure stakeholders that we interviewed reported that they did not understand how the framework related to prioritizing infrastructure, how it affected planning and operations, or where their particular organizations fell within it.

In addition, CISA lacked documented goals and strategies for its framework. Without such documented goals and strategies, stakeholders\u2019 questions regarding the framework will likely persist. \uf0d8   We recommended that CISA ensure that stakeholders are fully engaged in the implementation of the framework and document the framework\u2019s goals and strategies.

{"content": "CYBERSECURITY HIGH-RISK SERIES: Challenges in Protecting Cyber Critical Infrastructure\n Overview Federal agencies and our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures\u2014such as energy, transportation systems, communications, and financial services\u2014are dependent on technology systems to carry out fundamental operations and to process, maintain, and report vital information. The security of these systems and data is also vital to safeguarding individual privacy and protecting the nation\u2019s security, prosperity, and well-being. However, risks to these essential technology systems are increasing\u2014in particular, malicious actors are becoming more willing and capable of carrying out cyberattacks. Such attacks could result in serious harm to human safety, national security, the environment, and the economy. Agencies and critical infrastructure owners and operators must protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their systems and effectively respond to cyberattacks. We have designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area since 1997. We expanded this high-risk area in 2003 to include protection of critical cyber infrastructure. In 2015, we expanded it again to include protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information. This is the third in a series of four reports that lay out the main cybersecurity areas the federal government needs to urgently address. It focuses on the need to protect cyber critical infrastructure.1 We have made 106 recommendations in public reports since 2010 in this area. About 60 of these recommendations have not been implemented as of December 2022. Until these are fully implemented, key critical infrastructures will continue to have increased cybersecurity risks to their systems and data. For more information on this report and others in this series, visit https://www.gao.gov/cybersecurity.\ninfrastructure?\nWhat actions should be taken to strengthen the federal role in protecting the cybersecurity of critical The U.S. grid\u2019s distribution systems\u2014which carry electricity from transmission systems to consumers and are regulated primarily by states\u2014are increasingly at risk from cyberattacks. Distribution systems are growing more vulnerable, in part because of industrial control systems\u2019 increasing connectivity.2 As a result, threat actors can use multiple techniques to access those systems and potentially disrupt operations (see figure 1).\nFigure 1: Examples of Techniques for Gaining Initial Access to Industrial Control Systems\nWe reported in March 2021 that DOE, as the lead federal agency for the energy sector, developed plans to help combat these threats and implement the national cybersecurity strategy for the grid. However, DOE\u2019s plans did not address distribution systems\u2019 vulnerabilities related to supply chains. As a result, these plans will likely be of limited use in prioritizing federal support to states in addressing grid distribution systems\u2019 cybersecurity. \uf0d8   We recommended that, in developing plans to implement the national cybersecurity strategy for the grid, DOE coordinate with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), states, and industry to more fully address risks to the grid\u2019s distribution systems from cyberattacks. DOE agreed with our recommendation; however, it had not yet been implemented as of December 2022.\nIn October 2022, we reported that K-12 schools had experienced significant educational impact due to cybersecurity incidents, such as ransomware attacks. For example, officials from state and local entities reported that the loss of learning following a cyberattack ranged from 3 days to 3 weeks, and recovery time ranged from 2 to 9 months. The National Infrastructure Protection Plan (national plan) established Education as the sector risk management agency that is responsible for the protection of the education critical infrastructure subsector. As such, Education and CISA are to coordinate K-12 cybersecurity efforts with federal and nonfederal partners. For example, Education and CISA offer cybersecurity-related products and services to K-12 schools, such as online safety guidance. In addition, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is to provide criminal investigative support. However, the federal agencies had little to no interaction with other agencies and the K-12 community regarding schools\u2019 cybersecurity. This was due, in part, to Education not establishing a government coordinating council, as called for in the national plan. Such a council could facilitate ongoing communication and coordination among federal agencies and with the K-12 community and enable federal agencies to better address the cybersecurity needs of K-12 schools. \uf0d8   We recommended that Education establish a collaborative mechanism, such as an applicable government coordinating council, to coordinate cybersecurity efforts, among other things. Education partially agreed with this recommendation; it remained not implemented as of December 2022.\nThe communications sector is an integral component of the U.S. economy and faces serious physical, cyber-related, and human threats that could affect the operations of local, regional, and national level networks, according to CISA and sector stakeholders (see figure 2). In addition to managing federal coordination during incidents impacting the communications sector, CISA shares information with sector stakeholders to enhance their cybersecurity and improve interoperability, situational awareness, and preparedness for responding to and managing incidents.\nFigure 2: Examples of Potential Security Threats to the Communications Sector\nIn November 2021, we reported that CISA had not assessed the effectiveness of its programs and services supporting the security and resilience of the communications sector. By completing such an assessment, CISA would be better positioned to determine which programs and services are most useful or relevant in supporting the sector\u2019s security and resilience. We also reported that CISA had not updated its 2015 Communications Sector-Specific Plan. CISA officials acknowledged that certain elements of the plan are out of date and agreed the plan should be revised. Developing and issuing a revised plan would help CISA to address emerging threats and risks to the communications sector. \uf0d8   We recommended that CISA assess the effectiveness of its programs and services to support the communications sector and, in coordination with public and private communications sector stakeholders, produce a revised Communications Sector-Specific Plan. CISA agreed with our recommendations; however, neither of them had been implemented as of December 2022.\nOffshore oil and gas infrastructure faces significant and increasing cybersecurity risks in the form of threat actors, vulnerabilities, and potential impacts. In October 2022, we reported that the bureau had long recognized the need to address cybersecurity risks and initiated efforts to do so in 2015, 2020, and 2022. However, the initiatives did not result in substantial action, and the bureau had not yet developed a cybersecurity strategy. To address the lack of progress, the bureau hired a cybersecurity specialist to lead its risk-mitigation initiative in 2022, but bureau officials said the initiative will be paused until the specialist is adequately versed in relevant issues. Absent the immediate development and implementation of an appropriate strategy, the offshore oil and gas infrastructure will remain at significant risk.\n\uf0d8   We recommended that the bureau develop and implement a strategy for its most recent cybersecurity initiative. Such a strategy should include, among other things, a risk assessment, performance measures, and identification of needed resources. The Department of Interior generally agreed with our recommendation; however, it remained not implemented as of December 2022.\nRansomware is a form of malicious software that threat actors use in a multistage attack to encrypt files on a device and render data and systems unusable. These threat actors then demand ransom payments in exchange for restoring access to the locked data and systems (see figure 3).\nFigure 3: Four Stages of a Common Ransomware Attack\nIn September 2022, we reported that CISA, FBI, and Secret Service provide assistance in preventing and responding to ransomware attacks on tribal, state, local, and territorial government organizations. The agencies coordinated through existing mechanisms\u2014such as interagency detailees and field-level staff\u2014and demonstrated coordination on a joint ransomware website, guidance, and alerts. However, respondents identified challenges related to awareness, outreach, and communication. Further, the three agencies had not addressed aspects of six of seven key practices for interagency collaboration in their ransomware assistance to tribal, state, local, and territorial governments. For instance, existing interagency collaboration on ransomware assistance to tribal, state, local, and territorial governments was informal and lacked detailed procedures. \uf0d8   We recommended that DHS and the Department of Justice address identified challenges and incorporate key collaboration practices in delivering services to tribal, state, local, and territorial governments. Both Departments agreed with their respective recommendations; however, the recommendations had not yet been implemented as of December 2022.\nIn 2019, CISA published the National Critical Functions framework, which is a set of 55 critical functions (such as \u201csupply water\u201d) of government and the private sector considered vital to the security, economy, and public health and safety of the nation. According to CISA officials, this framework is intended to better assess how failures in functions across the 16 critical infrastructure sectors may cascade into key systems (such as public water systems) and assets (including infrastructure such as water treatment plants) as shown in figure 4.\nFigure 4: Examples of Critical Infrastructure Systems and Assets That Support the National Critical Function \u201cSupply Water\u201d\nIn March 2022, we reported that CISA planned to integrate the National Critical Functions framework into broader prioritization and risk management efforts. However, the federal and nonfederal critical infrastructure stakeholders that we interviewed reported that they did not understand how the framework related to prioritizing infrastructure, how it affected planning and operations, or where their particular organizations fell within it. CISA officials acknowledged the need to improve the connection between the National Critical Functions framework and local and operational risk management activities and communications. In addition, CISA lacked documented goals and strategies for its framework. Without such documented goals and strategies, stakeholders\u2019 questions regarding the framework will likely persist. \uf0d8   We recommended that CISA ensure that stakeholders are fully engaged in the implementation of the framework and document the framework\u2019s goals and strategies. CISA agreed with these and four additional related recommendations on setting priorities, seeking states\u2019 input, improving coordination, and sharing threat information.

{"content": "June 27, 2023\nCongressional Committees\nOver the past 3 years, our work has resulted in annual financial benefits ranging from $55 billion to over $76 billion. Our work also produced more than 1,200 other benefits each year, including better services to the public and improved government operations.1 We typically make more than 1,000 recommendations to executive branch agencies every year and most recommendations have been implemented within 4 years.2\nOur recommendations for executive action and matters for congressional consideration produce financial benefits for the federal government that can be measured.3 When Congress or agencies act on our matters and recommendations, government expenditures are often reduced, funds are put to better use, or federal revenues are increased. For example, a financial benefit can be the result of changes in business operations and activities; the restructuring of federal programs; or modifications to entitlements, taxes, or user fees.\nWhen sufficiently reliable data exist, we are able to obtain or generate reasonable estimates that capture the potential dollar value of these actions. We have previously reported that it is often the case that such data are not available or not sufficiently reliable for this purpose, or only reliable to produce rough estimates of magnitude. From those areas where we have reported estimates for individual recommendations and matters, they suggest that tens of billions of dollars in additional financial benefits could be achieved from full implementation.4\nMany of the benefits that result from our work cannot easily be measured in dollar terms so we refer to them as \u201cother benefits.\u201d During fiscal year 2022, we recorded more than 1,200 other benefits that fell into six categories, including public safety and security and program efficiency and effectiveness. In 2022 for example, in response to our recommendation, the Federal Aviation Administration appointed an executive council to oversee its safety compliance program for airlines and pilots to ensure the program operates as intended.5\nThe Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, includes a provision for us to provide additional detail on the potential financial benefits associated with our open recommendations and matters.6 This report provides estimated ranges of potential financial benefits that could result from implementation of our open recommendations and matters. Estimated ranges are provided for selected entities (nine agencies and Congress), for all other agencies combined, and as an overall total that sums these 11 ranges.\nTo select entities and develop simulations, we used data from two internal performance monitoring and accountability systems. These two systems record (1) our recommendations and matters and (2) benefits resulting from our work. These benefits result from our recommendations and matters, as well as benefits achieved through our other work. \nWe assessed the recommendations and matters data and determined they were sufficiently reliable to present the number of recommendations and matters made since 2001, their implementation status, and the entities to which they were directed. We assessed the benefits data and determined they were sufficiently reliable to present the financial and other benefits identified since 2001, to identify the entities that contributed to these benefits, and to use in our simulations. Because these two systems were designed for different purposes, there is not a direct link between recommendations and matters data and benefits data. We used analytic techniques to identify and limit our use of benefits data to those likely to be associated with recommendations and matters made from October 1, 2001 to May 8, 2023.\nWe have reported that data limitations and other factors limit our ability to calculate precisely the total potential financial benefits from individual open recommendations and matters.7 Simulation is a useful tool for estimation when data limitations and other uncertainties limit the ability to generate specific or precise calculations or estimates reliably. This approach allows us to estimate a range of the total financial benefits that could occur from implementation of our open recommendations and matters, without estimating a value for each recommendation or matter individually.\nTo estimate ranges of net potential financial benefits, we used bootstrapping and a Monte Carlo simulation approach.8 These approaches use historical data on realized financial benefits to estimate potential financial benefits from implementing all of our open recommendations and matters. Producing such an estimate is challenging due to the variation in types of recommendations and matters and uncertainty about the way any particular recommendation or matter might be successfully implemented. Therefore, we estimate a range of potential financial benefits rather than a single estimate. \nTo ensure a sufficient number of open recommendations and matters for each agency simulation, we selected the 10 entities\u2014nine agencies and Congress\u2014with the largest number of open recommendations and matters.9 These entities accounted for more than two-thirds of our open recommendations and matters. We developed 11 individual models specific to our 10 selected entities and one that combines all other agencies. The total simulated potential financial benefits is a sum of these individual models.\nThe results of our simulations depend both on our historical data and on key assumptions we made about how those data might correspond to future results. For example, to perform simulations using the historical data, we generally assume that net financial benefits from open recommendations or matters would be similar to net benefits from implemented recommendations or matters for the same agency, Congress, or combination of agencies.10\nWe believe our assumptions are reasonable given our historical experience and the degree of uncertainty involved. However, our estimates will not necessarily correspond to real world results, in part because financial benefits will ultimately depend on whether, how, and when recommendations or matters are addressed. We used a variety of data and alternative model specifications to test sensitivity to our assumptions and mitigate these limitations. For more details about limitations related to historical data, the simulation approach, and these tests, see appendix I.\nWe conducted this work from January to June 2023 in accordance with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance Framework that are relevant to our objectives. The framework requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to meet our stated objectives and to discuss any limitations in our work. We believe that the information and data obtained, and the analysis conducted, provide a reasonable basis for any findings and conclusions in this product.\nBackground\nAs of May 8, 2023, 5,226 of our recommendations and matters remained open, including 4,098 made in the last 4 years and 1,128 made more than 4 years ago (see fig. 1).\nFigure 1: Number of GAO Recommendations and Matters, by Date Made and Status, Oct. 1, 2001 \u2013 May 8, 2023\nWe selected 10 entities with the largest number of open recommendations as of May 8, 2023 for individual analysis in this report. These selected entities accounted for 25,197 (about 60 percent) of all recommendations and matters identified during the period, and 21,618 (about 59 percent) of closed recommendations and matters.\nWe identified 875 instances of financial benefits totaling $739.2 billion, and 23,579 instances of other benefits to the federal government resulting from implementation of recommendations and matters from October 1, 2001 to May 8, 2023.11 Our 10 selected entities contributed to about $516.6 billion of the $739.2 billion in total financial benefits (about 70 percent), and 14,707 other benefits (about 62 percent) during the October 1, 2001 to May 8, 2023 time period.12\nImplementing Open GAO Recommendations and Matters Could Produce $100 Billion or More in Financial Benefits, According to Our Simulations\nBased on a series of simulations models we developed, we estimate that implementing all of our recommendations and matters that were open as of May 8, 2023, could result in $92 billion to $182 billion of measurable, future financial benefits, with a median simulated value of approximately $131 billion.13 This range reflects the middle 80 percent of simulated values. These simulations do not provide insights into which specific recommendations and matters could lead to benefits, the value of financial benefits from individual recommendations and matters, or the likely budgetary impact of financial benefits. These estimates reflect the range of potential financial benefits that could result from implementation of our open recommendations and matters, given key assumptions in our model (see fig. 2).14\nFigure 2: Simulated Financial Benefits of Implementing All Open GAO Recommendations and Matters\nNote: The figure is scaled proportionally to the share of simulated outcomes. These simulated values represent potential financial benefits that would occur if all recommendations and matters open as of May 8, 2023 were implemented and achieved financial benefits similar to those identified in our 2001\u20132023 data. Real-world financial benefits will depend on whether, how, and when recommendations are addressed. The simulation does not create or use individual estimates from currently open recommendations, which may indicate that additional financial benefits are possible.\n On average across our simulations, our 10 selected entities accounted for about 80 percent of the total simulated financial benefits. See appendix II for individual agency results and examples of open recommendations and matters for congressional consideration that have the potential for financial benefits.\nThese simulations demonstrate the full range of simulated potential financial benefits that could result from implementing our 5,226 open recommendations and matters. The simulations overall may understate the total value of financial benefits that might accrue from our recommendations and matters, for several reasons.\n\u2022   Lack of data and other issues often make it difficult or impossible to measure the financial benefit associated with implementation of our recommendation and matters. Many of the 23,579 instances of other benefits in our historical data likely have financial benefits that are not reflected in our simulations.\n\u2022   Historical data only identify up to 5 years of financial benefits from an individual recommendation, though these benefits could continue for longer periods.15\n\u2022   Different methods, including estimation of potential financial benefits from individual recommendations and matters where data are available, suggest some individual cases may have very large potential financial benefits, but these cases are not reflected in our simulation.16 However, the results of these simulations should be interpreted carefully. The historical data we used for the simulation have limitations, as does the simulation itself. Some key limitations include:\n\u2022   The historical financial benefits used in the simulation rely on individual estimates from a variety of sources, which considered different periods and used different data, assumptions, and methods.17 These differences include the availability and quality of data, methodological decisions such as whether and how to adjust for inflation, and the period for which data on benefits were available. These differences contribute additional uncertainty to our estimates, resulting in potential for both over-estimation and under-estimation of total benefits. To mitigate this issue, as well as others described below, we present and emphasize the middle 80 percent of simulated values. \u2022   Financial benefits may not be effectively simulated for agencies that have a small number of open recommendations and matters. In these cases, the results could understate the total potential financial benefits. To mitigate this issue, we selected only the 10 entities with the largest number of open recommendations and matters for our models. Each of these 10 entities has at least 150 open recommendations or matters to simulate. Nevertheless, several individual agency simulations had at least one simulated result with no predicted financial benefits. \u2022   The simulations generally predict financial benefits under the assumption that such benefits will occur in similar frequency and similar magnitude to recommendations and matters previously implemented by the agencies or Congress. However, there may be important differences between open recommendations and our historical data that do not conform to this assumption. For example, our historical data may reflect a tendency of agencies to implement recommendations with higher financial benefits and leave recommendations with lower financial benefits unimplemented. On the other hand, agencies may tend to implement lower cost recommendations because they are relatively easier to implement, leaving recommendations with higher up-front costs but also higher net benefits, unimplemented and therefore absent in our historical data on financial benefit magnitude. Appendix I provides additional details on (1) the conservative nature of our simulated estimates, (2) key information about our data and simulations and related limitations in our results, and (3) additional models and sensitivity testing which demonstrate generally consistent results under a range of different assumptions.\nAgencies and Congress could help realize these potential financial benefits by addressing our open recommendations and matters. We regularly provide data on our open recommendations to agencies. Each year, we report on opportunities for agencies and Congress to reduce duplication, overlap, and fragmentation in federal programs, including chances for agencies to save money and increase revenue.18\nIn addition, since 2015, we have sent priority recommendation letters to heads of departments or agencies highlighting recommendations that could save large amounts of money; improve congressional or executive branch decision-making on major issues; eliminate mismanagement, fraud and abuse; or ensure that programs comply with laws and that funds are spent legally.19 These letters do not include all our open recommendations, but highlight recommendations that we believe warrant priority attention from agency heads. \nWe also issue biennial reports updating our High-Risk List, which identifies government operations with vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, or in need of transformation. Most recently, in April 2023, we reported that agencies need to address hundreds of our open recommendations to bring about lasting solutions to 37 high-risk areas, and that legislation is needed in some cases.20\nAgency Comments\nWe provided a draft of this report to the Departments of Defense, Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Transportation, the Treasury, and Veterans Affairs, the Internal Revenue Service, and the Office of Management and Budget for technical review.

{"content": "June 27, 2023\nCongressional Committees\nOver the past 3 years, our work has resulted in annual financial benefits ranging from $55 billion to over $76 billion. Our work also produced more than 1,200 other benefits each year, including better services to the public and improved government operations.1 We typically make more than 1,000 recommendations to executive branch agencies every year and most recommendations have been implemented within 4 years.2\nOur recommendations for executive action and matters for congressional consideration produce financial benefits for the federal government that can be measured.3 When Congress or agencies act on our matters and recommendations, government expenditures are often reduced, funds are put to better use, or federal revenues are increased. For example, a financial benefit can be the result of changes in business operations and activities; the restructuring of federal programs; or modifications to entitlements, taxes, or user fees.\nWhen sufficiently reliable data exist, we are able to obtain or generate reasonable estimates that capture the potential dollar value of these actions. We have previously reported that it is often the case that such data are not available or not sufficiently reliable for this purpose, or only reliable to produce rough estimates of magnitude. From those areas where we have reported estimates for individual recommendations and matters, they suggest that tens of billions of dollars in additional financial benefits could be achieved from full implementation.4\nMany of the benefits that result from our work cannot easily be measured in dollar terms so we refer to them as \u201cother benefits.\u201d During fiscal year 2022, we recorded more than 1,200 other benefits that fell into six categories, including public safety and security and program efficiency and effectiveness. In 2022 for example, in response to our recommendation, the Federal Aviation Administration appointed an executive council to oversee its safety compliance program for airlines and pilots to ensure the program operates as intended.5\nThe Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, includes a provision for us to provide additional detail on the potential financial benefits associated with our open recommendations and matters.6 This report provides estimated ranges of potential financial benefits that could result from implementation of our open recommendations and matters. Estimated ranges are provided for selected entities (nine agencies and Congress), for all other agencies combined, and as an overall total that sums these 11 ranges.\nTo select entities and develop simulations, we used data from two internal performance monitoring and accountability systems. These two systems record (1) our recommendations and matters and (2) benefits resulting from our work. These benefits result from our recommendations and matters, as well as benefits achieved through our other work. \nWe assessed the recommendations and matters data and determined they were sufficiently reliable to present the number of recommendations and matters made since 2001, their implementation status, and the entities to which they were directed. We assessed the benefits data and determined they were sufficiently reliable to present the financial and other benefits identified since 2001, to identify the entities that contributed to these benefits, and to use in our simulations. Because these two systems were designed for different purposes, there is not a direct link between recommendations and matters data and benefits data. We used analytic techniques to identify and limit our use of benefits data to those likely to be associated with recommendations and matters made from October 1, 2001 to May 8, 2023.\nWe have reported that data limitations and other factors limit our ability to calculate precisely the total potential financial benefits from individual open recommendations and matters.7 Simulation is a useful tool for estimation when data limitations and other uncertainties limit the ability to generate specific or precise calculations or estimates reliably. This approach allows us to estimate a range of the total financial benefits that could occur from implementation of our open recommendations and matters, without estimating a value for each recommendation or matter individually.\nTo estimate ranges of net potential financial benefits, we used bootstrapping and a Monte Carlo simulation approach.8 These approaches use historical data on realized financial benefits to estimate potential financial benefits from implementing all of our open recommendations and matters. Producing such an estimate is challenging due to the variation in types of recommendations and matters and uncertainty about the way any particular recommendation or matter might be successfully implemented. Therefore, we estimate a range of potential financial benefits rather than a single estimate. \nTo ensure a sufficient number of open recommendations and matters for each agency simulation, we selected the 10 entities\u2014nine agencies and Congress\u2014with the largest number of open recommendations and matters.9 These entities accounted for more than two-thirds of our open recommendations and matters. We developed 11 individual models specific to our 10 selected entities and one that combines all other agencies. The total simulated potential financial benefits is a sum of these individual models.\nThe results of our simulations depend both on our historical data and on key assumptions we made about how those data might correspond to future results. For example, to perform simulations using the historical data, we generally assume that net financial benefits from open recommendations or matters would be similar to net benefits from implemented recommendations or matters for the same agency, Congress, or combination of agencies.10\nWe believe our assumptions are reasonable given our historical experience and the degree of uncertainty involved. However, our estimates will not necessarily correspond to real world results, in part because financial benefits will ultimately depend on whether, how, and when recommendations or matters are addressed. We used a variety of data and alternative model specifications to test sensitivity to our assumptions and mitigate these limitations. For more details about limitations related to historical data, the simulation approach, and these tests, see appendix I.\nWe conducted this work from January to June 2023 in accordance with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance Framework that are relevant to our objectives. The framework requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to meet our stated objectives and to discuss any limitations in our work. We believe that the information and data obtained, and the analysis conducted, provide a reasonable basis for any findings and conclusions in this product.\nBackground\nAs of May 8, 2023, 5,226 of our recommendations and matters remained open, including 4,098 made in the last 4 years and 1,128 made more than 4 years ago (see fig. 1).\nFigure 1: Number of GAO Recommendations and Matters, by Date Made and Status, Oct. 1, 2001 \u2013 May 8, 2023\nWe selected 10 entities with the largest number of open recommendations as of May 8, 2023 for individual analysis in this report. These selected entities accounted for 25,197 (about 60 percent) of all recommendations and matters identified during the period, and 21,618 (about 59 percent) of closed recommendations and matters.\nWe identified 875 instances of financial benefits totaling $739.2 billion, and 23,579 instances of other benefits to the federal government resulting from implementation of recommendations and matters from October 1, 2001 to May 8, 2023.11 Our 10 selected entities contributed to about $516.6 billion of the $739.2 billion in total financial benefits (about 70 percent), and 14,707 other benefits (about 62 percent) during the October 1, 2001 to May 8, 2023 time period.12\nImplementing Open GAO Recommendations and Matters Could Produce $100 Billion or More in Financial Benefits, According to Our Simulations\nBased on a series of simulations models we developed, we estimate that implementing all of our recommendations and matters that were open as of May 8, 2023, could result in $92 billion to $182 billion of measurable, future financial benefits, with a median simulated value of approximately $131 billion.13 This range reflects the middle 80 percent of simulated values. These simulations do not provide insights into which specific recommendations and matters could lead to benefits, the value of financial benefits from individual recommendations and matters, or the likely budgetary impact of financial benefits. These estimates reflect the range of potential financial benefits that could result from implementation of our open recommendations and matters, given key assumptions in our model (see fig. 2).14\nFigure 2: Simulated Financial Benefits of Implementing All Open GAO Recommendations and Matters\nNote: The figure is scaled proportionally to the share of simulated outcomes. These simulated values represent potential financial benefits that would occur if all recommendations and matters open as of May 8, 2023 were implemented and achieved financial benefits similar to those identified in our 2001\u20132023 data. Real-world financial benefits will depend on whether, how, and when recommendations are addressed. The simulation does not create or use individual estimates from currently open recommendations, which may indicate that additional financial benefits are possible.\n On average across our simulations, our 10 selected entities accounted for about 80 percent of the total simulated financial benefits. See appendix II for individual agency results and examples of open recommendations and matters for congressional consideration that have the potential for financial benefits.\nThese simulations demonstrate the full range of simulated potential financial benefits that could result from implementing our 5,226 open recommendations and matters. The simulations overall may understate the total value of financial benefits that might accrue from our recommendations and matters, for several reasons.\n\u2022   Lack of data and other issues often make it difficult or impossible to measure the financial benefit associated with implementation of our recommendation and matters. Many of the 23,579 instances of other benefits in our historical data likely have financial benefits that are not reflected in our simulations.\n\u2022   Historical data only identify up to 5 years of financial benefits from an individual recommendation, though these benefits could continue for longer periods.15\n\u2022   Different methods, including estimation of potential financial benefits from individual recommendations and matters where data are available, suggest some individual cases may have very large potential financial benefits, but these cases are not reflected in our simulation.16 However, the results of these simulations should be interpreted carefully.

On the other hand, agencies may tend to implement lower cost recommendations because they are relatively easier to implement, leaving recommendations with higher up-front costs but also higher net benefits, unimplemented and therefore absent in our historical data on financial benefit magnitude. Appendix I provides additional details on (1) the conservative nature of our simulated estimates, (2) key information about our data and simulations and related limitations in our results, and (3) additional models and sensitivity testing which demonstrate generally consistent results under a range of different assumptions.\nAgencies and Congress could help realize these potential financial benefits by addressing our open recommendations and matters. We regularly provide data on our open recommendations to agencies. Each year, we report on opportunities for agencies and Congress to reduce duplication, overlap, and fragmentation in federal programs, including chances for agencies to save money and increase revenue.18\nIn addition, since 2015, we have sent priority recommendation letters to heads of departments or agencies highlighting recommendations that could save large amounts of money; improve congressional or executive branch decision-making on major issues; eliminate mismanagement, fraud and abuse; or ensure that programs comply with laws and that funds are spent legally.19 These letters do not include all our open recommendations, but highlight recommendations that we believe warrant priority attention from agency heads. \nWe also issue biennial reports updating our High-Risk List, which identifies government operations with vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, or in need of transformation.

{"content": "June 27, 2023\nCongressional Committees\nOver the past 3 years, our work has resulted in annual financial benefits ranging from $55 billion to over $76 billion. Our work also produced more than 1,200 other benefits each year, including better services to the public and improved government operations.1 We typically make more than 1,000 recommendations to executive branch agencies every year and most recommendations have been implemented within 4 years.2\nOur recommendations for executive action and matters for congressional consideration produce financial benefits for the federal government that can be measured.3 When Congress or agencies act on our matters and recommendations, government expenditures are often reduced, funds are put to better use, or federal revenues are increased. For example, a financial benefit can be the result of changes in business operations and activities; the restructuring of federal programs; or modifications to entitlements, taxes, or user fees.\nWhen sufficiently reliable data exist, we are able to obtain or generate reasonable estimates that capture the potential dollar value of these actions. We have previously reported that it is often the case that such data are not available or not sufficiently reliable for this purpose, or only reliable to produce rough estimates of magnitude. From those areas where we have reported estimates for individual recommendations and matters, they suggest that tens of billions of dollars in additional financial benefits could be achieved from full implementation.4\nMany of the benefits that result from our work cannot easily be measured in dollar terms so we refer to them as \u201cother benefits.\u201d During fiscal year 2022, we recorded more than 1,200 other benefits that fell into six categories, including public safety and security and program efficiency and effectiveness. In 2022 for example, in response to our recommendation, the Federal Aviation Administration appointed an executive council to oversee its safety compliance program for airlines and pilots to ensure the program operates as intended.5\nThe Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, includes a provision for us to provide additional detail on the potential financial benefits associated with our open recommendations and matters.6 This report provides estimated ranges of potential financial benefits that could result from implementation of our open recommendations and matters. Estimated ranges are provided for selected entities (nine agencies and Congress), for all other agencies combined, and as an overall total that sums these 11 ranges.\nTo select entities and develop simulations, we used data from two internal performance monitoring and accountability systems. These two systems record (1) our recommendations and matters and (2) benefits resulting from our work. These benefits result from our recommendations and matters, as well as benefits achieved through our other work. \nWe assessed the recommendations and matters data and determined they were sufficiently reliable to present the number of recommendations and matters made since 2001, their implementation status, and the entities to which they were directed. We assessed the benefits data and determined they were sufficiently reliable to present the financial and other benefits identified since 2001, to identify the entities that contributed to these benefits, and to use in our simulations. Because these two systems were designed for different purposes, there is not a direct link between recommendations and matters data and benefits data. We used analytic techniques to identify and limit our use of benefits data to those likely to be associated with recommendations and matters made from October 1, 2001 to May 8, 2023.\nWe have reported that data limitations and other factors limit our ability to calculate precisely the total potential financial benefits from individual open recommendations and matters.7 Simulation is a useful tool for estimation when data limitations and other uncertainties limit the ability to generate specific or precise calculations or estimates reliably. This approach allows us to estimate a range of the total financial benefits that could occur from implementation of our open recommendations and matters, without estimating a value for each recommendation or matter individually.\nTo estimate ranges of net potential financial benefits, we used bootstrapping and a Monte Carlo simulation approach.8 These approaches use historical data on realized financial benefits to estimate potential financial benefits from implementing all of our open recommendations and matters. Producing such an estimate is challenging due to the variation in types of recommendations and matters and uncertainty about the way any particular recommendation or matter might be successfully implemented. Therefore, we estimate a range of potential financial benefits rather than a single estimate. \nTo ensure a sufficient number of open recommendations and matters for each agency simulation, we selected the 10 entities\u2014nine agencies and Congress\u2014with the largest number of open recommendations and matters.9 These entities accounted for more than two-thirds of our open recommendations and matters. We developed 11 individual models specific to our 10 selected entities and one that combines all other agencies. The total simulated potential financial benefits is a sum of these individual models.\nThe results of our simulations depend both on our historical data and on key assumptions we made about how those data might correspond to future results. For example, to perform simulations using the historical data, we generally assume that net financial benefits from open recommendations or matters would be similar to net benefits from implemented recommendations or matters for the same agency, Congress, or combination of agencies.10\nWe believe our assumptions are reasonable given our historical experience and the degree of uncertainty involved. However, our estimates will not necessarily correspond to real world results, in part because financial benefits will ultimately depend on whether, how, and when recommendations or matters are addressed. We used a variety of data and alternative model specifications to test sensitivity to our assumptions and mitigate these limitations. For more details about limitations related to historical data, the simulation approach, and these tests, see appendix I.\nWe conducted this work from January to June 2023 in accordance with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance Framework that are relevant to our objectives. The framework requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to meet our stated objectives and to discuss any limitations in our work. We believe that the information and data obtained, and the analysis conducted, provide a reasonable basis for any findings and conclusions in this product.\nBackground\nAs of May 8, 2023, 5,226 of our recommendations and matters remained open, including 4,098 made in the last 4 years and 1,128 made more than 4 years ago (see fig. 1).\nFigure 1: Number of GAO Recommendations and Matters, by Date Made and Status, Oct. 1, 2001 \u2013 May 8, 2023\nWe selected 10 entities with the largest number of open recommendations as of May 8, 2023 for individual analysis in this report. These selected entities accounted for 25,197 (about 60 percent) of all recommendations and matters identified during the period, and 21,618 (about 59 percent) of closed recommendations and matters.\nWe identified 875 instances of financial benefits totaling $739.2 billion, and 23,579 instances of other benefits to the federal government resulting from implementation of recommendations and matters from October 1, 2001 to May 8, 2023.11 Our 10 selected entities contributed to about $516.6 billion of the $739.2 billion in total financial benefits (about 70 percent), and 14,707 other benefits (about 62 percent) during the October 1, 2001 to May 8, 2023 time period.12\nImplementing Open GAO Recommendations and Matters Could Produce $100 Billion or More in Financial Benefits, According to Our Simulations\nBased on a series of simulations models we developed, we estimate that implementing all of our recommendations and matters that were open as of May 8, 2023, could result in $92 billion to $182 billion of measurable, future financial benefits, with a median simulated value of approximately $131 billion.13 This range reflects the middle 80 percent of simulated values. These simulations do not provide insights into which specific recommendations and matters could lead to benefits, the value of financial benefits from individual recommendations and matters, or the likely budgetary impact of financial benefits. These estimates reflect the range of potential financial benefits that could result from implementation of our open recommendations and matters, given key assumptions in our model (see fig. 2).14\nFigure 2: Simulated Financial Benefits of Implementing All Open GAO Recommendations and Matters\nNote: The figure is scaled proportionally to the share of simulated outcomes. These simulated values represent potential financial benefits that would occur if all recommendations and matters open as of May 8, 2023 were implemented and achieved financial benefits similar to those identified in our 2001\u20132023 data. Real-world financial benefits will depend on whether, how, and when recommendations are addressed. The simulation does not create or use individual estimates from currently open recommendations, which may indicate that additional financial benefits are possible.\n On average across our simulations, our 10 selected entities accounted for about 80 percent of the total simulated financial benefits. See appendix II for individual agency results and examples of open recommendations and matters for congressional consideration that have the potential for financial benefits.\nThese simulations demonstrate the full range of simulated potential financial benefits that could result from implementing our 5,226 open recommendations and matters. The simulations overall may understate the total value of financial benefits that might accrue from our recommendations and matters, for several reasons.\n\u2022   Lack of data and other issues often make it difficult or impossible to measure the financial benefit associated with implementation of our recommendation and matters. Many of the 23,579 instances of other benefits in our historical data likely have financial benefits that are not reflected in our simulations.\n\u2022   Historical data only identify up to 5 years of financial benefits from an individual recommendation, though these benefits could continue for longer periods.15\n\u2022   Different methods, including estimation of potential financial benefits from individual recommendations and matters where data are available, suggest some individual cases may have very large potential financial benefits, but these cases are not reflected in our simulation.16 However, the results of these simulations should be interpreted carefully. The historical data we used for the simulation have limitations, as does the simulation itself. Some key limitations include:\n\u2022   The historical financial benefits used in the simulation rely on individual estimates from a variety of sources, which considered different periods and used different data, assumptions, and methods.17 These differences include the availability and quality of data, methodological decisions such as whether and how to adjust for inflation, and the period for which data on benefits were available. These differences contribute additional uncertainty to our estimates, resulting in potential for both over-estimation and under-estimation of total benefits. To mitigate this issue, as well as others described below, we present and emphasize the middle 80 percent of simulated values. \u2022   Financial benefits may not be effectively simulated for agencies that have a small number of open recommendations and matters. In these cases, the results could understate the total potential financial benefits. To mitigate this issue, we selected only the 10 entities with the largest number of open recommendations and matters for our models. Each of these 10 entities has at least 150 open recommendations or matters to simulate. Nevertheless, several individual agency simulations had at least one simulated result with no predicted financial benefits. \u2022   The simulations generally predict financial benefits under the assumption that such benefits will occur in similar frequency and similar magnitude to recommendations and matters previously implemented by the agencies or Congress. However, there may be important differences between open recommendations and our historical data that do not conform to this assumption. For example, our historical data may reflect a tendency of agencies to implement recommendations with higher financial benefits and leave recommendations with lower financial benefits unimplemented. On the other hand, agencies may tend to implement lower cost recommendations because they are relatively easier to implement, leaving recommendations with higher up-front costs but also higher net benefits, unimplemented and therefore absent in our historical data on financial benefit magnitude. Appendix I provides additional details on (1) the conservative nature of our simulated estimates, (2) key information about our data and simulations and related limitations in our results, and (3) additional models and sensitivity testing which demonstrate generally consistent results under a range of different assumptions.\nAgencies and Congress could help realize these potential financial benefits by addressing our open recommendations and matters. We regularly provide data on our open recommendations to agencies.

Washington, DC  20548\nComptroller General of the United States\n May 9, 2023\nThe Honorable Samantha Power Administrator U.S. Agency for International Development 1300 Pennsylvania Avenue NW Washington, D.C. 20523\nPriority Open Recommendations: U.S. Agency for International Development\nDear Administrator Power:\nThe purpose of this letter is to provide an update on the overall status of the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) implementation of GAO\u2019s recommendations and to call your continued personal attention to areas where open recommendations should be given high priority.1 In November 2022, we reported that, on a government-wide basis, 77 percent of our recommendations made 4 years ago were implemented.2 USAID\u2019s recommendation implementation rate was 100 percent over this period. As of April 2023, USAID had 31 open recommendations. Fully implementing these open recommendations could significantly improve agency operations.\nSince our May 2022 letter, two priority recommendations remain open. We ask that you direct your continued attention to these two priority recommendations. (See enclosure for the list of recommendations.)\nThe two recommendations fall into the following area.\nEstablishing performance goals and targets. Both priority recommendations would help improve USAID\u2019s ability to use performance data to assess Feed the Future\u2019s (FTF) performance. We maintain that it is important that USAID and its 11 federal partner agencies monitor FTF\u2019s performance as an interconnected whole. Specifically, we recommended that USAID, in consultation with its partner agencies, establish FTF-wide performance goals and set measurable targets for performance indicators. Implementing these recommendations will help ensure that USAID and its partner agencies can meaningfully use performance indicator data to assess and report on progress toward FTF\u2019s overall strategic mission.\n- - - - - \nAs you know, in April 2023, we issued our biennial update to our High-Risk List. This list identifies government  operations with greater vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. It also identifies the need for transformation to address economy, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges.3\nSeveral government-wide, high-risk areas have direct implications for USAID and its operations. These include (1) improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations, (2) improving strategic human capital management, (3) managing federal real property, (4) ensuring the cybersecurity of the nation,4 and (5) managing government-wide personnel security clearance process.\nWe urge your attention to the government-wide, high-risk  issues as they relate to USAID. Progress on high-risk issues has been possible through the concerted actions and efforts of Congress, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the leadership and staff in agencies, including within USAID. In March 2022, we issued a report on key practices to successfully address high-risk areas, which can be a helpful resource as your agency continues to make progress to address high-risk issues.5\nIn addition to your continued attention on these issues, Congress plays a key role in providing oversight and maintaining focus on our recommendations to ensure they are implemented and produce their desired results. Legislation enacted in December 2022 includes a provision for GAO to identify any additional congressional oversight actions that can help agencies implement priority recommendations and address any underlying issues relating to such implementation.6\nThere are various strategies Congress can use in addressing our recommendations, such as incorporating them into legislation. Congress can also use its budget, appropriations, and oversight processes to incentivize executive branch agencies to act on our recommendations and monitor their progress. For example, Congress can hold hearings focused on USAID\u2019s progress in implementing GAO\u2019s priority recommendations, withhold funds when appropriate, or take other actions to provide incentives for agencies to act. Moreover, Congress could follow up during the appropriations process and request periodic updates. Congress also plays a key role in addressing any underlying issues related to the implementation of these recommendations. For example, Congress could pass legislation providing an agency explicit authority to implement a recommendation or requiring an agency to take certain actions to implement a recommendation. \nCopies of this report are being sent to the Director of OMB and the appropriate congressional committees. In addition, the report will be available on our website at http://www.gao.gov.\nI appreciate USAID\u2019s continued commitment to these important issues.

{"content": "441 G St. N.W. Washington, DC  20548\nAugust 31, 2023\nReport to Congressional Committees\nExport-Import Bank: Monitoring of Exports with Dual Military and Civilian Uses as of 2023\nThe mission of the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) is to support the export of U.S. goods and services through loans, loan guarantees, and insurance, thereby supporting U.S. jobs. EXIM\u2019s charter contains a general prohibition on support for defense articles and services, with limited exceptions. In 1994, Congress gave EXIM statutory authority to support exports of defense articles and services with both civilian and military uses, known as dual-use exports, provided that EXIM determines the items are nonlethal and primarily for civilian use.1 For example, in 2011, EXIM directly loaned about $64 million to a French company to finance a dual-use export\u2014a geosynchronous satellite,2 mainly intended to supply civilian services such as direct-to-home TV and broadband.3\nThe Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 extended EXIM\u2019s authority to finance dual- use exports until December 31, 2026, when EXIM\u2019s operating authority expires under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 635f.4 The law that granted EXIM\u2019s dual-use authority in 1994 included a provision for GAO, in consultation with EXIM, to report annually on the end uses of dual-use exports supported by EXIM during the second preceding fiscal year.5 This report (1) examines the status of EXIM\u2019s monitoring of dual-use exports that it continued to finance in fiscal year 2021, as of August 2023, and (2) identifies any new dual-use exports that EXIM financed in fiscal year 2022.\nTo address these objectives, we reviewed EXIM guidance and database records as well as EXIM documentation related to an existing dual-use transaction. This documentation included a  technical operating report, an annual end-use certification report, and a dual-use compliance determination. We also interviewed EXIM officials in Washington, D.C. We did not independently verify the information that buyers provided to EXIM or assess the effectiveness of EXIM\u2019s methods of determining end use. We determined that data used to identify the status of dual-use exports were sufficiently reliable for purposes of identifying dual-use exports financed by EXIM. We based this determination on our prior assessments of the data as well as EXIM\u2019s confirmation that, as of July 2023, no changes had been made to its data collection procedures or the database it uses to maintain information on dual-use exports.\nWe conducted this performance audit from June 2023 to August 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nBackground\nEXIM\u2019s Engineering and Environment Division, with assistance from the bank\u2019s Office of the General Counsel, Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs, and Office of Policy Analysis and International Relations, is responsible for implementing EXIM\u2019s dual-use authority. EXIM defines \u201cdefense article\u201d and \u201cdefense service\u201d on the basis of the end user, the nature of the item, and its use.\nIn 2015, EXIM revised its guidance for monitoring dual-use transactions in response to findings we reported in August 2014.6 Specifically, in response to our recommendation, EXIM\u2019s revised guidance called for the EXIM engineer assigned to monitor the transaction to take the following actions:\n\u2022  Notify buyers. In advance of deadlines specified in EXIM\u2019s credit agreements with buyers, the engineer is to remind buyers of the reports due to be submitted to EXIM. If a dual-use report becomes overdue, the engineer is to notify the buyer and alert EXIM\u2019s Office of the General Counsel within 30 days of the date when the report or related information was due.\n\u2022  Document monitoring activities. The engineer is to keep a record of monitoring activities in an electronic folder, which is also to contain documents such as reports that the bank requires from the buyer. These required documents vary by loan agreement and may include progress reports on construction, testing, and delivery of financed exports; technical operating reports once the item is in use; and annual end-use certifications or reports. The annual end-use certification describes the civilian and military uses of the exported item and includes certification by the buyer that the item is being used primarily for civilian purposes.\n\u2022  Determine dual-use compliance. Within 120 calendar days of the beginning of each calendar year, the engineer is to determine whether information received during the previous year was adequate to demonstrate that the transaction complied or failed to comply with the dual-use policy in the previous year, as set forth in the financing agreement and EXIM\u2019s charter. If the engineer determines that the buyer is, or may be, out of compliance with the agreement\u2019s dual-use requirements, the engineer must retain files documenting the referral of this determination to senior management and the Office of the General Counsel. In addition, the engineer must retain files documenting any follow-up correspondence with the buyer to confirm the actual end use of the exports.\nEXIM Continued to Monitor a Single Dual-Use Export Transaction\nAs of August 2023, EXIM was monitoring the end use of a single transaction that it had continued to finance in fiscal year 2021. This transaction with the government of Mexico, comprising two satellites, was approved in 2012 and required documentation in 2023. The transaction included a fixed-service satellite, which was launched in December 2012 and became operational in February 2013, and a mobile-service satellite, which was launched in October 2015 and became operational in December 2015.7 EXIM received all required documents from the government of Mexico on time. The EXIM engineer subsequently determined that Mexico was in compliance with the bank\u2019s dual-use policy, as outlined in table 1.

{"content": "441 G St. N.W. Washington, DC  20548\nAugust 31, 2023\nReport to Congressional Committees\nExport-Import Bank: Monitoring of Exports with Dual Military and Civilian Uses as of 2023\nThe mission of the Export-Import Bank of the United States (EXIM) is to support the export of U.S. goods and services through loans, loan guarantees, and insurance, thereby supporting U.S. jobs. EXIM\u2019s charter contains a general prohibition on support for defense articles and services, with limited exceptions. In 1994, Congress gave EXIM statutory authority to support exports of defense articles and services with both civilian and military uses, known as dual-use exports, provided that EXIM determines the items are nonlethal and primarily for civilian use.1 For example, in 2011, EXIM directly loaned about $64 million to a French company to finance a dual-use export\u2014a geosynchronous satellite,2 mainly intended to supply civilian services such as direct-to-home TV and broadband.3\nThe Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 extended EXIM\u2019s authority to finance dual- use exports until December 31, 2026, when EXIM\u2019s operating authority expires under 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 635f.4 The law that granted EXIM\u2019s dual-use authority in 1994 included a provision for GAO, in consultation with EXIM, to report annually on the end uses of dual-use exports supported by EXIM during the second preceding fiscal year.5 This report (1) examines the status of EXIM\u2019s monitoring of dual-use exports that it continued to finance in fiscal year 2021, as of August 2023, and (2) identifies any new dual-use exports that EXIM financed in fiscal year 2022.\nTo address these objectives, we reviewed EXIM guidance and database records as well as EXIM documentation related to an existing dual-use transaction. This documentation included a  technical operating report, an annual end-use certification report, and a dual-use compliance determination. We also interviewed EXIM officials in Washington, D.C. We did not independently verify the information that buyers provided to EXIM or assess the effectiveness of EXIM\u2019s methods of determining end use. We determined that data used to identify the status of dual-use exports were sufficiently reliable for purposes of identifying dual-use exports financed by EXIM. We based this determination on our prior assessments of the data as well as EXIM\u2019s confirmation that, as of July 2023, no changes had been made to its data collection procedures or the database it uses to maintain information on dual-use exports.\nWe conducted this performance audit from June 2023 to August 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nBackground\nEXIM\u2019s Engineering and Environment Division, with assistance from the bank\u2019s Office of the General Counsel, Office of Congressional and Intergovernmental Affairs, and Office of Policy Analysis and International Relations, is responsible for implementing EXIM\u2019s dual-use authority. EXIM defines \u201cdefense article\u201d and \u201cdefense service\u201d on the basis of the end user, the nature of the item, and its use.\nIn 2015, EXIM revised its guidance for monitoring dual-use transactions in response to findings we reported in August 2014.6 Specifically, in response to our recommendation, EXIM\u2019s revised guidance called for the EXIM engineer assigned to monitor the transaction to take the following actions:\n\u2022  Notify buyers. In advance of deadlines specified in EXIM\u2019s credit agreements with buyers, the engineer is to remind buyers of the reports due to be submitted to EXIM. If a dual-use report becomes overdue, the engineer is to notify the buyer and alert EXIM\u2019s Office of the General Counsel within 30 days of the date when the report or related information was due.\n\u2022  Document monitoring activities. The engineer is to keep a record of monitoring activities in an electronic folder, which is also to contain documents such as reports that the bank requires from the buyer. These required documents vary by loan agreement and may include progress reports on construction, testing, and delivery of financed exports; technical operating reports once the item is in use; and annual end-use certifications or reports. The annual end-use certification describes the civilian and military uses of the exported item and includes certification by the buyer that the item is being used primarily for civilian purposes.\n\u2022  Determine dual-use compliance. Within 120 calendar days of the beginning of each calendar year, the engineer is to determine whether information received during the previous year was adequate to demonstrate that the transaction complied or failed to comply with the dual-use policy in the previous year, as set forth in the financing agreement and EXIM\u2019s charter. If the engineer determines that the buyer is, or may be, out of compliance with the agreement\u2019s dual-use requirements, the engineer must retain files documenting the referral of this determination to senior management and the Office of the General Counsel. In addition, the engineer must retain files documenting any follow-up correspondence with the buyer to confirm the actual end use of the exports.\nEXIM Continued to Monitor a Single Dual-Use Export Transaction\nAs of August 2023, EXIM was monitoring the end use of a single transaction that it had continued to finance in fiscal year 2021.

McCaul Chairman Committee on Foreign Affairs House of Representatives\nSubject: Venezuela: Illicit Financial Flows and U.S. Efforts to Disrupt Them\nMuch of Venezuela is ungoverned, undergoverned, or ill governed, according to the Department of State. In 2019, the U.S. ceased to recognize Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as Venezuela's president and suspended embassy operations in Venezuela, according to State. U.S. agencies have indicated that the illegitimate Maduro regime allows and tolerates the use of its territory by transnational criminal organizations (TCO), including U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations, for drug trafficking and other criminal enterprises. According to the 2022 Caribbean Border Counternarcotics Strategy, the ongoing political instability in Venezuela provides a permissive smuggling environment for TCOs, and Venezuela\u2019s corrupt political and security infrastructure enables officials to participate in, and profit from, these illicit activities. TCOs have used Venezuela\u2019s permissive environment to generate income. Corrupt Venezuelans have used their positions for illegitimate income. Furthermore, between 2017 and 2022, State has consistently determined that Venezuela is a major money laundering country. State and the Department of the Treasury have reported that Venezuela is susceptible to illicit financial activity, including money laundering and public corruption.\nYou asked us to review transnational organized crime related to Venezuela. In February 2023, we briefed congressional committees on Venezuela\u2019s regional influence.1 We described how corruption at various levels within Venezuela had enabled transnational crime, such as the trafficking of drugs, gold, arms, and persons. We also described how crime in Venezuela had undermined regional security and contributed to the humanitarian crisis. In May 2023, we reported on (1) how Colombian cocaine is trafficked through Venezuela destined for the U.S., Europe, and Africa; (2) how the permissive environment in Venezuela allows corrupt individuals to collaborate with drug traffickers; and (3) how the situation in Venezuela undermines U.S. counternarcotics goals in Colombia.2 In May 2023, we reported on (1) the main TCOs in Venezuela and their activities; (2) links between those TCOs, the Maduro regime, and\nVenezuelan security forces; and (3) U.S. actions to counter transnational organized crime in Venezuela.3\nFor this report, we analyzed illicit financial flows connected to Venezuela. Specifically, we examined (1) what U.S. agencies know about illicit financial flows connected to Venezuela and (2) U.S. efforts to disrupt those flows.\nTo address our objectives, we analyzed intelligence reports, diplomatic cables, criminal analyses, and U.S. government\u2013funded research. We interviewed officials of the Departments of Defense (DOD), Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), State, and the Treasury in Washington, D.C. We also met with U.S. officials at U.S. Southern Command and Joint Interagency Task Force\u2013South in Florida in July 2022.\nWe conducted this performance audit from February 2022 to June 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nSome information that was considered in developing the findings was excluded from this product for national security reasons. We provided a detailed, classified briefing on our findings to congressional committees in May 2023. U.S. agencies, including DOD and Treasury, determined that the briefing contained information that cannot be released to the public. This correspondence is a summary of our work. DOD, DHS, DOJ, State, and Treasury determined the information in this product was publicly releasable.\nSummary\nIllicit financial flows related to Venezuela include proceeds from the sale of commodities such as oil and gold, among others, as well as drug trafficking.\nOil remains a major source of income for Venezuela and has been a mechanism for fraud and corruption, according to Treasury officials. Venezuelan oil continues to be exported to other countries, such as China.\nIllicitly-mined gold from Venezuela has been refined and its origins otherwise disguised in the Caribbean, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa before entering international markets, according to U.S. government\u2013funded research. Venezuelan gold was subsequently exported to countries in Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia.\nDrugs are trafficked through Venezuela, destined for U.S. and European markets. State has described Venezuela as a preferred route for trafficking drugs, predominately cocaine. Individuals in the Maduro regime collaborated with the National Liberation Army (Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional, known by its Spanish abbreviation ELN) and dissidents of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, known as FARC dissidents) to transport cocaine through Venezuela, according to the\nCommander of the U.S. Southern Command.4 ELN and two specific dissident groups of the former FARC are U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations.\nVenezuelan actors\u2014including criminal organizations, corrupt individuals in the Maduro regime, and others\u2014attempt to export these commodities globally and take steps to cloud their origins. Venezuelan actors use shell companies and familial or business contacts acting as proxies to hide their assets. Venezuelan elites continue to use complex transnational mechanisms to move, store, and trade their wealth abroad, according to State-funded research.\nU.S. agencies have undertaken efforts to disrupt these flows. State and Treasury have provided assistance to partner countries in the region to build their capacity to disrupt criminal activity in general and, to some extent, financial crimes in particular. However, Treasury officials noted that the volume of illicit financial flows is overwhelming for many partners in the region. Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued financial advisories on corruption in Venezuela. Treasury also designated more than 300 individuals and entities related to Venezuela, blocking their assets and generally prohibiting U.S. persons (which include businesses, such as financial institutions) from dealing with them.5 DOJ and DHS have based criminal investigations on the information they have collected. DOJ has charged at least 35 individuals with money laundering\u2013related crimes connected to Venezuela and secured convictions for some, according to reporting by DOJ\u2019s Fraud Section.6 DOD monitors drug movements in the region, including those from Venezuela, and has provided money laundering\u2013 related intelligence analysis to U.S. law enforcement agencies. Other than these, DOJ, DHS, and DOD do not have any efforts specifically directed at illicit financial activity related to Venezuela.\nRecommendations for Executive Action\nWe are not making recommendations in this correspondence. However, we made a recommendation in one of our related products that State include a summary of U.S. objectives for Venezuela to counter money laundering connected to international narcotics trafficking in subsequent International Narcotics Control Strategy Reports.7\nAgency Comments\nWe provided a draft of this product to DHS, DOD, DOJ, State, and Treasury. DOD, DOJ, State, and Treasury provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. DHS had no comments.\nAs agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 7 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees; the Secretaries of Defense, Homeland Security, \nState, and the Treasury; and the U.S. Attorney General.

We interviewed officials of the Departments of Defense (DOD), Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), State, and the Treasury in Washington, D.C. We also met with U.S. officials at U.S. Southern Command and Joint Interagency Task Force\u2013South in Florida in July 2022.\nWe conducted this performance audit from February 2022 to June 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nSome information that was considered in developing the findings was excluded from this product for national security reasons. We provided a detailed, classified briefing on our findings to congressional committees in May 2023. U.S. agencies, including DOD and Treasury, determined that the briefing contained information that cannot be released to the public. This correspondence is a summary of our work. DOD, DHS, DOJ, State, and Treasury determined the information in this product was publicly releasable.\nSummary\nIllicit financial flows related to Venezuela include proceeds from the sale of commodities such as oil and gold, among others, as well as drug trafficking.\nOil remains a major source of income for Venezuela and has been a mechanism for fraud and corruption, according to Treasury officials. Venezuelan oil continues to be exported to other countries, such as China.\nIllicitly-mined gold from Venezuela has been refined and its origins otherwise disguised in the Caribbean, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa before entering international markets, according to U.S. government\u2013funded research. Venezuelan gold was subsequently exported to countries in Europe, the Middle East, and East Asia.\nDrugs are trafficked through Venezuela, destined for U.S. and European markets. State has described Venezuela as a preferred route for trafficking drugs, predominately cocaine. Individuals in the Maduro regime collaborated with the National Liberation Army (Ej\u00e9rcito de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional, known by its Spanish abbreviation ELN) and dissidents of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, known as FARC dissidents) to transport cocaine through Venezuela, according to the\nCommander of the U.S. Southern Command.4 ELN and two specific dissident groups of the former FARC are U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations.\nVenezuelan actors\u2014including criminal organizations, corrupt individuals in the Maduro regime, and others\u2014attempt to export these commodities globally and take steps to cloud their origins. Venezuelan actors use shell companies and familial or business contacts acting as proxies to hide their assets. Venezuelan elites continue to use complex transnational mechanisms to move, store, and trade their wealth abroad, according to State-funded research.\nU.S. agencies have undertaken efforts to disrupt these flows. State and Treasury have provided assistance to partner countries in the region to build their capacity to disrupt criminal activity in general and, to some extent, financial crimes in particular. However, Treasury officials noted that the volume of illicit financial flows is overwhelming for many partners in the region. Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued financial advisories on corruption in Venezuela. Treasury also designated more than 300 individuals and entities related to Venezuela, blocking their assets and generally prohibiting U.S. persons (which include businesses, such as financial institutions) from dealing with them.5 DOJ and DHS have based criminal investigations on the information they have collected. DOJ has charged at least 35 individuals with money laundering\u2013related crimes connected to Venezuela and secured convictions for some, according to reporting by DOJ\u2019s Fraud Section.6 DOD monitors drug movements in the region, including those from Venezuela, and has provided money laundering\u2013 related intelligence analysis to U.S. law enforcement agencies. Other than these, DOJ, DHS, and DOD do not have any efforts specifically directed at illicit financial activity related to Venezuela.\nRecommendations for Executive Action\nWe are not making recommendations in this correspondence. However, we made a recommendation in one of our related products that State include a summary of U.S. objectives for Venezuela to counter money laundering connected to international narcotics trafficking in subsequent International Narcotics Control Strategy Reports.7\nAgency Comments\nWe provided a draft of this product to DHS, DOD, DOJ, State, and Treasury. DOD, DOJ, State, and Treasury provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. DHS had no comments.\nAs agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 7 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate congressional committees; the Secretaries of Defense, Homeland Security, \nState, and the Treasury; and the U.S. Attorney General.

Powell Chair Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 20th St. & Constitution Ave., NW Washington, D.C. 20551\nPriority Open Recommendations: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nDear Chair Powell:\nThe purpose of this letter is to provide an update on the overall status of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\u2019s implementation of GAO\u2019s recommendations and to call your continued personal attention to open recommendations that should be given high priority.1  In November 2022, we reported that on a government-wide basis, 77 percent of our recommendations made 4 years ago were implemented.2 The Federal Reserve\u2019s implementation rate for these recommendations was 84 percent. As of July 2023, the Federal Reserve had 13 open recommendations. Fully implementing these open recommendations could significantly improve the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to more effectively oversee risks to consumers and the safety and soundness of the U.S. banking system.\nIn our June 2022 letter, we noted that three of the open recommendations were priority recommendations. Since that time, the Federal Reserve has not implemented any of them. We ask for your attention to these three priority recommendations, which are related to financial technology (fintech) and stress testing. We are also adding one new priority recommendation related to oversight of blockchain technology. This brings the total number of priority recommendations to four. (See enclosure for the list of recommendations.)\nThe four priority recommendations fall into the following three areas:\nBlockchain technology. Recent volatility, bankruptcies, and instances of fraud in the crypto asset markets illustrate the harm consumers and investors may face without adequate protections. We recommended that the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators jointly establish or adapt an existing formal coordination mechanism to identify and address blockchain-related risks. If implemented, the Federal Reserve and the financial regulators would be able to collectively identify risks posed by blockchain-related products and services and develop and implement a regulatory response in a timely manner.\nFinancial technology. Fintech lenders may analyze large amounts of alternative data on borrower characteristics, such as information from bank accounts, when determining borrowers\u2019 creditworthiness. We recommended that the Federal Reserve, other federal banking regulators, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau communicate the appropriate use of alternative data in the underwriting process with banks that engage in third-party relationships with fintech lenders. Implementing our priority recommendation in this area could better position federally regulated banks to manage the risks associated with partnering with fintech lenders that use these data.\nStress testing of banking institutions. The 2007\u20132009 financial crisis resulted in the Federal Reserve and other banking regulators conducting stress tests to determine whether banking institutions had enough capital to survive further economic shocks and still continue lending activities. In November 2016, we made two recommendations to improve the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to manage model risk and stress testing of banking institutions. These recommendations include designing and implementing a process to communicate information about the uncertainty surrounding post-stress capital ratio estimates during capital analysis and review deliberations. They also include implementing a process to articulate tolerance levels for key risks identified through sensitivity testing and for the degree of uncertainty in the projected capital ratios. If implemented, these two priority recommendations could help the Federal Reserve manage the risks in its models and account appropriately for uncertainty and sensitivity of model results.\nIn light of recent bank failures and federal banking regulators\u2019 emergency response, we also urge you to revisit the Federal Reserve\u2019s prompt corrective action framework. In 2011, we recommended that the Federal Reserve and other regulators consider adopting noncapital triggers that would require early and forceful regulatory actions tied to unsafe banking practices.3  The regulators considered noncapital triggers, but have not added them to the framework. We maintain that incorporating noncapital triggers would encourage earlier action and give the regulators and banks more time to address deteriorating conditions.\n- - - - -\nIn April 2023, we issued our biennial update to our High-Risk List, which identifies government operations with greater vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement or the need for transformation to address economy, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges.4  One of our high-risk areas\u2014modernizing the U.S. financial regulatory system\u2014relates directly to the Federal Reserve. Specifically, we urge your attention to the effective and efficient oversight of financial institutions and activities.\nIn addition, several other government-wide high-risk areas also have direct implications for the Federal Reserve and its operations. These include (1) improving the management of IT  acquisitions and operations, (2) improving strategic human capital management, (3) managing federal real property, (4) ensuring the cybersecurity of the nation,5 and (5) managing the government-wide personnel security process.\nWe urge your attention to the government-wide high-risk  issues, as well as the high-risk area for which the Federal Reserve has a leading role. Progress on high-risk issues has been possible through the concerted actions and efforts of Congress, Office of Management and Budget, and the leadership and staff in agencies, including within the Federal Reserve. In March 2022, we issued a report on key practices to successfully address high-risk areas, which can be a helpful resource as your agency continues to make progress to address high-risk issues.6\nIn addition to your continued attention on these issues, Congress plays a key role in providing oversight and maintaining focus on our recommendations to ensure they are implemented and produce their desired results. Legislation enacted in December 2022 includes a provision for GAO to identify any additional congressional oversight actions that can help agencies implement priority recommendations and address any underlying issues relating to such implementation.7\nThere are various strategies Congress can use in addressing our recommendations, such as incorporating them into legislation. Congress can also use its oversight processes to incentivize the Federal Reserve to act on our recommendations and monitor its progress. For example, Congress can hold hearings focused on the Federal Reserve\u2019s progress in implementing GAO\u2019s priority recommendations or take other actions to provide incentives for the Federal Reserve to act. Congress also plays a key role in addressing any underlying issues related to the implementation of these recommendations. For example, Congress can pass legislation providing an agency explicit authority to implement a recommendation or requiring an agency to take certain actions to implement a recommendation.\nCopies of this report are being sent to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the appropriate congressional committees. In addition, the report will be available on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.\nI appreciate the Federal Reserve\u2019s continued commitment to these important issues.

GAO-23-105346. Washington, D.C.: June 22, 2023.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2023\nRecommendation: The Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System should jointly establish or adapt an existing formal coordination mechanism with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Securities and Exchange Commission for collectively identifying risks posed by blockchain-related products and services and formulating a timely regulatory response. To facilitate these objectives, this mechanism could include formal planning documents that establish the frequency of meetings and processes for identifying risks and responding to them within agreed-upon time frames.\nAction Needed: The Federal Reserve neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendation. In its agency comment letter, the Federal Reserve said it routinely engages with the other federal financial regulators on emerging risks posed by blockchain-related products and services. However, the regulators\u2019 coordination efforts have not always addressed risks posed by crypto assets in a timely manner. We maintain that a formal coordination mechanism focused on collectively identifying risks posed by blockchain-related products and services and formulating timely regulatory responses could improve protections for consumers and investors, mitigate illicit finance and threats to financial stability, and promote responsible innovation and U.S. competitiveness.\nHigh Risk Area: Modernizing the U.S. Financial Regulatory System\nDirector: Michael E.

GAO-19-111. Washington, D.C.: December 19, 2018 (reissued with revisions on Mar. 12, 2019).\nYear Recommendation Made: 2019\nRecommendation: The Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System should, in coordination with the other federal banking regulators and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and with input from relevant stakeholders, communicate in writing to banks that engage in third-party relationships with financial technology (fintech) lenders on the appropriate use of alternative data in the underwriting process, including issues to consider when selecting types of alternative data to use.\nAction Needed: The Federal Reserve agreed with the recommendation. In July 2021, the Federal Reserve, along with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, proposed interagency guidance on third-party risk management. As of June 2023, the regulators issued final interagency guidance but it did not include specific direction to banks engaging with fintech lenders on the use of alternative data in the underwriting process. Rather the guidance indicates that it is broadly applicable to all topics and third-party relationships and, accordingly, did not address specific topics, such as the use of alternative data, or specific types of third-party relationships, such as relationships with fintech companies.  However, the guidance states regulators may issue additional guidance on specific topics in the future.\nIn March 2021, these agencies and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and National Credit Union Administration issued a request for information on artificial intelligence, including machine learning. The comment period for the request for information ended on July 1, 2021, and the regulators were working on next steps for the request for information.\nTo fully implement our recommendation, the Federal Reserve needs to provide\u2014in coordination with other federal banking regulators and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2014finalized written communication that gives banks that engage in third-party relationships with fintech lenders specific direction on the appropriate use of alternative data in the underwriting process. Clear communication on appropriate use of alternative data would give fintech lenders greater certainty about their compliance with consumer protection laws and help banks manage the risks associated with partnering with fintech lenders.\nDirector: Michael E.

GAO-17-48. Washington, D.C.: November 15, 2016.\nYear Recommendations Made: 2017\nRecommendation: To improve the Federal Reserve's ability to manage model risk and ensure that decisions based on supervisory stress test results are informed by an understanding of model risk, the Federal Reserve should design and implement a process to communicate information about the range and sources of uncertainty surrounding the post-stress capital ratio estimates to the Board during Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review deliberations.\nAction Needed: The Federal Reserve agreed with the recommendation. As of January 2023, Federal Reserve staff had communicated uncertainty surrounding the post-stress capital ratio estimates (how much capital is available to cover unexpected losses in stress scenarios) to senior officials. As of June 2023, the Federal Reserve did not provide any additional updates. We will continue to monitor its progress on addressing our recommendation. To fully implement our recommendation, the Federal Reserve needs to implement a process to communicate this information to the governors of the Federal Reserve. Until this process is completed, the\nFederal Reserve may miss important connections between elements of component models, which in turn may limit understanding of risks inherent in their modeling choices.\nRecommendation: To improve the Federal Reserve's ability to manage model risk and ensure that decisions based on supervisory stress test results are informed by an understanding of model risk, the Federal Reserve should design and implement a process for the Board and senior staff to articulate tolerance levels for key risks identified through sensitivity testing and for the degree of uncertainty in the projected capital ratios.\nAction Needed: The Federal Reserve agreed with the recommendation. As of January 2023, Federal Reserve staff and senior officials had discussed and approved tolerance levels for key risks based on uncertainty analysis results. As of June 2023, the Federal Reserve did not provide any additional updates. We will continue to monitor its progress on addressing our recommendation. To fully implement our recommendation, the Federal Reserve needs to implement a process for the Board itself to articulate tolerance levels for these key risks. Without systematically identifying and communicating acceptable levels of risk in its supervisory stress test models, the Federal Reserve may be limited in its ability to effectively evaluate and manage its model risk.\nHigh Risk Area: Modernizing the U.S. Financial Regulatory System\nDirector: Michael E.

{"content": "441 G St. N.W. Washington, DC  20548\nComptroller General of the United States\n August 1, 2023\nThe Honorable Jerome H. Powell Chair Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 20th St. & Constitution Ave., NW Washington, D.C. 20551\nPriority Open Recommendations: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\nDear Chair Powell:\nThe purpose of this letter is to provide an update on the overall status of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System\u2019s implementation of GAO\u2019s recommendations and to call your continued personal attention to open recommendations that should be given high priority.1  In November 2022, we reported that on a government-wide basis, 77 percent of our recommendations made 4 years ago were implemented.2 The Federal Reserve\u2019s implementation rate for these recommendations was 84 percent. As of July 2023, the Federal Reserve had 13 open recommendations. Fully implementing these open recommendations could significantly improve the Federal Reserve\u2019s efforts to more effectively oversee risks to consumers and the safety and soundness of the U.S. banking system.\nIn our June 2022 letter, we noted that three of the open recommendations were priority recommendations. Since that time, the Federal Reserve has not implemented any of them. We ask for your attention to these three priority recommendations, which are related to financial technology (fintech) and stress testing. We are also adding one new priority recommendation related to oversight of blockchain technology. This brings the total number of priority recommendations to four. (See enclosure for the list of recommendations.)\nThe four priority recommendations fall into the following three areas:\nBlockchain technology. Recent volatility, bankruptcies, and instances of fraud in the crypto asset markets illustrate the harm consumers and investors may face without adequate protections. We recommended that the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators jointly establish or adapt an existing formal coordination mechanism to identify and address blockchain-related risks. If implemented, the Federal Reserve and the financial regulators would be able to collectively identify risks posed by blockchain-related products and services and develop and implement a regulatory response in a timely manner.\nFinancial technology. Fintech lenders may analyze large amounts of alternative data on borrower characteristics, such as information from bank accounts, when determining borrowers\u2019 creditworthiness. We recommended that the Federal Reserve, other federal banking regulators, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau communicate the appropriate use of alternative data in the underwriting process with banks that engage in third-party relationships with fintech lenders. Implementing our priority recommendation in this area could better position federally regulated banks to manage the risks associated with partnering with fintech lenders that use these data.\nStress testing of banking institutions. The 2007\u20132009 financial crisis resulted in the Federal Reserve and other banking regulators conducting stress tests to determine whether banking institutions had enough capital to survive further economic shocks and still continue lending activities. In November 2016, we made two recommendations to improve the Federal Reserve\u2019s ability to manage model risk and stress testing of banking institutions. These recommendations include designing and implementing a process to communicate information about the uncertainty surrounding post-stress capital ratio estimates during capital analysis and review deliberations. They also include implementing a process to articulate tolerance levels for key risks identified through sensitivity testing and for the degree of uncertainty in the projected capital ratios. If implemented, these two priority recommendations could help the Federal Reserve manage the risks in its models and account appropriately for uncertainty and sensitivity of model results.\nIn light of recent bank failures and federal banking regulators\u2019 emergency response, we also urge you to revisit the Federal Reserve\u2019s prompt corrective action framework. In 2011, we recommended that the Federal Reserve and other regulators consider adopting noncapital triggers that would require early and forceful regulatory actions tied to unsafe banking practices.3  The regulators considered noncapital triggers, but have not added them to the framework. We maintain that incorporating noncapital triggers would encourage earlier action and give the regulators and banks more time to address deteriorating conditions.\n- - - - -\nIn April 2023, we issued our biennial update to our High-Risk List, which identifies government operations with greater vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement or the need for transformation to address economy, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges.4  One of our high-risk areas\u2014modernizing the U.S. financial regulatory system\u2014relates directly to the Federal Reserve. Specifically, we urge your attention to the effective and efficient oversight of financial institutions and activities.\nIn addition, several other government-wide high-risk areas also have direct implications for the Federal Reserve and its operations. These include (1) improving the management of IT  acquisitions and operations, (2) improving strategic human capital management, (3) managing federal real property, (4) ensuring the cybersecurity of the nation,5 and (5) managing the government-wide personnel security process.\nWe urge your attention to the government-wide high-risk  issues, as well as the high-risk area for which the Federal Reserve has a leading role. Progress on high-risk issues has been possible through the concerted actions and efforts of Congress, Office of Management and Budget, and the leadership and staff in agencies, including within the Federal Reserve. In March 2022, we issued a report on key practices to successfully address high-risk areas, which can be a helpful resource as your agency continues to make progress to address high-risk issues.6\nIn addition to your continued attention on these issues, Congress plays a key role in providing oversight and maintaining focus on our recommendations to ensure they are implemented and produce their desired results. Legislation enacted in December 2022 includes a provision for GAO to identify any additional congressional oversight actions that can help agencies implement priority recommendations and address any underlying issues relating to such implementation.7\nThere are various strategies Congress can use in addressing our recommendations, such as incorporating them into legislation. Congress can also use its oversight processes to incentivize the Federal Reserve to act on our recommendations and monitor its progress. For example, Congress can hold hearings focused on the Federal Reserve\u2019s progress in implementing GAO\u2019s priority recommendations or take other actions to provide incentives for the Federal Reserve to act. Congress also plays a key role in addressing any underlying issues related to the implementation of these recommendations. For example, Congress can pass legislation providing an agency explicit authority to implement a recommendation or requiring an agency to take certain actions to implement a recommendation.\nCopies of this report are being sent to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the appropriate congressional committees. In addition, the report will be available on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.\nI appreciate the Federal Reserve\u2019s continued commitment to these important issues. If you have any questions or would like to discuss any of the issues outlined in this letter, please do not hesitate to contact me or Daniel Garcia-Diaz, Managing Director, Financial Markets and Community Investment, at garciadiazd@gao.gov or (202) 512-8678. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. Our teams will continue to coordinate with your staff on all 13 open recommendations, as  well as those recommendations in the high-risk areas for which the Federal Reserve has a leading role.

Washington, DC  20548\n July 28, 2023\nThe Honorable Bernard Sanders Chair The Honorable Bill Cassidy Ranking Member Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions United States Senate\nThe Honorable Cathy McMorris Rodgers Chair The Honorable Frank Pallone, Jr. Ranking Member Committee on Energy and Commerce House of Representatives\nOver-the-Counter Drugs: Status of FDA\u2019s Implementation of Exclusivity Provisions in the CARES Act\nOver-the-counter (OTC) drugs play an important role in the U.S. health care system by providing consumers quick access to health care products for a variety of uses without a prescription. These include, for example, painkillers to relieve minor aches and pains and sunscreen to help prevent sunburn and skin cancer. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2014 an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\u2014is responsible for ensuring the safety and effectiveness of drugs, including OTC drugs. FDA regulates the safety and effectiveness of most OTC drugs through its monograph process, through which OTC drugs can be marketed without prior FDA evaluation and approval for each individual product.1 FDA issues monographs to establish conditions\u2014such as active ingredients, dosage forms, indications for use, and product labeling\u2014under which an OTC drug in a given therapeutic category (e.g., sunscreen, antacid) is generally recognized as safe and effective for its intended use.\nBoth FDA officials and industry stakeholders, among others, have noted that the monograph process has limited FDA\u2019s ability to quickly update OTC monographs to allow additional products to be marketed for consumers, as we previously reported.2 To expedite the monograph process and incentivize industry innovation in the development of new OTC drugs, in March 2020, the CARES Act made several changes to the regulation of OTC drugs.3 Among those changes, the CARES Act changed the monograph process to make it less burdensome on the agency to update and create new monographs. The CARES Act also allowed drug manufacturers, marketers, and others (hereafter \u201crequestors\u201d) to request changes to a monograph and provided an 18-month period of marketing exclusivity if FDA makes certain requested changes.4 This exclusivity\u2014hereafter referred to as OTC monograph drug exclusivity\u2014is intended to create an incentive for industry innovation for OTC drug products. The CARES Act included a provision for GAO to examine and report on the implementation and impact of exclusivity for OTC drugs on industry innovation and consumer access and affordability 4 years after the enactment of the CARES Act, or by March 2024.5 This report describes (1) the status of FDA\u2019s efforts to implement OTC monograph drug exclusivity provisions, and (2) research and stakeholder perspectives on how OTC monograph drug exclusivity may affect industry innovation for OTC drugs and consumer access to and affordability of these drugs.\nTo describe the status of FDA\u2019s efforts to implement OTC monograph drug exclusivity provisions, we reviewed FDA draft guidance, annual progress reports, and relevant legislation. We also interviewed FDA officials about their activities to implement the changes to the monograph process under the CARES Act.\nTo describe research and stakeholder perspectives on how OTC monograph drug exclusivity may affect industry innovation and consumers, we conducted a literature search to identify relevant studies published in peer-reviewed journals, government reports, and trade or research institute publications on the effect of exclusivity on industry innovation and consumers from January 2008 through April 2023.6 We also interviewed FDA officials and representatives for industry stakeholders\u2014selected on the basis of their participation in GAO's 2020 report on\nFDA's oversight of OTC drugs\u2014about how exclusivity may affect consumers and industry innovation.7\nWe conducted this performance audit from January 2023 to July 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our finding based on our audit objective. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our finding based on our audit objective.\nBackground\nThe CARES Act created section 505G of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act governing FDA\u2019s OTC monograph process. Among the reforms made by the CARES Act, section 505G replaced the rulemaking process for OTC monographs with an administrative order process to allow FDA to issue and revise monographs more quickly, including revisions to address safety issues. As we previously reported, FDA expects the time frames for issuing proposed and final administrative orders to be substantially shorter than those for issuing proposed and final rules.8 Section 505G also allowed requestors\u2014such as drug manufacturers, marketers, processors, or developers\u2014to request changes to OTC monographs by submitting an OTC monograph order request.9 In addition, the CARES Act authorized FDA to assess new OTC monograph user fees to provide the agency with additional resources to regulate OTC drugs.10 FDA began collecting OTC monograph user fees in June 2021.\nThe CARES Act provided exclusivity to requestors for certain types of OTC monograph changes made as a result of a monograph order request. OTC monograph drug exclusivity is available for (1) a change relating to an active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient) not previously incorporated in a monograph drug or (2) a change in the conditions of use of a drug for which new human data studies conducted or sponsored by the requestor were essential to issuance of the final administrative order.11 If FDA makes the requested changes to an OTC monograph, the requestor will receive 18 months of exclusivity to market their OTC drug incorporating the requested change.12 For example, if an OTC drug manufacturer requests a monograph change for a new dosage form of an available OTC painkiller\u2014e.g., a dissolvable film that can be taken without water\u2014based on new human data studies and FDA makes the requested change, the manufacturer would receive an 18-month period of exclusivity. This means that for 18 months, the manufacturer would have exclusive rights to sell the OTC painkiller in the new dosage form.\nOTC monograph drug exclusivity is not available under section 505G for safety-related changes, changes related to methods of testing safety or efficacy, or for certain other changes, such as modifications to the directions for use and reordering of existing information on a product\u2019s drug facts label.\nFDA Has Not Yet Received Monograph Order Requests Eligible for OTC Monograph Drug Exclusivity\nAs of May 2023, no companies have received OTC monograph drug exclusivity for any OTC drugs under section 505G. FDA officials told us that as of March 2023, the agency had not received any OTC monograph order requests. Officials also told us that they do not expect to receive any OTC monograph order requests until October 2023 at the earliest.\nFDA is in the process of implementing OTC monograph reform, including the provisions in section 505G related to exclusivity. According to the agency\u2019s goals document, the agency anticipated that the first 3 years of implementing OTC monograph reform\u2014fiscal years 2021 through 2023\u2014would entail developing the infrastructure to carry out OTC monograph reform. This includes hiring and training staff, developing guidance for agency staff and industry, and constructing information technology (IT) platforms to, among other things, facilitate the review of OTC monograph order requests.13 In addition, during this time, the agency expected that its capacity for reviewing OTC monograph order requests would be consumed by other monograph mandates and safety activities.14\nFor fiscal years 2021 and 2022, FDA reported that the agency had collected over $42 million in OTC monograph user fees, which it used in conjunction with the agency\u2019s regular appropriations to support all OTC monograph reform activities. This included hiring 32 new employees, implementing a public-facing OTC monograph IT dashboard, and designing an IT platform for FDA\u2019s OTC monograph review activities. FDA officials told us that the agency has started developing policies and guidance for both agency staff and industry related to changes made by the CARES Act. For example, in April 2023, FDA solicited public comments on the agency\u2019s draft guidance for the format and content of OTC monograph order requests.15\nAdditionally, officials told us that, as of March 2023, they have begun to develop the preliminary procedures needed to review OTC monograph order requests. Officials also told us that FDA is developing procedures related to how the agency will implement OTC monograph drug exclusivity.\nIndustry stakeholders from a national trade organization told us that a handful of their member companies are actively considering submitting an OTC monograph order request and are enthusiastic over the prospect of an 18-month period of exclusivity. However, industry stakeholders said the submissions may not occur until 2024. According to the potential timeframes described in the agency\u2019s May 2020 informational briefing on monograph reform, FDA estimates an OTC monograph order request review would take 17 to 23 months before the agency could finalize a monograph change, including one related to exclusivity.16\nEffect of OTC Monograph Drug Exclusivity on Innovation and Consumers Is Unknown\nThe potential effect of OTC monograph drug exclusivity on OTC drug innovation and consumers is unknown. Among the 91 journal articles we reviewed, none provided evidence for the effect that exclusivity could have on consumer access to OTC drugs, on the affordability of OTC drug products, and on OTC drug innovation. However, some noted that exclusivity would likely incentivize industry innovation in developing OTC drugs. For example, in a 2021 legal journal article on monograph reform, the authors noted that the combination of the faster administrative order process for monographs and an exclusivity period may facilitate the development of a wider variety of OTC drugs.17 Similarly, another 2021 dermatology journal article noted that the OTC monograph drug exclusivity period for new active ingredients may incentivize industry innovation in developing new sunscreen products.18\nFDA officials told us that they are unaware of a methodology that the agency could use to evaluate the effect of OTC monograph drug exclusivity. Consequently, FDA officials told us the agency does not plan to evaluate the effect that exclusivity has on industry innovation and consumer access to OTC drugs or the affordability of OTC drugs.\nIndustry stakeholders told us that exclusivity is a key incentive for the research investments that potential requestors would be making to support product innovation. One industry stakeholder representative said that a longer period of exclusivity (i.e., longer than the 18-month period under section 505G) would better spur innovation, considering the high costs and the period of time needed to conduct human clinical studies.19 \nOrganizations representing consumers and industry stakeholders differed on how they expect OTC monograph drug exclusivity to affect consumer access and affordability.20 For example, in a January 2018 letter to congressional leaders, an organization representing consumer interests publicly raised concerns that OTC drug companies may limit the availability of older but equally effective OTC drugs, pushing consumers to purchase newer, more expensive drugs that have received exclusivity.21 In contrast, representatives from industry stakeholders told us they expect that innovations in OTC drug administration will increase consumer access to and utilization of OTC drugs. These stakeholders also told us they expect the effect of OTC monograph drug exclusivity on OTC drug affordability for consumers to be minimal because of the availability of alternative OTC drugs, for example. Representatives from one industry stakeholder organization noted that, even where an OTC drug has received exclusivity, consumers will still have other options available, since therapeutic categories often have multiple alternative OTC products. For example, according to these industry stakeholder representatives, if a new sunscreen active ingredient is introduced to the monograph and receives exclusivity, other sunscreen products that use a different active ingredient will still be available to consumers, and thus consumers may not pick that new alternative. They also told us that after the 18-month OTC monograph drug exclusivity period, there will be competition from other manufacturers to produce generic products and ensure drug affordability for consumers.\nAgency comments\nWe provided a draft of this report to FDA for review and comment.

The CARES Act included a provision for GAO to examine and report on the implementation and impact of exclusivity for OTC drugs on industry innovation and consumer access and affordability 4 years after the enactment of the CARES Act, or by March 2024.5 This report describes (1) the status of FDA\u2019s efforts to implement OTC monograph drug exclusivity provisions, and (2) research and stakeholder perspectives on how OTC monograph drug exclusivity may affect industry innovation for OTC drugs and consumer access to and affordability of these drugs.\nTo describe the status of FDA\u2019s efforts to implement OTC monograph drug exclusivity provisions, we reviewed FDA draft guidance, annual progress reports, and relevant legislation. We also interviewed FDA officials about their activities to implement the changes to the monograph process under the CARES Act.\nTo describe research and stakeholder perspectives on how OTC monograph drug exclusivity may affect industry innovation and consumers, we conducted a literature search to identify relevant studies published in peer-reviewed journals, government reports, and trade or research institute publications on the effect of exclusivity on industry innovation and consumers from January 2008 through April 2023.6 We also interviewed FDA officials and representatives for industry stakeholders\u2014selected on the basis of their participation in GAO's 2020 report on\nFDA's oversight of OTC drugs\u2014about how exclusivity may affect consumers and industry innovation.7\nWe conducted this performance audit from January 2023 to July 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our finding based on our audit objective. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our finding based on our audit objective.\nBackground\nThe CARES Act created section 505G of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act governing FDA\u2019s OTC monograph process. Among the reforms made by the CARES Act, section 505G replaced the rulemaking process for OTC monographs with an administrative order process to allow FDA to issue and revise monographs more quickly, including revisions to address safety issues. As we previously reported, FDA expects the time frames for issuing proposed and final administrative orders to be substantially shorter than those for issuing proposed and final rules.8 Section 505G also allowed requestors\u2014such as drug manufacturers, marketers, processors, or developers\u2014to request changes to OTC monographs by submitting an OTC monograph order request.9 In addition, the CARES Act authorized FDA to assess new OTC monograph user fees to provide the agency with additional resources to regulate OTC drugs.10 FDA began collecting OTC monograph user fees in June 2021.\nThe CARES Act provided exclusivity to requestors for certain types of OTC monograph changes made as a result of a monograph order request. OTC monograph drug exclusivity is available for (1) a change relating to an active ingredient (including any ester or salt of the active ingredient) not previously incorporated in a monograph drug or (2) a change in the conditions of use of a drug for which new human data studies conducted or sponsored by the requestor were essential to issuance of the final administrative order.11 If FDA makes the requested changes to an OTC monograph, the requestor will receive 18 months of exclusivity to market their OTC drug incorporating the requested change.12 For example, if an OTC drug manufacturer requests a monograph change for a new dosage form of an available OTC painkiller\u2014e.g., a dissolvable film that can be taken without water\u2014based on new human data studies and FDA makes the requested change, the manufacturer would receive an 18-month period of exclusivity. This means that for 18 months, the manufacturer would have exclusive rights to sell the OTC painkiller in the new dosage form.\nOTC monograph drug exclusivity is not available under section 505G for safety-related changes, changes related to methods of testing safety or efficacy, or for certain other changes, such as modifications to the directions for use and reordering of existing information on a product\u2019s drug facts label.\nFDA Has Not Yet Received Monograph Order Requests Eligible for OTC Monograph Drug Exclusivity\nAs of May 2023, no companies have received OTC monograph drug exclusivity for any OTC drugs under section 505G. FDA officials told us that as of March 2023, the agency had not received any OTC monograph order requests. Officials also told us that they do not expect to receive any OTC monograph order requests until October 2023 at the earliest.\nFDA is in the process of implementing OTC monograph reform, including the provisions in section 505G related to exclusivity. According to the agency\u2019s goals document, the agency anticipated that the first 3 years of implementing OTC monograph reform\u2014fiscal years 2021 through 2023\u2014would entail developing the infrastructure to carry out OTC monograph reform. This includes hiring and training staff, developing guidance for agency staff and industry, and constructing information technology (IT) platforms to, among other things, facilitate the review of OTC monograph order requests.13 In addition, during this time, the agency expected that its capacity for reviewing OTC monograph order requests would be consumed by other monograph mandates and safety activities.14\nFor fiscal years 2021 and 2022, FDA reported that the agency had collected over $42 million in OTC monograph user fees, which it used in conjunction with the agency\u2019s regular appropriations to support all OTC monograph reform activities. This included hiring 32 new employees, implementing a public-facing OTC monograph IT dashboard, and designing an IT platform for FDA\u2019s OTC monograph review activities. FDA officials told us that the agency has started developing policies and guidance for both agency staff and industry related to changes made by the CARES Act. For example, in April 2023, FDA solicited public comments on the agency\u2019s draft guidance for the format and content of OTC monograph order requests.15\nAdditionally, officials told us that, as of March 2023, they have begun to develop the preliminary procedures needed to review OTC monograph order requests. Officials also told us that FDA is developing procedures related to how the agency will implement OTC monograph drug exclusivity.\nIndustry stakeholders from a national trade organization told us that a handful of their member companies are actively considering submitting an OTC monograph order request and are enthusiastic over the prospect of an 18-month period of exclusivity. However, industry stakeholders said the submissions may not occur until 2024. According to the potential timeframes described in the agency\u2019s May 2020 informational briefing on monograph reform, FDA estimates an OTC monograph order request review would take 17 to 23 months before the agency could finalize a monograph change, including one related to exclusivity.16\nEffect of OTC Monograph Drug Exclusivity on Innovation and Consumers Is Unknown\nThe potential effect of OTC monograph drug exclusivity on OTC drug innovation and consumers is unknown. Among the 91 journal articles we reviewed, none provided evidence for the effect that exclusivity could have on consumer access to OTC drugs, on the affordability of OTC drug products, and on OTC drug innovation. However, some noted that exclusivity would likely incentivize industry innovation in developing OTC drugs. For example, in a 2021 legal journal article on monograph reform, the authors noted that the combination of the faster administrative order process for monographs and an exclusivity period may facilitate the development of a wider variety of OTC drugs.17 Similarly, another 2021 dermatology journal article noted that the OTC monograph drug exclusivity period for new active ingredients may incentivize industry innovation in developing new sunscreen products.18\nFDA officials told us that they are unaware of a methodology that the agency could use to evaluate the effect of OTC monograph drug exclusivity. Consequently, FDA officials told us the agency does not plan to evaluate the effect that exclusivity has on industry innovation and consumer access to OTC drugs or the affordability of OTC drugs.\nIndustry stakeholders told us that exclusivity is a key incentive for the research investments that potential requestors would be making to support product innovation. One industry stakeholder representative said that a longer period of exclusivity (i.e., longer than the 18-month period under section 505G) would better spur innovation, considering the high costs and the period of time needed to conduct human clinical studies.19 \nOrganizations representing consumers and industry stakeholders differed on how they expect OTC monograph drug exclusivity to affect consumer access and affordability.20 For example, in a January 2018 letter to congressional leaders, an organization representing consumer interests publicly raised concerns that OTC drug companies may limit the availability of older but equally effective OTC drugs, pushing consumers to purchase newer, more expensive drugs that have received exclusivity.21 In contrast, representatives from industry stakeholders told us they expect that innovations in OTC drug administration will increase consumer access to and utilization of OTC drugs. These stakeholders also told us they expect the effect of OTC monograph drug exclusivity on OTC drug affordability for consumers to be minimal because of the availability of alternative OTC drugs, for example. Representatives from one industry stakeholder organization noted that, even where an OTC drug has received exclusivity, consumers will still have other options available, since therapeutic categories often have multiple alternative OTC products. For example, according to these industry stakeholder representatives, if a new sunscreen active ingredient is introduced to the monograph and receives exclusivity, other sunscreen products that use a different active ingredient will still be available to consumers, and thus consumers may not pick that new alternative. They also told us that after the 18-month OTC monograph drug exclusivity period, there will be competition from other manufacturers to produce generic products and ensure drug affordability for consumers.\nAgency comments\nWe provided a draft of this report to FDA for review and comment.

No text of specified style in document.\n June 6, 2023\nChairman Barr, Ranking Member Foster, and Members of the Committee:\nThank you for the opportunity to join you today to discuss the nation\u2019s unsustainable fiscal path, the risks posed by debt limit impasses, and actions Congress can take to address these challenges.\nLast month we issued our seventh annual fiscal health report to examine the current fiscal condition of the federal government and its future fiscal path, absent policy changes in revenue and program spending.1 The report highlights long-term projections from GAO and others showing that the balance of current revenue and program spending policies result in debt growing faster than the economy. This is unsustainable over the long term. Rising debt, relative to economic growth, could increase borrowing costs for both the federal government and private borrowers and could slow economic growth. In addition, delays in raising or suspending the debt limit\u2014the legal limit on the total amount of money that the federal government is authorized to borrow to meet its existing legal obligations\u2014 pose additional risks to the long-term fiscal outlook.2\nMy testimony is based on our prior reports on the nation\u2019s fiscal health and federal debt management. A detailed discussion of the prior reports\u2019 objectives, scope, and methodologies, including our assessment of data reliability, is available in each of the reports cited throughout this statement. The work upon which this testimony is based was conducted in accordance with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance Framework that are relevant to our objectives. The framework requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to meet our stated objectives and to discuss any limitations in our work. We believe that the information and data obtained, and the analysis conducted, provide a reasonable basis for any findings and conclusions in this product.\nError! No text of specified style in document.\nIncreasingly Large Budget Deficits Drive Unsustainable Long- Term Debt Levels\n For most of the nation\u2019s history, the federal government\u2019s debt held by the public as a share of the economy\u2014gross domestic product (GDP)\u2014has increased during wartime and recessions but decreased during peacetime and economic expansions (see fig. 1). For example, publicly held debt as a share of GDP rose significantly during World War II but decreased rapidly in the post-war years. More recently, this pattern has changed and debt held by the public as a share of GDP grew during three of the four most recent economic expansions.\nFigure 1: Debt Held by the Public Projected to Grow Faster Than Gross Domestic Product\n At the end of fiscal year 2022, debt held by the public was about 97 percent of GDP. Debt held by the public is projected to reach its historical high of 106 percent of GDP within 10 years and to continue to grow at an increasing pace. We project that this ratio could reach more than 219 percent of GDP by 2051, absent any changes in revenue and spending policies.\nThe growing debt is a consequence of borrowing to finance increasingly large annual budget deficits. The federal government has run a deficit\u2014 where spending is greater than revenues\u2014in every fiscal year since 2002. Our simulations show that\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n \u2022   Federal program spending (including Social Security and federal health care programs; such as Medicare) increases more than revenue, resulting in the primary deficit\u2014the gap between program spending and revenue;3 and\n\u2022   net interest spending, which primarily represents the federal government\u2019s cost to service its debt, steadily increases over the next 30 years, further widening the total budget deficits.4\nOur simulation shows that by 2051 the primary deficit would be 6.1 percent of GDP, compared to 2.9 percent in 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic). Our simulation also shows that the total budget deficit\u2014 including net interest spending\u2014would reach 14.5 percent of GDP in 2051, up from 4.6 percent in 2019 (see fig. 2).\nFigure 2: Primary Deficit and Total Budget Deficit, Actual, and Projected\nError! No text of specified style in document.\nRising Interest Costs Are a Risk to the Fiscal Outlook\n In recent years, the federal government\u2019s net interest spending has represented a relatively small share of GDP and total federal spending, primarily because interest rates have been relatively low. However, interest rates are projected to rise in the long term, and federal net interest spending is projected to increase. In our simulation, net interest spending would increase steadily over the next 30 years as a share of GDP, total federal spending, and revenue.\nAverage net interest spending was 1.5 percent of GDP over the last 20 years. In our simulation, net interest spending grows from 1.9 percent of GDP in 2022 to 8.4 percent of GDP in 2051, and reaches 24.6 percent of GDP in 2096. Net interest spending was $475 billion in 2022 and is projected to exceed $1 trillion in 2029.\nRecent interest rate increases demonstrate the effects of rates on net interest spending. During fiscal year 2022, interest rates on 10-year Treasury securities rose from 1.48 percent to 3.83 percent. The government\u2019s net interest spending is sensitive to changes in interest rates and depends on the maturities of the Treasury securities issued. As debt held by the public matures, Treasury will have to replace it, potentially at higher interest rates. This refinancing, in turn, would increase the government\u2019s interest costs. Of all Treasury marketable securities held by the public, 28 percent will mature in fiscal year 2023 and 70 percent will mature within 6 years. Treasury may also need to issue more debt to finance new deficits at higher market interest rates. If interest rates rise more than the rates assumed in our simulations it would further increase projected deficits and debt.\nDebt Limit Impasses Disrupt Treasury Markets and Increase Interest Costs\nMany investors accept low interest rates on Treasury securities because they are considered one of the safest assets in the world\u2014they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.5 However, delays in statutorily raising or suspending the debt limit could compromise the perceived safety of Treasury securities. The debt limit is a statutory limit on the total amount of money that the federal government is authorized to borrow\u2014subject to very limited exceptions\u2014to meet its\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n existing legal obligations. 6 The debt limit does not restrict Congress\u2019s ability to pass spending and revenue legislation that affects the level of debt, nor does it otherwise constrain fiscal policy.\nDelays in raising or suspending the debt limit require Treasury to deviate from its normal cash and debt management operations. Such delays have occurred in 12 of the last 13 fiscal years. Treasury must take extraordinary actions to avoid exceeding the debt limit, such as suspending investments to some federal employees\u2019 retirement funds.7\nIf Treasury has exhausted all extraordinary actions and does not have enough cash on hand to meet its financial commitments, it could be forced to delay payments until sufficient funds become available or the debt limit is either statutorily increased or suspended. That is, Treasury might eventually be forced to default on legal debt obligations.\nFailure to raise or suspend the debt limit could force Treasury to delay payments on maturing securities and interest until sufficient funds are available, which would constitute a default. A default could have devastating effects on U.S. and global economies and the public.\nOur work has shown that even without a default, a debt limit impasse can be costly. Uncertainty surrounding raising or suspending the debt limit disrupts financial markets, and may cause investors to require higher interest rates to hedge against the increased risks\u2014a risk premium. Higher interest rates, in turn, increase Treasury\u2019s borrowing costs\u2014even if action is taken in time to pay investors. For example, we found that primarily during the final 10 days of the 2013 debt limit impasse, estimated total increased borrowing costs escalated rapidly.8 We estimated that total increased borrowing costs incurred through \nError! No text of specified style in document.\n September 30, 2014, on securities auctioned by Treasury during the impasse ranged from roughly $38 million to more than $70 million.\nWe were pleased that Congress took action in time to avoid the catastrophic effects of defaulting on the nation\u2019s debt. Failure to timely raise the nation\u2019s debt ceiling would have had dire economic and reputational consequences.\nAction Is Needed to Avoid Debt Limit Impasses and Change the Fiscal Path\nSince 2017, we have stated that a plan is needed to address the government\u2019s fiscal outlook and promote a sustainable fiscal policy\u2014 where government spending and revenue policies cause the debt-to-GDP ratio to be stable or decline over the long term. A long-term plan can provide a cohesive picture of the government\u2019s long-term goals. It can also serve as a mechanism for building consensus around these goals, as well as a road map for achieving them. Our work in recent years has identified several components of an effective fiscal plan for Congress\u2019s consideration.\nIncorporate Well-Designed Fiscal Rules and Targets\nIn September 2020, we suggested that Congress consider including fiscal rules and targets as part of a long-term fiscal plan.9 Fiscal rules and targets can help manage debt by controlling factors such as spending and revenue to meet a deficit or debt-to-GDP target. For example, a primary balance rule would establish a target for the primary deficit or surplus each year. We identified key considerations for the design, implementation, and enforcement of fiscal rules and targets (see fig. 3).\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n Figure 3: Key Considerations for the Design, Implementation, and Enforcement of Fiscal Rules and Targets\nError! No text of specified style in document.\nAssess the Drivers of the Primary Deficit\n To change the long-term fiscal path, policymakers will need to consider policy changes to the entire range of federal activities\u2014both revenue and spending. When decisions about revenue and spending must be made, policymakers should have information about the various policy tools\u2014 mandatory spending, discretionary spending, and tax expenditures, such as deductions and tax credits\u2014in any given area and the ability to compare them.\nDecisions on these policy changes will be difficult. For example, if at the end of 30 years (2022 to 2051) Congress wanted to achieve a debt-to- GDP ratio of 100 percent\u2014about the ratio over the past 3 years\u2014it would need to implement revenue increases or program spending reductions\u2014 or a combination of both\u2014of $34.7 trillion, in present value terms. Those changes equate to increasing projected annual revenues by 23.2 percent or decreasing projected annual program spending by 18.6 percent.\nConsider Alternative Approaches to the Debt Limit\nTo avoid disrupting the Treasury market and increasing borrowing costs and to improve federal debt management, Congress should consider alternative approaches to the debt limit. The 116th and 117th Congresses considered legislation that, if enacted, could have helped avoid debt limit impasses.10 We have identified alternative approaches, each of which has strengths and weaknesses. All approaches would maintain congressional control and oversight of federal borrowing and better align decisions about the level of debt with decisions on spending and revenue at the time those decisions are made.11 We do not endorse a specific option, but have suggested Congress consider such approaches.\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n Alternative approaches to avoid impasses on the debt limit include\n\u2022   linking action on the debt limit to the budget resolution; \u2022   providing the administration with the authority to propose a change in the debt limit that would take effect absent enactment of a joint resolution of disapproval within a specified time frame; or \u2022   delegating broad authority to the administration to borrow as necessary to fund enacted laws.\nChairman Barr, Ranking Member Foster, and Members of the Committee, this concludes my prepared remarks. I look forward to answering any questions you may have.\nGAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments\nIf you or your staff have questions about this testimony, please contact Jeff Arkin, Director, Strategic Issues, at (202) 512-6806 or arkinj@gao.gov.

No text of specified style in document.\n existing legal obligations. 6 The debt limit does not restrict Congress\u2019s ability to pass spending and revenue legislation that affects the level of debt, nor does it otherwise constrain fiscal policy.\nDelays in raising or suspending the debt limit require Treasury to deviate from its normal cash and debt management operations. Such delays have occurred in 12 of the last 13 fiscal years. Treasury must take extraordinary actions to avoid exceeding the debt limit, such as suspending investments to some federal employees\u2019 retirement funds.7\nIf Treasury has exhausted all extraordinary actions and does not have enough cash on hand to meet its financial commitments, it could be forced to delay payments until sufficient funds become available or the debt limit is either statutorily increased or suspended. That is, Treasury might eventually be forced to default on legal debt obligations.\nFailure to raise or suspend the debt limit could force Treasury to delay payments on maturing securities and interest until sufficient funds are available, which would constitute a default. A default could have devastating effects on U.S. and global economies and the public.\nOur work has shown that even without a default, a debt limit impasse can be costly. Uncertainty surrounding raising or suspending the debt limit disrupts financial markets, and may cause investors to require higher interest rates to hedge against the increased risks\u2014a risk premium. Higher interest rates, in turn, increase Treasury\u2019s borrowing costs\u2014even if action is taken in time to pay investors. For example, we found that primarily during the final 10 days of the 2013 debt limit impasse, estimated total increased borrowing costs escalated rapidly.8 We estimated that total increased borrowing costs incurred through \nError! No text of specified style in document.\n September 30, 2014, on securities auctioned by Treasury during the impasse ranged from roughly $38 million to more than $70 million.\nWe were pleased that Congress took action in time to avoid the catastrophic effects of defaulting on the nation\u2019s debt. Failure to timely raise the nation\u2019s debt ceiling would have had dire economic and reputational consequences.\nAction Is Needed to Avoid Debt Limit Impasses and Change the Fiscal Path\nSince 2017, we have stated that a plan is needed to address the government\u2019s fiscal outlook and promote a sustainable fiscal policy\u2014 where government spending and revenue policies cause the debt-to-GDP ratio to be stable or decline over the long term. A long-term plan can provide a cohesive picture of the government\u2019s long-term goals. It can also serve as a mechanism for building consensus around these goals, as well as a road map for achieving them. Our work in recent years has identified several components of an effective fiscal plan for Congress\u2019s consideration.\nIncorporate Well-Designed Fiscal Rules and Targets\nIn September 2020, we suggested that Congress consider including fiscal rules and targets as part of a long-term fiscal plan.9 Fiscal rules and targets can help manage debt by controlling factors such as spending and revenue to meet a deficit or debt-to-GDP target. For example, a primary balance rule would establish a target for the primary deficit or surplus each year. We identified key considerations for the design, implementation, and enforcement of fiscal rules and targets (see fig. 3).\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n Figure 3: Key Considerations for the Design, Implementation, and Enforcement of Fiscal Rules and Targets\nError! No text of specified style in document.\nAssess the Drivers of the Primary Deficit\n To change the long-term fiscal path, policymakers will need to consider policy changes to the entire range of federal activities\u2014both revenue and spending. When decisions about revenue and spending must be made, policymakers should have information about the various policy tools\u2014 mandatory spending, discretionary spending, and tax expenditures, such as deductions and tax credits\u2014in any given area and the ability to compare them.\nDecisions on these policy changes will be difficult. For example, if at the end of 30 years (2022 to 2051) Congress wanted to achieve a debt-to- GDP ratio of 100 percent\u2014about the ratio over the past 3 years\u2014it would need to implement revenue increases or program spending reductions\u2014 or a combination of both\u2014of $34.7 trillion, in present value terms. Those changes equate to increasing projected annual revenues by 23.2 percent or decreasing projected annual program spending by 18.6 percent.\nConsider Alternative Approaches to the Debt Limit\nTo avoid disrupting the Treasury market and increasing borrowing costs and to improve federal debt management, Congress should consider alternative approaches to the debt limit. The 116th and 117th Congresses considered legislation that, if enacted, could have helped avoid debt limit impasses.10 We have identified alternative approaches, each of which has strengths and weaknesses. All approaches would maintain congressional control and oversight of federal borrowing and better align decisions about the level of debt with decisions on spending and revenue at the time those decisions are made.11 We do not endorse a specific option, but have suggested Congress consider such approaches.\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n Alternative approaches to avoid impasses on the debt limit include\n\u2022   linking action on the debt limit to the budget resolution; \u2022   providing the administration with the authority to propose a change in the debt limit that would take effect absent enactment of a joint resolution of disapproval within a specified time frame; or \u2022   delegating broad authority to the administration to borrow as necessary to fund enacted laws.\nChairman Barr, Ranking Member Foster, and Members of the Committee, this concludes my prepared remarks.

No text of specified style in document.\n June 6, 2023\nChairman Barr, Ranking Member Foster, and Members of the Committee:\nThank you for the opportunity to join you today to discuss the nation\u2019s unsustainable fiscal path, the risks posed by debt limit impasses, and actions Congress can take to address these challenges.\nLast month we issued our seventh annual fiscal health report to examine the current fiscal condition of the federal government and its future fiscal path, absent policy changes in revenue and program spending.1 The report highlights long-term projections from GAO and others showing that the balance of current revenue and program spending policies result in debt growing faster than the economy. This is unsustainable over the long term. Rising debt, relative to economic growth, could increase borrowing costs for both the federal government and private borrowers and could slow economic growth. In addition, delays in raising or suspending the debt limit\u2014the legal limit on the total amount of money that the federal government is authorized to borrow to meet its existing legal obligations\u2014 pose additional risks to the long-term fiscal outlook.2\nMy testimony is based on our prior reports on the nation\u2019s fiscal health and federal debt management. A detailed discussion of the prior reports\u2019 objectives, scope, and methodologies, including our assessment of data reliability, is available in each of the reports cited throughout this statement. The work upon which this testimony is based was conducted in accordance with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance Framework that are relevant to our objectives. The framework requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to meet our stated objectives and to discuss any limitations in our work. We believe that the information and data obtained, and the analysis conducted, provide a reasonable basis for any findings and conclusions in this product.\nError! No text of specified style in document.\nIncreasingly Large Budget Deficits Drive Unsustainable Long- Term Debt Levels\n For most of the nation\u2019s history, the federal government\u2019s debt held by the public as a share of the economy\u2014gross domestic product (GDP)\u2014has increased during wartime and recessions but decreased during peacetime and economic expansions (see fig. 1). For example, publicly held debt as a share of GDP rose significantly during World War II but decreased rapidly in the post-war years. More recently, this pattern has changed and debt held by the public as a share of GDP grew during three of the four most recent economic expansions.\nFigure 1: Debt Held by the Public Projected to Grow Faster Than Gross Domestic Product\n At the end of fiscal year 2022, debt held by the public was about 97 percent of GDP. Debt held by the public is projected to reach its historical high of 106 percent of GDP within 10 years and to continue to grow at an increasing pace. We project that this ratio could reach more than 219 percent of GDP by 2051, absent any changes in revenue and spending policies.\nThe growing debt is a consequence of borrowing to finance increasingly large annual budget deficits. The federal government has run a deficit\u2014 where spending is greater than revenues\u2014in every fiscal year since 2002. Our simulations show that\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n \u2022   Federal program spending (including Social Security and federal health care programs; such as Medicare) increases more than revenue, resulting in the primary deficit\u2014the gap between program spending and revenue;3 and\n\u2022   net interest spending, which primarily represents the federal government\u2019s cost to service its debt, steadily increases over the next 30 years, further widening the total budget deficits.4\nOur simulation shows that by 2051 the primary deficit would be 6.1 percent of GDP, compared to 2.9 percent in 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic). Our simulation also shows that the total budget deficit\u2014 including net interest spending\u2014would reach 14.5 percent of GDP in 2051, up from 4.6 percent in 2019 (see fig. 2).\nFigure 2: Primary Deficit and Total Budget Deficit, Actual, and Projected\nError! No text of specified style in document.\nRising Interest Costs Are a Risk to the Fiscal Outlook\n In recent years, the federal government\u2019s net interest spending has represented a relatively small share of GDP and total federal spending, primarily because interest rates have been relatively low. However, interest rates are projected to rise in the long term, and federal net interest spending is projected to increase. In our simulation, net interest spending would increase steadily over the next 30 years as a share of GDP, total federal spending, and revenue.\nAverage net interest spending was 1.5 percent of GDP over the last 20 years. In our simulation, net interest spending grows from 1.9 percent of GDP in 2022 to 8.4 percent of GDP in 2051, and reaches 24.6 percent of GDP in 2096. Net interest spending was $475 billion in 2022 and is projected to exceed $1 trillion in 2029.\nRecent interest rate increases demonstrate the effects of rates on net interest spending. During fiscal year 2022, interest rates on 10-year Treasury securities rose from 1.48 percent to 3.83 percent. The government\u2019s net interest spending is sensitive to changes in interest rates and depends on the maturities of the Treasury securities issued. As debt held by the public matures, Treasury will have to replace it, potentially at higher interest rates. This refinancing, in turn, would increase the government\u2019s interest costs. Of all Treasury marketable securities held by the public, 28 percent will mature in fiscal year 2023 and 70 percent will mature within 6 years. Treasury may also need to issue more debt to finance new deficits at higher market interest rates. If interest rates rise more than the rates assumed in our simulations it would further increase projected deficits and debt.\nDebt Limit Impasses Disrupt Treasury Markets and Increase Interest Costs\nMany investors accept low interest rates on Treasury securities because they are considered one of the safest assets in the world\u2014they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.5 However, delays in statutorily raising or suspending the debt limit could compromise the perceived safety of Treasury securities.

Washington, D.C. 20549\nPriority Open Recommendations: Securities and Exchange Commission\nDear Chair Gensler:\nThe purpose of this letter is to provide an update on the overall status of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) implementation of GAO\u2019s recommendations and to call your continued personal attention to areas where open recommendations should be given high priority.1  In November 2022, we reported that on a government-wide basis, 77 percent of our recommendations made 4 years ago were implemented.2  SEC\u2019s implementation rate for these recommendations was 96 percent. As of June 2023, SEC had three open recommendations. Fully implementing these open recommendations could significantly improve SEC\u2019s operations.\nSince our June 2022 letter, SEC has implemented all three of our open priority recommendations. Specifically, SEC adopted\n\u2022   new performance measures and numerical targets to help assess the effectiveness of its oversight of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA); \u2022   policies and procedures to identify, communicate, and monitor significant findings from its inspections and oversight examinations of FINRA; and \u2022   new policies for identifying and communicating the significance of SEC\u2019s inspection and examination findings to FINRA, as we recommended in 2021.3\nBy taking these steps, SEC will receive the information it needs to better monitor and assess the effectiveness of its reviews of FINRA, better evaluate FINRA\u2019s responses, and more clearly communicate SEC\u2019s concerns to FINRA. Consequently, SEC will be better positioned to protect  investors and maintain efficient markets, and the agency will have greater assurance that FINRA will carry out its regulatory responsibilities.\nWe are adding one new priority recommendation for SEC related to the oversight of blockchain technology. (See enclosure for the recommendation.)\nThe new priority recommendation addresses blockchain technology:\nBlockchain technology. Recent volatility, bankruptcies, and instances of fraud in the crypto asset markets illustrate the harm consumers and investors may face without adequate protections. We recommended the SEC and the other federal financial regulators jointly establish or adapt an existing formal coordination mechanism to identify and address blockchain-related risks. Once implemented, SEC and the other federal financial regulators would be able to collectively identify risks posed by blockchain-related products and services and develop and implement a regulatory response in a timely manner. (See enclosure for the recommendation and actions needed to implement it).\n - - - -\nIn April 2023, we issued our biennial update to our High-Risk List. This list identifies government operations with greater vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. It also identifies the need for transformation to address economy, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges.4  One of our high-risk areas\u2014modernizing the U.S. financial regulatory system\u2014 involves SEC.\nIn addition, several other government-wide high-risk areas also have direct implications for SEC and its operations. These include (1) improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations, (2) improving strategic human capital management, (3) managing federal real property, (4) ensuring the cybersecurity of the nation,5 and (5) government-wide personnel security clearance process.\nWe urge your attention to these government-wide, high-risk  issues as they relate to SEC. Progress on high-risk issues has been possible through the concerted actions and efforts of Congress, the Office of Management and Budget, and the leadership and staff in agencies, including within SEC. In March 2022, we issued a report on key practices to successfully address high-risk areas, which can be a helpful resource as your agency continues to make progress to address high-risk issues.6\nIn addition to your continued attention on these issues, Congress plays a key role in providing oversight and maintaining focus on our recommendations to ensure they are implemented and produce their desired results. Legislation enacted in December 2022 includes a provision for GAO to identify any additional congressional oversight actions that can help agencies implement priority recommendations and address any underlying issues relating to such implementation.7\nThere are various strategies Congress can use in addressing our recommendations, such as incorporating them into legislation. Congress can also use its budget, appropriations, and oversight processes to incentivize agencies to act on our recommendations and monitor their progress. For example, Congress can hold hearings focused on SEC\u2019s progress in implementing GAO\u2019s priority recommendations, withhold funds when appropriate, or take other actions to provide incentives for agencies to act. Moreover, Congress can follow up during the appropriations process and request periodic updates. Congress also plays a key role in addressing any underlying issues related to the implementation of these recommendations. For example, Congress can pass legislation providing SEC explicit authority to implement a recommendation or requiring an agency to take certain actions to implement a recommendation.\nCopies of this report are being sent to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the appropriate congressional committees. In addition, the report will be available on our website at http://www.gao.gov.\nI appreciate SEC\u2019s continued commitment in addressing GAO\u2019s past priority recommendations and SEC\u2019s actions in the government-wide, high-risk issues. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me or Daniel Garcia-Diaz, Managing Director, Financial Markets and Community Investment, at garciadiazd@gao.gov or 202-512-8678.

To facilitate these objectives, this mechanism could include formal planning documents that establish the frequency of meetings and processes for identifying risks and responding to them within agreed-upon time frames.\nAction Needed: SEC neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendation. SEC noted that it has already coordinated through venues including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the President\u2019s Working Group, and some international organizations to identify risks related to crypto assets. However, the regulators\u2019 coordination efforts have not always addressed risks posed by crypto assets in a timely manner.

In addition, the Center may, at its discretion, investigate and resolve allegations of other policy violations, including non-sexual child abuse as well as emotional and physical misconduct.3\nThe Empowering Olympic, Paralympic, and Amateur Athletes Act of 2020 (EOPAAA) made several amendments to the Ted Stevens Act.4 Among other things, the EOPAAA prohibits former employees or board members of the Corporation or a national governing body from  working or volunteering at the Center for 2 years after their departure.5 The act also provides that an executive or attorney for the Center shall be considered to have an inappropriate conflict of interest if the executive or attorney also represents the Corporation or a national governing body.6 In addition, the act prohibits the Corporation and the national governing bodies from interfering in or attempting to influence the outcome of an investigation.7\nThe EOPAAA includes a provision for GAO to annually \u201cmake available to the public a certification relating to the Center\u2019s independence from the Corporation,\u201d including findings of whether:8\n\u2022   a violation of the prohibition on employment of former employees or board members of the Corporation has occurred during the year preceding the certification; \u2022   an executive or attorney for the Center has had an inappropriate conflict of interest during that year; and \u2022   the Corporation has interfered in, or attempted to influence the outcome of, an investigation by the Center.\nIn our third annual report, we examined, during the period of January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022: (1) whether former board members or employees of the Corporation observed the required 2-year cooling-off period before working or volunteering at the Center; (2) whether an executive or attorney for the Center had an inappropriate conflict of interest; and (3) whether the Corporation interfered in, or attempted to influence the outcome of, an investigation by the Center.\nOur certification applies to the Corporation.9 However, we also included information about national governing bodies in our report because the EOPAAA refers to national governing bodies as well as the Corporation in connection with the cooling-off period, the definition of an inappropriate conflict of interest, and the prohibition on interference with Center investigations.\nOur findings in this report are based on our review of information and documents that we obtained from the Center, the Corporation, and national governing bodies.10 Specifically, to examine whether the cooling-off period was observed and whether inappropriate conflicts of interest occurred, we reviewed information provided by the Center about its employees and volunteers (including board members, executives, attorneys, contractors, and other staff) who worked or volunteered for the Center at any point during its fiscal year 2022 (January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022). We reviewed conflict of interest verification forms and associated supplemental statements that the Center requires of all its employees, board and committee members, contractors, outside counsel, and volunteers.11 The form requires disclosure of any current or past employment or association with the Corporation or a national governing body.\nWe also cross-checked the information provided by the Center with information we received from the Corporation and 43 of 52 national governing bodies about their employees.12 For example, we obtained from the Corporation and national governing bodies information about attorneys they employed, hired, or retained, including the dates of representation, among other things. We also received information from the Corporation and national governing bodies about whether, to their knowledge, former employees, including board members, executives, attorneys, employees of contractors, and volunteers, subsequently became involved with the Center after leaving their organizations.\nTo examine whether the Corporation or national governing bodies interfered in, or attempted to influence the outcome of, an investigation, we reviewed the Center\u2019s written responses to questions about how employees, board members, or other representatives of the Corporation or national governing bodies interacted with the Center during its fiscal year 2022. We also reviewed various documents, such as the Center\u2019s employee handbook, bylaws, confidentiality policy, and standard operating procedures. In addition, we reviewed the Center\u2019s SafeSport Code, which establishes acceptable standards of conduct for all individuals who participate in U.S. Olympic and Paralympic events and training. Finally, we reviewed written responses from the Corporation and a random selection of national governing bodies about their communications with the Center regarding allegations and investigations.13\nWe conducted this performance audit from January 2023 to June 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nCertification\nBased on the certification provisions of the EOPAAA and the methodology described above, we certify that the Center was independent from the Corporation during its fiscal year 2022, as described in more detail below.\nObservance of 2-Year Cooling-Off Period for Former Employees and Board Members\nWe found no evidence that a former employee or board member of the Corporation worked for the Center in violation of the cooling-off period during its fiscal year 2022. Specifically, we compared the names of individuals who separated from the Corporation between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2022 with those who worked with the Center during its fiscal year 2022. We found that none of these individuals from the Corporation worked with the Center during 2022. See table 1 for the number of individuals who were employed or worked with the Center during its fiscal year 2022.14\nTable 1. Number of Individuals Who Were Employed, Volunteered, or Worked with the U.S. Center for SafeSport Fiscal Year 2022 (January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022)\nType of Individual Employees Board and committee members Contractors Outside Counsel\nNumber of Individuals 130 21 53 16\nSource: GAO presentation of U.S. Center for SafeSport information.  |  GAO-23-106592 Note: The U.S. Center for SafeSport considers board and committee members to be volunteers.\nThe Center takes multiple steps to ensure its employees and volunteers are aware of and in compliance with the 2-year cooling-off period. For example, when the Center advertises job vacancies it includes language describing the 2-year cooling-off period. Moreover, according to Center officials, the Center\u2019s human resources department conducts reviews of applicants\u2019 resumes and publicly available employment information to ensure all incoming employees are in compliance.\nThe Center also provides employees and volunteers with its conflict of interest policy. According to the policy, a conflict of interest, or potential conflict of interest, exists when an individual\u2019s past, current, or anticipated future activities or interests, including financial interests, interfere with, influence, or have the potential to interfere with or influence the individual\u2019s responsibilities on behalf of the Center or undermine the Center\u2019s interests. In our report on fiscal year 2021 we found that, since July 2019, the Center has required its employees to complete a conflict of interest verification form at the start of employment or engagement with the Center, and, according to Center officials, annually thereafter.15 The form requires disclosure of any current or past employment or association with the Corporation or a national governing body.\nThe Center provided us with copies of conflict of interest verification forms for its employees and other individuals who worked with the Center during its fiscal year 2022. Our review of these forms found that no individuals reported having worked for the Corporation or national governing bodies during the required 2-year cooling-off period. Likewise, our review of information provided by responding national governing bodies found that none reported having employed individuals who subsequently volunteered or worked for the Center during the required 2-year cooling-off period.\nExecutive or Attorney Conflicts of Interest\nWe found no evidence of a conflict of interest, as defined by the EOPAAA, between the Center\u2019s executives or attorneys and the Corporation.16 The Center employed 11 executives and attorneys and retained 16 attorneys as outside counsel from various law firms in that year. No Center executives or attorneys reported representing the Corporation during the relevant period. In addition, we cross-checked the names of every attorney the Corporation employed or retained as outside counsel and did not find any that also represented the Center in its fiscal year 2022. Similarly, with regard to the responding national governing bodies, we identified no conflicts of interest, as defined by the EOPAAA, for the Center\u2019s fiscal year 2022.\nCenter Safeguards to Prevent Interference or Influence in Investigations\nOur review of the Center\u2019s investigative process found no evidence of interference or influence by the Corporation. Center staff reported to us that they were not aware of any attempts by the Corporation to interfere in or influence the outcome of an investigation during the Center\u2019s fiscal year 2022. According to Center staff, the Center expects employees and board members to report to senior staff members within the Center any attempts to interfere in or influence the outcome of an investigation.17\nThe Center has safeguards in place to prevent the Corporation and national governing bodies from interfering in or influencing the outcome of investigations. The SafeSport Code and the Center\u2019s standard operating procedures require the Center to share only limited information about allegations and investigations with the Corporation and national governing bodies. For example, the Center may request basic information from the Corporation and national governing bodies when determining its jurisdiction over a case, such as the names and contact information of individuals and their membership status. The Center may also notify the Corporation or national governing bodies with jurisdiction over individuals about any temporary measures it imposes, such as restrictions on an individual\u2019s eligibility to participate in a sport.18 Such notifications allow the Corporation or national governing bodies to enforce the temporary measures. The Center does not provide, per its policies, detailed information about investigations to the Corporation and national governing bodies. The SafeSport Code also includes language prohibiting the Corporation or national governing body employees, board members, and legal counsel from serving as advisors to individuals participating in the Center\u2019s processes.\nThe Corporation and selected national governing bodies provided information about their communications with the Center related to allegations and investigations. We found that written responses from the Corporation and the responding national governing bodies were consistent with the procedures outlined in the SafeSport Code and the Center\u2019s standard operating procedures. The Corporation and responding national governing bodies reported to us that their interactions with the Center were generally limited to (1) receiving notices from the Center about jurisdiction, temporary measures, or final resolution decisions; or (2) requests from the Center for information about claimants, respondents, or witnesses.19\nIn our report on fiscal year 2021 we found that, in addition to sharing limited information about investigations with the Corporation and national governing bodies, the Center had taken additional steps to prevent the Corporation or national governing bodies from interfering in or influencing the outcome of investigations.20 According to Center staff, they have discussed with employees and board members the provisions of the EOPAAA, including the provision prohibiting the Corporation and national governing bodies from interfering in, or attempting to influence the outcome of, an investigation. Also, the Center revised the SafeSport Code to state that the Corporation and national governing bodies are prohibited from interfering in, attempting to interfere in, or influencing the outcome of the Center\u2019s investigations. The national governing bodies and Corporation received notice of this change in December 2021. Additionally, the Center conducted trainings for the Corporation and national governing bodies on the issue of interference as well as for Center employees and board members on reporting attempts to influence an investigation. According to Center officials, the Center will continue to conduct such trainings in the future. \nThird Party Views\nWe provided excerpts of this report to the Center for review and comment.

In addition, the Center may, at its discretion, investigate and resolve allegations of other policy violations, including non-sexual child abuse as well as emotional and physical misconduct.3\nThe Empowering Olympic, Paralympic, and Amateur Athletes Act of 2020 (EOPAAA) made several amendments to the Ted Stevens Act.4 Among other things, the EOPAAA prohibits former employees or board members of the Corporation or a national governing body from  working or volunteering at the Center for 2 years after their departure.5 The act also provides that an executive or attorney for the Center shall be considered to have an inappropriate conflict of interest if the executive or attorney also represents the Corporation or a national governing body.6 In addition, the act prohibits the Corporation and the national governing bodies from interfering in or attempting to influence the outcome of an investigation.7\nThe EOPAAA includes a provision for GAO to annually \u201cmake available to the public a certification relating to the Center\u2019s independence from the Corporation,\u201d including findings of whether:8\n\u2022   a violation of the prohibition on employment of former employees or board members of the Corporation has occurred during the year preceding the certification; \u2022   an executive or attorney for the Center has had an inappropriate conflict of interest during that year; and \u2022   the Corporation has interfered in, or attempted to influence the outcome of, an investigation by the Center.\nIn our third annual report, we examined, during the period of January 1, 2022, through December 31, 2022: (1) whether former board members or employees of the Corporation observed the required 2-year cooling-off period before working or volunteering at the Center; (2) whether an executive or attorney for the Center had an inappropriate conflict of interest; and (3) whether the Corporation interfered in, or attempted to influence the outcome of, an investigation by the Center.\nOur certification applies to the Corporation.9 However, we also included information about national governing bodies in our report because the EOPAAA refers to national governing bodies as well as the Corporation in connection with the cooling-off period, the definition of an inappropriate conflict of interest, and the prohibition on interference with Center investigations.\nOur findings in this report are based on our review of information and documents that we obtained from the Center, the Corporation, and national governing bodies.10 Specifically, to examine whether the cooling-off period was observed and whether inappropriate conflicts of interest occurred, we reviewed information provided by the Center about its employees and volunteers (including board members, executives, attorneys, contractors, and other staff) who worked or volunteered for the Center at any point during its fiscal year 2022 (January 1, 2022, to December 31, 2022). We reviewed conflict of interest verification forms and associated supplemental statements that the Center requires of all its employees, board and committee members, contractors, outside counsel, and volunteers.11 The form requires disclosure of any current or past employment or association with the Corporation or a national governing body.\nWe also cross-checked the information provided by the Center with information we received from the Corporation and 43 of 52 national governing bodies about their employees.12 For example, we obtained from the Corporation and national governing bodies information about attorneys they employed, hired, or retained, including the dates of representation, among other things. We also received information from the Corporation and national governing bodies about whether, to their knowledge, former employees, including board members, executives, attorneys, employees of contractors, and volunteers, subsequently became involved with the Center after leaving their organizations.\nTo examine whether the Corporation or national governing bodies interfered in, or attempted to influence the outcome of, an investigation, we reviewed the Center\u2019s written responses to questions about how employees, board members, or other representatives of the Corporation or national governing bodies interacted with the Center during its fiscal year 2022. We also reviewed various documents, such as the Center\u2019s employee handbook, bylaws, confidentiality policy, and standard operating procedures. In addition, we reviewed the Center\u2019s SafeSport Code, which establishes acceptable standards of conduct for all individuals who participate in U.S. Olympic and Paralympic events and training. Finally, we reviewed written responses from the Corporation and a random selection of national governing bodies about their communications with the Center regarding allegations and investigations.13\nWe conducted this performance audit from January 2023 to June 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nCertification\nBased on the certification provisions of the EOPAAA and the methodology described above, we certify that the Center was independent from the Corporation during its fiscal year 2022, as described in more detail below.\nObservance of 2-Year Cooling-Off Period for Former Employees and Board Members\nWe found no evidence that a former employee or board member of the Corporation worked for the Center in violation of the cooling-off period during its fiscal year 2022. Specifically, we compared the names of individuals who separated from the Corporation between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2022 with those who worked with the Center during its fiscal year 2022. We found that none of these individuals from the Corporation worked with the Center during 2022. See table 1 for the number of individuals who were employed or worked with the Center during its fiscal year 2022.14\nTable 1. Number of Individuals Who Were Employed, Volunteered, or Worked with the U.S. Center for SafeSport Fiscal Year 2022 (January 1, 2022 to December 31, 2022)\nType of Individual Employees Board and committee members Contractors Outside Counsel\nNumber of Individuals 130 21 53 16\nSource: GAO presentation of U.S. Center for SafeSport information.  |  GAO-23-106592 Note: The U.S. Center for SafeSport considers board and committee members to be volunteers.\nThe Center takes multiple steps to ensure its employees and volunteers are aware of and in compliance with the 2-year cooling-off period. For example, when the Center advertises job vacancies it includes language describing the 2-year cooling-off period. Moreover, according to Center officials, the Center\u2019s human resources department conducts reviews of applicants\u2019 resumes and publicly available employment information to ensure all incoming employees are in compliance.\nThe Center also provides employees and volunteers with its conflict of interest policy. According to the policy, a conflict of interest, or potential conflict of interest, exists when an individual\u2019s past, current, or anticipated future activities or interests, including financial interests, interfere with, influence, or have the potential to interfere with or influence the individual\u2019s responsibilities on behalf of the Center or undermine the Center\u2019s interests. In our report on fiscal year 2021 we found that, since July 2019, the Center has required its employees to complete a conflict of interest verification form at the start of employment or engagement with the Center, and, according to Center officials, annually thereafter.15 The form requires disclosure of any current or past employment or association with the Corporation or a national governing body.\nThe Center provided us with copies of conflict of interest verification forms for its employees and other individuals who worked with the Center during its fiscal year 2022. Our review of these forms found that no individuals reported having worked for the Corporation or national governing bodies during the required 2-year cooling-off period. Likewise, our review of information provided by responding national governing bodies found that none reported having employed individuals who subsequently volunteered or worked for the Center during the required 2-year cooling-off period.\nExecutive or Attorney Conflicts of Interest\nWe found no evidence of a conflict of interest, as defined by the EOPAAA, between the Center\u2019s executives or attorneys and the Corporation.16 The Center employed 11 executives and attorneys and retained 16 attorneys as outside counsel from various law firms in that year. No Center executives or attorneys reported representing the Corporation during the relevant period. In addition, we cross-checked the names of every attorney the Corporation employed or retained as outside counsel and did not find any that also represented the Center in its fiscal year 2022. Similarly, with regard to the responding national governing bodies, we identified no conflicts of interest, as defined by the EOPAAA, for the Center\u2019s fiscal year 2022.\nCenter Safeguards to Prevent Interference or Influence in Investigations\nOur review of the Center\u2019s investigative process found no evidence of interference or influence by the Corporation. Center staff reported to us that they were not aware of any attempts by the Corporation to interfere in or influence the outcome of an investigation during the Center\u2019s fiscal year 2022. According to Center staff, the Center expects employees and board members to report to senior staff members within the Center any attempts to interfere in or influence the outcome of an investigation.17\nThe Center has safeguards in place to prevent the Corporation and national governing bodies from interfering in or influencing the outcome of investigations. The SafeSport Code and the Center\u2019s standard operating procedures require the Center to share only limited information about allegations and investigations with the Corporation and national governing bodies. For example, the Center may request basic information from the Corporation and national governing bodies when determining its jurisdiction over a case, such as the names and contact information of individuals and their membership status. The Center may also notify the Corporation or national governing bodies with jurisdiction over individuals about any temporary measures it imposes, such as restrictions on an individual\u2019s eligibility to participate in a sport.18 Such notifications allow the Corporation or national governing bodies to enforce the temporary measures. The Center does not provide, per its policies, detailed information about investigations to the Corporation and national governing bodies. The SafeSport Code also includes language prohibiting the Corporation or national governing body employees, board members, and legal counsel from serving as advisors to individuals participating in the Center\u2019s processes.\nThe Corporation and selected national governing bodies provided information about their communications with the Center related to allegations and investigations. We found that written responses from the Corporation and the responding national governing bodies were consistent with the procedures outlined in the SafeSport Code and the Center\u2019s standard operating procedures. The Corporation and responding national governing bodies reported to us that their interactions with the Center were generally limited to (1) receiving notices from the Center about jurisdiction, temporary measures, or final resolution decisions; or (2) requests from the Center for information about claimants, respondents, or witnesses.19\nIn our report on fiscal year 2021 we found that, in addition to sharing limited information about investigations with the Corporation and national governing bodies, the Center had taken additional steps to prevent the Corporation or national governing bodies from interfering in or influencing the outcome of investigations.20 According to Center staff, they have discussed with employees and board members the provisions of the EOPAAA, including the provision prohibiting the Corporation and national governing bodies from interfering in, or attempting to influence the outcome of, an investigation. Also, the Center revised the SafeSport Code to state that the Corporation and national governing bodies are prohibited from interfering in, attempting to interfere in, or influencing the outcome of the Center\u2019s investigations. The national governing bodies and Corporation received notice of this change in December 2021. Additionally, the Center conducted trainings for the Corporation and national governing bodies on the issue of interference as well as for Center employees and board members on reporting attempts to influence an investigation. According to Center officials, the Center will continue to conduct such trainings in the future. \nThird Party Views\nWe provided excerpts of this report to the Center for review and comment.

For more information, contact Jessica Farb at (202) 512-7114 or farbj@gao.gov.\nUnited States Government Accountability Office\n Letter\nLetter\n Chairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and Members of the Committee:\nI appreciate the opportunity to be here today to discuss the Health Center Program. As you know, health centers were established to increase the availability of primary and preventive health care services for low-income people living in medically underserved areas. These outpatient facilities receive federal funding and serve as an important safety net provider as the majority of their patients are uninsured or enrolled in Medicaid.\nThe majority of health centers serve the general population within a designated area, while other types of health centers provide care to more specific populations, including the homeless, residents of public housing, and migrant and seasonal farmworkers. Regardless of type, health centers are required to provide health care to individuals who are members of the health center\u2019s target population or to all individuals located in the health center\u2019s service area, regardless of their ability to pay. In some communities, these centers may be the only primary care providers available to certain vulnerable populations. In 2021 nearly 1,400 health centers operated more than 11,000 sites that provided care to more than 30 million people in the United States, including one in five rural residents and one in three living in poverty.\nHealth centers rely on revenue from a variety of public and private sources, including federal, state, and local governments; and payments for services from Medicaid, Medicare, private insurance, and patients. This revenue includes grants awarded by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) through its Health Center Program. In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) established an additional source of funding for the Health Center\nProgram\u2019s grants: the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF).1 The CHCF supports a variety of grants to health centers for health care services for low-income populations.\nMy statement today describes the Health Center Program, trends in health centers\u2019 revenues from 2010 through 2017, and the purposes for which CHCF grants were awarded during our period of analysis. This statement is based on our most recent report on the Health Center Program, which was issued in May 2019, and selected updates.2\nFor our May 2019 report, we analyzed HRSA data collected from health centers and compiled in its Uniform Data System to identify the sources and amounts of revenue health centers received from calendar years 2010 through 2017, the most recent data at the time of our analysis.3 We also reviewed HRSA grant documentation for grants funded by the CHCF for fiscal years 2011-2017\u2014the most recent data at the time of our analysis\u2014including information on the award amount and purpose of the grant, and reviewed some published studies that described the purposes for which CHCF grants have been made. Additionally, we interviewed HRSA officials, authors of the published studies, and an association representing health centers. Our May 2019 report includes a full description of our scope and methodology. In addition, we reviewed some HRSA data from 2021 to provide selected updates to the data we previously reported, such as amount of revenue health centers received and the number of health centers serving patients.\nWe conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nHealth Center Program\nThe federal Health Center Program was established in the mid-1960s in an effort to help low-income individuals gain access to health care services. The Health Center Program, authorized in Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act, is administered by HRSA\u2019s Bureau of Primary Health Care and makes grants\u2014known as Section 330 grants\u2014to four types of health centers that primarily serve low-income populations: mandatory appropriations provided from the CHCF.4 From fiscal years 2010 through 2021, funding appropriated for Section 330 grants\u2014which includes funding from discretionary appropriations and the CHCF\u2014 increased from about $2.1 billion to $5.6 billion. In addition, some COVID- 19 relief acts appropriated supplemental funding for Section 330 grants.5\nHealth centers are required to provide comprehensive primary health services, including preventive, diagnostic, treatment, and emergency health services. (See table 1.) All services that health centers provide must be available to patients at the center regardless of patient payment source or ability to pay and must be available (either directly or under a referral arrangement) to patients at all health center service sites. Services are provided by clinical staff\u2014including physicians, nurses, dentists, and mental health and substance abuse professionals\u2014or through contracts or cooperative arrangements with other providers.\nCategory Supplemental services\nExamples of services provided Additional services that are not primary health services but are appropriate to meet the health needs of the service population, such as behavioral health and environmental health services.a Health centers are not required to provide these services.\nSource: Public Health Services Act. | GAO-23-106664 aBehavioral health services include the services of psychiatrists, psychologists, and other appropriate mental health professionals. Environmental services can include the detection and alleviation of unhealthful conditions associated with water supply and lead exposure, among other things.\nIn addition to the services they provide, health centers are also required to document the unmet health needs of the residents in their service area and to periodically review their service areas to determine whether the services provided are available and accessible to area residents promptly and as appropriate. Health centers also must have a sliding fee scale based on a patient\u2019s ability to pay and generally must be governed by a community board of which at least 51 percent of the members are patients of the health center. HRSA determines whether health center grantees meet these and other health center program requirements when making award determinations.6\nTrends in Health Centers\u2019 Revenue\nOur analysis of HRSA data showed that health centers\u2019 revenue more than doubled from calendar years 2010 through 2017, from about $12.7 billion to $26.3 billion.7 HRSA data also showed over the same time period, the number of health centers increased from 1,124 centers in 2010 to 1,373 centers in 2017. In addition, the number of patients served over the same time period increased by 7.7 million patients, from 19.5 million to 27.2 million. In 2021, there were nearly 1,400 health centers serving more than 30 million patients.\nHealth centers\u2019 revenue comes from a variety of sources, including reimbursements from Medicaid, Medicare, private insurance, and federal and state grants. While total health center revenue increased from 2010 through 2017, the share of revenue from each source changed in different ways. In particular, revenue from federal and state grants decreased from 38.0 percent of total revenue in 2010 to about 30.2 percent of total revenue in 2017 while reimbursements from Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurance increased (see fig.1).8\nFigure 1: Health Center Revenue 2010 and 2017\nNotes: Revenue in the Uniform Data System is defined as the gross receipts on a cash basis for each year collected by health centers, regardless of the period in which the paid for services were rendered. Dollars are nominal. Percentages may not add to 100 due to rounding. aOther revenue includes two categories in the Uniform Data System: (1) other public insurance and (2) non-patient related revenue not reported elsewhere, such as revenue from fund-raising, rent from tenants, medical record fees, and vending machines. bGrants in HRSA\u2019s Uniform Data System include three categories of revenue: (1) Section 330 grants, such as Health Center Program grants; (2) other federal grants, such as Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Record Incentive grants; and (3) non-federal grants or contracts, such as amounts from contracts that are not tied to the delivery of services and amounts received from state and local indigent care programs.\nIn response to earlier increases in program funding, GAO was previously asked to examine HRSA\u2019s oversight of the Community Health Center Program. In our May 2012 report, we made six recommendations for improving oversight such as strengthening HRSA\u2019s ability to consistently identify and cite grantee noncompliance and periodically assessing whether HRSA\u2019s new process for addressing grantee noncompliance was working as intended.9 HRSA implemented all six of our recommendations.\nPurposes of Community Health Center Fund Grants\nGAO\u2019s analysis of HRSA data showed that from fiscal years 2011 through 2017, health centers received approximately $15.8 billion in Section 330 grants funded by the CHCF. Of this total amount, 79.7 percent\u2014or $12.6 billion\u2014was awarded for the purpose of maintaining operations at existing health centers (see fig. 2). According to HRSA officials, these CHCF grants were used to fill the gap between what it cost to operate a health center and the amount of revenue a health center received. As such, officials explained, the awards were a primary means through which health centers provided health care services that may be uncompensated, including services for uninsured patients or services not typically reimbursed by other payers, such as adult dental care. The remaining $3.2 billion in CHCF grants were made to increase the amount of services provided at existing health centers; increase the number of health centers and sites; and support other special initiatives, such as implementing health information technology.\nFigure 2: Total Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Section 330 Grants Funded by the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF), Fiscal Years 2011\u2013 2017\nNotes: Section 330 grants funded by the CHCF are a subset of all Section 330 grants. Percentages may not add to 100 due to rounding. Dollars across fiscal years are nominal.\nIn the coming months, we will be starting an examination of trends in health center funding since our last review, including an assessment of how additional funding provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been used. In addition, we anticipate analyzing the characteristics of the patients health centers serve, among other issues.\nChairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and Members of the Committee, this concludes my statement.

As you know, health centers were established to increase the availability of primary and preventive health care services for low-income people living in medically underserved areas. These outpatient facilities receive federal funding and serve as an important safety net provider as the majority of their patients are uninsured or enrolled in Medicaid.\nThe majority of health centers serve the general population within a designated area, while other types of health centers provide care to more specific populations, including the homeless, residents of public housing, and migrant and seasonal farmworkers. Regardless of type, health centers are required to provide health care to individuals who are members of the health center\u2019s target population or to all individuals located in the health center\u2019s service area, regardless of their ability to pay. In some communities, these centers may be the only primary care providers available to certain vulnerable populations. In 2021 nearly 1,400 health centers operated more than 11,000 sites that provided care to more than 30 million people in the United States, including one in five rural residents and one in three living in poverty.\nHealth centers rely on revenue from a variety of public and private sources, including federal, state, and local governments; and payments for services from Medicaid, Medicare, private insurance, and patients. This revenue includes grants awarded by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) through its Health Center Program. In 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) established an additional source of funding for the Health Center\nProgram\u2019s grants: the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF).1 The CHCF supports a variety of grants to health centers for health care services for low-income populations.\nMy statement today describes the Health Center Program, trends in health centers\u2019 revenues from 2010 through 2017, and the purposes for which CHCF grants were awarded during our period of analysis. This statement is based on our most recent report on the Health Center Program, which was issued in May 2019, and selected updates.2\nFor our May 2019 report, we analyzed HRSA data collected from health centers and compiled in its Uniform Data System to identify the sources and amounts of revenue health centers received from calendar years 2010 through 2017, the most recent data at the time of our analysis.3 We also reviewed HRSA grant documentation for grants funded by the CHCF for fiscal years 2011-2017\u2014the most recent data at the time of our analysis\u2014including information on the award amount and purpose of the grant, and reviewed some published studies that described the purposes for which CHCF grants have been made. Additionally, we interviewed HRSA officials, authors of the published studies, and an association representing health centers. Our May 2019 report includes a full description of our scope and methodology. In addition, we reviewed some HRSA data from 2021 to provide selected updates to the data we previously reported, such as amount of revenue health centers received and the number of health centers serving patients.\nWe conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nHealth Center Program\nThe federal Health Center Program was established in the mid-1960s in an effort to help low-income individuals gain access to health care services. The Health Center Program, authorized in Section 330 of the Public Health Service Act, is administered by HRSA\u2019s Bureau of Primary Health Care and makes grants\u2014known as Section 330 grants\u2014to four types of health centers that primarily serve low-income populations: mandatory appropriations provided from the CHCF.4 From fiscal years 2010 through 2021, funding appropriated for Section 330 grants\u2014which includes funding from discretionary appropriations and the CHCF\u2014 increased from about $2.1 billion to $5.6 billion. In addition, some COVID- 19 relief acts appropriated supplemental funding for Section 330 grants.5\nHealth centers are required to provide comprehensive primary health services, including preventive, diagnostic, treatment, and emergency health services. (See table 1.) All services that health centers provide must be available to patients at the center regardless of patient payment source or ability to pay and must be available (either directly or under a referral arrangement) to patients at all health center service sites. Services are provided by clinical staff\u2014including physicians, nurses, dentists, and mental health and substance abuse professionals\u2014or through contracts or cooperative arrangements with other providers.\nCategory Supplemental services\nExamples of services provided Additional services that are not primary health services but are appropriate to meet the health needs of the service population, such as behavioral health and environmental health services.a Health centers are not required to provide these services.\nSource: Public Health Services Act. | GAO-23-106664 aBehavioral health services include the services of psychiatrists, psychologists, and other appropriate mental health professionals. Environmental services can include the detection and alleviation of unhealthful conditions associated with water supply and lead exposure, among other things.\nIn addition to the services they provide, health centers are also required to document the unmet health needs of the residents in their service area and to periodically review their service areas to determine whether the services provided are available and accessible to area residents promptly and as appropriate. Health centers also must have a sliding fee scale based on a patient\u2019s ability to pay and generally must be governed by a community board of which at least 51 percent of the members are patients of the health center. HRSA determines whether health center grantees meet these and other health center program requirements when making award determinations.6\nTrends in Health Centers\u2019 Revenue\nOur analysis of HRSA data showed that health centers\u2019 revenue more than doubled from calendar years 2010 through 2017, from about $12.7 billion to $26.3 billion.7 HRSA data also showed over the same time period, the number of health centers increased from 1,124 centers in 2010 to 1,373 centers in 2017. In addition, the number of patients served over the same time period increased by 7.7 million patients, from 19.5 million to 27.2 million. In 2021, there were nearly 1,400 health centers serving more than 30 million patients.\nHealth centers\u2019 revenue comes from a variety of sources, including reimbursements from Medicaid, Medicare, private insurance, and federal and state grants. While total health center revenue increased from 2010 through 2017, the share of revenue from each source changed in different ways. In particular, revenue from federal and state grants decreased from 38.0 percent of total revenue in 2010 to about 30.2 percent of total revenue in 2017 while reimbursements from Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurance increased (see fig.1).8\nFigure 1: Health Center Revenue 2010 and 2017\nNotes: Revenue in the Uniform Data System is defined as the gross receipts on a cash basis for each year collected by health centers, regardless of the period in which the paid for services were rendered. Dollars are nominal. Percentages may not add to 100 due to rounding. aOther revenue includes two categories in the Uniform Data System: (1) other public insurance and (2) non-patient related revenue not reported elsewhere, such as revenue from fund-raising, rent from tenants, medical record fees, and vending machines. bGrants in HRSA\u2019s Uniform Data System include three categories of revenue: (1) Section 330 grants, such as Health Center Program grants; (2) other federal grants, such as Medicare and Medicaid Electronic Health Record Incentive grants; and (3) non-federal grants or contracts, such as amounts from contracts that are not tied to the delivery of services and amounts received from state and local indigent care programs.\nIn response to earlier increases in program funding, GAO was previously asked to examine HRSA\u2019s oversight of the Community Health Center Program. In our May 2012 report, we made six recommendations for improving oversight such as strengthening HRSA\u2019s ability to consistently identify and cite grantee noncompliance and periodically assessing whether HRSA\u2019s new process for addressing grantee noncompliance was working as intended.9 HRSA implemented all six of our recommendations.\nPurposes of Community Health Center Fund Grants\nGAO\u2019s analysis of HRSA data showed that from fiscal years 2011 through 2017, health centers received approximately $15.8 billion in Section 330 grants funded by the CHCF. Of this total amount, 79.7 percent\u2014or $12.6 billion\u2014was awarded for the purpose of maintaining operations at existing health centers (see fig. 2). According to HRSA officials, these CHCF grants were used to fill the gap between what it cost to operate a health center and the amount of revenue a health center received. As such, officials explained, the awards were a primary means through which health centers provided health care services that may be uncompensated, including services for uninsured patients or services not typically reimbursed by other payers, such as adult dental care. The remaining $3.2 billion in CHCF grants were made to increase the amount of services provided at existing health centers; increase the number of health centers and sites; and support other special initiatives, such as implementing health information technology.\nFigure 2: Total Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Section 330 Grants Funded by the Community Health Center Fund (CHCF), Fiscal Years 2011\u2013 2017\nNotes: Section 330 grants funded by the CHCF are a subset of all Section 330 grants. Percentages may not add to 100 due to rounding. Dollars across fiscal years are nominal.\nIn the coming months, we will be starting an examination of trends in health center funding since our last review, including an assessment of how additional funding provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been used. In addition, we anticipate analyzing the characteristics of the patients health centers serve, among other issues.\nChairman Sanders, Ranking Member Cassidy, and Members of the Committee, this concludes my statement.

The Congressional Award Act established the Congressional Award Board to carry out a program to promote excellence among the nation\u2019s youth in the areas of public service, personal development, physical fitness, and expedition or exploration.1 The Board created the Foundation as a nonprofit corporation to assist in carrying out this program.2 The Congressional Award Act, as amended by the Government Reports Elimination Act of 2014, requires the Foundation to obtain an annual financial statement audit from an independent public accountant (IPA).3 The act includes a provision for GAO to review the audit of the Foundation\u2019s financial statements and report the results to the Congress annually.4\nThe Foundation received an unmodified opinion on its fiscal years 2022 and 2021 financial statements.5 The IPA found the Foundation\u2019s financial statements presented fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Foundation and the results of its activities and its cash flows in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The IPA also reported for fiscal year 2022 that it did not identify any (1) deficiencies it considered to be material weaknesses6 in the Foundation\u2019s internal control over financial reporting or (2) instances of noncompliance or other matters that are required to be reported under U.S.  generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS).7 In addition, the IPA reported it conducted its audit and prepared its report in accordance with GAGAS. The Foundation concurred with the IPA\u2019s conclusions.\nObjective, Scope, and Methodology\nOur objective was to review the Foundation\u2019s fiscal year 2022 financial statement audit in order to identify any significant issues we believe require attention. To satisfy this objective, we performed the following procedures:\n\u2022  We read and considered the following with respect to the IPA\u2019s independence, objectivity, and qualifications:\n\u2022   the results of the IPA\u2019s most recent peer review,8 dated July 22, 2020, which indicated a \u201cpass\u201d rating;9 \u2022  the IPA\u2019s certification of independence; \u2022  the engagement letter between the IPA and the Foundation that described the respective responsibilities of both parties, set forth the scope and objectives of the audit service, and referenced the professional standards governing the conduct of the engagement; \u2022   r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of key audit team members; and \u2022   documentation related to the continuing professional education of the IPA staff members assigned to the audit.\n\u2022  We analyzed key audit documentation focusing on (1) the summary planning documents, including the IPA\u2019s assessment of the risk of material misstatement in the Foundation\u2019s financial statements; (2) the audit procedures developed in response to this assessment; and (3) the audit completion documents summarizing the results and conclusions the IPA reached.\n\u2022  We read the Foundation\u2019s fiscal years 2022 and 2021 financial statements, the IPA\u2019s audit report on the Foundation\u2019s financial statements, and the IPA\u2019s report on internal control over financial reporting and on compliance and other matters based on its audit. \n\u2022  We also discussed matters pertinent to our objective with IPA representatives and Foundation management officials.\nOur review of the Foundation\u2019s fiscal year 2022 financial statement audit, as differentiated from an audit of the financial statements, was not intended to enable us to express, and we do not express, an opinion on the Foundation\u2019s financial statements or conclude on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Furthermore, we do not express an opinion on the Foundation\u2019s compliance with provisions of applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and grant agreements. The IPA is responsible for its reports on the Foundation dated March 31, 2023, and the conclusions expressed therein.\nWe conducted this performance audit from February 2023 to June 2023 in accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objective. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objective.\nNo Significant Issues Identified Related to the Foundation\u2019s Fiscal Year 2022 Financial Statement Audit\nBased on the limited procedures we performed in reviewing the IPA\u2019s audit of the Foundation\u2019s fiscal year 2022 financial statements, we did not identify any significant issues we believe require attention. Had we performed additional procedures, other matters might have come to our attention that we would have reported.\nAgency Comments and Third-Party Views\nWe provided a draft of this report to the Foundation and the IPA for review and comment. The Foundation\u2019s National Director and the Foundation\u2019s Audit Committee Chair responded in an email that they were pleased that GAO found no significant issues related to the audit. The IPA\u2019s Audit Principal responded in an email that the IPA had no comments in regard to our report.\n- - - - -\nWe are sending copies of this report to the National Director of the Congressional Award Foundation, the Chair of the Congressional Award Board\u2019s Audit Committee, and other interested parties.

Practitioners believe these therapies have the potential to revolutionize patient care and improve lives. Regenerative medicine and other advanced therapies include cell, gene, and tissue- based therapies.1 The goal of these therapies is to repair or replace damaged human cells, tissues, or organs to supplement or restore function, by going beyond existing medical treatments to address the underlying causes of disease or provide cures for previously untreatable diseases and conditions.\nOver the years, technologies for the development of these therapies have advanced significantly. Research and development for such technologies includes, for example, new ways to engineer tissue-based therapies. As of December 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 26 regenerative medicine and advanced therapies.2 In 2019, a  former FDA commissioner predicted FDA could approve 10 to 20 such therapies annually by 2025.3 The promise of new, approved regenerative medicine and advanced therapies to ameliorate and cure previously untreatable diseases and conditions depends, in part, on the existence of a robust, well-trained workforce.\nWithin the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and FDA have responsibilities for regenerative medicine and advanced therapy development and oversight. NIH funds scientific regenerative medicine and advanced cell, gene, and tissue research, while FDA reviews, approves, and regulates the development and marketing of therapies for which research and development has been successful.4 From fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2021 (the most recent complete fiscal year of data available), NIH provided close to $7 billion in funds for regenerative medicine research.5 Neither FDA nor NIH has responsibility for ensuring the sufficiency of this workforce.\nThe Timely ReAuthorization of Necessary Stem-cell Programs Lends Access to Needed Therapies (TRANSPLANT) Act of 2021 included a provision for GAO to study the regenerative medicine and advanced therapies workforce in the commercial and academic sectors.6 This report provides information on specific to this workforce.9 We also conducted a simple key word search on a national online job search site to corroborate and expand on workforce information provided by our eight stakeholders.\nTo provide information on education and training for the regenerative medicine and advanced therapies workforce, we interviewed FDA and NIH officials, as well as representatives from the eight selected stakeholder organizations, and reviewed related science and technology reports as cited above. Similar to workforce data, based on consultation with the Department of Education and the Association of American Medical Colleges, we determined that existing federal and national education data are not specific to regenerative medicine and advanced therapies.10\nTo provide information on current and future workforce and education and training needs, we interviewed the same federal officials and eight stakeholder organizations. Information obtained from stakeholder organizations is intended to be illustrative and does not represent the perspectives of all individuals and organizations in this field.\nWe conducted this performance audit from May 2022 to March 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nBackground\nRegenerative medicine and advanced therapies are used to treat patients with a wide range of diseases and conditions across numerous fields. Current FDA-approved therapies are for the treatment or correction of certain hematological, oncological, dermatological, ophthalmological, dental, immunological, orthopedic, and neurological diseases and conditions. For example, patients with certain types of leukemia, lymphoma, and other types of cancer may undergo chemotherapy to kill the cancerous cells in their bone marrow and then receive healthy, blood- forming cells through one of FDA\u2019s approved bone marrow transplant therapies. Other types of approved therapies aim to provoke an immune response, such as gene-edited cellular therapies that modulate patients\u2019 immune systems to attack cancerous tumors, or help rebuild tissues, such as a tissue-engineered therapy to repair knee cartilage. As such, the regenerative medicine and advanced therapies workforce encompasses individuals responsible for the research, development, and biomanufacturing of such therapies for eventual marketing approval by FDA, as well as the clinicians and technicians responsible for administering these therapies to patients across these varied medical fields.\nAdvanced Therapies and Biomanufacturing\nCell and gene therapies use cells either from a patient\u2019s own body or from a donor to treat disease. These therapies use naturally occurring, reprogrammed, or genetically modified cells, including stem cells, immune system cells, and other types of cells, to grow, replace, or repair diseased or damaged ones to help treat or cure disease. Gene therapies also include therapies that deliver genetic material to cells using viral or other vectors, to change how proteins are used by cells. Tissue-based therapies combine cells and biologically compatible materials from natural or artificial sources (e.g., animal tissues or polyethylene plastic) that serve as structural scaffolds into a single product to restore or strengthen damaged tissue. Biomanufacturing for regenerative medicine and advanced therapies requires: collecting biological materials, such as cells or tissues from patients or donors; altering and testing such materials for safety, sterility, and efficacy; and packaging and delivering the therapies to clinical care sites for patient administration. Currently, biomanufacturing is primarily conducted manually in small batches in laboratories. In the longer term, biomanufacturers aim to produce versions of existing and developing cell and tissue therapies in larger quantities, which may significantly increase accessibility and reduce the cost of such therapies. This future state necessitates the development of standards, equipment, and automated processes to make biomanufacturing scalable, consistent, and stable.\nSource: GAO.  |  GAO-23-106030\nThe process for bringing new regenerative medicine and advanced therapies to the market generally takes years. For a therapy to be considered for marketing approval by FDA, commercial and academic developers of such therapies must carry out numerous activities across research and development, biomanufacturing, clinical care, and regulatory affairs.\n\u2022   Research and development activities include preclinical testing for safety and effectiveness. \u2022   Biomanufacturing activities include the production of therapies using living cells and testing these therapies on human subjects.11\n\u2022   Clinical care activities include assessing patients for suitability of treatment with such therapies, administering the therapies, and assessing patient outcomes. \u2022   Regulatory affairs activities include navigating the federal regulatory process and submitting the necessary applications, results of toxicity and safety testing, and other required information and data, to FDA.\nThe Regenerative Medicine and Advanced Therapies Workforce Is Wide-\nThe regenerative medicine and advanced therapies workforce is generally reflective of the larger life sciences workforce. As such, individuals working in the regenerative medicine and advanced therapies field occupy a wide range of jobs across research and development, biomanufacturing, clinical care, and regulatory affairs activities. For example,\nRanging and Interdisciplinary\n\u2022   Research and development occupations may include research physicians, cell therapy scientists (including biologists, chemists, and immunologists), data scientists, and laboratory technicians, among others.12 These individuals may work in academic medical centers or in commercial companies, such as pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies.\n\u2022   Biomanufacturing occupations may include manufacturing associates, cell therapy process development engineers, quality control associates, and technical sales specialists, among others.13\n\u2022   Clinical care occupations may include physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, phlebotomists, and transplantation surgeons, among others.14\n\u2022   Regulatory occupations may include regulatory consultants, clinical pharmacologists, and others who are responsible for ensuring that manufacturers meet FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements for new therapies. These occupations may be the same as or similar to those in research and development and biomanufacturing. According to some of our stakeholders, many of these occupations\u2014such as data scientists, various technicians, physicians, and regulatory consultants\u2014may be needed across the product development and clinical care activities.\nSee figure 1 for an illustrative example of the activities and occupations that correspond to the four broad occupational categories for one FDA- approved advanced therapy.15 See appendix I for more detailed information on activities and occupations for this cell therapy.\nFigure 1: Sample Activities and Occupations for Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cell Therapy by Occupation Category\nNote: This CAR T cell workforce figure is intended to serve as an illustrative example of the range of activities and occupations across the four categories of therapy development we use for this report. As an illustrative example, this figure may not be a complete rendering of all activities and occupations that are involved. The occupation examples are not intended to align with the order of activity examples. aTranslational scientists take discoveries made in the laboratory, clinic, or field and transform them into new treatments and approaches that help improve the health of the population. bBiomanufacturing activities include the production of therapies using living cells.\nOccupations Require Postsecondary Biological Science or Additional Specialized Training\nIndividuals working with regenerative medicine and advanced therapies would need postsecondary education and degrees appropriate to their area of work.16 That is, researchers and related occupations would need science- and engineering-based degrees, and clinical occupations would need clinical and professional degrees. Specifically, Clinical Degrees and \u2022   Research and development and biomanufacturing occupations generally require certificates or associate, undergraduate, or postgraduate degrees in biological sciences and biological engineering, among others. \u2022   Clinical care occupations generally require medical, nursing, or related clinical or professional degrees. \u2022   Regulatory affairs occupations require either life sciences degrees like those working in research and development and biomanufacturing, or clinical or professional degrees like those in clinical care, including pharmacology, in order to navigate the FDA approval process. Further, according to many of our eight selected stakeholders, workers in many regenerative medicine and advanced therapy occupations would likely need additional specialized training, such as on-the-job training in laboratory techniques, or medical fellowships in topics and practices specific to the field. For example, laboratory technicians assisting with research and development of stem cell cancer therapies would need training on how to conduct human leukocyte antigen typing to match bone marrow donors and recipients. For CAR T cell cancer therapies, laboratory technicians assisting with research and development would need additional specialized knowledge and training on editing the genes of the cells.\nRegenerative medicine biomanufacturing technicians would need training in current good manufacturing practices, and additional training may be needed for technicians working on specific types of therapies. For example, biomanufacturing technicians would need additional specialized knowledge and training on maintaining current good manufacturing and tissue practices for growing tissue using scaffolds.17 There may be other nuanced differences in education and training for similarly titled occupations in the field depending on research, manufacturing, and clinical care needs of each therapy.\nVarious entities, such as academic medical centers, industry associations, and the federal government offer internships or continuing professional education for this workforce. For example, workers may participate in continuing professional education opportunities, such as conferences and webinars, to maintain proficiency and keep current on advances in the field. Other opportunities, such as internships and fellowships, may provide more intensive training, such as for individuals in their early careers. See Table 1 for examples of internships and fellowships for which agency officials and stakeholders provided information.18\nProvider/sponsor FDA-NIH Interagency Oncology Task Force Fellowship GROW Internship\nDescription This fellowship trains scientists to build awareness of regulatory requirements into early stages of medical product development, and develop strategies to improve planning throughout research and regulatory review. This fellowship has four tracks: three oncology product research and review tracks for (1) concurrent NIH hematology/oncology fellows, (2) physicians board-certified in oncology, and (3) postdoctoral research fellows; and a fourth cancer prevention product and review track for doctoral-level individuals. Alliance for Regenerative Medicine    The GROW (GeneRating Diversity and Opportunity Within Regenerative Medicine) internship is a summer program that provides early career paid opportunities in the regenerative medicine sector to Black or African American undergraduates, graduating seniors, and graduate students.\nSource: GAO analysis of information from Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and our selected stakeholders. | GAO-23-106030\nStakeholders Noted Current Shortages of\nSkilled Technicians and a Need for Additional Education for the Future\nWorkforce\nStakeholders Identified Current Shortages of Skilled Laboratory and Manufacturing Technicians and Others\nMany of the stakeholders we interviewed discussed shortages in either the number of current and projected laboratory technicians or the number of biomanufacturing technicians needed to support the development of regenerative medicine and advanced therapies. For example, some stakeholders cited a lack of technicians with the specialized skills and experience to conduct laboratory research activities, such as developing assays and conducting flow cytometry and mass spectrometry.19 These stakeholders noted that the small number of 2-year biotechnology degree or certificate programs contributes to this shortage. Because of the lack of individuals with this educational background, some stakeholders said individuals with higher levels of education than may be necessary\u2014such as bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degrees\u2013were working in these roles, which tend to require repetitive manual work. This practice leads to high turnover, as staff with more advanced degrees seek to further their research and development careers. Academic medical institutions\u2019 inability to compete with salaries and benefit packages offered by commercial companies that conduct similar research is a contributing factor to technician shortages and high turnover, according to one stakeholder.\nStakeholders also identified workforce shortages and gaps in other specialized positions. For example, many stakeholders noted that there is a lack of quality control or quality assurance associates and data scientists who can work with large data sets. In addition, stakeholders noted shortages of individuals who have knowledge of and experience with FDA regulations, individuals with master\u2019s degrees who can manage both the scientific and operational/managerial sides of biomanufacturing, technicians with education or experience in clean room manufacturing and good manufacturing practices, and nurses and medical technologists who provide post-transplant care with education and training in assessing cell viability.20 However, the lack of federal or national data specific to the regenerative medicine and advanced therapies workforce limits comprehensive analyses of workforce capacity and identification of potential gaps specific to this field.\nRepresentatives from two stakeholder groups we spoke with said their organizations have conducted regenerative medicine and advanced therapies workforce assessments. For example, the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine published a workforce assessment in March 2023.21 The Forum on Regenerative Medicine\u2014a forum of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (National Academies)\u2014convened a public workshop to discuss workforce issues in November 2022, and is expected release a report of the proceedings in spring 2023.\nStakeholders Identified the Need for Additional Education to Help Ensure a Sufficient Workforce for the Future\nSome stakeholders noted that vocational education for skilled laboratory and manufacturing technicians at the community and technical college level is insufficient to meet current and future workforce needs. In addition, many stakeholders noted that no nationally recognized regenerative medicine and advanced therapies education curriculum currently exists for either scientific or clinical and professional degrees.22 For example, a representative from one stakeholder group told us that, of the approximately 200 community and technical colleges in Georgia, only four offer certificate programs or associate\u2019s degrees in biotechnology. In addition, a search of the Department of Education\u2019s College Navigator shows that only 73 institutions offer certificate programs or associate degrees in biotechnology, which is about 7 percent of the 1,043 public, tribal, and independent community colleges in the U.S. in 2022, according to the American Association of Community Colleges.\nSome stakeholders we spoke with suggested the need to establish additional technical and other education programs to meet future workforce needs. They identified particular subjects a regenerative medicine-based curriculum should include for such programs, primarily in two of the four broad categories we identified\u2014research and development and biomanufacturing. For example, one stakeholder group emphasized that education for this field needs to include active practice with laboratory and manufacturing equipment and in such environments, in addition to classroom learning.\nSome stakeholders noted that additional education programs should include subjects consistent with technologies and processes for therapies that are FDA-approved or on a path toward regulatory approval, so that such programs are developed in line with industry needs. Such programs should also include education on good manufacturing practices, quality assurance, and regulatory requirements. Many stakeholders also noted such programs should include education on data science, especially as the field anticipates moving toward larger-scale, more automated manufacturing.23 One stakeholder group suggested that certificate programs could also provide the education individuals would need to carry out laboratory techniques, especially for individuals who may be changing careers.24\nOne stakeholder group noted that some organizations were working to develop curricula for regenerative medicine and advanced therapies education. This stakeholder group suggested that such a curriculum could be franchised across colleges as well as industry, which might minimize the need for on-the-job training. In addition, this group noted establishing additional 2-year certificate or degree programs based on such a curriculum would also make such programs available to more diverse communities, thereby increasing workforce diversity. This stakeholder group agreed that consensus on a core curriculum that reflects the diverse, interdisciplinary nature of regenerative medicine and advanced therapies would help clarify the education and training needs for a competent, robust workforce.\nAgency Comments\nWe provided a copy of the draft report to HHS for review and comment.

For example,\nRanging and Interdisciplinary\n\u2022   Research and development occupations may include research physicians, cell therapy scientists (including biologists, chemists, and immunologists), data scientists, and laboratory technicians, among others.12 These individuals may work in academic medical centers or in commercial companies, such as pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies.\n\u2022   Biomanufacturing occupations may include manufacturing associates, cell therapy process development engineers, quality control associates, and technical sales specialists, among others.13\n\u2022   Clinical care occupations may include physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, phlebotomists, and transplantation surgeons, among others.14\n\u2022   Regulatory occupations may include regulatory consultants, clinical pharmacologists, and others who are responsible for ensuring that manufacturers meet FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements for new therapies. These occupations may be the same as or similar to those in research and development and biomanufacturing. According to some of our stakeholders, many of these occupations\u2014such as data scientists, various technicians, physicians, and regulatory consultants\u2014may be needed across the product development and clinical care activities.\nSee figure 1 for an illustrative example of the activities and occupations that correspond to the four broad occupational categories for one FDA- approved advanced therapy.15 See appendix I for more detailed information on activities and occupations for this cell therapy.\nFigure 1: Sample Activities and Occupations for Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cell Therapy by Occupation Category\nNote: This CAR T cell workforce figure is intended to serve as an illustrative example of the range of activities and occupations across the four categories of therapy development we use for this report. As an illustrative example, this figure may not be a complete rendering of all activities and occupations that are involved. The occupation examples are not intended to align with the order of activity examples. aTranslational scientists take discoveries made in the laboratory, clinic, or field and transform them into new treatments and approaches that help improve the health of the population. bBiomanufacturing activities include the production of therapies using living cells.\nOccupations Require Postsecondary Biological Science or Additional Specialized Training\nIndividuals working with regenerative medicine and advanced therapies would need postsecondary education and degrees appropriate to their area of work.16 That is, researchers and related occupations would need science- and engineering-based degrees, and clinical occupations would need clinical and professional degrees. Specifically, Clinical Degrees and \u2022   Research and development and biomanufacturing occupations generally require certificates or associate, undergraduate, or postgraduate degrees in biological sciences and biological engineering, among others. \u2022   Clinical care occupations generally require medical, nursing, or related clinical or professional degrees. \u2022   Regulatory affairs occupations require either life sciences degrees like those working in research and development and biomanufacturing, or clinical or professional degrees like those in clinical care, including pharmacology, in order to navigate the FDA approval process. Further, according to many of our eight selected stakeholders, workers in many regenerative medicine and advanced therapy occupations would likely need additional specialized training, such as on-the-job training in laboratory techniques, or medical fellowships in topics and practices specific to the field. For example, laboratory technicians assisting with research and development of stem cell cancer therapies would need training on how to conduct human leukocyte antigen typing to match bone marrow donors and recipients. For CAR T cell cancer therapies, laboratory technicians assisting with research and development would need additional specialized knowledge and training on editing the genes of the cells.\nRegenerative medicine biomanufacturing technicians would need training in current good manufacturing practices, and additional training may be needed for technicians working on specific types of therapies. For example, biomanufacturing technicians would need additional specialized knowledge and training on maintaining current good manufacturing and tissue practices for growing tissue using scaffolds.17 There may be other nuanced differences in education and training for similarly titled occupations in the field depending on research, manufacturing, and clinical care needs of each therapy.\nVarious entities, such as academic medical centers, industry associations, and the federal government offer internships or continuing professional education for this workforce. For example, workers may participate in continuing professional education opportunities, such as conferences and webinars, to maintain proficiency and keep current on advances in the field. Other opportunities, such as internships and fellowships, may provide more intensive training, such as for individuals in their early careers. See Table 1 for examples of internships and fellowships for which agency officials and stakeholders provided information.18\nProvider/sponsor FDA-NIH Interagency Oncology Task Force Fellowship GROW Internship\nDescription This fellowship trains scientists to build awareness of regulatory requirements into early stages of medical product development, and develop strategies to improve planning throughout research and regulatory review.

For example, some stakeholders cited a lack of technicians with the specialized skills and experience to conduct laboratory research activities, such as developing assays and conducting flow cytometry and mass spectrometry.19 These stakeholders noted that the small number of 2-year biotechnology degree or certificate programs contributes to this shortage. Because of the lack of individuals with this educational background, some stakeholders said individuals with higher levels of education than may be necessary\u2014such as bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degrees\u2013were working in these roles, which tend to require repetitive manual work. This practice leads to high turnover, as staff with more advanced degrees seek to further their research and development careers. Academic medical institutions\u2019 inability to compete with salaries and benefit packages offered by commercial companies that conduct similar research is a contributing factor to technician shortages and high turnover, according to one stakeholder.\nStakeholders also identified workforce shortages and gaps in other specialized positions. For example, many stakeholders noted that there is a lack of quality control or quality assurance associates and data scientists who can work with large data sets. In addition, stakeholders noted shortages of individuals who have knowledge of and experience with FDA regulations, individuals with master\u2019s degrees who can manage both the scientific and operational/managerial sides of biomanufacturing, technicians with education or experience in clean room manufacturing and good manufacturing practices, and nurses and medical technologists who provide post-transplant care with education and training in assessing cell viability.20 However, the lack of federal or national data specific to the regenerative medicine and advanced therapies workforce limits comprehensive analyses of workforce capacity and identification of potential gaps specific to this field.\nRepresentatives from two stakeholder groups we spoke with said their organizations have conducted regenerative medicine and advanced therapies workforce assessments. For example, the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine published a workforce assessment in March 2023.21 The Forum on Regenerative Medicine\u2014a forum of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (National Academies)\u2014convened a public workshop to discuss workforce issues in November 2022, and is expected release a report of the proceedings in spring 2023.\nStakeholders Identified the Need for Additional Education to Help Ensure a Sufficient Workforce for the Future\nSome stakeholders noted that vocational education for skilled laboratory and manufacturing technicians at the community and technical college level is insufficient to meet current and future workforce needs. In addition, many stakeholders noted that no nationally recognized regenerative medicine and advanced therapies education curriculum currently exists for either scientific or clinical and professional degrees.22 For example, a representative from one stakeholder group told us that, of the approximately 200 community and technical colleges in Georgia, only four offer certificate programs or associate\u2019s degrees in biotechnology. In addition, a search of the Department of Education\u2019s College Navigator shows that only 73 institutions offer certificate programs or associate degrees in biotechnology, which is about 7 percent of the 1,043 public, tribal, and independent community colleges in the U.S. in 2022, according to the American Association of Community Colleges.\nSome stakeholders we spoke with suggested the need to establish additional technical and other education programs to meet future workforce needs. They identified particular subjects a regenerative medicine-based curriculum should include for such programs, primarily in two of the four broad categories we identified\u2014research and development and biomanufacturing. For example, one stakeholder group emphasized that education for this field needs to include active practice with laboratory and manufacturing equipment and in such environments, in addition to classroom learning.\nSome stakeholders noted that additional education programs should include subjects consistent with technologies and processes for therapies that are FDA-approved or on a path toward regulatory approval, so that such programs are developed in line with industry needs. Such programs should also include education on good manufacturing practices, quality assurance, and regulatory requirements. Many stakeholders also noted such programs should include education on data science, especially as the field anticipates moving toward larger-scale, more automated manufacturing.23 One stakeholder group suggested that certificate programs could also provide the education individuals would need to carry out laboratory techniques, especially for individuals who may be changing careers.24\nOne stakeholder group noted that some organizations were working to develop curricula for regenerative medicine and advanced therapies education. This stakeholder group suggested that such a curriculum could be franchised across colleges as well as industry, which might minimize the need for on-the-job training. In addition, this group noted establishing additional 2-year certificate or degree programs based on such a curriculum would also make such programs available to more diverse communities, thereby increasing workforce diversity. This stakeholder group agreed that consensus on a core curriculum that reflects the diverse, interdisciplinary nature of regenerative medicine and advanced therapies would help clarify the education and training needs for a competent, robust workforce.\nAgency Comments\nWe provided a copy of the draft report to HHS for review and comment.

Practitioners believe these therapies have the potential to revolutionize patient care and improve lives. Regenerative medicine and other advanced therapies include cell, gene, and tissue- based therapies.1 The goal of these therapies is to repair or replace damaged human cells, tissues, or organs to supplement or restore function, by going beyond existing medical treatments to address the underlying causes of disease or provide cures for previously untreatable diseases and conditions.\nOver the years, technologies for the development of these therapies have advanced significantly. Research and development for such technologies includes, for example, new ways to engineer tissue-based therapies. As of December 2022, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 26 regenerative medicine and advanced therapies.2 In 2019, a  former FDA commissioner predicted FDA could approve 10 to 20 such therapies annually by 2025.3 The promise of new, approved regenerative medicine and advanced therapies to ameliorate and cure previously untreatable diseases and conditions depends, in part, on the existence of a robust, well-trained workforce.\nWithin the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and FDA have responsibilities for regenerative medicine and advanced therapy development and oversight. NIH funds scientific regenerative medicine and advanced cell, gene, and tissue research, while FDA reviews, approves, and regulates the development and marketing of therapies for which research and development has been successful.4 From fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2021 (the most recent complete fiscal year of data available), NIH provided close to $7 billion in funds for regenerative medicine research.5 Neither FDA nor NIH has responsibility for ensuring the sufficiency of this workforce.\nThe Timely ReAuthorization of Necessary Stem-cell Programs Lends Access to Needed Therapies (TRANSPLANT) Act of 2021 included a provision for GAO to study the regenerative medicine and advanced therapies workforce in the commercial and academic sectors.6 This report provides information on specific to this workforce.9 We also conducted a simple key word search on a national online job search site to corroborate and expand on workforce information provided by our eight stakeholders.\nTo provide information on education and training for the regenerative medicine and advanced therapies workforce, we interviewed FDA and NIH officials, as well as representatives from the eight selected stakeholder organizations, and reviewed related science and technology reports as cited above. Similar to workforce data, based on consultation with the Department of Education and the Association of American Medical Colleges, we determined that existing federal and national education data are not specific to regenerative medicine and advanced therapies.10\nTo provide information on current and future workforce and education and training needs, we interviewed the same federal officials and eight stakeholder organizations. Information obtained from stakeholder organizations is intended to be illustrative and does not represent the perspectives of all individuals and organizations in this field.\nWe conducted this performance audit from May 2022 to March 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nBackground\nRegenerative medicine and advanced therapies are used to treat patients with a wide range of diseases and conditions across numerous fields. Current FDA-approved therapies are for the treatment or correction of certain hematological, oncological, dermatological, ophthalmological, dental, immunological, orthopedic, and neurological diseases and conditions. For example, patients with certain types of leukemia, lymphoma, and other types of cancer may undergo chemotherapy to kill the cancerous cells in their bone marrow and then receive healthy, blood- forming cells through one of FDA\u2019s approved bone marrow transplant therapies. Other types of approved therapies aim to provoke an immune response, such as gene-edited cellular therapies that modulate patients\u2019 immune systems to attack cancerous tumors, or help rebuild tissues, such as a tissue-engineered therapy to repair knee cartilage. As such, the regenerative medicine and advanced therapies workforce encompasses individuals responsible for the research, development, and biomanufacturing of such therapies for eventual marketing approval by FDA, as well as the clinicians and technicians responsible for administering these therapies to patients across these varied medical fields.\nAdvanced Therapies and Biomanufacturing\nCell and gene therapies use cells either from a patient\u2019s own body or from a donor to treat disease. These therapies use naturally occurring, reprogrammed, or genetically modified cells, including stem cells, immune system cells, and other types of cells, to grow, replace, or repair diseased or damaged ones to help treat or cure disease. Gene therapies also include therapies that deliver genetic material to cells using viral or other vectors, to change how proteins are used by cells. Tissue-based therapies combine cells and biologically compatible materials from natural or artificial sources (e.g., animal tissues or polyethylene plastic) that serve as structural scaffolds into a single product to restore or strengthen damaged tissue. Biomanufacturing for regenerative medicine and advanced therapies requires: collecting biological materials, such as cells or tissues from patients or donors; altering and testing such materials for safety, sterility, and efficacy; and packaging and delivering the therapies to clinical care sites for patient administration. Currently, biomanufacturing is primarily conducted manually in small batches in laboratories. In the longer term, biomanufacturers aim to produce versions of existing and developing cell and tissue therapies in larger quantities, which may significantly increase accessibility and reduce the cost of such therapies. This future state necessitates the development of standards, equipment, and automated processes to make biomanufacturing scalable, consistent, and stable.\nSource: GAO.  |  GAO-23-106030\nThe process for bringing new regenerative medicine and advanced therapies to the market generally takes years. For a therapy to be considered for marketing approval by FDA, commercial and academic developers of such therapies must carry out numerous activities across research and development, biomanufacturing, clinical care, and regulatory affairs.\n\u2022   Research and development activities include preclinical testing for safety and effectiveness. \u2022   Biomanufacturing activities include the production of therapies using living cells and testing these therapies on human subjects.11\n\u2022   Clinical care activities include assessing patients for suitability of treatment with such therapies, administering the therapies, and assessing patient outcomes. \u2022   Regulatory affairs activities include navigating the federal regulatory process and submitting the necessary applications, results of toxicity and safety testing, and other required information and data, to FDA.\nThe Regenerative Medicine and Advanced Therapies Workforce Is Wide-\nThe regenerative medicine and advanced therapies workforce is generally reflective of the larger life sciences workforce.

Information obtained from stakeholder organizations is intended to be illustrative and does not represent the perspectives of all individuals and organizations in this field.\nWe conducted this performance audit from May 2022 to March 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nBackground\nRegenerative medicine and advanced therapies are used to treat patients with a wide range of diseases and conditions across numerous fields. Current FDA-approved therapies are for the treatment or correction of certain hematological, oncological, dermatological, ophthalmological, dental, immunological, orthopedic, and neurological diseases and conditions. For example, patients with certain types of leukemia, lymphoma, and other types of cancer may undergo chemotherapy to kill the cancerous cells in their bone marrow and then receive healthy, blood- forming cells through one of FDA\u2019s approved bone marrow transplant therapies. Other types of approved therapies aim to provoke an immune response, such as gene-edited cellular therapies that modulate patients\u2019 immune systems to attack cancerous tumors, or help rebuild tissues, such as a tissue-engineered therapy to repair knee cartilage. As such, the regenerative medicine and advanced therapies workforce encompasses individuals responsible for the research, development, and biomanufacturing of such therapies for eventual marketing approval by FDA, as well as the clinicians and technicians responsible for administering these therapies to patients across these varied medical fields.\nAdvanced Therapies and Biomanufacturing\nCell and gene therapies use cells either from a patient\u2019s own body or from a donor to treat disease. These therapies use naturally occurring, reprogrammed, or genetically modified cells, including stem cells, immune system cells, and other types of cells, to grow, replace, or repair diseased or damaged ones to help treat or cure disease. Gene therapies also include therapies that deliver genetic material to cells using viral or other vectors, to change how proteins are used by cells. Tissue-based therapies combine cells and biologically compatible materials from natural or artificial sources (e.g., animal tissues or polyethylene plastic) that serve as structural scaffolds into a single product to restore or strengthen damaged tissue. Biomanufacturing for regenerative medicine and advanced therapies requires: collecting biological materials, such as cells or tissues from patients or donors; altering and testing such materials for safety, sterility, and efficacy; and packaging and delivering the therapies to clinical care sites for patient administration. Currently, biomanufacturing is primarily conducted manually in small batches in laboratories. In the longer term, biomanufacturers aim to produce versions of existing and developing cell and tissue therapies in larger quantities, which may significantly increase accessibility and reduce the cost of such therapies. This future state necessitates the development of standards, equipment, and automated processes to make biomanufacturing scalable, consistent, and stable.\nSource: GAO.  |  GAO-23-106030\nThe process for bringing new regenerative medicine and advanced therapies to the market generally takes years. For a therapy to be considered for marketing approval by FDA, commercial and academic developers of such therapies must carry out numerous activities across research and development, biomanufacturing, clinical care, and regulatory affairs.\n\u2022   Research and development activities include preclinical testing for safety and effectiveness. \u2022   Biomanufacturing activities include the production of therapies using living cells and testing these therapies on human subjects.11\n\u2022   Clinical care activities include assessing patients for suitability of treatment with such therapies, administering the therapies, and assessing patient outcomes. \u2022   Regulatory affairs activities include navigating the federal regulatory process and submitting the necessary applications, results of toxicity and safety testing, and other required information and data, to FDA.\nThe Regenerative Medicine and Advanced Therapies Workforce Is Wide-\nThe regenerative medicine and advanced therapies workforce is generally reflective of the larger life sciences workforce. As such, individuals working in the regenerative medicine and advanced therapies field occupy a wide range of jobs across research and development, biomanufacturing, clinical care, and regulatory affairs activities. For example,\nRanging and Interdisciplinary\n\u2022   Research and development occupations may include research physicians, cell therapy scientists (including biologists, chemists, and immunologists), data scientists, and laboratory technicians, among others.12 These individuals may work in academic medical centers or in commercial companies, such as pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies.\n\u2022   Biomanufacturing occupations may include manufacturing associates, cell therapy process development engineers, quality control associates, and technical sales specialists, among others.13\n\u2022   Clinical care occupations may include physicians, advanced practitioners, nurses, phlebotomists, and transplantation surgeons, among others.14\n\u2022   Regulatory occupations may include regulatory consultants, clinical pharmacologists, and others who are responsible for ensuring that manufacturers meet FDA\u2019s regulatory requirements for new therapies. These occupations may be the same as or similar to those in research and development and biomanufacturing. According to some of our stakeholders, many of these occupations\u2014such as data scientists, various technicians, physicians, and regulatory consultants\u2014may be needed across the product development and clinical care activities.\nSee figure 1 for an illustrative example of the activities and occupations that correspond to the four broad occupational categories for one FDA- approved advanced therapy.15 See appendix I for more detailed information on activities and occupations for this cell therapy.\nFigure 1: Sample Activities and Occupations for Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cell Therapy by Occupation Category\nNote: This CAR T cell workforce figure is intended to serve as an illustrative example of the range of activities and occupations across the four categories of therapy development we use for this report. As an illustrative example, this figure may not be a complete rendering of all activities and occupations that are involved. The occupation examples are not intended to align with the order of activity examples. aTranslational scientists take discoveries made in the laboratory, clinic, or field and transform them into new treatments and approaches that help improve the health of the population. bBiomanufacturing activities include the production of therapies using living cells.\nOccupations Require Postsecondary Biological Science or Additional Specialized Training\nIndividuals working with regenerative medicine and advanced therapies would need postsecondary education and degrees appropriate to their area of work.16 That is, researchers and related occupations would need science- and engineering-based degrees, and clinical occupations would need clinical and professional degrees. Specifically, Clinical Degrees and \u2022   Research and development and biomanufacturing occupations generally require certificates or associate, undergraduate, or postgraduate degrees in biological sciences and biological engineering, among others. \u2022   Clinical care occupations generally require medical, nursing, or related clinical or professional degrees. \u2022   Regulatory affairs occupations require either life sciences degrees like those working in research and development and biomanufacturing, or clinical or professional degrees like those in clinical care, including pharmacology, in order to navigate the FDA approval process. Further, according to many of our eight selected stakeholders, workers in many regenerative medicine and advanced therapy occupations would likely need additional specialized training, such as on-the-job training in laboratory techniques, or medical fellowships in topics and practices specific to the field. For example, laboratory technicians assisting with research and development of stem cell cancer therapies would need training on how to conduct human leukocyte antigen typing to match bone marrow donors and recipients. For CAR T cell cancer therapies, laboratory technicians assisting with research and development would need additional specialized knowledge and training on editing the genes of the cells.\nRegenerative medicine biomanufacturing technicians would need training in current good manufacturing practices, and additional training may be needed for technicians working on specific types of therapies. For example, biomanufacturing technicians would need additional specialized knowledge and training on maintaining current good manufacturing and tissue practices for growing tissue using scaffolds.17 There may be other nuanced differences in education and training for similarly titled occupations in the field depending on research, manufacturing, and clinical care needs of each therapy.\nVarious entities, such as academic medical centers, industry associations, and the federal government offer internships or continuing professional education for this workforce. For example, workers may participate in continuing professional education opportunities, such as conferences and webinars, to maintain proficiency and keep current on advances in the field. Other opportunities, such as internships and fellowships, may provide more intensive training, such as for individuals in their early careers. See Table 1 for examples of internships and fellowships for which agency officials and stakeholders provided information.18\nProvider/sponsor FDA-NIH Interagency Oncology Task Force Fellowship GROW Internship\nDescription This fellowship trains scientists to build awareness of regulatory requirements into early stages of medical product development, and develop strategies to improve planning throughout research and regulatory review. This fellowship has four tracks: three oncology product research and review tracks for (1) concurrent NIH hematology/oncology fellows, (2) physicians board-certified in oncology, and (3) postdoctoral research fellows; and a fourth cancer prevention product and review track for doctoral-level individuals. Alliance for Regenerative Medicine    The GROW (GeneRating Diversity and Opportunity Within Regenerative Medicine) internship is a summer program that provides early career paid opportunities in the regenerative medicine sector to Black or African American undergraduates, graduating seniors, and graduate students.\nSource: GAO analysis of information from Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and our selected stakeholders. | GAO-23-106030\nStakeholders Noted Current Shortages of\nSkilled Technicians and a Need for Additional Education for the Future\nWorkforce\nStakeholders Identified Current Shortages of Skilled Laboratory and Manufacturing Technicians and Others\nMany of the stakeholders we interviewed discussed shortages in either the number of current and projected laboratory technicians or the number of biomanufacturing technicians needed to support the development of regenerative medicine and advanced therapies. For example, some stakeholders cited a lack of technicians with the specialized skills and experience to conduct laboratory research activities, such as developing assays and conducting flow cytometry and mass spectrometry.19 These stakeholders noted that the small number of 2-year biotechnology degree or certificate programs contributes to this shortage. Because of the lack of individuals with this educational background, some stakeholders said individuals with higher levels of education than may be necessary\u2014such as bachelor\u2019s or master\u2019s degrees\u2013were working in these roles, which tend to require repetitive manual work. This practice leads to high turnover, as staff with more advanced degrees seek to further their research and development careers. Academic medical institutions\u2019 inability to compete with salaries and benefit packages offered by commercial companies that conduct similar research is a contributing factor to technician shortages and high turnover, according to one stakeholder.\nStakeholders also identified workforce shortages and gaps in other specialized positions. For example, many stakeholders noted that there is a lack of quality control or quality assurance associates and data scientists who can work with large data sets. In addition, stakeholders noted shortages of individuals who have knowledge of and experience with FDA regulations, individuals with master\u2019s degrees who can manage both the scientific and operational/managerial sides of biomanufacturing, technicians with education or experience in clean room manufacturing and good manufacturing practices, and nurses and medical technologists who provide post-transplant care with education and training in assessing cell viability.20 However, the lack of federal or national data specific to the regenerative medicine and advanced therapies workforce limits comprehensive analyses of workforce capacity and identification of potential gaps specific to this field.\nRepresentatives from two stakeholder groups we spoke with said their organizations have conducted regenerative medicine and advanced therapies workforce assessments. For example, the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine published a workforce assessment in March 2023.21 The Forum on Regenerative Medicine\u2014a forum of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine (National Academies)\u2014convened a public workshop to discuss workforce issues in November 2022, and is expected release a report of the proceedings in spring 2023.\nStakeholders Identified the Need for Additional Education to Help Ensure a Sufficient Workforce for the Future\nSome stakeholders noted that vocational education for skilled laboratory and manufacturing technicians at the community and technical college level is insufficient to meet current and future workforce needs. In addition, many stakeholders noted that no nationally recognized regenerative medicine and advanced therapies education curriculum currently exists for either scientific or clinical and professional degrees.22 For example, a representative from one stakeholder group told us that, of the approximately 200 community and technical colleges in Georgia, only four offer certificate programs or associate\u2019s degrees in biotechnology. In addition, a search of the Department of Education\u2019s College Navigator shows that only 73 institutions offer certificate programs or associate degrees in biotechnology, which is about 7 percent of the 1,043 public, tribal, and independent community colleges in the U.S. in 2022, according to the American Association of Community Colleges.\nSome stakeholders we spoke with suggested the need to establish additional technical and other education programs to meet future workforce needs. They identified particular subjects a regenerative medicine-based curriculum should include for such programs, primarily in two of the four broad categories we identified\u2014research and development and biomanufacturing. For example, one stakeholder group emphasized that education for this field needs to include active practice with laboratory and manufacturing equipment and in such environments, in addition to classroom learning.\nSome stakeholders noted that additional education programs should include subjects consistent with technologies and processes for therapies that are FDA-approved or on a path toward regulatory approval, so that such programs are developed in line with industry needs. Such programs should also include education on good manufacturing practices, quality assurance, and regulatory requirements. Many stakeholders also noted such programs should include education on data science, especially as the field anticipates moving toward larger-scale, more automated manufacturing.23 One stakeholder group suggested that certificate programs could also provide the education individuals would need to carry out laboratory techniques, especially for individuals who may be changing careers.24\nOne stakeholder group noted that some organizations were working to develop curricula for regenerative medicine and advanced therapies education. This stakeholder group suggested that such a curriculum could be franchised across colleges as well as industry, which might minimize the need for on-the-job training. In addition, this group noted establishing additional 2-year certificate or degree programs based on such a curriculum would also make such programs available to more diverse communities, thereby increasing workforce diversity. This stakeholder group agreed that consensus on a core curriculum that reflects the diverse, interdisciplinary nature of regenerative medicine and advanced therapies would help clarify the education and training needs for a competent, robust workforce.\nAgency Comments\nWe provided a copy of the draft report to HHS for review and comment.

In fiscal year 2022, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) assisted over 620,000 veterans pursuing education through the GI Bill programs.1 Some veterans also leave military service with wilderness survival and related skills that are applicable to careers in outdoor recreation, an estimated $159 billion annual industry in 2021 employing millions across the public and private sectors.2 In addition, some studies suggest that outdoor recreation activities (e.g., fishing) may be beneficial to veterans experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder.3 \nHowever, little is known about the educational or employment pathways for veterans into the outdoor recreation sector.\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, includes provisions for GAO to review veterans\u2019 use of educational benefits and pursuit of careers in outdoor recreation.4 This report describes opportunities and associated challenges for veterans to (1) use the GI Bill programs and related VA benefits toward outdoor recreation education and (2) pursue federal employment in outdoor recreation.\nTo describe veterans\u2019 use of VA benefits toward outdoor recreation education, we identified eligible education programs using VA and Department of Education (Education) data. Specifically, we used data from VA\u2019s GI Bill Comparison Tool database and a list of key outdoor recreation activities developed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to identify outdoor recreation certificate programs that VA had approved as of June 2022.5 We also used VA data from 2020, the most recent available, to identify the number of GI Bill beneficiaries enrolled in these certificate programs that year. In addition, we used data from Education\u2019s College Scorecard database to identify colleges offering outdoor recreation-related degree programs as of 2022. We assessed the reliability of these data sources by reviewing data documentation, performing logic tests on the data, and interviewing agency officials from VA and Education. As a result of this assessment, we concluded that the VA and Education data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We also interviewed officials at state agencies that approve programs for VA educational benefits and at selected outdoor recreation certificate programs.6\nTo describe veterans\u2019 federal employment in outdoor recreation careers, we analyzed employment opportunities and interviewed officials about veteran hiring initiatives at four federal agencies with missions connected to the outdoors: the Department of Agriculture (USDA); Department of the\nInterior (Interior); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. We identified outdoor recreation positions at these agencies by analyzing Office of Personnel Management (OPM) occupational series and gathering input from agency officials.7 We then analyzed 2021 data from OPM\u2019s Enterprise Human Resources Integration system on the number of veterans that held these positions and certain characteristics of their employment (e.g., full- vs. part-time positions).8 We assessed the reliability of OPM\u2019s data by reviewing data documentation, performing logic tests on the data, and interviewing agency officials. We also reviewed prior GAO and OPM work assessing the reliability of these data. As a result of this assessment, we concluded that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.\nIn addition, we reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations. We also interviewed officials at VA, an outdoor recreation industry association, and veteran advocacy groups involved with either student veterans or outdoors issues.9\nWe conducted this performance audit from July 2022 to May 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nVA Benefits Programs\nBackground VA administers several benefits programs that can help veterans pay for their education and career training. The largest VA education benefit programs are the GI Bill programs, particularly the Post-9/11 GI Bill program.10 GI Bill beneficiaries can use their benefits for a range of learning opportunities, including undergraduate and graduate degrees and non-degree programs, such as certificate programs. For veterans receiving full Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, VA generally will pay the actual net cost of in-state tuition and fees at public colleges and the lesser of (1) the actual net cost for tuition and fees, and (2) an annually-determined maximum amount at nonpublic, for-profit, or foreign schools (generally $26,381 for the 2022-2023 school year).11 The program also provides additional payments for housing and books directly to eligible veterans. In fiscal year 2022, VA provided $8.1 billion in benefits for over 564,000 Post-9/11 GI Bill beneficiaries.\nIn addition to the GI Bill program, VA administers the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) program, which can pay tuition and fees for education and training to help veterans with service-connected disabilities reenter the workforce.12 VR&E can also provide additional assistance, including career counseling and short-term employment services like job search assistance.13 Veterans enrolled in training may also be eligible to receive a monthly subsistence allowance to assist them with living expenses. Subject to the approval of their VR&E counselor, veterans with service-connected disabilities may use their VR&E benefits to pay for education at outdoor recreation certificate and degree programs, in preparation for careers in the outdoor recreation industry.14 VR&E counselors work with veterans to design individualized service plans and identify training and services needed to help them achieve their employment goals. In fiscal year 2022, VR&E provided approximately $1.5 billion in benefits for around 124,000 veterans.15\nSchool and Program Approval Process for Veterans Education Benefit Programs\nVA is responsible for overseeing schools and programs that enroll veterans who are using VA education benefits. To provide this oversight, VA enters into agreements with State Approving Agencies (SAA) to help approve and monitor schools and programs within each state. Veterans may use GI Bill benefits for approved programs, but the approval process and requirements vary depending on the type of program. For example, degree programs at colleges that are eligible for federal student aid and accredited by a Department of Education-recognized accrediting entity are generally deemed approved for GI Bill benefit purposes by SAAs. SAA review of non-accredited courses (such as those offered at some outdoor skills schools) involves a review of the program\u2019s course outlines and fee schedules, among other things. In addition, sports or athletics courses (e.g., fishing or skiing) are generally presumed to be recreational, and will not be approved, unless the enrollee establishes that the course has a bona fide use in pursuing his or her vocational objective.\nVeterans Can Use VA Education Benefits at Different Types of Outdoor Recreation\nEducation Programs, but Some Veterans May Face Challenges Unique to the Field \nVeterans Can Use VA Education Benefits to Pursue Certificate Programs or College\nVeterans interested in pursuing outdoor recreation careers can use VA education benefits to obtain training through two potential pathways. In general, they may enroll in approved (1) outdoor recreation certificate programs or (2) colleges with outdoor recreation-related degree programs (see fig. 1). Degrees Related to Outdoor Recreation\nFigure 1: Examples of Veterans\u2019 Potential Education Pathways to Outdoor Recreation Careers\nOutdoor Recreation Certificates provide students opportunities to enroll in\nOutdoor recreation certificate programs generally prepare students for careers guiding or instructing outdoor recreation activities, such as scuba diving, mountain climbing, and hunting. We identified 34 GI Bill-approved outdoor recreation certificate programs located in 16 states, according to VA data as of June 2022.16 We found that 431 veterans used their GI Bill Outdoor recreation certificate programs benefits at 20 of these certificate programs in 2020, according to the most 17 courses to develop vocational skills in recent data available. areas such as fly-fishing, canoeing, backpacking, mountain climbing rescue, and wilderness first aid. Graduates of these certificate programs may seek careers as guides or instructors using the skills learned in these courses (e.g. mountain guide, scuba diving instructor).

These degree programs can prepare students to Outdoor Recreation-Related  facilitate or administer outdoor recreation and education in parks and protected areas. We identified about 1,400 colleges with outdoor Outdoor recreation-related college recreation-related degree programs that were eligible for VA benefits (i.e., degrees provide students opportunities to enroll in courses such as outdoor GI Bill and VR&E), according to our analysis of Education\u2019s College recreation administration, natural Scorecard data.18 These colleges, which are dispersed across all U.S. resource management, adventure leadership, and physical and social states, offered around 3,100 distinct outdoor recreation-related degree sciences. Graduates of these programs programs.19 may seek careers in public agencies or private businesses that provide outdoor recreational and tourism experiences. Source: GAO summary of outdoor recreation related degrees and discussions with outdoor recreation education stakeholders | GAO-23- 106149\nChallenges for Veterans Pursuing Outdoor Education May Include Offerings\n Veterans pursuing outdoor recreation education may face challenges\u2014 some of which are unique to the field\u2014according to officials at outdoor recreation certificate programs, SAAs, and a veteran advocacy group we interviewed: Seasonality of Program \u2022   Seasonality and geographic location of program offerings. Veterans may face challenges accessing programs that are limited to certain times of the year within specific geographic regions. For example, some courses in avalanche rescue or ice climbing are available only in mountainous regions during the winter. Veterans who are interested in avalanche rescue or ice climbing careers may need to travel to these regions during winter months to obtain training. However, an official we spoke to at a mountain guiding certificate program said that, in his experience, veterans are comfortable with traveling for training, as many became accustomed to deploying and traveling while serving in the military. \u2022   Some outdoor recreation certificate programs do not have GI Bill approval. Veterans interested in pursuing outdoor recreation education may be unable to use GI Bill benefits toward certain certificate programs. For example, one certificate program that provides advanced mountain guide training is not currently approved for use of GI Bill benefits. However, another program offers a GI Bill- approved mountain guiding certificate program for beginning- and intermediate-level training. An official at the non-approved program said they are not currently pursuing GI Bill approval because they are concerned about the administrative burden it may create for their organization. On the other hand, officials at an approved scuba diving certificate program said that the GI Bill approval process was not administratively burdensome because the process was similar to steps they had already taken to obtain a state operating license. In addition, both SAA officials and school officials at approved outdoor recreation certificate programs said that SAAs provide significant technical assistance to schools seeking GI Bill approval. \u2022   General challenges associated with pursuing higher education. As we have previously reported, in general veterans may face broader challenges pursuing higher education, including adjusting to civilian life and dealing with service-related disabilities, in addition to balancing family obligations.20 This prior work found that these challenges can put student veterans at greater risk of not completing their academic degree programs. For example, representatives from a group that advocates for student veterans told us that some veterans experience challenges pursuing higher education due to service- connected disabilities, such as post-traumatic stress disorder.\nSeveral Thousand Veterans Are\nEmployed in Federal Outdoor Recreation\nPositions, but Some Veterans May Face Challenges Pursuing These Careers\nFederal Agencies Employed about 4,900 Recreation Positions, and Attract Veterans through Hiring Initiatives\nAbout 4,900 veterans were employed in outdoor recreation positions at federal agencies with missions connected to the outdoors, according to 21 Veterans in Outdoor                        our analysis of 2021 employment data.           These agencies include the Department of Agriculture (USDA), Department of the Interior, Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\u2014which together comprise the Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation.22\nWe identified 11 federal positions in which employees may work outside as part of their job duties to support recreational activities\u2014including forestry technician, park guide, park ranger, landscape architect, and fish biologist.23 Of these federal positions, the greatest number of veterans were employed as forestry technicians and in the general fields of natural resources management and biological sciences.24 (See table 1.)\n Veterans comprised a smaller proportion of employees in outdoor recreation positions than in the larger federal workforce. For instance, veterans accounted for 11 percent of federal outdoor recreation employees. (See table 2.) By contrast, veterans made up about 18 percent of employees across all occupations at the corresponding agencies.\n Federal officials we interviewed said their agencies have several programs and initiatives to attract veterans to outdoor recreation positions. For instance, many veterans pursuing federal employment can use veterans\u2019 hiring preference, a system that provides special consideration to certain veterans who pursue federal civilian employment.25 About 88 percent of veterans in federal outdoor recreation careers were eligible for veterans\u2019 preference, according to our analysis of OPM data. This is in line with the 90 percent of veterans eligible for veterans\u2019 preference in all positions at these agencies.26\nBeyond veterans\u2019 preference, officials at these four agencies described various programs or initiatives to attract veterans to work in outdoor recreation positions.\n\u2022   Skill training. Interior officials told us the department participates in the Department of Defense\u2019s SkillBridge program. This program offers service members the opportunity to gain civilian work experience through training, apprenticeships, or internships during their last 180 days of military service. Active duty service members have used this program at Interior to pursue positions in national parks, according to Interior officials. In addition, NOAA officials we interviewed reported that they provide veterans opportunities to train in fisheries habitat restoration through the agency\u2019s Veterans Corps Fisheries Program. \u2022   Recruitment. USDA and Army Corps officials told us their agencies recruit veterans at career fairs. \u2022   Internships. Interior officials told us the agency participates in the Department of Defense\u2019s Operation Warfighter. This program offers opportunities for service members recovering from injury to gain civilian work experience and develop their job skills through internship programs. \u2022   Strategic planning. Within Interior, the National Park Service\u2019s strategic plan includes a goal to assist veterans with the transition into the civilian workforce through skills training, job matching, and employment opportunities with public land management agencies.\nChallenges to Veterans Pursuing Federal Outdoor Recreation Employment Include the Seasonal or Part-Time Nature of the Jobs\nVeterans may face some challenges when pursuing federal outdoor recreation positions, including those that pertain to the nature of the positions themselves. For instance, the seasonal nature of some of these outdoor recreation positions can deter veterans seeking year-round, full- time employment from pursuing these careers, according to outdoor recreation industry officials. Federal outdoor recreation positions are more frequently seasonal or part-time assignments than other types of federal employment.27 About 38 percent of federal outdoor recreation employees were either seasonal or part-time, compared to 11 percent of all federal government employees, according to our analysis of 2021 federal employment data. recreation positions: mission of the work. generalizable.\nPerspectives from veterans in outdoor For certain outdoor-related positions, the majority of employees are either seasonal or part-time. For example, over 63 percent of both park guide Working in outdoor recreation leverages many and forestry technician positions were seasonal or part-time. Officials at skills that veterans possess\u2014including initiative, adaptability, and leadership. While an outdoor recreation industry group told us that the seasonality of these some veterans may struggle with the positions, as well as the potential need to move frequently to maintain seasonal nature of many of these positions, employment, can create challenges for veterans looking to pursue these others thrive working in outdoor recreation because of the therapeutic nature and careers. Furthermore, federal officials told us that some outdoor recreation jobs are low paying, entry-level positions, and thus may not be Source: GAO interview with veterans in outdoor recreation positions.  |  GAO-23-106149    a good fit for veterans who are transitioning to civilian employment mid- 28 Note: The selected observation reflects themes career. raised in GAO\u2019s conversation with two veterans in outdoor recreation positions and is not Veterans may also face challenges obtaining outdoor recreation employment because these career paths are less well-known, according to federal officials and representatives from the outdoor recreation industry we interviewed. For instance, representatives from a group advocating for veterans in the outdoors told us that veterans may not realize careers in outdoor recreation are viable options. One way VA is raising awareness of these career paths is through its online employment tools, which include information on outdoor recreation careers. For instance, VA\u2019s online career assessment tool may suggest careers such as ski patrollers or fish and game wardens to veterans based on their specific interests.\nAgency Comments\nWe provided a draft of this report to the Department of Agriculture; Department of Commerce; Department of Defense; Department of Education; Department of the Interior; Department of Veterans Affairs; and Office of Personnel Management for review and comment.

{"content": "June 6, 2023\nThe Honorable Jon Tester Chairman The Honorable Jerry Moran Ranking Member Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs United States Senate\nThe Honorable Mike Bost Chairman The Honorable Mark Takano Ranking Member Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs House of Representatives\nThe federal government\u2019s commitment to those who served in the military includes helping them pursue education and gain employment skills to succeed in the civilian workforce. In fiscal year 2022, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) assisted over 620,000 veterans pursuing education through the GI Bill programs.1 Some veterans also leave military service with wilderness survival and related skills that are applicable to careers in outdoor recreation, an estimated $159 billion annual industry in 2021 employing millions across the public and private sectors.2 In addition, some studies suggest that outdoor recreation activities (e.g., fishing) may be beneficial to veterans experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder.3 \nHowever, little is known about the educational or employment pathways for veterans into the outdoor recreation sector.\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, includes provisions for GAO to review veterans\u2019 use of educational benefits and pursuit of careers in outdoor recreation.4 This report describes opportunities and associated challenges for veterans to (1) use the GI Bill programs and related VA benefits toward outdoor recreation education and (2) pursue federal employment in outdoor recreation.\nTo describe veterans\u2019 use of VA benefits toward outdoor recreation education, we identified eligible education programs using VA and Department of Education (Education) data. Specifically, we used data from VA\u2019s GI Bill Comparison Tool database and a list of key outdoor recreation activities developed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to identify outdoor recreation certificate programs that VA had approved as of June 2022.5 We also used VA data from 2020, the most recent available, to identify the number of GI Bill beneficiaries enrolled in these certificate programs that year. In addition, we used data from Education\u2019s College Scorecard database to identify colleges offering outdoor recreation-related degree programs as of 2022. We assessed the reliability of these data sources by reviewing data documentation, performing logic tests on the data, and interviewing agency officials from VA and Education. As a result of this assessment, we concluded that the VA and Education data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We also interviewed officials at state agencies that approve programs for VA educational benefits and at selected outdoor recreation certificate programs.6\nTo describe veterans\u2019 federal employment in outdoor recreation careers, we analyzed employment opportunities and interviewed officials about veteran hiring initiatives at four federal agencies with missions connected to the outdoors: the Department of Agriculture (USDA); Department of the\nInterior (Interior); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. We identified outdoor recreation positions at these agencies by analyzing Office of Personnel Management (OPM) occupational series and gathering input from agency officials.7 We then analyzed 2021 data from OPM\u2019s Enterprise Human Resources Integration system on the number of veterans that held these positions and certain characteristics of their employment (e.g., full- vs. part-time positions).8 We assessed the reliability of OPM\u2019s data by reviewing data documentation, performing logic tests on the data, and interviewing agency officials. We also reviewed prior GAO and OPM work assessing the reliability of these data. As a result of this assessment, we concluded that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.\nIn addition, we reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations. We also interviewed officials at VA, an outdoor recreation industry association, and veteran advocacy groups involved with either student veterans or outdoors issues.9\nWe conducted this performance audit from July 2022 to May 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nVA Benefits Programs\nBackground VA administers several benefits programs that can help veterans pay for their education and career training. The largest VA education benefit programs are the GI Bill programs, particularly the Post-9/11 GI Bill program.10 GI Bill beneficiaries can use their benefits for a range of learning opportunities, including undergraduate and graduate degrees and non-degree programs, such as certificate programs. For veterans receiving full Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, VA generally will pay the actual net cost of in-state tuition and fees at public colleges and the lesser of (1) the actual net cost for tuition and fees, and (2) an annually-determined maximum amount at nonpublic, for-profit, or foreign schools (generally $26,381 for the 2022-2023 school year).11 The program also provides additional payments for housing and books directly to eligible veterans. In fiscal year 2022, VA provided $8.1 billion in benefits for over 564,000 Post-9/11 GI Bill beneficiaries.\nIn addition to the GI Bill program, VA administers the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) program, which can pay tuition and fees for education and training to help veterans with service-connected disabilities reenter the workforce.12 VR&E can also provide additional assistance, including career counseling and short-term employment services like job search assistance.13 Veterans enrolled in training may also be eligible to receive a monthly subsistence allowance to assist them with living expenses. Subject to the approval of their VR&E counselor, veterans with service-connected disabilities may use their VR&E benefits to pay for education at outdoor recreation certificate and degree programs, in preparation for careers in the outdoor recreation industry.14 VR&E counselors work with veterans to design individualized service plans and identify training and services needed to help them achieve their employment goals. In fiscal year 2022, VR&E provided approximately $1.5 billion in benefits for around 124,000 veterans.15\nSchool and Program Approval Process for Veterans Education Benefit Programs\nVA is responsible for overseeing schools and programs that enroll veterans who are using VA education benefits. To provide this oversight, VA enters into agreements with State Approving Agencies (SAA) to help approve and monitor schools and programs within each state. Veterans may use GI Bill benefits for approved programs, but the approval process and requirements vary depending on the type of program. For example, degree programs at colleges that are eligible for federal student aid and accredited by a Department of Education-recognized accrediting entity are generally deemed approved for GI Bill benefit purposes by SAAs. SAA review of non-accredited courses (such as those offered at some outdoor skills schools) involves a review of the program\u2019s course outlines and fee schedules, among other things. In addition, sports or athletics courses (e.g., fishing or skiing) are generally presumed to be recreational, and will not be approved, unless the enrollee establishes that the course has a bona fide use in pursuing his or her vocational objective.\nVeterans Can Use VA Education Benefits at Different Types of Outdoor Recreation\nEducation Programs, but Some Veterans May Face Challenges Unique to the Field \nVeterans Can Use VA Education Benefits to Pursue Certificate Programs or College\nVeterans interested in pursuing outdoor recreation careers can use VA education benefits to obtain training through two potential pathways. In general, they may enroll in approved (1) outdoor recreation certificate programs or (2) colleges with outdoor recreation-related degree programs (see fig. 1). Degrees Related to Outdoor Recreation\nFigure 1: Examples of Veterans\u2019 Potential Education Pathways to Outdoor Recreation Careers\nOutdoor Recreation Certificates provide students opportunities to enroll in\nOutdoor recreation certificate programs generally prepare students for careers guiding or instructing outdoor recreation activities, such as scuba diving, mountain climbing, and hunting. We identified 34 GI Bill-approved outdoor recreation certificate programs located in 16 states, according to VA data as of June 2022.16 We found that 431 veterans used their GI Bill Outdoor recreation certificate programs benefits at 20 of these certificate programs in 2020, according to the most 17 courses to develop vocational skills in recent data available. areas such as fly-fishing, canoeing, backpacking, mountain climbing rescue, and wilderness first aid. Graduates of these certificate programs may seek careers as guides or instructors using the skills learned in these courses (e.g. mountain guide, scuba diving instructor).

These degree programs can prepare students to Outdoor Recreation-Related  facilitate or administer outdoor recreation and education in parks and protected areas. We identified about 1,400 colleges with outdoor Outdoor recreation-related college recreation-related degree programs that were eligible for VA benefits (i.e., degrees provide students opportunities to enroll in courses such as outdoor GI Bill and VR&E), according to our analysis of Education\u2019s College recreation administration, natural Scorecard data.18 These colleges, which are dispersed across all U.S. resource management, adventure leadership, and physical and social states, offered around 3,100 distinct outdoor recreation-related degree sciences. Graduates of these programs programs.19 may seek careers in public agencies or private businesses that provide outdoor recreational and tourism experiences. Source: GAO summary of outdoor recreation related degrees and discussions with outdoor recreation education stakeholders | GAO-23- 106149\nChallenges for Veterans Pursuing Outdoor Education May Include Offerings\n Veterans pursuing outdoor recreation education may face challenges\u2014 some of which are unique to the field\u2014according to officials at outdoor recreation certificate programs, SAAs, and a veteran advocacy group we interviewed: Seasonality of Program \u2022   Seasonality and geographic location of program offerings. Veterans may face challenges accessing programs that are limited to certain times of the year within specific geographic regions. For example, some courses in avalanche rescue or ice climbing are available only in mountainous regions during the winter. Veterans who are interested in avalanche rescue or ice climbing careers may need to travel to these regions during winter months to obtain training. However, an official we spoke to at a mountain guiding certificate program said that, in his experience, veterans are comfortable with traveling for training, as many became accustomed to deploying and traveling while serving in the military. \u2022   Some outdoor recreation certificate programs do not have GI Bill approval. Veterans interested in pursuing outdoor recreation education may be unable to use GI Bill benefits toward certain certificate programs. For example, one certificate program that provides advanced mountain guide training is not currently approved for use of GI Bill benefits. However, another program offers a GI Bill- approved mountain guiding certificate program for beginning- and intermediate-level training. An official at the non-approved program said they are not currently pursuing GI Bill approval because they are concerned about the administrative burden it may create for their organization. On the other hand, officials at an approved scuba diving certificate program said that the GI Bill approval process was not administratively burdensome because the process was similar to steps they had already taken to obtain a state operating license. In addition, both SAA officials and school officials at approved outdoor recreation certificate programs said that SAAs provide significant technical assistance to schools seeking GI Bill approval. \u2022   General challenges associated with pursuing higher education. As we have previously reported, in general veterans may face broader challenges pursuing higher education, including adjusting to civilian life and dealing with service-related disabilities, in addition to balancing family obligations.20 This prior work found that these challenges can put student veterans at greater risk of not completing their academic degree programs. For example, representatives from a group that advocates for student veterans told us that some veterans experience challenges pursuing higher education due to service- connected disabilities, such as post-traumatic stress disorder.\nSeveral Thousand Veterans Are\nEmployed in Federal Outdoor Recreation\nPositions, but Some Veterans May Face Challenges Pursuing These Careers\nFederal Agencies Employed about 4,900 Recreation Positions, and Attract Veterans through Hiring Initiatives\nAbout 4,900 veterans were employed in outdoor recreation positions at federal agencies with missions connected to the outdoors, according to 21 Veterans in Outdoor                        our analysis of 2021 employment data.           These agencies include the Department of Agriculture (USDA), Department of the Interior, Department of Commerce, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\u2014which together comprise the Federal Interagency Council on Outdoor Recreation.22\nWe identified 11 federal positions in which employees may work outside as part of their job duties to support recreational activities\u2014including forestry technician, park guide, park ranger, landscape architect, and fish biologist.23 Of these federal positions, the greatest number of veterans were employed as forestry technicians and in the general fields of natural resources management and biological sciences.24 (See table 1.)\n Veterans comprised a smaller proportion of employees in outdoor recreation positions than in the larger federal workforce. For instance, veterans accounted for 11 percent of federal outdoor recreation employees. (See table 2.) By contrast, veterans made up about 18 percent of employees across all occupations at the corresponding agencies.\n Federal officials we interviewed said their agencies have several programs and initiatives to attract veterans to outdoor recreation positions. For instance, many veterans pursuing federal employment can use veterans\u2019 hiring preference, a system that provides special consideration to certain veterans who pursue federal civilian employment.25 About 88 percent of veterans in federal outdoor recreation careers were eligible for veterans\u2019 preference, according to our analysis of OPM data. This is in line with the 90 percent of veterans eligible for veterans\u2019 preference in all positions at these agencies.26\nBeyond veterans\u2019 preference, officials at these four agencies described various programs or initiatives to attract veterans to work in outdoor recreation positions.\n\u2022   Skill training. Interior officials told us the department participates in the Department of Defense\u2019s SkillBridge program. This program offers service members the opportunity to gain civilian work experience through training, apprenticeships, or internships during their last 180 days of military service. Active duty service members have used this program at Interior to pursue positions in national parks, according to Interior officials. In addition, NOAA officials we interviewed reported that they provide veterans opportunities to train in fisheries habitat restoration through the agency\u2019s Veterans Corps Fisheries Program. \u2022   Recruitment. USDA and Army Corps officials told us their agencies recruit veterans at career fairs. \u2022   Internships. Interior officials told us the agency participates in the Department of Defense\u2019s Operation Warfighter. This program offers opportunities for service members recovering from injury to gain civilian work experience and develop their job skills through internship programs. \u2022   Strategic planning. Within Interior, the National Park Service\u2019s strategic plan includes a goal to assist veterans with the transition into the civilian workforce through skills training, job matching, and employment opportunities with public land management agencies.\nChallenges to Veterans Pursuing Federal Outdoor Recreation Employment Include the Seasonal or Part-Time Nature of the Jobs\nVeterans may face some challenges when pursuing federal outdoor recreation positions, including those that pertain to the nature of the positions themselves. For instance, the seasonal nature of some of these outdoor recreation positions can deter veterans seeking year-round, full- time employment from pursuing these careers, according to outdoor recreation industry officials. Federal outdoor recreation positions are more frequently seasonal or part-time assignments than other types of federal employment.27 About 38 percent of federal outdoor recreation employees were either seasonal or part-time, compared to 11 percent of all federal government employees, according to our analysis of 2021 federal employment data. recreation positions: mission of the work. generalizable.\nPerspectives from veterans in outdoor For certain outdoor-related positions, the majority of employees are either seasonal or part-time. For example, over 63 percent of both park guide Working in outdoor recreation leverages many and forestry technician positions were seasonal or part-time. Officials at skills that veterans possess\u2014including initiative, adaptability, and leadership. While an outdoor recreation industry group told us that the seasonality of these some veterans may struggle with the positions, as well as the potential need to move frequently to maintain seasonal nature of many of these positions, employment, can create challenges for veterans looking to pursue these others thrive working in outdoor recreation because of the therapeutic nature and careers.

For instance, representatives from a group advocating for veterans in the outdoors told us that veterans may not realize careers in outdoor recreation are viable options. One way VA is raising awareness of these career paths is through its online employment tools, which include information on outdoor recreation careers. For instance, VA\u2019s online career assessment tool may suggest careers such as ski patrollers or fish and game wardens to veterans based on their specific interests.\nAgency Comments\nWe provided a draft of this report to the Department of Agriculture; Department of Commerce; Department of Defense; Department of Education; Department of the Interior; Department of Veterans Affairs; and Office of Personnel Management for review and comment.

For instance, veterans accounted for 11 percent of federal outdoor recreation employees. (See table 2.) By contrast, veterans made up about 18 percent of employees across all occupations at the corresponding agencies.\n Federal officials we interviewed said their agencies have several programs and initiatives to attract veterans to outdoor recreation positions. For instance, many veterans pursuing federal employment can use veterans\u2019 hiring preference, a system that provides special consideration to certain veterans who pursue federal civilian employment.25 About 88 percent of veterans in federal outdoor recreation careers were eligible for veterans\u2019 preference, according to our analysis of OPM data. This is in line with the 90 percent of veterans eligible for veterans\u2019 preference in all positions at these agencies.26\nBeyond veterans\u2019 preference, officials at these four agencies described various programs or initiatives to attract veterans to work in outdoor recreation positions.\n\u2022   Skill training. Interior officials told us the department participates in the Department of Defense\u2019s SkillBridge program. This program offers service members the opportunity to gain civilian work experience through training, apprenticeships, or internships during their last 180 days of military service. Active duty service members have used this program at Interior to pursue positions in national parks, according to Interior officials. In addition, NOAA officials we interviewed reported that they provide veterans opportunities to train in fisheries habitat restoration through the agency\u2019s Veterans Corps Fisheries Program. \u2022   Recruitment. USDA and Army Corps officials told us their agencies recruit veterans at career fairs. \u2022   Internships. Interior officials told us the agency participates in the Department of Defense\u2019s Operation Warfighter. This program offers opportunities for service members recovering from injury to gain civilian work experience and develop their job skills through internship programs. \u2022   Strategic planning. Within Interior, the National Park Service\u2019s strategic plan includes a goal to assist veterans with the transition into the civilian workforce through skills training, job matching, and employment opportunities with public land management agencies.\nChallenges to Veterans Pursuing Federal Outdoor Recreation Employment Include the Seasonal or Part-Time Nature of the Jobs\nVeterans may face some challenges when pursuing federal outdoor recreation positions, including those that pertain to the nature of the positions themselves. For instance, the seasonal nature of some of these outdoor recreation positions can deter veterans seeking year-round, full- time employment from pursuing these careers, according to outdoor recreation industry officials. Federal outdoor recreation positions are more frequently seasonal or part-time assignments than other types of federal employment.27 About 38 percent of federal outdoor recreation employees were either seasonal or part-time, compared to 11 percent of all federal government employees, according to our analysis of 2021 federal employment data. recreation positions: mission of the work. generalizable.\nPerspectives from veterans in outdoor For certain outdoor-related positions, the majority of employees are either seasonal or part-time.

Officials at skills that veterans possess\u2014including initiative, adaptability, and leadership. While an outdoor recreation industry group told us that the seasonality of these some veterans may struggle with the positions, as well as the potential need to move frequently to maintain seasonal nature of many of these positions, employment, can create challenges for veterans looking to pursue these others thrive working in outdoor recreation because of the therapeutic nature and careers.

For instance, representatives from a group advocating for veterans in the outdoors told us that veterans may not realize careers in outdoor recreation are viable options. One way VA is raising awareness of these career paths is through its online employment tools, which include information on outdoor recreation careers. For instance, VA\u2019s online career assessment tool may suggest careers such as ski patrollers or fish and game wardens to veterans based on their specific interests.\nAgency Comments\nWe provided a draft of this report to the Department of Agriculture; Department of Commerce; Department of Defense; Department of Education; Department of the Interior; Department of Veterans Affairs; and Office of Personnel Management for review and comment.

{"content": "June 6, 2023\nThe Honorable Jon Tester Chairman The Honorable Jerry Moran Ranking Member Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs United States Senate\nThe Honorable Mike Bost Chairman The Honorable Mark Takano Ranking Member Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs House of Representatives\nThe federal government\u2019s commitment to those who served in the military includes helping them pursue education and gain employment skills to succeed in the civilian workforce. In fiscal year 2022, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) assisted over 620,000 veterans pursuing education through the GI Bill programs.1 Some veterans also leave military service with wilderness survival and related skills that are applicable to careers in outdoor recreation, an estimated $159 billion annual industry in 2021 employing millions across the public and private sectors.2 In addition, some studies suggest that outdoor recreation activities (e.g., fishing) may be beneficial to veterans experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder.3 \nHowever, little is known about the educational or employment pathways for veterans into the outdoor recreation sector.\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, includes provisions for GAO to review veterans\u2019 use of educational benefits and pursuit of careers in outdoor recreation.4 This report describes opportunities and associated challenges for veterans to (1) use the GI Bill programs and related VA benefits toward outdoor recreation education and (2) pursue federal employment in outdoor recreation.\nTo describe veterans\u2019 use of VA benefits toward outdoor recreation education, we identified eligible education programs using VA and Department of Education (Education) data. Specifically, we used data from VA\u2019s GI Bill Comparison Tool database and a list of key outdoor recreation activities developed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis to identify outdoor recreation certificate programs that VA had approved as of June 2022.5 We also used VA data from 2020, the most recent available, to identify the number of GI Bill beneficiaries enrolled in these certificate programs that year. In addition, we used data from Education\u2019s College Scorecard database to identify colleges offering outdoor recreation-related degree programs as of 2022. We assessed the reliability of these data sources by reviewing data documentation, performing logic tests on the data, and interviewing agency officials from VA and Education. As a result of this assessment, we concluded that the VA and Education data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We also interviewed officials at state agencies that approve programs for VA educational benefits and at selected outdoor recreation certificate programs.6\nTo describe veterans\u2019 federal employment in outdoor recreation careers, we analyzed employment opportunities and interviewed officials about veteran hiring initiatives at four federal agencies with missions connected to the outdoors: the Department of Agriculture (USDA); Department of the\nInterior (Interior); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. We identified outdoor recreation positions at these agencies by analyzing Office of Personnel Management (OPM) occupational series and gathering input from agency officials.7 We then analyzed 2021 data from OPM\u2019s Enterprise Human Resources Integration system on the number of veterans that held these positions and certain characteristics of their employment (e.g., full- vs. part-time positions).8 We assessed the reliability of OPM\u2019s data by reviewing data documentation, performing logic tests on the data, and interviewing agency officials. We also reviewed prior GAO and OPM work assessing the reliability of these data. As a result of this assessment, we concluded that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.\nIn addition, we reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations. We also interviewed officials at VA, an outdoor recreation industry association, and veteran advocacy groups involved with either student veterans or outdoors issues.9\nWe conducted this performance audit from July 2022 to May 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nVA Benefits Programs\nBackground VA administers several benefits programs that can help veterans pay for their education and career training. The largest VA education benefit programs are the GI Bill programs, particularly the Post-9/11 GI Bill program.10 GI Bill beneficiaries can use their benefits for a range of learning opportunities, including undergraduate and graduate degrees and non-degree programs, such as certificate programs. For veterans receiving full Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits, VA generally will pay the actual net cost of in-state tuition and fees at public colleges and the lesser of (1) the actual net cost for tuition and fees, and (2) an annually-determined maximum amount at nonpublic, for-profit, or foreign schools (generally $26,381 for the 2022-2023 school year).11 The program also provides additional payments for housing and books directly to eligible veterans. In fiscal year 2022, VA provided $8.1 billion in benefits for over 564,000 Post-9/11 GI Bill beneficiaries.\nIn addition to the GI Bill program, VA administers the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) program, which can pay tuition and fees for education and training to help veterans with service-connected disabilities reenter the workforce.12 VR&E can also provide additional assistance, including career counseling and short-term employment services like job search assistance.13 Veterans enrolled in training may also be eligible to receive a monthly subsistence allowance to assist them with living expenses. Subject to the approval of their VR&E counselor, veterans with service-connected disabilities may use their VR&E benefits to pay for education at outdoor recreation certificate and degree programs, in preparation for careers in the outdoor recreation industry.14 VR&E counselors work with veterans to design individualized service plans and identify training and services needed to help them achieve their employment goals. In fiscal year 2022, VR&E provided approximately $1.5 billion in benefits for around 124,000 veterans.15\nSchool and Program Approval Process for Veterans Education Benefit Programs\nVA is responsible for overseeing schools and programs that enroll veterans who are using VA education benefits. To provide this oversight, VA enters into agreements with State Approving Agencies (SAA) to help approve and monitor schools and programs within each state. Veterans may use GI Bill benefits for approved programs, but the approval process and requirements vary depending on the type of program. For example, degree programs at colleges that are eligible for federal student aid and accredited by a Department of Education-recognized accrediting entity are generally deemed approved for GI Bill benefit purposes by SAAs. SAA review of non-accredited courses (such as those offered at some outdoor skills schools) involves a review of the program\u2019s course outlines and fee schedules, among other things. In addition, sports or athletics courses (e.g., fishing or skiing) are generally presumed to be recreational, and will not be approved, unless the enrollee establishes that the course has a bona fide use in pursuing his or her vocational objective.\nVeterans Can Use VA Education Benefits at Different Types of Outdoor Recreation\nEducation Programs, but Some Veterans May Face Challenges Unique to the Field \nVeterans Can Use VA Education Benefits to Pursue Certificate Programs or College\nVeterans interested in pursuing outdoor recreation careers can use VA education benefits to obtain training through two potential pathways. In general, they may enroll in approved (1) outdoor recreation certificate programs or (2) colleges with outdoor recreation-related degree programs (see fig. 1). Degrees Related to Outdoor Recreation\nFigure 1: Examples of Veterans\u2019 Potential Education Pathways to Outdoor Recreation Careers\nOutdoor Recreation Certificates provide students opportunities to enroll in\nOutdoor recreation certificate programs generally prepare students for careers guiding or instructing outdoor recreation activities, such as scuba diving, mountain climbing, and hunting. We identified 34 GI Bill-approved outdoor recreation certificate programs located in 16 states, according to VA data as of June 2022.16 We found that 431 veterans used their GI Bill Outdoor recreation certificate programs benefits at 20 of these certificate programs in 2020, according to the most 17 courses to develop vocational skills in recent data available. areas such as fly-fishing, canoeing, backpacking, mountain climbing rescue, and wilderness first aid. Graduates of these certificate programs may seek careers as guides or instructors using the skills learned in these courses (e.g. mountain guide, scuba diving instructor). Source: GAO summary of outdoor recreation certificates and discussions with outdoor recreation education stakeholders.  |  GAO-23-106149\nDegrees\nSome colleges also offer outdoor recreation-related undergraduate and graduate degree programs in disciplines such as natural resources conservation and research (e.g., environmental science), outdoor education, and forestry. These degree programs can prepare students to Outdoor Recreation-Related  facilitate or administer outdoor recreation and education in parks and protected areas. We identified about 1,400 colleges with outdoor Outdoor recreation-related college recreation-related degree programs that were eligible for VA benefits (i.e., degrees provide students opportunities to enroll in courses such as outdoor GI Bill and VR&E), according to our analysis of Education\u2019s College recreation administration, natural Scorecard data.18 These colleges, which are dispersed across all U.S. resource management, adventure leadership, and physical and social states, offered around 3,100 distinct outdoor recreation-related degree sciences. Graduates of these programs programs.19 may seek careers in public agencies or private businesses that provide outdoor recreational and tourism experiences. Source: GAO summary of outdoor recreation related degrees and discussions with outdoor recreation education stakeholders | GAO-23- 106149\nChallenges for Veterans Pursuing Outdoor Education May Include Offerings\n Veterans pursuing outdoor recreation education may face challenges\u2014 some of which are unique to the field\u2014according to officials at outdoor recreation certificate programs, SAAs, and a veteran advocacy group we interviewed: Seasonality of Program \u2022   Seasonality and geographic location of program offerings. Veterans may face challenges accessing programs that are limited to certain times of the year within specific geographic regions. For example, some courses in avalanche rescue or ice climbing are available only in mountainous regions during the winter. Veterans who are interested in avalanche rescue or ice climbing careers may need to travel to these regions during winter months to obtain training. However, an official we spoke to at a mountain guiding certificate program said that, in his experience, veterans are comfortable with traveling for training, as many became accustomed to deploying and traveling while serving in the military. \u2022   Some outdoor recreation certificate programs do not have GI Bill approval. Veterans interested in pursuing outdoor recreation education may be unable to use GI Bill benefits toward certain certificate programs. For example, one certificate program that provides advanced mountain guide training is not currently approved for use of GI Bill benefits. However, another program offers a GI Bill- approved mountain guiding certificate program for beginning- and intermediate-level training. An official at the non-approved program said they are not currently pursuing GI Bill approval because they are concerned about the administrative burden it may create for their organization. On the other hand, officials at an approved scuba diving certificate program said that the GI Bill approval process was not administratively burdensome because the process was similar to steps they had already taken to obtain a state operating license. In addition, both SAA officials and school officials at approved outdoor recreation certificate programs said that SAAs provide significant technical assistance to schools seeking GI Bill approval. \u2022   General challenges associated with pursuing higher education. As we have previously reported, in general veterans may face broader challenges pursuing higher education, including adjusting to civilian life and dealing with service-related disabilities, in addition to balancing family obligations.20 This prior work found that these challenges can put student veterans at greater risk of not completing their academic degree programs. For example, representatives from a group that advocates for student veterans told us that some veterans experience challenges pursuing higher education due to service- connected disabilities, such as post-traumatic stress disorder.\nSeveral Thousand Veterans Are\nEmployed in Federal Outdoor Recreation\nPositions, but Some Veterans May Face Challenges Pursuing These Careers\nFederal Agencies Employed about 4,900 Recreation Positions, and Attract Veterans through Hiring Initiatives\nAbout 4,900 veterans were employed in outdoor recreation positions at federal agencies with missions connected to the outdoors, according to 21 Veterans in Outdoor                        our analysis of 2021 employment data.

{"content": "CYBERSECURITY HIGH-RISK SERIES: Challenges in Establishing a Comprehensive Cybersecurity Strategy and Performing Effective Oversight\nOverview Federal agencies and our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures\u2014such as energy, transportation systems, communications, and financial services\u2014are dependent on technology systems to carry out fundamental operations and to process, maintain, and report vital information. The security of these systems and data is also vital to safeguarding individual privacy and protecting the nation\u2019s security, prosperity, and well-being. However, risks to these essential technology systems are increasing\u2014in particular, malicious actors are becoming more willing and capable of carrying out cyberattacks. Such attacks could result in serious harm to human safety, national security, the environment, and the economy. Agencies and critical infrastructure owners and operators must protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their systems and effectively respond to cyberattacks. We have designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area since 1997. We expanded this high-risk area in 2003 to include protection of critical cyber infrastructure. In 2015, we expanded it again to include protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information. This is the first in a series of four reports that lay out the main cybersecurity areas the federal government should urgently address, beginning with the need for a comprehensive strategy and effective oversight.1 We have made about 335 recommendations in public reports since 2010 with respect to this area. About 190 of these recommendations were not implemented as of December 2022. Until these are fully implemented, federal agencies will be more limited in their ability to protect private and sensitive data entrusted to them. For more information on this report and others in this series, visit https://www.gao.gov/cybersecurity.\ncomprehensive federal cyber strategy?\n What actions can the federal government take to execute a more The White House\u2019s September 2018 National Cyber Strategy and the National Security Council\u2019s (NSC) accompanying June 2019 Implementation Plan detail the executive branch\u2019s approach to managing the nation\u2019s cybersecurity. In September 2020, we reported that the strategy and implementation plan addressed some, but not all, of the desirable characteristics of national strategies. In particular, the National Cyber Strategy, when combined with the Implementation Plan, addressed three of the six desirable characteristics of national strategies but did not include key elements for three other characteristics (see figure 1). We stressed that moving forward, the incoming administration needed to either update the existing strategy and plan or develop a new comprehensive strategy that addresses those characteristics.\nFigure 1: Extent to Which the National Cyber Strategy and Implementation Plan Addressed the Desirable Characteristics of a National Strategy\nThe Congress and Administration took action to establish and fill a critical cybersecurity leadership position. Specifically, in January 2021, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 established the Office of the National Cyber Director within the Executive Office of the President. In June 2021, the Senate confirmed the first National Cyber Director to head the office and serve as the principal advisor to the President on cybersecurity policy and strategy. The Director subsequently issued a strategic statement for the office that summarized its vision, challenge, path, and urgency to improve the nation\u2019s cybersecurity. However, until the federal government fully develops and implements a comprehensive national strategy, it will not have a clear roadmap for overcoming the cyber challenges facing our nation. \uf0d8   We recommended that the National Security Council work with relevant federal entities to update cybersecurity strategy documents to include goals, performance measures, and resource information, among other things. As of August 2022, according to the Office of the National Cyber Director, the development of a national cybersecurity strategy by the administration is underway. The office noted that it is obtaining feedback on the strategy from many other federal entities, including the National Security Council, on this effort.\nchain risks?\n What actions can the federal government take to mitigate global supply Federal agencies rely extensively on information and communications technology (ICT) products and services to carry out their operations. However, agencies face numerous ICT supply chain risks, including threats posed by counterfeiters who may exploit vulnerabilities in the supply chain. To assist agencies with effectively managing their ICT supply chain risks, the National Institute of Standards and Technology developed guidance that includes risk-based practices. In December 2020, our review of 23 civilian agencies found that none had fully implemented all of the seven foundational practices for supply chain risk management and that 14 had not implemented any of the practices (see figure 2).2 For example, only three out of the 23 agencies had fully developed organizational procedures to detect counterfeit and compromised ICT products prior deployment. In addition, none of the 23 agencies had established a process to conduct agency-wide assessments of ICT supply chain risks. Implementing foundational practices for ICT supply chain risk management is essential to agencies addressing the risks of malicious actors disrupting mission operations, stealing intellectual property, or harming individuals.\nFigure 2: Extent to Which the 23 Civilian Agencies Implemented Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) Practices\n\uf0d8   We recommended that the 23 agencies fully implement foundational practices in their organization-wide approaches to ICT supply chain risk management.3 As of December 2022, 130 of our 145 recommendations were not yet implemented; none of the 23 agencies had fully implemented all recommendations addressed to them.\nworkforce challenges?\n What actions can the federal government take to address cybersecurity In April 2020, we examined the extent to which OMB and lead agencies addressed key practices for effectively implementing selected government-wide reforms (see figure 3). These included reforms that prioritized solving the cybersecurity workforce shortage by identifying and closing workforce skills gaps and developing a standardized approach to hiring, training, and retaining qualified cybersecurity professionals.\nFigure 3: Extent to Which the Government-Wide Plan to Solve the Cybersecurity Workforce Shortage Addressed Key Reform Practices\nWe found that OMB and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) partially addressed most of the key practices associated with effective reforms through their efforts to implement several projects, such as training employees to fill vacant cybersecurity positions and streamlining hiring processes. However, OMB and DHS had not established a dedicated implementation team or a government-wide implementation plan, among other practices. Without these practices in place, OMB and DHS will likely be unable to make significant progress towards solving the cybersecurity workforce shortage. \uf0d8   We recommended several actions aimed at addressing continuing cybersecurity workforce challenges. These recommendations focused on developing a government-wide workforce plan and related supporting practices such as establishing a leadership team and crafting an implementation plan. Government- wide leadership responsibility for cyber workforce issues transitioned in 2022 from OMB and DHS to the Office of the National Cyber Director. Since the transition, the Director has committed to developing a national strategy that addresses cyber training and education, digital awareness, and the cyber workforce. This commitment is consistent with the current Administration\u2019s management agenda, which states that the Administration must identify and address critical skills gaps across the federal IT and cybersecurity workforce. We will continue monitoring efforts to develop the strategy.\nensure the security of emerging technologies?\n What actions can the federal government take to The nation\u2019s critical infrastructure sectors rely on electronic systems, including Internet of Things (IoT) and operational technology (OT) devices and systems (see figure 4).4 In December 2022, we reported that the federal lead agencies of the reviewed critical infrastructure sectors\u2014the Departments of Energy, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and Transportation\u2014had cybersecurity initiatives underway intended to help protect three critical infrastructure sectors with extensive use of IoT or OT devices and systems.

{"content": "CYBERSECURITY HIGH-RISK SERIES: Challenges in Establishing a Comprehensive Cybersecurity Strategy and Performing Effective Oversight\nOverview Federal agencies and our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures\u2014such as energy, transportation systems, communications, and financial services\u2014are dependent on technology systems to carry out fundamental operations and to process, maintain, and report vital information. The security of these systems and data is also vital to safeguarding individual privacy and protecting the nation\u2019s security, prosperity, and well-being. However, risks to these essential technology systems are increasing\u2014in particular, malicious actors are becoming more willing and capable of carrying out cyberattacks. Such attacks could result in serious harm to human safety, national security, the environment, and the economy. Agencies and critical infrastructure owners and operators must protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their systems and effectively respond to cyberattacks. We have designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area since 1997. We expanded this high-risk area in 2003 to include protection of critical cyber infrastructure. In 2015, we expanded it again to include protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information. This is the first in a series of four reports that lay out the main cybersecurity areas the federal government should urgently address, beginning with the need for a comprehensive strategy and effective oversight.1 We have made about 335 recommendations in public reports since 2010 with respect to this area. About 190 of these recommendations were not implemented as of December 2022. Until these are fully implemented, federal agencies will be more limited in their ability to protect private and sensitive data entrusted to them. For more information on this report and others in this series, visit https://www.gao.gov/cybersecurity.\ncomprehensive federal cyber strategy?\n What actions can the federal government take to execute a more The White House\u2019s September 2018 National Cyber Strategy and the National Security Council\u2019s (NSC) accompanying June 2019 Implementation Plan detail the executive branch\u2019s approach to managing the nation\u2019s cybersecurity. In September 2020, we reported that the strategy and implementation plan addressed some, but not all, of the desirable characteristics of national strategies. In particular, the National Cyber Strategy, when combined with the Implementation Plan, addressed three of the six desirable characteristics of national strategies but did not include key elements for three other characteristics (see figure 1). We stressed that moving forward, the incoming administration needed to either update the existing strategy and plan or develop a new comprehensive strategy that addresses those characteristics.\nFigure 1: Extent to Which the National Cyber Strategy and Implementation Plan Addressed the Desirable Characteristics of a National Strategy\nThe Congress and Administration took action to establish and fill a critical cybersecurity leadership position. Specifically, in January 2021, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 established the Office of the National Cyber Director within the Executive Office of the President. In June 2021, the Senate confirmed the first National Cyber Director to head the office and serve as the principal advisor to the President on cybersecurity policy and strategy. The Director subsequently issued a strategic statement for the office that summarized its vision, challenge, path, and urgency to improve the nation\u2019s cybersecurity. However, until the federal government fully develops and implements a comprehensive national strategy, it will not have a clear roadmap for overcoming the cyber challenges facing our nation. \uf0d8   We recommended that the National Security Council work with relevant federal entities to update cybersecurity strategy documents to include goals, performance measures, and resource information, among other things. As of August 2022, according to the Office of the National Cyber Director, the development of a national cybersecurity strategy by the administration is underway. The office noted that it is obtaining feedback on the strategy from many other federal entities, including the National Security Council, on this effort.\nchain risks?\n What actions can the federal government take to mitigate global supply Federal agencies rely extensively on information and communications technology (ICT) products and services to carry out their operations. However, agencies face numerous ICT supply chain risks, including threats posed by counterfeiters who may exploit vulnerabilities in the supply chain. To assist agencies with effectively managing their ICT supply chain risks, the National Institute of Standards and Technology developed guidance that includes risk-based practices. In December 2020, our review of 23 civilian agencies found that none had fully implemented all of the seven foundational practices for supply chain risk management and that 14 had not implemented any of the practices (see figure 2).2 For example, only three out of the 23 agencies had fully developed organizational procedures to detect counterfeit and compromised ICT products prior deployment. In addition, none of the 23 agencies had established a process to conduct agency-wide assessments of ICT supply chain risks. Implementing foundational practices for ICT supply chain risk management is essential to agencies addressing the risks of malicious actors disrupting mission operations, stealing intellectual property, or harming individuals.\nFigure 2: Extent to Which the 23 Civilian Agencies Implemented Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) Practices\n\uf0d8   We recommended that the 23 agencies fully implement foundational practices in their organization-wide approaches to ICT supply chain risk management.3 As of December 2022, 130 of our 145 recommendations were not yet implemented; none of the 23 agencies had fully implemented all recommendations addressed to them.\nworkforce challenges?\n What actions can the federal government take to address cybersecurity In April 2020, we examined the extent to which OMB and lead agencies addressed key practices for effectively implementing selected government-wide reforms (see figure 3). These included reforms that prioritized solving the cybersecurity workforce shortage by identifying and closing workforce skills gaps and developing a standardized approach to hiring, training, and retaining qualified cybersecurity professionals.\nFigure 3: Extent to Which the Government-Wide Plan to Solve the Cybersecurity Workforce Shortage Addressed Key Reform Practices\nWe found that OMB and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) partially addressed most of the key practices associated with effective reforms through their efforts to implement several projects, such as training employees to fill vacant cybersecurity positions and streamlining hiring processes. However, OMB and DHS had not established a dedicated implementation team or a government-wide implementation plan, among other practices. Without these practices in place, OMB and DHS will likely be unable to make significant progress towards solving the cybersecurity workforce shortage. \uf0d8   We recommended several actions aimed at addressing continuing cybersecurity workforce challenges. These recommendations focused on developing a government-wide workforce plan and related supporting practices such as establishing a leadership team and crafting an implementation plan. Government- wide leadership responsibility for cyber workforce issues transitioned in 2022 from OMB and DHS to the Office of the National Cyber Director. Since the transition, the Director has committed to developing a national strategy that addresses cyber training and education, digital awareness, and the cyber workforce. This commitment is consistent with the current Administration\u2019s management agenda, which states that the Administration must identify and address critical skills gaps across the federal IT and cybersecurity workforce.

No text of specified style in document.\n Chairman Rosendale, Ranking Member Cherfilus-McCormick, and Members of the Subcommittee:\nThank you for having me here today to discuss our work on contracting for and managing IT at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\nVA depends on critical underlying IT systems to manage benefits and provide care to millions of veterans and their families. VA\u2019s use of IT includes hundreds of information systems, thousands of computers, and a computer network with hundreds of thousands of user accounts. As a result, VA has among the highest obligations in the federal government for IT procurement.1 From fiscal years 2017 through 2021, VA obligated over $25 billion on contracts and orders to procure a range of IT products, systems, and services.2\nWe and VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General have reported on VA\u2019s challenges with managing its major IT acquisitions, including its financial management system and electronic health record modernization initiatives, which have experienced schedule delays.3 In 2015, we added VA health care to our High-Risk List due, in part, to its IT challenges. VA has implemented 24 recommendations we have made since 2010 to address its health care IT challenges. VA has not yet implemented 22 recommendations, including 15 related to the department\u2019s electronic health record modernization effort. However, VA challenges go beyond IT management. In 2019 we added VA acquisition management to our High- Risk List as a result of the department\u2019s significant contract obligations and numerous challenges to efficient acquisitions.4 VA has implemented \nError!

Specifically, FITARA requires that agency CIOs review and approve IT contracts prior to award, unless that contract is associated with a non- major investment.11 When the contract is associated with a non-major investment, the CIO may delegate the review and approval duties to an official who reports directly to the CIO. Alternatively, the law states that an agency may use its governance processes to approve any IT contract, as long as the agency CIO is a full participant in the governance processes.\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance released in June 2015 described how agencies are to implement FITARA.12 The guidance emphasized the need for CIOs to have full accountability for IT acquisition and management decisions, and gives agencies considerable flexibility in making those decisions.13 Specifically, with regard to CIOs\u2019 review and approval of IT contracts, OMB\u2019s guidance provides:\n\u2022   Agencies may not approve acquisition strategies and plans that include IT without CIO review and approval;14\n\u2022   CIOs can designate other agency officials to act as their representatives, but the CIOs must retain accountability;15\n\u2022   Chief Acquisition Officers are responsible for ensuring that all IT contract actions are consistent with CIO-approved acquisition strategies and plans; and \u2022   Chief Acquisition Officers are to indicate to the CIOs when planned acquisition strategies and acquisition plans include IT.\nVA\u2019s FITARA approval process guidance from August 2020 requires the CIO or other authorized representative to review the acquisition strategies of VA\u2019s IT and IT-related procurements prior to solicitation and contract award.16 This process is intended to ensure that the CIO has visibility into and accountability over all IT across the department. For acquisitions with estimated total contract lifecycle costs under $15 million, VA guidance allows the CIO to delegate the FITARA review and approval to another \nError! No text of specified style in document.\n appropriate official.17 Further, the guidance states that contracting officials may not enter into a contract or other agreement for IT or IT-related products or services without receiving FITARA approval. Based on definitions in VA\u2019s August 2020 guidance and subsequent policy issued in January 2023, VA requires FITARA review and approval for all procurements using IT funds and all procurements categorized with IT product and service codes.18\nVA\u2019s IT Contract Obligations Increased as Number of\nIn 2022, we reported that from fiscal years 2017 through 2021, total IT contract obligations increased by more than half, while the number of contractors receiving awards decreased by more than a quarter (see fig. 19 1). Contractors Decreased\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n Figure 1: Department of Veterans Affairs IT Contract Obligations and Number of Contractors Receiving IT Contract Obligations\n Technology modernization initiatives and COVID-19 pandemic response efforts drove the growth in IT contract obligations. Large technology modernization initiatives included electronic health records modernization and replacement of VA\u2019s legacy financial management system. In addition, VA obligated over $2 billion for IT as part of the agency\u2019s response to COVID-19 in fiscal years 2020 and 2021. Meanwhile, a potential driver of the decrease in contractors despite rising obligations is that from fiscal years 2017 through 2021, the number of new IT contracts awarded and orders issued fell by more than half. At the same time, the average total contract and order value of new awards\u2014as identified in the Federal Procurement Data System\u2014almost tripled.20 VA officials told us that the department had made a concerted effort to consolidate customer IT requirements, which resulted in fewer\u2014though larger\u2014IT procurements. Our prior work on government-wide contracting for common products and services through initiatives such as strategic\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n sourcing and category management likewise showed a decrease in the number of contractors providing such products and services.21\nAcross fiscal years 2017 through 2021, VA also made an increasing proportion of IT obligations via modifications adding funding to existing contracts and orders, compared with those made via new contracts and orders. VA officials told us that the department increasingly exercised options to extend performance on existing contracts, rather than awarding new ones. These overall trends were mirrored in VA\u2019s IT contracting with service-disabled veteran-owned or veteran-owned small businesses. While obligations to these businesses increased almost 30 percent, the number of such contractors fell by more than 10 percent.\nWe also found an increasing concentration of obligations to a small group of contractors. The proportion of obligations received by the 10 contractors with the most IT obligations in a given year grew from 45 percent in fiscal year 2017 to 56 percent in fiscal year 2021. More broadly, 30 contractors received about 75 percent of all VA IT obligations over this period.\nVA increasingly concentrated obligations on two particular contract vehicles\u2014including the Transformation Twenty-One Total Technology Next Generation (T4NG) contract\u2014which by fiscal year 2021 together accounted for over half of all VA\u2019s IT contract obligations. These two contract vehicles consist of indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts awarded to multiple contractors.22 Agencies may use this type of contract when they do not know the exact quantities and delivery times of needed products and services at the time of contract award. Once awarded, an agency places orders against the contract for specific products or services as needs arise. The order generally must be competed, through fair opportunity, among all the contract holders.23 VA\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n officials told us that potential reasons for increased use of these contracts included a streamlined acquisition process, cost savings, and the ease with which contracting officers could identify small businesses capable of meeting IT requirements.\nWe also analyzed procurement data on competition rates for IT contracting. Overall, VA\u2019s 76 percent competition rate for IT contracting for fiscal years 2017 through 2021 was lower than the 82 percent rate for non-IT contracting.24 We found that one large contract for the electronic health record modernization initiative represented over 50 percent of the total obligations for contracts or orders identified as awarded or issued noncompetitively. VA awarded this contract noncompetitively to Cerner Government Services, Inc. in 2018. VA\u2019s competition rate for IT contracting was similar to that for IT contracting at comparable federal agencies.25 VA also achieved competition rates of over 90 percent on its two primary indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract vehicles.\nVA\u2019s IT-Related Assets and Activities Were Not with CIO Approval\nAs we reported in March 2023, VA procured IT and IT-related assets and activities that were often not approved by its CIO.26 Specifically, VA awarded 11,644 new contract actions categorized as IT between March 2018 and the end of fiscal year 2021. VA did not provide evidence of CIO approval for 4,513 (or 39 percent) of these contract actions. Consistently Procured Our in-depth review of 26 selected IT contract actions from fiscal year 2021 found that 12 had documentation showing approval by appropriate agency officials at the required level of authority. The remaining 14 contract actions lacked CIO approval documentation. Of these, one was managed by the Technology Acquisition Center\u2014charged with centralized management of IT procurements\u2014and 13 were managed by\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n contracting offices without an IT focus. Figure 2 illustrates the results of our review of selected contract actions by type of contracting office.\nFigure 2: Selected Fiscal Year 2021 IT Contract Actions Approved through the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) Approval Process, by Type of Contracting Office\n According to VA officials, their contracting systems lack an automated control that would remind contracting officers of CIO review and approval requirements. Without an automated check or control to ensure contracting officer compliance, it is likely that there will continue to be IT procurements that will not be routed for CIO review, particularly for the contracting offices that are not IT-focused. The lack of visibility into the procurement of much of VA\u2019s IT assets and activities constrained the CIO\u2019s opportunity to provide input on current and planned IT acquisitions.\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n This, in turn, could result in awarding contracts that are duplicative or poorly conceived.\nAccordingly, we made a recommendation to the Secretary of VA to direct the CIO and Chief Acquisition Officer to implement automated controls into relevant contracting systems to help ensure that IT and IT-related assets and activities are appropriately identified for VA\u2019s FITARA approval process. The department agreed with our recommendation. VA\u2019s comments included a list of proposed activities that it is considering as part of an action plan to implement our recommendation. If this proposed approach is carried out effectively, VA should be able to address the issue.\nIn summary, VA has taken important actions to establish a process for reviewing IT and IT-related assets and activities. However, gaps remain that continue to obscure the complete view of IT investments throughout the department. Consequently, while many IT acquisitions have been appropriately examined in the last 4 years according to VA\u2019s FITARA approval process, the department falls short of demonstrating that the CIO has reviewed all IT assets and activities. As VA IT obligations continue to increase, full visibility into the procurement of VA\u2019s IT assets and activities will help to ensure that the CIO is able to provide input on current and planned IT acquisitions. We will continue to track VA\u2019s progress in response to our related recommendation.\nChairman Rosendale, Ranking Member Cherfilus-McCormick, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.

No text of specified style in document.\n Chairman Rosendale, Ranking Member Cherfilus-McCormick, and Members of the Subcommittee:\nThank you for having me here today to discuss our work on contracting for and managing IT at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\nVA depends on critical underlying IT systems to manage benefits and provide care to millions of veterans and their families. VA\u2019s use of IT includes hundreds of information systems, thousands of computers, and a computer network with hundreds of thousands of user accounts. As a result, VA has among the highest obligations in the federal government for IT procurement.1 From fiscal years 2017 through 2021, VA obligated over $25 billion on contracts and orders to procure a range of IT products, systems, and services.2\nWe and VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General have reported on VA\u2019s challenges with managing its major IT acquisitions, including its financial management system and electronic health record modernization initiatives, which have experienced schedule delays.3 In 2015, we added VA health care to our High-Risk List due, in part, to its IT challenges. VA has implemented 24 recommendations we have made since 2010 to address its health care IT challenges. VA has not yet implemented 22 recommendations, including 15 related to the department\u2019s electronic health record modernization effort. However, VA challenges go beyond IT management. In 2019 we added VA acquisition management to our High- Risk List as a result of the department\u2019s significant contract obligations and numerous challenges to efficient acquisitions.4 VA has implemented \nError!

Specifically, FITARA requires that agency CIOs review and approve IT contracts prior to award, unless that contract is associated with a non- major investment.11 When the contract is associated with a non-major investment, the CIO may delegate the review and approval duties to an official who reports directly to the CIO. Alternatively, the law states that an agency may use its governance processes to approve any IT contract, as long as the agency CIO is a full participant in the governance processes.\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance released in June 2015 described how agencies are to implement FITARA.12 The guidance emphasized the need for CIOs to have full accountability for IT acquisition and management decisions, and gives agencies considerable flexibility in making those decisions.13 Specifically, with regard to CIOs\u2019 review and approval of IT contracts, OMB\u2019s guidance provides:\n\u2022   Agencies may not approve acquisition strategies and plans that include IT without CIO review and approval;14\n\u2022   CIOs can designate other agency officials to act as their representatives, but the CIOs must retain accountability;15\n\u2022   Chief Acquisition Officers are responsible for ensuring that all IT contract actions are consistent with CIO-approved acquisition strategies and plans; and \u2022   Chief Acquisition Officers are to indicate to the CIOs when planned acquisition strategies and acquisition plans include IT.\nVA\u2019s FITARA approval process guidance from August 2020 requires the CIO or other authorized representative to review the acquisition strategies of VA\u2019s IT and IT-related procurements prior to solicitation and contract award.16 This process is intended to ensure that the CIO has visibility into and accountability over all IT across the department. For acquisitions with estimated total contract lifecycle costs under $15 million, VA guidance allows the CIO to delegate the FITARA review and approval to another \nError! No text of specified style in document.\n appropriate official.17 Further, the guidance states that contracting officials may not enter into a contract or other agreement for IT or IT-related products or services without receiving FITARA approval. Based on definitions in VA\u2019s August 2020 guidance and subsequent policy issued in January 2023, VA requires FITARA review and approval for all procurements using IT funds and all procurements categorized with IT product and service codes.18\nVA\u2019s IT Contract Obligations Increased as Number of\nIn 2022, we reported that from fiscal years 2017 through 2021, total IT contract obligations increased by more than half, while the number of contractors receiving awards decreased by more than a quarter (see fig. 19 1). Contractors Decreased\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n Figure 1: Department of Veterans Affairs IT Contract Obligations and Number of Contractors Receiving IT Contract Obligations\n Technology modernization initiatives and COVID-19 pandemic response efforts drove the growth in IT contract obligations. Large technology modernization initiatives included electronic health records modernization and replacement of VA\u2019s legacy financial management system. In addition, VA obligated over $2 billion for IT as part of the agency\u2019s response to COVID-19 in fiscal years 2020 and 2021. Meanwhile, a potential driver of the decrease in contractors despite rising obligations is that from fiscal years 2017 through 2021, the number of new IT contracts awarded and orders issued fell by more than half. At the same time, the average total contract and order value of new awards\u2014as identified in the Federal Procurement Data System\u2014almost tripled.20 VA officials told us that the department had made a concerted effort to consolidate customer IT requirements, which resulted in fewer\u2014though larger\u2014IT procurements. Our prior work on government-wide contracting for common products and services through initiatives such as strategic\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n sourcing and category management likewise showed a decrease in the number of contractors providing such products and services.21\nAcross fiscal years 2017 through 2021, VA also made an increasing proportion of IT obligations via modifications adding funding to existing contracts and orders, compared with those made via new contracts and orders. VA officials told us that the department increasingly exercised options to extend performance on existing contracts, rather than awarding new ones. These overall trends were mirrored in VA\u2019s IT contracting with service-disabled veteran-owned or veteran-owned small businesses. While obligations to these businesses increased almost 30 percent, the number of such contractors fell by more than 10 percent.\nWe also found an increasing concentration of obligations to a small group of contractors. The proportion of obligations received by the 10 contractors with the most IT obligations in a given year grew from 45 percent in fiscal year 2017 to 56 percent in fiscal year 2021. More broadly, 30 contractors received about 75 percent of all VA IT obligations over this period.\nVA increasingly concentrated obligations on two particular contract vehicles\u2014including the Transformation Twenty-One Total Technology Next Generation (T4NG) contract\u2014which by fiscal year 2021 together accounted for over half of all VA\u2019s IT contract obligations. These two contract vehicles consist of indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts awarded to multiple contractors.22 Agencies may use this type of contract when they do not know the exact quantities and delivery times of needed products and services at the time of contract award. Once awarded, an agency places orders against the contract for specific products or services as needs arise. The order generally must be competed, through fair opportunity, among all the contract holders.23 VA\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n officials told us that potential reasons for increased use of these contracts included a streamlined acquisition process, cost savings, and the ease with which contracting officers could identify small businesses capable of meeting IT requirements.\nWe also analyzed procurement data on competition rates for IT contracting. Overall, VA\u2019s 76 percent competition rate for IT contracting for fiscal years 2017 through 2021 was lower than the 82 percent rate for non-IT contracting.24 We found that one large contract for the electronic health record modernization initiative represented over 50 percent of the total obligations for contracts or orders identified as awarded or issued noncompetitively. VA awarded this contract noncompetitively to Cerner Government Services, Inc. in 2018. VA\u2019s competition rate for IT contracting was similar to that for IT contracting at comparable federal agencies.25 VA also achieved competition rates of over 90 percent on its two primary indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract vehicles.\nVA\u2019s IT-Related Assets and Activities Were Not with CIO Approval\nAs we reported in March 2023, VA procured IT and IT-related assets and activities that were often not approved by its CIO.26 Specifically, VA awarded 11,644 new contract actions categorized as IT between March 2018 and the end of fiscal year 2021. VA did not provide evidence of CIO approval for 4,513 (or 39 percent) of these contract actions. Consistently Procured Our in-depth review of 26 selected IT contract actions from fiscal year 2021 found that 12 had documentation showing approval by appropriate agency officials at the required level of authority. The remaining 14 contract actions lacked CIO approval documentation. Of these, one was managed by the Technology Acquisition Center\u2014charged with centralized management of IT procurements\u2014and 13 were managed by\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n contracting offices without an IT focus. Figure 2 illustrates the results of our review of selected contract actions by type of contracting office.\nFigure 2: Selected Fiscal Year 2021 IT Contract Actions Approved through the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) Approval Process, by Type of Contracting Office\n According to VA officials, their contracting systems lack an automated control that would remind contracting officers of CIO review and approval requirements. Without an automated check or control to ensure contracting officer compliance, it is likely that there will continue to be IT procurements that will not be routed for CIO review, particularly for the contracting offices that are not IT-focused. The lack of visibility into the procurement of much of VA\u2019s IT assets and activities constrained the CIO\u2019s opportunity to provide input on current and planned IT acquisitions.\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n This, in turn, could result in awarding contracts that are duplicative or poorly conceived.\nAccordingly, we made a recommendation to the Secretary of VA to direct the CIO and Chief Acquisition Officer to implement automated controls into relevant contracting systems to help ensure that IT and IT-related assets and activities are appropriately identified for VA\u2019s FITARA approval process. The department agreed with our recommendation. VA\u2019s comments included a list of proposed activities that it is considering as part of an action plan to implement our recommendation. If this proposed approach is carried out effectively, VA should be able to address the issue.\nIn summary, VA has taken important actions to establish a process for reviewing IT and IT-related assets and activities. However, gaps remain that continue to obscure the complete view of IT investments throughout the department. Consequently, while many IT acquisitions have been appropriately examined in the last 4 years according to VA\u2019s FITARA approval process, the department falls short of demonstrating that the CIO has reviewed all IT assets and activities. As VA IT obligations continue to increase, full visibility into the procurement of VA\u2019s IT assets and activities will help to ensure that the CIO is able to provide input on current and planned IT acquisitions. We will continue to track VA\u2019s progress in response to our related recommendation.\nChairman Rosendale, Ranking Member Cherfilus-McCormick, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.

No text of specified style in document.\n Chairman Rosendale, Ranking Member Cherfilus-McCormick, and Members of the Subcommittee:\nThank you for having me here today to discuss our work on contracting for and managing IT at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\nVA depends on critical underlying IT systems to manage benefits and provide care to millions of veterans and their families. VA\u2019s use of IT includes hundreds of information systems, thousands of computers, and a computer network with hundreds of thousands of user accounts. As a result, VA has among the highest obligations in the federal government for IT procurement.1 From fiscal years 2017 through 2021, VA obligated over $25 billion on contracts and orders to procure a range of IT products, systems, and services.2\nWe and VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General have reported on VA\u2019s challenges with managing its major IT acquisitions, including its financial management system and electronic health record modernization initiatives, which have experienced schedule delays.3 In 2015, we added VA health care to our High-Risk List due, in part, to its IT challenges. VA has implemented 24 recommendations we have made since 2010 to address its health care IT challenges. VA has not yet implemented 22 recommendations, including 15 related to the department\u2019s electronic health record modernization effort. However, VA challenges go beyond IT management. In 2019 we added VA acquisition management to our High- Risk List as a result of the department\u2019s significant contract obligations and numerous challenges to efficient acquisitions.4 VA has implemented \nError!

Specifically, FITARA requires that agency CIOs review and approve IT contracts prior to award, unless that contract is associated with a non- major investment.11 When the contract is associated with a non-major investment, the CIO may delegate the review and approval duties to an official who reports directly to the CIO. Alternatively, the law states that an agency may use its governance processes to approve any IT contract, as long as the agency CIO is a full participant in the governance processes.\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance released in June 2015 described how agencies are to implement FITARA.12 The guidance emphasized the need for CIOs to have full accountability for IT acquisition and management decisions, and gives agencies considerable flexibility in making those decisions.13 Specifically, with regard to CIOs\u2019 review and approval of IT contracts, OMB\u2019s guidance provides:\n\u2022   Agencies may not approve acquisition strategies and plans that include IT without CIO review and approval;14\n\u2022   CIOs can designate other agency officials to act as their representatives, but the CIOs must retain accountability;15\n\u2022   Chief Acquisition Officers are responsible for ensuring that all IT contract actions are consistent with CIO-approved acquisition strategies and plans; and \u2022   Chief Acquisition Officers are to indicate to the CIOs when planned acquisition strategies and acquisition plans include IT.\nVA\u2019s FITARA approval process guidance from August 2020 requires the CIO or other authorized representative to review the acquisition strategies of VA\u2019s IT and IT-related procurements prior to solicitation and contract award.16 This process is intended to ensure that the CIO has visibility into and accountability over all IT across the department. For acquisitions with estimated total contract lifecycle costs under $15 million, VA guidance allows the CIO to delegate the FITARA review and approval to another \nError! No text of specified style in document.\n appropriate official.17 Further, the guidance states that contracting officials may not enter into a contract or other agreement for IT or IT-related products or services without receiving FITARA approval. Based on definitions in VA\u2019s August 2020 guidance and subsequent policy issued in January 2023, VA requires FITARA review and approval for all procurements using IT funds and all procurements categorized with IT product and service codes.18\nVA\u2019s IT Contract Obligations Increased as Number of\nIn 2022, we reported that from fiscal years 2017 through 2021, total IT contract obligations increased by more than half, while the number of contractors receiving awards decreased by more than a quarter (see fig. 19 1). Contractors Decreased\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n Figure 1: Department of Veterans Affairs IT Contract Obligations and Number of Contractors Receiving IT Contract Obligations\n Technology modernization initiatives and COVID-19 pandemic response efforts drove the growth in IT contract obligations. Large technology modernization initiatives included electronic health records modernization and replacement of VA\u2019s legacy financial management system. In addition, VA obligated over $2 billion for IT as part of the agency\u2019s response to COVID-19 in fiscal years 2020 and 2021. Meanwhile, a potential driver of the decrease in contractors despite rising obligations is that from fiscal years 2017 through 2021, the number of new IT contracts awarded and orders issued fell by more than half. At the same time, the average total contract and order value of new awards\u2014as identified in the Federal Procurement Data System\u2014almost tripled.20 VA officials told us that the department had made a concerted effort to consolidate customer IT requirements, which resulted in fewer\u2014though larger\u2014IT procurements. Our prior work on government-wide contracting for common products and services through initiatives such as strategic\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n sourcing and category management likewise showed a decrease in the number of contractors providing such products and services.21\nAcross fiscal years 2017 through 2021, VA also made an increasing proportion of IT obligations via modifications adding funding to existing contracts and orders, compared with those made via new contracts and orders. VA officials told us that the department increasingly exercised options to extend performance on existing contracts, rather than awarding new ones. These overall trends were mirrored in VA\u2019s IT contracting with service-disabled veteran-owned or veteran-owned small businesses. While obligations to these businesses increased almost 30 percent, the number of such contractors fell by more than 10 percent.\nWe also found an increasing concentration of obligations to a small group of contractors. The proportion of obligations received by the 10 contractors with the most IT obligations in a given year grew from 45 percent in fiscal year 2017 to 56 percent in fiscal year 2021. More broadly, 30 contractors received about 75 percent of all VA IT obligations over this period.\nVA increasingly concentrated obligations on two particular contract vehicles\u2014including the Transformation Twenty-One Total Technology Next Generation (T4NG) contract\u2014which by fiscal year 2021 together accounted for over half of all VA\u2019s IT contract obligations. These two contract vehicles consist of indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contracts awarded to multiple contractors.22 Agencies may use this type of contract when they do not know the exact quantities and delivery times of needed products and services at the time of contract award. Once awarded, an agency places orders against the contract for specific products or services as needs arise. The order generally must be competed, through fair opportunity, among all the contract holders.23 VA\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n officials told us that potential reasons for increased use of these contracts included a streamlined acquisition process, cost savings, and the ease with which contracting officers could identify small businesses capable of meeting IT requirements.\nWe also analyzed procurement data on competition rates for IT contracting. Overall, VA\u2019s 76 percent competition rate for IT contracting for fiscal years 2017 through 2021 was lower than the 82 percent rate for non-IT contracting.24 We found that one large contract for the electronic health record modernization initiative represented over 50 percent of the total obligations for contracts or orders identified as awarded or issued noncompetitively. VA awarded this contract noncompetitively to Cerner Government Services, Inc. in 2018. VA\u2019s competition rate for IT contracting was similar to that for IT contracting at comparable federal agencies.25 VA also achieved competition rates of over 90 percent on its two primary indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity contract vehicles.\nVA\u2019s IT-Related Assets and Activities Were Not with CIO Approval\nAs we reported in March 2023, VA procured IT and IT-related assets and activities that were often not approved by its CIO.26 Specifically, VA awarded 11,644 new contract actions categorized as IT between March 2018 and the end of fiscal year 2021. VA did not provide evidence of CIO approval for 4,513 (or 39 percent) of these contract actions. Consistently Procured Our in-depth review of 26 selected IT contract actions from fiscal year 2021 found that 12 had documentation showing approval by appropriate agency officials at the required level of authority. The remaining 14 contract actions lacked CIO approval documentation. Of these, one was managed by the Technology Acquisition Center\u2014charged with centralized management of IT procurements\u2014and 13 were managed by\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n contracting offices without an IT focus. Figure 2 illustrates the results of our review of selected contract actions by type of contracting office.\nFigure 2: Selected Fiscal Year 2021 IT Contract Actions Approved through the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) Approval Process, by Type of Contracting Office\n According to VA officials, their contracting systems lack an automated control that would remind contracting officers of CIO review and approval requirements. Without an automated check or control to ensure contracting officer compliance, it is likely that there will continue to be IT procurements that will not be routed for CIO review, particularly for the contracting offices that are not IT-focused. The lack of visibility into the procurement of much of VA\u2019s IT assets and activities constrained the CIO\u2019s opportunity to provide input on current and planned IT acquisitions.\nError! No text of specified style in document.\n This, in turn, could result in awarding contracts that are duplicative or poorly conceived.\nAccordingly, we made a recommendation to the Secretary of VA to direct the CIO and Chief Acquisition Officer to implement automated controls into relevant contracting systems to help ensure that IT and IT-related assets and activities are appropriately identified for VA\u2019s FITARA approval process. The department agreed with our recommendation. VA\u2019s comments included a list of proposed activities that it is considering as part of an action plan to implement our recommendation. If this proposed approach is carried out effectively, VA should be able to address the issue.\nIn summary, VA has taken important actions to establish a process for reviewing IT and IT-related assets and activities. However, gaps remain that continue to obscure the complete view of IT investments throughout the department. Consequently, while many IT acquisitions have been appropriately examined in the last 4 years according to VA\u2019s FITARA approval process, the department falls short of demonstrating that the CIO has reviewed all IT assets and activities. As VA IT obligations continue to increase, full visibility into the procurement of VA\u2019s IT assets and activities will help to ensure that the CIO is able to provide input on current and planned IT acquisitions.

Washington, DC  20548\nComptroller General of the United States\nMay 3, 2023\n The Honorable Miguel Cardona Secretary of Education U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20202\nPriority Open Recommendations: Department of Education\nDear Secretary Cardona:\nThe purpose of this letter is to provide an update on the overall status of the Department of Education\u2019s implementation of GAO\u2019s recommendations and to call your continued attention to areas where open recommendations should be given high priority.1 In November 2022, we reported that on a government-wide basis, 77 percent of our recommendations made 4 years ago were implemented.2 Education\u2019s recommendation implementation rate was 83 percent. As of March 2023, Education had 88 open recommendations. Fully implementing these open recommendations could significantly improve agency operations.\nSince our June 2022 letter, Education has implemented two of five priority recommendations:\n\u2022  Education issued guidance on services available to parents placing students with a disability in a private school and worked with states to ensure their policies and procedures were consistent with this guidance. These efforts implement our November 2017 recommendation for the agency to work with states to provide accurate information on changes in special education rights when a parent places a student with a disability in a private school.3\n\u2022  Education implemented our November 2015 recommendation to clarify instructions and guidance to servicers of federal student loans in the Direct Loan program. The agency issued guidance to improve clarity on how servicers should apply overpayments to a borrower's student loan balance and how to treat retirement benefits when calculating borrowers' incomes for Income-Driven Repayment plans. Education is also redesigning  its student loan financial services system, which will include guidance to servicers. These efforts will provide more consistent services to borrowers.4\nWe ask for your continued attention to the three remaining priority recommendations identified in the 2022 letter. We are adding three new recommendations related to TRIO grants for college students with disabilities, Education\u2019s privacy program, and the Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) cost estimation guidance for acquisition programs, bringing the total number of priority recommendations to six. (See the enclosure for a list of these recommendations and actions needed to implement them.)\nThe six priority recommendations fall into the following areas.\nProtecting the investment in higher education. The Department of Education faces challenges overseeing federal student aid and loan programs as student loan debt approaches $1.6 trillion. Our three recommendations in this area call for evaluating the effectiveness of efforts to assist students who receive federal student aid, assessing the performance of a TRIO grant program that supports college students with disabilities, and improving FSA\u2019s cost estimation guidance for acquisition programs. By fully implementing these recommendations, Education could better serve the needs of federal student aid and TRIO participants, and improve the reliability of the cost estimates FSA develops for its acquisition programs.\nEnsuring the well-being and education of the nation\u2019s school-age children. Education plays a critical role in helping support approximately 50 million children who attend the nation\u2019s K-12 public schools. Implementing our three priority recommendations in this area, including improving data on virtual charter school contractors and establishing a time frame to update privacy procedures, could help states address financial risks associated with charter school management organizations, improve reporting on restraint and seclusion incidents, and effectively implement privacy protections.\n --     --     --     --     --\n In April 2023, we issued our biennial update to our High-Risk List, which identifies government operations with greater vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement or the need for transformation to address economy, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges.5\nSeveral government-wide high-risk areas have direct implications for Education and its operations. These include (1) improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations, (2) improving strategic human capital management, (3) managing federal real property, (4) ensuring the cybersecurity of the nation,6 and (5) establishing a government-wide personnel security clearance process. \nWe urge your attention to these government-wide high-risk issues as they relate to Education. Progress on high-risk issues has been possible through the concerted actions and efforts of Congress, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the leadership and staff in agencies, including Education. In March 2022, we issued a report on key practices to successfully address high-risk areas, which can be a helpful resource as your agency continues to make progress to address high-risk issues.7\nIn addition to your continued attention to these issues, Congress plays a key role in providing oversight and maintaining focus on our recommendations to ensure they are implemented and produce their desired results. Legislation enacted in December 2022 includes a provision for GAO to identify any additional congressional oversight actions that can help agencies implement priority recommendations and address any underlying issues relating to such implementation.8\nCongress can use various strategies to address our recommendations, such as incorporating them into legislation. Congress can also use its budget, appropriations, and oversight processes to incentivize executive branch agencies to act on our recommendations and monitor their progress. For example, Congress can hold hearings focused on Education\u2019s progress in implementing GAO\u2019s priority recommendations, withhold funds when appropriate, or take other actions to provide incentives to act. Moreover, Congress could follow up during the appropriations process and request periodic updates. Congress also plays a key role in addressing any underlying issues related to the implementation of these recommendations. For example, Congress could pass legislation providing an agency authority to implement a recommendation or requiring an agency to take certain actions to implement a recommendation. In addition, Congress should consider legislation requiring colleges to provide clear and standard information in their financial aid offers, in response to our recent recommendation.9\nCopies of this report are being sent to the Director of the OMB and the appropriate congressional committees. In addition, the report will be available on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.\nI appreciate Education\u2019s continued commitment to these important issues. If you have any questions or would like to discuss any of the issues outlined in this report, please do not hesitate to contact me or Cindy Brown Barnes, Managing Director, Education, Workforce, and Income Security Issues at brownbarnesc@gao.gov or 202-512-7215. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. We will continue to coordinate with your staff on all of the 88 open recommendations.

The office reported that the FSA Chief Operating Officer directed the senior leadership team to establish a working group to identify potential improvements to its project management guidance and practices. To fully implement this recommendation, FSA should update its cost estimate guidance to include all 12 steps of the cost estimating process identified in the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide. Until FSA establishes this revised cost estimating guidance, it is less likely to develop reliable cost estimates for its acquisition programs.

{"content": "441 G St. N.W. Washington, DC  20548\nComptroller General of the United States\nMay 3, 2023\n The Honorable Miguel Cardona Secretary of Education U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20202\nPriority Open Recommendations: Department of Education\nDear Secretary Cardona:\nThe purpose of this letter is to provide an update on the overall status of the Department of Education\u2019s implementation of GAO\u2019s recommendations and to call your continued attention to areas where open recommendations should be given high priority.1 In November 2022, we reported that on a government-wide basis, 77 percent of our recommendations made 4 years ago were implemented.2 Education\u2019s recommendation implementation rate was 83 percent. As of March 2023, Education had 88 open recommendations. Fully implementing these open recommendations could significantly improve agency operations.\nSince our June 2022 letter, Education has implemented two of five priority recommendations:\n\u2022  Education issued guidance on services available to parents placing students with a disability in a private school and worked with states to ensure their policies and procedures were consistent with this guidance. These efforts implement our November 2017 recommendation for the agency to work with states to provide accurate information on changes in special education rights when a parent places a student with a disability in a private school.3\n\u2022  Education implemented our November 2015 recommendation to clarify instructions and guidance to servicers of federal student loans in the Direct Loan program. The agency issued guidance to improve clarity on how servicers should apply overpayments to a borrower's student loan balance and how to treat retirement benefits when calculating borrowers' incomes for Income-Driven Repayment plans. Education is also redesigning  its student loan financial services system, which will include guidance to servicers. These efforts will provide more consistent services to borrowers.4\nWe ask for your continued attention to the three remaining priority recommendations identified in the 2022 letter. We are adding three new recommendations related to TRIO grants for college students with disabilities, Education\u2019s privacy program, and the Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) cost estimation guidance for acquisition programs, bringing the total number of priority recommendations to six. (See the enclosure for a list of these recommendations and actions needed to implement them.)\nThe six priority recommendations fall into the following areas.\nProtecting the investment in higher education. The Department of Education faces challenges overseeing federal student aid and loan programs as student loan debt approaches $1.6 trillion. Our three recommendations in this area call for evaluating the effectiveness of efforts to assist students who receive federal student aid, assessing the performance of a TRIO grant program that supports college students with disabilities, and improving FSA\u2019s cost estimation guidance for acquisition programs. By fully implementing these recommendations, Education could better serve the needs of federal student aid and TRIO participants, and improve the reliability of the cost estimates FSA develops for its acquisition programs.\nEnsuring the well-being and education of the nation\u2019s school-age children. Education plays a critical role in helping support approximately 50 million children who attend the nation\u2019s K-12 public schools. Implementing our three priority recommendations in this area, including improving data on virtual charter school contractors and establishing a time frame to update privacy procedures, could help states address financial risks associated with charter school management organizations, improve reporting on restraint and seclusion incidents, and effectively implement privacy protections.\n --     --     --     --     --\n In April 2023, we issued our biennial update to our High-Risk List, which identifies government operations with greater vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement or the need for transformation to address economy, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges.5\nSeveral government-wide high-risk areas have direct implications for Education and its operations. These include (1) improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations, (2) improving strategic human capital management, (3) managing federal real property, (4) ensuring the cybersecurity of the nation,6 and (5) establishing a government-wide personnel security clearance process. \nWe urge your attention to these government-wide high-risk issues as they relate to Education. Progress on high-risk issues has been possible through the concerted actions and efforts of Congress, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the leadership and staff in agencies, including Education. In March 2022, we issued a report on key practices to successfully address high-risk areas, which can be a helpful resource as your agency continues to make progress to address high-risk issues.7\nIn addition to your continued attention to these issues, Congress plays a key role in providing oversight and maintaining focus on our recommendations to ensure they are implemented and produce their desired results. Legislation enacted in December 2022 includes a provision for GAO to identify any additional congressional oversight actions that can help agencies implement priority recommendations and address any underlying issues relating to such implementation.8\nCongress can use various strategies to address our recommendations, such as incorporating them into legislation. Congress can also use its budget, appropriations, and oversight processes to incentivize executive branch agencies to act on our recommendations and monitor their progress. For example, Congress can hold hearings focused on Education\u2019s progress in implementing GAO\u2019s priority recommendations, withhold funds when appropriate, or take other actions to provide incentives to act. Moreover, Congress could follow up during the appropriations process and request periodic updates. Congress also plays a key role in addressing any underlying issues related to the implementation of these recommendations. For example, Congress could pass legislation providing an agency authority to implement a recommendation or requiring an agency to take certain actions to implement a recommendation. In addition, Congress should consider legislation requiring colleges to provide clear and standard information in their financial aid offers, in response to our recent recommendation.9\nCopies of this report are being sent to the Director of the OMB and the appropriate congressional committees. In addition, the report will be available on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.\nI appreciate Education\u2019s continued commitment to these important issues. If you have any questions or would like to discuss any of the issues outlined in this report, please do not hesitate to contact me or Cindy Brown Barnes, Managing Director, Education, Workforce, and Income Security Issues at brownbarnesc@gao.gov or 202-512-7215. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. We will continue to coordinate with your staff on all of the 88 open recommendations.

The agency plans to collect data from SSS grantees on participants\u2019 disability status and use this information to report on the TRIO program\u2019s performance for participants with disabilities. To fully implement this recommendation, Education needs to complete these efforts.

The office reported that the FSA Chief Operating Officer directed the senior leadership team to establish a working group to identify potential improvements to its project management guidance and practices. To fully implement this recommendation, FSA should update its cost estimate guidance to include all 12 steps of the cost estimating process identified in the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide.

The agency reported that it has begun updating existing privacy policies, including those establishing and administering the privacy program. To fully implement this recommendation, the agency needs to finish updating its policies and procedures regarding record notices. Without fully establishing this element of its privacy program, Education will have less assurance that it is consistently and effectively implementing privacy protections.\nDirector: Jennifer Franks, Information Technology and Cybersecurity\nContact Information: franksj@gao.gov or (404) 679-1831 \nPublic Affairs\nChuck Young, Managing Director, youngc1@gao.gov, (202) 512-4800 U.S. Government Accountability Office, 441 G Street NW, Room 7149 Washington, DC 20548\nStrategic Planning and External Liaison\nStephen J.

Dodaro Comptroller General of the United States\nGAO-23-106864\nLetter\nLetter\n Chair Hassan, Ranking Member Romney, and Members of the Subcommittee:\nI am pleased to be here today to discuss opportunities to reduce fragmentation, overlap, and duplication in the federal government, and help achieve cost savings and other financial benefits. GAO issues annual reports on federal programs, agencies, offices, and initiatives\u2014 either within departments or government-wide\u2014that have duplicative goals or activities.1 As part of this work, GAO also identifies additional opportunities for greater efficiency and effectiveness that result in cost savings, improved program outcomes, or enhanced revenue collection. Opportunities exist for achieving tens of billions of dollars in financial benefits and improving a wide range of federal programs in areas such as healthcare, defense and others throughout government.\nIn our annual reports issued from 2011 to 2023, we have introduced 132 matters for Congress and 1,753 recommendations for federal agencies to eliminate, reduce, or better manage fragmentation, overlap, or duplication; and achieve cost savings or enhance revenues.2 We found that actions from Congress and agencies in these areas had resulted in about $600 billion in financial benefits since 2011. We also estimate tens of billions of additional financial benefits could be attained by fully implementing the remaining open matters and recommendations.\nOur 2023 report we are releasing today\u2014the 13th in this series\u2014includes 100 matters and recommendations across 35 new topic areas for Congress and agencies to improve government efficiency and effectiveness.3 My testimony today describes (1) new topic areas identified in our 2023 annual report, (2) the benefits Congress and federal agencies have achieved in addressing many of the matters and recommendations we have previously identified, and (3) examples of  open matters and recommendations that could yield significant additional benefits.\nMy comments today are based on our 2023 annual report, as well as our update on the progress made in implementing matters and recommendations that we have suggested in our previous annual reports. These efforts are based upon work we previously conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. More details on our scope and methodology, including the definitions we use for fragmentation, overlap, and duplication for this work, can be found in the full report.\nNew Opportunities to Improve Efficiency and Effectiveness across Government\nThe 100 matters and recommendations we identified span the federal government and are opportunities for Congress or federal agencies to improve government efficiency and effectiveness.4 In some areas, we have identified fragmentation, overlap, or duplication in government missions and functions. In others, Congress or federal agencies could take action to reduce the cost of government operations or enhance revenue collections. For example:\n\u2022   Congress should reauthorize the First Responder Network Authority by 2027 to ensure the continuity of the public-safety broadband network and collection of potential revenues of billions of dollars over 15 years. \u2022   The Office of Personnel Management could save hundreds of millions of dollars or more annually by identifying and removing ineligible family members from the Federal Employees Health Benefits program. \u2022   Responsible federal offices need a national broadband internet access strategy and should address any key statutory limitations to better manage fragmented efforts across 15 federal agencies and more than 130 programs. \u2022   The Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Administration for Community Living should identify a mechanism for nine federal programs across four federal agencies to continue sharing falls prevention information with one another and with disability organizations and providers in order to better manage fragmentation and potentially save tens of millions of dollars annually in related medical expenses. \u2022   The Internal Revenue Service should document processes used to address certain compliance risks for COVID-19 employer tax credits, and implement additional compliance activities to potentially recapture tens of millions of dollars or more of ineligible claims. \u2022   The General Services Administration could generate or save millions of dollars in property sales or space reduction opportunities by leveraging lessons learned to help with decision-making processes. \u2022   The Small Business Administration could recover millions of dollars by taking additional steps to identify and respond to potentially fraudulent or ineligible Restaurant Revitalization Fund recipients. \u2022   Congress and federal agencies could better manage fragmentation across the more than 30 federal entities involved in disaster recovery to improve service delivery to disaster survivors and improve the effectiveness of recovery efforts.\nCongress and Federal Agencies Continue to Address Matters and\nCongress and federal agencies have made progress in addressing many of the matters and recommendations we have identified in our annual reports since 2011, as shown in figure 1. As of April 2023, Congress and agencies had fully or partially addressed 1,383 (73 percent) of the 1,885 matters and recommendations; of these, they had fully addressed 1,239 and partially addressed 144.\nRecommendations Identified over the Last 13 Years, Resulting in\nSignificant Benefits\nFigure 1: Status of Duplication and Cost Savings Matters and Recommendations, as of April 2023\nNote: These data include matters and recommendations related to our prior annual reports, from prior GAO reports not previously tracked in this body of work but that have potential financial benefits, and those newly identified in our 2023 annual report. Matters and recommendations categorized as \u201cclosed-not implemented\u201d are no longer assessed. These are generally \u201cclosed-not implemented\u201d when the matter or recommendation is no longer relevant due to changing circumstances.\n As a result of steps Congress and agencies have taken to address these matters and recommendations, we have identified approximately $599.5 billion in total financial benefits, including $46.8 billion identified since our May 2022 report.5\nOur matters and recommendations, when implemented, often result in other benefits, such as (1) more effective government through improved interagency coordination; (2) improvements in major government programs or agencies; (3) reduced mismanagement, fraud, waste, and  abuse; and (4) increased assurance that programs comply with appropriate guidance. For example:\n\u2022   Imported Seafood Safety. In 2017, we reported that most seafood consumed in the United States is imported and about half of it is raised on fish farms.6 Because farmed seafood is raised in confined areas and susceptible to infections, farmers may use drugs, such as antibiotics. The use of unapproved drugs or the misuse of approved drugs may result in unsafe residues in seafood that can cause cancer or allergic reactions, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which is charged with ensuring the safety of most seafood. The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is responsible for ensuring the safety of imported catfish. We reported that the FDA and FSIS independently developed drug testing methods and maximum residue levels for use in seafood. We recommended that FDA and FSIS coordinate and communicate in developing drug residue testing methods and corresponding maximum residue levels for imported seafood, including imported catfish. In response, FDA and FSIS began regularly coordinating and communicating about these issues. Through this coordination, FDA can inform FSIS of its research work, emerging issues regarding drug residue testing in aquatic animals, and the potential for future collaboration on methods; and FSIS can provide FDA any updates on current aquaculture regulatory work and agency research priority projects involving catfish. These steps can help FDA and FSIS better ensure they are taking a consistent approach to ensuring consumer safety from unsafe drug residues.\nAction on Open Matters and Recommendations\nCongress and agencies have taken action on many of the 1,885 matters and recommendations we have identified since 2011. However, further steps are needed to fully address the 527 matters and recommendations that remain open. We estimate that tens of billions of dollars in additional financial benefits could be realized should Congress and agencies fully Could Yield Significant Additional Benefits address these matters and recommendations, and other improvements can be achieved as well, as shown in table 1.7\nIn our 2011 to 2023 annual reports, we identified 1,753 recommendations directed to federal agencies. Of these recommendations, 457 (about 26 percent) remained open as of April 2023, as shown in figure 2.\nFigure 2: Number of Open Duplication and Cost Savings Recommendations by Agency, as of April 2023\nNote: These data include matters and recommendations related to our prior annual reports, from prior GAO reports not previously tracked in this body of work but that have potential financial benefits, and those newly identified in the 2023 annual report. a\u201dOther federal entities\u201d reflects open recommendations directed to the following federal entities: Capitol Police Board, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, The Executive Office of the President, Federal Communications Commission, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, U.S. Agency for International Development, U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.\n In conclusion, we will continue to identify additional or emerging instances of fragmentation, overlap, and duplication where the government could achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness. We will also continue to identify opportunities for cost savings or revenue enhancement. Likewise, we will continue to monitor the progress Congress and federal agencies have made in addressing matters and recommendations we have previously identified. We stand ready to assist this and other committees in achieving a more efficient and effective government for the benefit of the American people.\nThank you, Chair Hassan, Ranking Member Romney, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.

We have determined this is an area in need of transformation. Improving HHS\u2019s leadership and coordination in this area will better prepare the nation for future emergencies and help mitigate their devastating public health and economic effects.\nMy statement today provides information from our prior work on HHS\u2019s leadership and coordination of public health emergencies and describes leading practices for agency reform efforts. This statement is based on the work that led us to designate this area as high risk, as well as our June 2018 report on agency reform leading practices.1\nWe conducted our work in accordance with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance Framework that are relevant to our objectives. The framework requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to meet our stated objectives and to discuss any limitations in our work. We believe that the information and data obtained, and the analysis conducted, provide a reasonable basis for any findings and conclusions in this product.\nHHS Leadership and Coordination of Public Health Emergencies\nOur recent high-risk designation is based on a body of work that found persistent deficiencies for more than a decade in HHS\u2019s ability to perform its leadership role. These deficiencies hindered the nation\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to a variety of other past emergencies, including other infectious diseases\u2014such as the H1N1 influenza pandemic, Zika, and Ebola\u2014and extreme weather events, such as hurricanes. Specifically, HHS\u2019s efforts have fallen short in five key areas of an effective national response:\n\u2022   Clear roles and responsibilities. The unprecedented scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the whole-of-nation response required to address it, highlighted the critical importance of clearly defining the roles and responsibilities for the wide range of federal departments and other key partners involved when preparing for pandemics and addressing unforeseen emergencies. Unclear roles and responsibilities persisted at HHS and affected response efforts. For example, we found that when HHS helped repatriate U.S. citizens from abroad and quarantine them domestically at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent the spread of the virus, significant confusion ensued due to a lack of clarity as to which HHS agency was in charge.2 As a result, HHS put repatriates, its own personnel, and nearby communities at risk. \u2022   Complete and consistent data. Data are critical to inform the response to a public health emergency. However, the data HHS relied on during the COVID-19 pandemic were incomplete and inconsistent, highlighting longstanding concerns in this area. Moreover, we found in 2010, 2017, and again in 2022 that, although required by statute since 2006, HHS had made little progress in implementing a nationwide public health situational awareness capability through an interoperable network of systems to help ensure timely and complete collection of public health data to aid a response.3 Under the existing process\u2014which HHS had to rely on during the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014 public health data are collected by thousands of disparate health departments, health care providers, and laboratories, as well as multiple federal agencies. \u2022   Clear and consistent communication. In the midst of a public health emergency, clear and consistent communication\u2014among all levels of  government, with health care providers, and to the public\u2014is paramount. Our work over the years, including most recently during the COVID-19 pandemic, has found that HHS has provided unclear and inconsistent communication during critical incidents. For example, this was problematic during the H1N1 response when we found that selected state officials reported being overwhelmed by the large volume of, and sometimes inconsistent, information received from HHS and the Department of Homeland Security.4 \u2022   Transparency and accountability. When agencies need to quickly disseminate funding and information during public health emergencies, transparency and accountability are especially critical to help ensure program integrity and build public trust. However, we have found deficiencies in this area both prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, within HHS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) changed its COVID-19 testing guidelines several times over the course of the pandemic with little explanation of the scientific rationale behind the changes.5 This resulted in confusion among the providers and public health stakeholder groups implementing the guidelines and risked the erosion of trust in the federal government. \u2022   Key partners\u2019 capabilities and limitations. We found in September 2019 that, in general, the agency within HHS tasked with leading preparedness and response activities on behalf of the Secretary\u2014the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR)\u2014 had limited capacity. Specifically, its personnel and supplies could support a response to two simultaneous events that occurred in different areas in the continental U.S. for 30 days, according to officials.6 Beyond that, ASPR relies on other response partners, but does not have a complete understanding of the capabilities and limitations of those partners, which creates a vulnerability. Furthermore, we have concerns that ASPR lacks the capability to fully execute its responsibilities. In April 2022, we found that ASPR had not undertaken key workforce planning steps to support the mission and goals of the new office it created to address medical product supply vulnerabilities highlighted during the pandemic.7 Additionally, in June 2020, we found that ASPR had aligned the size of its emergency responder workforce with the agency\u2019s strategic goals and objectives to a limited extent, affecting ASPR\u2019s ability to ensure that the size of the workforce could support its mission.8 We have made 155 recommendations to HHS to help address the aforementioned deficiencies and others we have identified in this area since 2007. As of April 2023, 91 of these recommendations remained unimplemented. We maintain that implementing these remaining recommendations will strengthen HHS\u2019s leadership and coordination of public health emergencies.\nIn our April 2023 update on this high-risk area, we reported that two HHS agencies that play key preparedness and response roles\u2014ASPR and CDC\u2014are undergoing reforms. Specifically, in July 2022, HHS announced that it had elevated ASPR to a stand-alone agency alongside other HHS agencies, such as CDC. According to an HHS statement, this change will ultimately allow ASPR to mobilize a coordinated national emergency response more effectively and efficiently. In August 2022, CDC announced programmatic, scientific, and operational improvements to better support the agency\u2019s public health response during emergencies and in normal operations. These agencies have taken some actions since their initial announcements, which we will continue to monitor. For example, in February 2023, ASPR announced a new organizational structure that, according to ASPR, accounts for the agency\u2019s expanded mission and new capabilities, among other considerations.\nLeading Agency Reform Practices\nWe have identified leading practices for successful agency reforms, by which agencies could address deficiencies such as those that led us to include HHS\u2019s leadership and coordination of public health emergencies on our High-Risk List.9 These leading practices indicate that agencies can successfully change if they have (1) clear goals, (2) follow a process to develop proposed reforms, (3) allocate implementation resources, and (4) consider workforce needs during and after the reform. See table 1 for examples of key questions that Congress can use to assess agencies\u2019 proposals for and implementation of reform efforts, in these four broad categories.\nWe shared these leading practices with HHS in January 2023 to use as it implements its planned reforms. These leading practices, along with the prerequisite of sustained leadership commitment, are essential to helping ensure the country is better prepared for future public health emergencies. Leadership commitment is the critical element for initiating and sustaining progress and making the types of management and operational improvements required to narrow or remove high-risk areas.\nIn closing, it is too soon to tell if HHS\u2019s efforts at reform will address the deficiencies we have identified in our high-risk designation. However, to the extent HHS chooses to follow these leading agency reform practices, they will help the department in its efforts to improve its leadership and coordination of future public health emergencies. The practices can also assist Congress as it oversees HHS\u2019s implementation of these reforms.\nChair Griffith, Ranking Member Castor, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my statement. I would be pleased to respond to any questions you may have.\nGAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments\nFor further information about this statement, please contact Mary Denigan-Macauley at (202) 512-7114 or deniganmacauleym@gao.gov.

HHS's efforts have been found to fall short in five key areas of an effective national response.", "In April 2023, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reported that key agencies involved in preparedness and response, such as ASPR and CDC, are undergoing reforms to enhance their effectiveness and efficiency in emergency response. These agencies have made initial announcements and taken some actions, including the elevation of ASPR to a stand-alone agency and programmatic improvements by CDC, with ongoing monitoring by the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO).", "It is uncertain whether the reform efforts by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) will effectively address the identified deficiencies in their high-risk designation. However, following the leading agency reform practices can aid HHS in improving their leadership and coordination of future public health emergencies, and Congress can use these practices to oversee the implementation of reforms.", "This segment provides information on the prior work conducted by the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) regarding the leadership and coordination of public health emergencies by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).

{"content": "Washington, DC  20548\n April 27, 2023\nThe Honorable Dick Durbin Chairman The Honorable Lindsey Graham Ranking Member Committee on the Judiciary United States Senate\nThe Honorable Jim Jordan Chairman The Honorable Jerrold Nadler Ranking Member Committee on the Judiciary House of Representatives\nCivil Monetary Penalties: Federal Agencies\u2019 Compliance with the 2022 Annual Inflation Adjustment Requirements\nCivil monetary penalties provide federal agencies with the ability to punish willful and egregious violators, deter future violations, and enforce regulatory policies government-wide. However, the penalties may lose their effectiveness, and the government may lose opportunities to collect significant receipts, if agencies do not periodically adjust them to account for inflation. Congress enacted the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (IAA)1 to allow for agencies to adjust their covered civil monetary penalties for inflation, promote compliance, and improve penalty collection.2 The act, as amended,3 includes a provision added in 2015 for GAO to submit a report annually to Congress assessing agency compliance with the required civil monetary penalty adjustments.4 \nThis seventh annual review responds to that statutory requirement. Our objective was to determine how many agencies subject to the IAA published 2022 civil monetary penalty inflation adjustments in the Federal Register as of December 31, 2022, and reported information about civil monetary penalties within each agency\u2019s jurisdiction in the 2022 agency financial report (AFR) submitted under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-136.5 This circular provides guidance to agencies that produce either AFRs or performance and accountability reports, and to government corporations that produce annual management reports.6 For purposes of this report, AFR refers to all three types of reports.\nTo address our objective, we used the list of 48 agencies from our prior report representing the population of agencies that could be subject to the IAA\u2019s applicable provisions.7 To assess completeness of the list, we searched the Federal Register for civil monetary penalty inflation adjustments that agencies not on the list published in calendar year 2022.8 We determined that we should add no agencies and concluded that the list was complete for our purposes.\nWe reviewed agencies\u2019 inflation adjustments published in the Federal Register as of December 31, 2022, and related information reported in the 2022 AFRs. We determined whether the agencies reported information about civil monetary penalties within their jurisdictions, including the 2022 annual inflation adjustment of the civil monetary penalty amounts, pursuant to the IAA and OMB Circular A-136, as applicable.9 We verified neither the accuracy of agencies\u2019 inflation adjustments nor reported civil monetary penalty information. We contacted officials at any agency that had not, in whole or in part, published civil monetary penalty inflation adjustments in the Federal Register or reported civil monetary penalty information in its AFR in order to confirm our findings.\nWe conducted this performance audit from December 2022 to April 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings based on our audit objectives.\nIn summary, 47 of the 48 agencies we reviewed for 2022 that could be subject to certain requirements of the IAA have complied with the applicable provisions. These agencies  published the 2022 annual inflation adjustment of the civil monetary penalty amounts within their jurisdictions in the Federal Register as of December 31, 2022, and reported related information about civil monetary penalties in their 2022 or 2021 AFRs, as the IAA and OMB Circular A-136 require. However, one agency\u2014the Department of the Treasury\u2014did not publish the inflation adjustment in the Federal Register as of December 31, 2022, and did not report in its 2022 AFR the required information for four of its civil monetary penalties. For further details on each agency\u2019s reporting status for 2022, see enclosure I.\nFigure 1 summarizes the status of the required reporting since we issued our first report in August 2017.10 As shown in the figure, our assessments have found that the majority of the agencies that could be subject to the applicable IAA provisions have published the inflation adjustment information and reported all required information in the AFR.\nFigure 1: Federal Agencies Reporting Civil Monetary Penalty Information, Including the Annual Inflation Adjustments, in the Federal Register as of December 31 and in Agency Financial Reports (AFR), 2016\u20132022\n \u00aaFor years 2016 through 2018, our review included 52 agencies that could be subject to applicable provisions of the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended (IAA). In our 2019 review, we removed four agencies\u2014the Department of Homeland Security/Department of Labor (DHS/DOL) joint rulemaking, International Trade Commission (ITC), Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC), and Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). We determined that (1) the DHS/DOL joint rulemaking was not applicable to the 2019 annual inflation adjustment, and both departments reported the required information separately; (2) ITC and TVA had determined that they were not subject to the IAA\u2019s applicable provisions; and (3) PRC was not considered an agency under the definition applicable to the act. Therefore, our review for years 2019 through 2022 included a total of 48 agencies. \u1d47Results reported for 2017 only include our assessment of whether agencies reported all required information in the AFR. We limited our review to agencies\u2019 2017 AFRs, and not the Federal Register publications, for purposes of their 2017 annual inflation adjustment reporting. \nAgency Comments\nWe provided a draft of this report to OMB and Treasury for review. OMB and Treasury informed us that they had no comments on the draft report.\n- - - - -\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Secretary of the Treasury, and other interested parties.

{"content": "Washington, DC  20548\n April 27, 2023\nThe Honorable Dick Durbin Chairman The Honorable Lindsey Graham Ranking Member Committee on the Judiciary United States Senate\nThe Honorable Jim Jordan Chairman The Honorable Jerrold Nadler Ranking Member Committee on the Judiciary House of Representatives\nCivil Monetary Penalties: Federal Agencies\u2019 Compliance with the 2022 Annual Inflation Adjustment Requirements\nCivil monetary penalties provide federal agencies with the ability to punish willful and egregious violators, deter future violations, and enforce regulatory policies government-wide. However, the penalties may lose their effectiveness, and the government may lose opportunities to collect significant receipts, if agencies do not periodically adjust them to account for inflation. Congress enacted the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990 (IAA)1 to allow for agencies to adjust their covered civil monetary penalties for inflation, promote compliance, and improve penalty collection.2 The act, as amended,3 includes a provision added in 2015 for GAO to submit a report annually to Congress assessing agency compliance with the required civil monetary penalty adjustments.4 \nThis seventh annual review responds to that statutory requirement. Our objective was to determine how many agencies subject to the IAA published 2022 civil monetary penalty inflation adjustments in the Federal Register as of December 31, 2022, and reported information about civil monetary penalties within each agency\u2019s jurisdiction in the 2022 agency financial report (AFR) submitted under Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-136.5 This circular provides guidance to agencies that produce either AFRs or performance and accountability reports, and to government corporations that produce annual management reports.6 For purposes of this report, AFR refers to all three types of reports.\nTo address our objective, we used the list of 48 agencies from our prior report representing the population of agencies that could be subject to the IAA\u2019s applicable provisions.7 To assess completeness of the list, we searched the Federal Register for civil monetary penalty inflation adjustments that agencies not on the list published in calendar year 2022.8 We determined that we should add no agencies and concluded that the list was complete for our purposes.\nWe reviewed agencies\u2019 inflation adjustments published in the Federal Register as of December 31, 2022, and related information reported in the 2022 AFRs. We determined whether the agencies reported information about civil monetary penalties within their jurisdictions, including the 2022 annual inflation adjustment of the civil monetary penalty amounts, pursuant to the IAA and OMB Circular A-136, as applicable.9 We verified neither the accuracy of agencies\u2019 inflation adjustments nor reported civil monetary penalty information. We contacted officials at any agency that had not, in whole or in part, published civil monetary penalty inflation adjustments in the Federal Register or reported civil monetary penalty information in its AFR in order to confirm our findings.\nWe conducted this performance audit from December 2022 to April 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings based on our audit objectives.\nIn summary, 47 of the 48 agencies we reviewed for 2022 that could be subject to certain requirements of the IAA have complied with the applicable provisions. These agencies  published the 2022 annual inflation adjustment of the civil monetary penalty amounts within their jurisdictions in the Federal Register as of December 31, 2022, and reported related information about civil monetary penalties in their 2022 or 2021 AFRs, as the IAA and OMB Circular A-136 require. However, one agency\u2014the Department of the Treasury\u2014did not publish the inflation adjustment in the Federal Register as of December 31, 2022, and did not report in its 2022 AFR the required information for four of its civil monetary penalties. For further details on each agency\u2019s reporting status for 2022, see enclosure I.\nFigure 1 summarizes the status of the required reporting since we issued our first report in August 2017.10 As shown in the figure, our assessments have found that the majority of the agencies that could be subject to the applicable IAA provisions have published the inflation adjustment information and reported all required information in the AFR.\nFigure 1: Federal Agencies Reporting Civil Monetary Penalty Information, Including the Annual Inflation Adjustments, in the Federal Register as of December 31 and in Agency Financial Reports (AFR), 2016\u20132022\n \u00aaFor years 2016 through 2018, our review included 52 agencies that could be subject to applicable provisions of the Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended (IAA). In our 2019 review, we removed four agencies\u2014the Department of Homeland Security/Department of Labor (DHS/DOL) joint rulemaking, International Trade Commission (ITC), Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC), and Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). We determined that (1) the DHS/DOL joint rulemaking was not applicable to the 2019 annual inflation adjustment, and both departments reported the required information separately; (2) ITC and TVA had determined that they were not subject to the IAA\u2019s applicable provisions; and (3) PRC was not considered an agency under the definition applicable to the act. Therefore, our review for years 2019 through 2022 included a total of 48 agencies. \u1d47Results reported for 2017 only include our assessment of whether agencies reported all required information in the AFR. We limited our review to agencies\u2019 2017 AFRs, and not the Federal Register publications, for purposes of their 2017 annual inflation adjustment reporting. \nAgency Comments\nWe provided a draft of this report to OMB and Treasury for review. OMB and Treasury informed us that they had no comments on the draft report.\n- - - - -\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the Secretary of the Treasury, and other interested parties.

In addition, ODNI stated that it had taken action to address 10 of them. I urge you to document ODNI's actions taken in response to these recommendations and provide this to us so we can assess the steps taken and determine whether the recommendations can be closed.\nIn addition to addressing GAO\u2019s recommendations, I request your assistance in resolving an issue that is negatively affecting our ability to complete our audit work in a timely manner. Specifically, GAO teams are experiencing significant delays obtaining ODNI\u2019s official comments and security/sensitivity reviews on our draft reports. This has led to delays in the issuance of our work and, thus, the delivery of information to Congress. Given the prolonged nature of some of these delays, we have issued some reports without ODNI\u2019s official comments. This is a decision we made reluctantly, as obtaining and reflecting official input on our reports is a valuable part of our process. Further, it benefits the audited agency as an opportunity to present its reaction to or perspectives on our recommendations. I ask for your support in addressing this issue moving forward.\nThe classified enclosure to this letter identifies 19 priority recommendations, of which several are classified, that directly address challenges in key areas of IC management and have an effect on the IC\u2019s ability to accomplish its mission.4 GAO has not added any priority recommendations since 2022.5 By fully implementing these recommendations, ODNI could improve its ability to help ensure the IC best manages its workforce and infrastructure in order to fulfill its mission of providing intelligence to decision makers, and could improve the IC\u2019s ability to efficiently and effectively perform mission activities. We ask for your continued attention to these 19 priority recommendations, which fall into the following four areas:\n\u2022   Intelligence Enterprise Management. We have five priority recommendations related to IC enterprise business functions, systems, and organizations.\n\u2022  Infrastructure and Facilities. We have two priority recommendations related to planning and management of IC infrastructure and facility projects.\n\u2022  Workforce Management. We have seven priority recommendations related to IC human capital and talent management.\n\u2022  Personnel Vetting. We have five priority recommendations related to the personnel vetting and security clearance process.\n- - - -\nIn April 2023, we issued our biennial update to our High-Risk List, which identifies government operations with greater vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement or the need for transformation to address economy, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges.6\nODNI has key equities related to one of our high-risk areas\u2014the government-wide personnel security clearance process. While we have identified some progress in addressing this high-risk issue, we currently have five priority recommendations directed to ODNI regarding personnel vetting. These recommendations are focused on ensuring the timely completion of  investigations and adjudications and developing performance measures for assessing the quality of all phases of the personnel security clearance process.\nSeveral other government-wide high-risk areas also have direct implications for ODNI and its operations. These include (1) improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations, (2) improving strategic human capital management, (3) managing federal real property, and (4) ensuring the cybersecurity of the nation.7 We urge your attention to the ODNI-specific and government-wide high-risk issues. Progress on high-risk issues has been possible through the concerted actions and efforts of Congress, the Office of Management and Budget, and the leadership and staff in agencies, including within ODNI. In March 2022, we issued a report on key practices to successfully address high-risk areas, which can be a helpful resource as your agency continues to make progress to address high-risk issues.8\nIn addition to your continued attention on these issues, Congress plays a key role in providing oversight and maintaining focus on our recommendations to ensure they are implemented and produce their desired results. Legislation enacted in December 2022 includes a provision for GAO to identify any additional congressional oversight actions that can help agencies implement priority recommendations and address any underlying issues relating to such implementation.9\nThere are various strategies Congress can use in addressing our recommendations, such as incorporating them into legislation. Congress can also use its budget, appropriations, and oversight processes to incentivize executive branch agencies to act on our recommendations and monitor their progress. For example, Congress can hold hearings focused on ODNI\u2019s progress in implementing GAO\u2019s priority recommendations, withhold funds when appropriate, or take other actions to provide incentives for agencies to act. Moreover, Congress could follow up during the appropriations process and request periodic updates. Congress also plays a key role in addressing any underlying issues related to the implementation of these recommendations. For example, Congress could pass legislation providing an agency explicit authority to implement a recommendation or requiring an agency to take certain actions to implement a recommendation.\nCopies of this letter are being sent to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the appropriate congressional committees. In addition, the letter will be available on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.\nI appreciate ODNI\u2019s commitment to these important issues, especially as the United States faces an increasingly complex and interconnected global security environment marked by the growing specter of strategic competition and conflict. If you have any questions or would like to discuss any of the issues outlined in the letter, please do not hesitate to contact me or Cathleen \nA.

Hanson Chairman U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Washington, D.C. 20555-0001\nPriority Open Recommendations: Nuclear Regulatory Commission\nDear Chairman Hanson:\nThe purpose of this letter is to provide an update on the overall status of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2019s (NRC) implementation of GAO\u2019s recommendations and to call your continued personal attention to areas where open recommendations should be given high priority.1 In November 2022, we reported that, on a government-wide basis, 77 percent of our recommendations made 4 years ago were implemented.2 NRC\u2019s recommendation implementation rate for that year was 100 percent, reflecting the implementation of 10 recommendations made in five reports from fiscal year 2018.3 As of March 2023, NRC had 21 open recommendations. Fully implementing these open recommendations could significantly improve agency operations.\nNRC has not implemented any of the five open priority recommendations we identified in our June 2022 letter.4 We ask your continued attention to these five remaining open priority recommendations. We are also adding three new recommendations related to NRC\u2019s materials licensing program and federal agencies\u2019 privacy programs. This brings the total number of priority recommendations to eight. (See enclosure for the list of recommendations.)\nThe eight priority recommendations fall into the following three areas:\nAddressing the security of radiological sources. Implementing our six priority recommendations in this area will better enable NRC to carry out its responsibility for licensing and regulating the secure use of radioactive materials while ensuring the protection of public health and safety and the environment. For example, in July 2022, we recommended that NRC add security features, such as multifactor authentication, to its licensing process to improve the process\u2019s integrity and make it less vulnerable to altering or forging licenses. Additionally, in April 2019, we made another recommendation that NRC consider socioeconomic consequences and fatalities from evacuations in the criteria for determining required security measures for radioactive materials that could be used in a radiological dispersal device (RDD). By implementing these and the four other recommendations, NRC would have greater assurance that bad actors cannot manipulate the system and that it considers the more likely and more significant consequences of a RDD when establishing its security requirements for radioactive material.\nImproving the reliability of cost estimates. NRC develops cost estimates when analyzing the costs and benefits of actions such as modifications to nuclear power plants. These estimates help inform NRC Commissioners\u2019 regulatory decisions. By fully implementing our recommendation to complete and issue its updated cost estimating procedures to align with best practices identified in our cost estimating guide, NRC will better ensure that its cost estimates are reliable and provide the Commissioners with adequate information on which to base their decisions.\nEnsuring the cybersecurity of the nation. Federal agencies can better protect information systems containing personally identifiable information by ensuring that agency policies and procedures fully define and document privacy officials\u2019 roles in reviewing, approving, overseeing and authorizing aspects of these systems. By implementing our one priority recommendation to fully define and document the role of senior agency official, NRC will be in a better position to ensure that privacy protections are adequately incorporated into agency systems that contain personally identifiable information.\n- - - - -\nIn April 2023, we issued our biennial update to our High-Risk List.

Dodaro Comptroller General of the United States\nEnclosure\ncc:    The Honorable Shalanda Young, Director, Office of Management and Budget\nEnclosure\nPriority Open Recommendations to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\nAddressing the Security of Radiological Sources\nNuclear Security: NRC Has Enhanced the Controls of Dangerous Radioactive Materials, but Vulnerabilities Remain. GAO-16-330. Washington, D.C.: July 1, 2016.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2016\nRecommendation: Because some quantities of radioactive materials are potentially dangerous to human health if not properly handled, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) should take action to better track and secure these materials and verify the legitimacy of the licenses for those who seek to possess them. Specifically, NRC should take the steps needed to include category 3 sources in the National Source Tracking System and add agreement state category 3 licenses to the Web-based Licensing System as quickly as reasonably possible.\nActions Needed: NRC neither explicitly agreed nor disagreed with this recommendation but stated that it would consider our recommendation as part of an existing working group. In August 2017, the working group provided a staff analysis on these issues to the Commission and recommended against including category 3 sources in the National Source Tracking System or adding information on agreement state category 3 licenses to the Web-based Licensing System. As of February 2023, NRC had no plans to put category 3 quantities into the National Source Tracking System, according to agency officials. We continue to believe that by implementing our recommendation, NRC would have greater assurance that bad actors could not manipulate the system, such as by altering a paper license to acquire radioactive materials in aggregate greater than what they are authorized to possess.\nRecommendation: Because some quantities of radioactive materials are potentially dangerous to human health if not properly handled, NRC should take action to better track and secure these materials and verify the legitimacy of the licenses for those who seek to possess them. Specifically, NRC should, at least until such time that category 3 licenses can be verified using the License Verification System, require that transferors of category 3 quantities of radioactive materials confirm the validity of a would-be purchaser's radioactive materials license with the appropriate regulatory authority before transferring any category 3 quantities of licensed materials.\nActions Needed: NRC neither explicitly agreed nor disagreed with this recommendation. As of February 2023, NRC was considering a rulemaking that would require that licensees transferring category 3 quantities of radioactive material verify licenses in NRC\u2019s License Verification System or by directly contacting NRC or the agreement state. As a part of the same rulemaking process, NRC is also considering establishing a requirement that safety and security equipment be in place before licenses are granted to such entities. This would address concerns over the potential for unknown entities to obtain valid licenses using false information. However, NRC has not yet proposed this rule. By implementing this recommendation as soon as possible, NRC would be better able to prevent bad actors from manipulating the system and obtaining dangerous quantities of radioactive material.\nCombating Nuclear Terrorism: NRC Needs to Take Additional Actions to Ensure the Security of High-Risk Radioactive Material. GAO-19-468. Washington, D.C.: April 4, 2019.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2019\nRecommendation: The Chairman of NRC should require additional security measures for high- risk quantities of certain category 3 radioactive material and assess whether other category 3 materials should also be safeguarded with additional security measures.\nActions Needed: NRC neither explicitly agreed nor disagreed with this recommendation but stated that it would consider the recommendation as part of an existing working group. In August 2017, the working group provided a staff analysis on these issues to the Commission that concluded that category 3 materials did not require additional security measures. In our April 2019 report, we provided new information such as expert views and studies on the risks of category 3 materials in a radiological dispersal device (RDD)\u2014also known as a dirty bomb. However, as of February 2023, NRC had not updated this analysis to take into account this new information. We continue to believe that by implementing our recommendation, NRC would have greater assurance that its requirements are sufficient to help prevent any high-risk radioactive materials from being stolen and used in a RDD.\nRecommendation: The Chairman of NRC should direct NRC staff to consider socioeconomic consequences and fatalities from evacuations in the criteria for determining what security measures should be required for radioactive materials that could be used in a RDD.\nActions Needed: NRC disagreed with this recommendation, maintaining that the current regulatory requirements provide for the safe and secure use of all radioactive materials, regardless of category. We disagree with NRC\u2019s assessment. About a month after we published our April 2019 report, a small amount of radioactive material was accidentally released at the University of Washington in Seattle. Although the release was not a RDD, it resulted in at least $156 million in cleanup and remediation costs, closure of the medical facility for 2 years, and negative impacts on researchers and medical professionals. This accident illustrates the risk posed by security failures involving similar quantities of material. We continue to believe that by implementing our recommendation, NRC would have better assurance that it considers more likely and more significant consequences of a RDD when establishing its security requirements for radioactive material.\nPreventing a Dirty Bomb: Vulnerabilities Persist in NRC\u2019s Controls for Purchases of High-Risk Radioactive Materials. GAO-22-103441. Washington, D.C.: July 14, 2022.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2022\nRecommendation: The Chairman of NRC should immediately require that vendors verify category 3 licenses with the appropriate regulatory authority.\nActions Needed: NRC partially agreed with this recommendation, and committed to take action to require that vendors verify category 3 licensees with the appropriate regulatory agency, but it did not agree to address these vulnerabilities immediately. As of February 2023, NRC was considering a rulemaking that would require specific measures for licensees to verify licenses for category 3 quantities of radioactive material. However, these vulnerabilities will remain while the rulemaking is under consideration, and we continue to believe NRC should immediately address these issues.\nRecommendation: The Chairman of NRC should add security features to its licensing process to improve its integrity and make it less vulnerable to altering or forging licenses. These security features could include multifactor authentication or moving away from paper licenses to electronic-based licensing.\nActions Needed: NRC agreed with this recommendation. As of February 2023, NRC stated that as part of its ongoing rulemaking process, it would develop additional guidance to regulators and licensees to reduce the potential that altered or counterfeit licenses could be used to purchase category 3 material. This includes exploring the specific methods listed in our recommendation. In addition, we made another recommendation in an Official Use Only version of this report that, if implemented, would reduce the risk of a dirty bomb.9\nDirector: Allison Bawden, Natural Resources and Environment Contact Information: BawdenA@gao.gov, (202) 512-3841\nImproving the Reliability of Cost Estimates\nNuclear Regulatory Commission: NRC Needs to Improve Its Cost Estimates by Incorporating More Best Practices. GAO-15-98. Washington, D.C.: December 12, 2014.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2014\nRecommendation: To improve the reliability of its cost estimates, as NRC revises its cost estimating procedures, the NRC Chairman should ensure that the agency aligns the procedures with relevant cost estimating best practices identified in the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide and ensure that future cost estimates are prepared in accordance with relevant cost estimating best practices.10\nActions Needed: NRC generally agreed with the recommendation. NRC updated a draft of its cost estimating procedures in January 2020 to conform with agency-wide directives and provided it to the NRC Commissioners for their review. However, NRC has not issued the final procedures. To fully implement this recommendation, NRC needs to issue its update to its cost estimating procedures to align with best practices identified in our cost estimating guide. By doing so, NRC will have better assurance that its cost estimates are reliable and that the NRC Commissioners have adequate information on which to base their regulatory decisions.\nDirector: Frank Rusco, Natural Resources and Environment Contact Information: RuscoF@gao.gov, (202) 512-3841\nEnsuring the Cybersecurity of the Nation\nPrivacy: Dedicated Leadership Can Improve Programs and Address Challenges, GAO-22- 105065. Washington, D.C.: Sept. 22, 2022.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2022 \nRecommendation: The Chairman of NRC should fully define and document the role of the senior agency official for privacy or other designated privacy official in reviewing and approving system categorizations, overseeing privacy control assessments, and reviewing authorization packages.\nAction Needed: We recommended that NRC fully define and document the role of the senior agency official for privacy or other designated privacy official in reviewing and approving system categorizations, overseeing privacy control assessments, and reviewing authorization packages. NRC concurred with our recommendation and stated that it was developing plans to address it; however, as of February 2023, it had not reported taking these actions. To fully address this recommendation, NRC needs to ensure it documents in its policies and procedures the role of its senior agency official for privacy or other privacy officials in each of these three steps. Doing so will help ensure that privacy protections are adequately incorporated into agency systems that contain personally identifiable information.\nHigh-Risk Area: Ensuring the Cybersecurity of the Nation\nDirector: Jennifer Franks, Information Technology and Cybersecurity Contact Information: FranksJ@gao.gov, (404) 679-1831\nStrategic Planning and External Liaison\nStephen J.

Specifically, NRC should, at least until such time that category 3 licenses can be verified using the License Verification System, require that transferors of category 3 quantities of radioactive materials confirm the validity of a would-be purchaser's radioactive materials license with the appropriate regulatory authority before transferring any category 3 quantities of licensed materials.\nActions Needed: NRC neither explicitly agreed nor disagreed with this recommendation. As of February 2023, NRC was considering a rulemaking that would require that licensees transferring category 3 quantities of radioactive material verify licenses in NRC\u2019s License Verification System or by directly contacting NRC or the agreement state. As a part of the same rulemaking process, NRC is also considering establishing a requirement that safety and security equipment be in place before licenses are granted to such entities. This would address concerns over the potential for unknown entities to obtain valid licenses using false information. However, NRC has not yet proposed this rule. By implementing this recommendation as soon as possible, NRC would be better able to prevent bad actors from manipulating the system and obtaining dangerous quantities of radioactive material.\nCombating Nuclear Terrorism: NRC Needs to Take Additional Actions to Ensure the Security of High-Risk Radioactive Material. GAO-19-468. Washington, D.C.: April 4, 2019.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2019\nRecommendation: The Chairman of NRC should require additional security measures for high- risk quantities of certain category 3 radioactive material and assess whether other category 3 materials should also be safeguarded with additional security measures.\nActions Needed: NRC neither explicitly agreed nor disagreed with this recommendation but stated that it would consider the recommendation as part of an existing working group. In August 2017, the working group provided a staff analysis on these issues to the Commission that concluded that category 3 materials did not require additional security measures. In our April 2019 report, we provided new information such as expert views and studies on the risks of category 3 materials in a radiological dispersal device (RDD)\u2014also known as a dirty bomb. However, as of February 2023, NRC had not updated this analysis to take into account this new information. We continue to believe that by implementing our recommendation, NRC would have greater assurance that its requirements are sufficient to help prevent any high-risk radioactive materials from being stolen and used in a RDD.\nRecommendation: The Chairman of NRC should direct NRC staff to consider socioeconomic consequences and fatalities from evacuations in the criteria for determining what security measures should be required for radioactive materials that could be used in a RDD.\nActions Needed: NRC disagreed with this recommendation, maintaining that the current regulatory requirements provide for the safe and secure use of all radioactive materials, regardless of category. We disagree with NRC\u2019s assessment. About a month after we published our April 2019 report, a small amount of radioactive material was accidentally released at the University of Washington in Seattle. Although the release was not a RDD, it resulted in at least $156 million in cleanup and remediation costs, closure of the medical facility for 2 years, and negative impacts on researchers and medical professionals. This accident illustrates the risk posed by security failures involving similar quantities of material. We continue to believe that by implementing our recommendation, NRC would have better assurance that it considers more likely and more significant consequences of a RDD when establishing its security requirements for radioactive material.\nPreventing a Dirty Bomb: Vulnerabilities Persist in NRC\u2019s Controls for Purchases of High-Risk Radioactive Materials. GAO-22-103441. Washington, D.C.: July 14, 2022.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2022\nRecommendation: The Chairman of NRC should immediately require that vendors verify category 3 licenses with the appropriate regulatory authority.\nActions Needed: NRC partially agreed with this recommendation, and committed to take action to require that vendors verify category 3 licensees with the appropriate regulatory agency, but it did not agree to address these vulnerabilities immediately. As of February 2023, NRC was considering a rulemaking that would require specific measures for licensees to verify licenses for category 3 quantities of radioactive material. However, these vulnerabilities will remain while the rulemaking is under consideration, and we continue to believe NRC should immediately address these issues.\nRecommendation: The Chairman of NRC should add security features to its licensing process to improve its integrity and make it less vulnerable to altering or forging licenses. These security features could include multifactor authentication or moving away from paper licenses to electronic-based licensing.\nActions Needed: NRC agreed with this recommendation. As of February 2023, NRC stated that as part of its ongoing rulemaking process, it would develop additional guidance to regulators and licensees to reduce the potential that altered or counterfeit licenses could be used to purchase category 3 material. This includes exploring the specific methods listed in our recommendation. In addition, we made another recommendation in an Official Use Only version of this report that, if implemented, would reduce the risk of a dirty bomb.9\nDirector: Allison Bawden, Natural Resources and Environment Contact Information: BawdenA@gao.gov, (202) 512-3841\nImproving the Reliability of Cost Estimates\nNuclear Regulatory Commission: NRC Needs to Improve Its Cost Estimates by Incorporating More Best Practices. GAO-15-98.

NRC updated a draft of its cost estimating procedures in January 2020 to conform with agency-wide directives and provided it to the NRC Commissioners for their review. However, NRC has not issued the final procedures. To fully implement this recommendation, NRC needs to issue its update to its cost estimating procedures to align with best practices identified in our cost estimating guide. By doing so, NRC will have better assurance that its cost estimates are reliable and that the NRC Commissioners have adequate information on which to base their regulatory decisions.\nDirector: Frank Rusco, Natural Resources and Environment Contact Information: RuscoF@gao.gov, (202) 512-3841\nEnsuring the Cybersecurity of the Nation\nPrivacy: Dedicated Leadership Can Improve Programs and Address Challenges, GAO-22- 105065.

NRC concurred with our recommendation and stated that it was developing plans to address it; however, as of February 2023, it had not reported taking these actions. To fully address this recommendation, NRC needs to ensure it documents in its policies and procedures the role of its senior agency official for privacy or other privacy officials in each of these three steps.

Hanson Chairman U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Washington, D.C. 20555-0001\nPriority Open Recommendations: Nuclear Regulatory Commission\nDear Chairman Hanson:\nThe purpose of this letter is to provide an update on the overall status of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2019s (NRC) implementation of GAO\u2019s recommendations and to call your continued personal attention to areas where open recommendations should be given high priority.1 In November 2022, we reported that, on a government-wide basis, 77 percent of our recommendations made 4 years ago were implemented.2 NRC\u2019s recommendation implementation rate for that year was 100 percent, reflecting the implementation of 10 recommendations made in five reports from fiscal year 2018.3 As of March 2023, NRC had 21 open recommendations. Fully implementing these open recommendations could significantly improve agency operations.\nNRC has not implemented any of the five open priority recommendations we identified in our June 2022 letter.4 We ask your continued attention to these five remaining open priority recommendations. We are also adding three new recommendations related to NRC\u2019s materials licensing program and federal agencies\u2019 privacy programs. This brings the total number of priority recommendations to eight. (See enclosure for the list of recommendations.)\nThe eight priority recommendations fall into the following three areas:\nAddressing the security of radiological sources. Implementing our six priority recommendations in this area will better enable NRC to carry out its responsibility for licensing and regulating the secure use of radioactive materials while ensuring the protection of public health and safety and the environment. For example, in July 2022, we recommended that NRC add security features, such as multifactor authentication, to its licensing process to improve the process\u2019s integrity and make it less vulnerable to altering or forging licenses. Additionally, in April 2019, we made another recommendation that NRC consider socioeconomic consequences and fatalities from evacuations in the criteria for determining required security measures for radioactive materials that could be used in a radiological dispersal device (RDD). By implementing these and the four other recommendations, NRC would have greater assurance that bad actors cannot manipulate the system and that it considers the more likely and more significant consequences of a RDD when establishing its security requirements for radioactive material.\nImproving the reliability of cost estimates. NRC develops cost estimates when analyzing the costs and benefits of actions such as modifications to nuclear power plants. These estimates help inform NRC Commissioners\u2019 regulatory decisions. By fully implementing our recommendation to complete and issue its updated cost estimating procedures to align with best practices identified in our cost estimating guide, NRC will better ensure that its cost estimates are reliable and provide the Commissioners with adequate information on which to base their decisions.\nEnsuring the cybersecurity of the nation. Federal agencies can better protect information systems containing personally identifiable information by ensuring that agency policies and procedures fully define and document privacy officials\u2019 roles in reviewing, approving, overseeing and authorizing aspects of these systems. By implementing our one priority recommendation to fully define and document the role of senior agency official, NRC will be in a better position to ensure that privacy protections are adequately incorporated into agency systems that contain personally identifiable information.\n- - - - -\nIn April 2023, we issued our biennial update to our High-Risk List. This list identifies government operations with greater vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. It also identifies the need for transformation to address economy, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges.5\nSeveral government-wide high-risk areas have direct implications for NRC and its operations. These include (1) the government-wide personnel security clearance process, (2) ensuring the cybersecurity of the nation,6 (3) improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations, (4) strategic human capital management, and (5) managing federal real property.\nWe urge your attention to these government-wide high-risk issues as they relate to NRC. Progress on high-risk issues has been possible through the concerted actions and efforts of Congress; the Office of Management and Budget; and the leadership and staff in agencies, including within NRC. In March 2022, we issued a report on key practices to successfully  address high-risk areas, which can be helpful resources as your agency continues to make progress to address high-risk issues.7\nIn additional to your continued attention on these issues, Congress plays a key role in providing oversight and maintaining focus on our recommendations to ensure they are implemented and produce their desired results. Legislation enacted in December 2022 includes a provision for GAO to identify any additional congressional oversight actions that can help agencies implement priority recommendations and address any underlying issues relating to such implementation.8\nThere are various strategies Congress can use in addressing our recommendations, such as incorporating them into legislation. Congress can also use its budget, appropriations, and oversight processes to incentivize executive branch agencies to act on our recommendations and monitor their progress. For example, Congress can hold hearings focused on NRC\u2019s progress in implementing GAO\u2019s priority recommendations, withhold funds when appropriate, or take other actions to provide incentives for agencies to act. Moreover, Congress could follow up during the appropriations process and request periodic updates. Congress also plays a key role in addressing any underlying issues related to the implementation of these recommendations. For example, Congress could pass legislation providing an agency explicit authority to implement a recommendation or requiring an agency to take certain actions to implement a recommendation.\nCopies of this report are being sent to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the appropriate congressional committees. In addition, the report is available on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov/.\nI appreciate NRC\u2019s continued commitment to these important issues.

In August 2017, the working group provided a staff analysis on these issues to the Commission and recommended against including category 3 sources in the National Source Tracking System or adding information on agreement state category 3 licenses to the Web-based Licensing System. As of February 2023, NRC had no plans to put category 3 quantities into the National Source Tracking System, according to agency officials. We continue to believe that by implementing our recommendation, NRC would have greater assurance that bad actors could not manipulate the system, such as by altering a paper license to acquire radioactive materials in aggregate greater than what they are authorized to possess.\nRecommendation: Because some quantities of radioactive materials are potentially dangerous to human health if not properly handled, NRC should take action to better track and secure these materials and verify the legitimacy of the licenses for those who seek to possess them. Specifically, NRC should, at least until such time that category 3 licenses can be verified using the License Verification System, require that transferors of category 3 quantities of radioactive materials confirm the validity of a would-be purchaser's radioactive materials license with the appropriate regulatory authority before transferring any category 3 quantities of licensed materials.\nActions Needed: NRC neither explicitly agreed nor disagreed with this recommendation. As of February 2023, NRC was considering a rulemaking that would require that licensees transferring category 3 quantities of radioactive material verify licenses in NRC\u2019s License Verification System or by directly contacting NRC or the agreement state. As a part of the same rulemaking process, NRC is also considering establishing a requirement that safety and security equipment be in place before licenses are granted to such entities. This would address concerns over the potential for unknown entities to obtain valid licenses using false information. However, NRC has not yet proposed this rule. By implementing this recommendation as soon as possible, NRC would be better able to prevent bad actors from manipulating the system and obtaining dangerous quantities of radioactive material.\nCombating Nuclear Terrorism: NRC Needs to Take Additional Actions to Ensure the Security of High-Risk Radioactive Material. GAO-19-468. Washington, D.C.: April 4, 2019.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2019\nRecommendation: The Chairman of NRC should require additional security measures for high- risk quantities of certain category 3 radioactive material and assess whether other category 3 materials should also be safeguarded with additional security measures.\nActions Needed: NRC neither explicitly agreed nor disagreed with this recommendation but stated that it would consider the recommendation as part of an existing working group. In August 2017, the working group provided a staff analysis on these issues to the Commission that concluded that category 3 materials did not require additional security measures. In our April 2019 report, we provided new information such as expert views and studies on the risks of category 3 materials in a radiological dispersal device (RDD)\u2014also known as a dirty bomb. However, as of February 2023, NRC had not updated this analysis to take into account this new information. We continue to believe that by implementing our recommendation, NRC would have greater assurance that its requirements are sufficient to help prevent any high-risk radioactive materials from being stolen and used in a RDD.\nRecommendation: The Chairman of NRC should direct NRC staff to consider socioeconomic consequences and fatalities from evacuations in the criteria for determining what security measures should be required for radioactive materials that could be used in a RDD.\nActions Needed: NRC disagreed with this recommendation, maintaining that the current regulatory requirements provide for the safe and secure use of all radioactive materials, regardless of category. We disagree with NRC\u2019s assessment. About a month after we published our April 2019 report, a small amount of radioactive material was accidentally released at the University of Washington in Seattle. Although the release was not a RDD, it resulted in at least $156 million in cleanup and remediation costs, closure of the medical facility for 2 years, and negative impacts on researchers and medical professionals. This accident illustrates the risk posed by security failures involving similar quantities of material. We continue to believe that by implementing our recommendation, NRC would have better assurance that it considers more likely and more significant consequences of a RDD when establishing its security requirements for radioactive material.\nPreventing a Dirty Bomb: Vulnerabilities Persist in NRC\u2019s Controls for Purchases of High-Risk Radioactive Materials. GAO-22-103441. Washington, D.C.: July 14, 2022.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2022\nRecommendation: The Chairman of NRC should immediately require that vendors verify category 3 licenses with the appropriate regulatory authority.\nActions Needed: NRC partially agreed with this recommendation, and committed to take action to require that vendors verify category 3 licensees with the appropriate regulatory agency, but it did not agree to address these vulnerabilities immediately. As of February 2023, NRC was considering a rulemaking that would require specific measures for licensees to verify licenses for category 3 quantities of radioactive material. However, these vulnerabilities will remain while the rulemaking is under consideration, and we continue to believe NRC should immediately address these issues.\nRecommendation: The Chairman of NRC should add security features to its licensing process to improve its integrity and make it less vulnerable to altering or forging licenses. These security features could include multifactor authentication or moving away from paper licenses to electronic-based licensing.\nActions Needed: NRC agreed with this recommendation. As of February 2023, NRC stated that as part of its ongoing rulemaking process, it would develop additional guidance to regulators and licensees to reduce the potential that altered or counterfeit licenses could be used to purchase category 3 material. This includes exploring the specific methods listed in our recommendation. In addition, we made another recommendation in an Official Use Only version of this report that, if implemented, would reduce the risk of a dirty bomb.9\nDirector: Allison Bawden, Natural Resources and Environment Contact Information: BawdenA@gao.gov, (202) 512-3841\nImproving the Reliability of Cost Estimates\nNuclear Regulatory Commission: NRC Needs to Improve Its Cost Estimates by Incorporating More Best Practices. GAO-15-98. Washington, D.C.: December 12, 2014.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2014\nRecommendation: To improve the reliability of its cost estimates, as NRC revises its cost estimating procedures, the NRC Chairman should ensure that the agency aligns the procedures with relevant cost estimating best practices identified in the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide and ensure that future cost estimates are prepared in accordance with relevant cost estimating best practices.10\nActions Needed: NRC generally agreed with the recommendation. NRC updated a draft of its cost estimating procedures in January 2020 to conform with agency-wide directives and provided it to the NRC Commissioners for their review. However, NRC has not issued the final procedures. To fully implement this recommendation, NRC needs to issue its update to its cost estimating procedures to align with best practices identified in our cost estimating guide. By doing so, NRC will have better assurance that its cost estimates are reliable and that the NRC Commissioners have adequate information on which to base their regulatory decisions.\nDirector: Frank Rusco, Natural Resources and Environment Contact Information: RuscoF@gao.gov, (202) 512-3841\nEnsuring the Cybersecurity of the Nation\nPrivacy: Dedicated Leadership Can Improve Programs and Address Challenges, GAO-22- 105065.

NRC concurred with our recommendation and stated that it was developing plans to address it; however, as of February 2023, it had not reported taking these actions. To fully address this recommendation, NRC needs to ensure it documents in its policies and procedures the role of its senior agency official for privacy or other privacy officials in each of these three steps. Doing so will help ensure that privacy protections are adequately incorporated into agency systems that contain personally identifiable information.\nHigh-Risk Area: Ensuring the Cybersecurity of the Nation\nDirector: Jennifer Franks, Information Technology and Cybersecurity Contact Information: FranksJ@gao.gov, (404) 679-1831\nStrategic Planning and External Liaison\nStephen J.

Hsu Acting Comptroller of the Currency Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 400 7th St. SW Washington, D.C. 20219\nPriority Open Recommendations: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\nDear Mr. Hsu:\nThe purpose of this letter is to provide the overall status of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\u2019s (OCC) implementation of GAO\u2019s recommendations and to call your personal attention to open recommendations that should be given high priority.1   In November 2022, we reported that on a government-wide basis, 77 percent of our recommendations made 4 years ago were implemented.2 OCC\u2019s implementation rate for recommendations implemented during this same period was 100 percent. As of July 2023, OCC had 10 open recommendations. Fully implementing these open recommendations could significantly improve OCC\u2019s efforts to supervise and examine the operations of its chartered banks.\nIn our May 2022 letter to the Department of the Treasury, we included our one open priority recommendation directed to OCC. Since that time, OCC has not implemented that recommendation. We ask your attention to this priority recommendation, which is related to financial technology (fintech). We are also adding one new priority recommendation related to oversight of blockchain technology. This brings OCC\u2019s total number of priority recommendations to two. (See enclosure for the list of recommendations.)\nThe two priority recommendations fall into the following areas:\nBlockchain technology. Recent volatility, bankruptcies, and instances of fraud in the crypto asset markets illustrate the harm consumers and investors may face without adequate protections. We recommended that OCC and other financial regulators jointly establish or adapt an existing formal coordination mechanism to identify and address blockchain-related risks. If implemented, OCC and the financial regulators would be able to collectively identify risks posed by blockchain-related products and services and develop and implement a regulatory response in a timely manner. \nFinancial technology. Fintech lenders may analyze large amounts of alternative data on borrower characteristics, such as information from bank accounts, when determining borrowers\u2019 creditworthiness. We recommended that OCC, the other federal banking regulators, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau communicate the appropriate use of alternative data in the underwriting process with banks that engage in third-party relationships with fintech lenders. Implementing our priority recommendation in this area could better position federally regulated banks to manage the risks associated with partnering with fintech lenders that use these data.\nIn light of recent bank failures and federal banking regulators\u2019 emergency response, we also urge you to revisit OCC\u2019s prompt corrective action framework. In 2011, we recommended that OCC and other regulators consider adopting noncapital triggers that would require early and forceful regulatory actions tied to unsafe banking practices.3 The regulators considered noncapital triggers, but have not added them to the framework. We maintain that incorporating noncapital triggers would encourage earlier action and give the regulators and banks more time to address deteriorating conditions.\n- - - -\nIn April 2023, we issued our biennial update to our High-Risk List. This list identifies government operations with greater vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. It also identifies the need for transformation to address economy, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges.4  One of our high-risk areas\u2014modernizing the U.S. financial regulatory system\u2014 relates directly to OCC. Specifically, we urge your attention to the effective and efficient oversight of financial institutions and activities.\nIn addition, several other government-wide high-risk areas also have direct implications for OCC and its operations. These include (1) improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations, (2) improving strategic human capital management, (3) managing federal real property, (4) ensuring the cybersecurity of the nation,5 and (5) managing the government-wide personnel security process.\n We urge your attention to the government-wide high-risk  issues, as well as the high-risk area for which OCC has a leading role. Progress on high-risk issues has been possible through the concerted actions and efforts of Congress, Office of Management and Budget, and the leadership and staff in agencies, including within OCC. In March 2022, we issued a report on key practices to successfully address high-risk areas, which can be a helpful resource as your agency continues to make progress to address high-risk issues.6 \nIn addition to your attention on these issues, Congress plays a key role in providing oversight and maintaining focus on our recommendations to ensure they are implemented and produce their desired results. Legislation enacted in December 2022 included a provision for GAO to identify any additional congressional oversight actions that can help agencies implement priority recommendations and address any underlying issues relating to such implementation.7\nCongress can use various strategies in addressing our recommendations, such as incorporating them into legislation. Congress can also use its oversight processes to incentivize OCC to act on our recommendations and monitor its progress. For example, Congress can hold hearings focused on OCC\u2019s progress in implementing GAO\u2019s priority recommendations or take other actions to provide incentives for the OCC to act. Congress also plays a key role in addressing any underlying issues related to the implementation of these recommendations. For example, Congress can pass legislation providing an agency explicit authority to implement a recommendation or requiring an agency to take certain actions to implement a recommendation.\nCopies of this report are being sent to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the appropriate congressional committees. In addition, the report will be available on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.\nI appreciate OCC\u2019s commitment to these important issues. If you have any questions or would like to discuss any of the issues outlined in this letter, please do not hesitate to contact me or Daniel Garcia-Diaz, Managing Director, Financial Markets and Community Investment, at garciadiazd@gao.gov or (202) 512-8678. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. Our teams will continue to coordinate with your staff on all 10 open recommendations, as well as those recommendations in the high-risk areas for which OCC has a leading role.

GAO-23-105346. Washington, D.C.: June 22, 2023.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2023\nRecommendation: The Comptroller of the Currency should jointly establish or adapt an existing formal coordination mechanism with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, National Credit Union Administration, and Securities and Exchange Commission for collectively identifying risks posed by blockchain-related products and services and formulating a timely regulatory response. To facilitate these objectives, this mechanism could include formal planning documents that establish the frequency of meetings and processes for identifying risks and responding to them within agreed- upon time frames.\nAction Needed: The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) neither agreed nor disagreed with the recommendation. In its agency comment letter, OCC said it continues to monitor\u2014separately and in collaboration with the other federal financial regulators\u2014emerging risks posed by blockchain-related products and services. However, the regulators\u2019 coordination efforts have not always addressed risks posed by crypto assets in a timely manner.

In July 2021, OCC, along with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve, proposed interagency guidance on third-party risk management. In June 2023, the federal banking regulators issued final interagency guidance, but this guidance did not include specific direction to banks engaging with fintech lenders on the use of alternative data in the underwriting process. Rather the guidance indicates that it is broadly applicable to all topics and third-party relationships and, accordingly, did not address specific topics, such as the use of alternative data, or specific types of third-party relationships, such as relationships with fintech companies. The guidance states regulators may issue additional guidance on specific topics in the future.\nIn March 2021, OCC, in coordination with other federal banking regulators and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a request for information on financial institutions\u2019 use of artificial intelligence, including machine learning. The comment period for the request for information ended on July 1, 2021, and the regulators were working on next steps for the request for information.\nTo fully implement this recommendation, OCC needs to provide\u2014in coordination with other federal banking regulators and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau\u2014finalized guidance on the appropriate use of alternative data in the underwriting process. Without such direction, banks partnering with financial technology lenders may not effectively manage associated risks, including compliance with fair lending and other consumer protection laws.

{"content": "February 21, 2023\nChair Ranking Member Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Committee on Appropriations United States Senate\nChair Robert Aderholt Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education Committee on Appropriations House of Representatives\nSince 1995, the Department of Education has supported charter schools across the nation through its Charter Schools Program (CSP) grants. Charter schools are publicly funded, semi-autonomous schools of choice. Funded at about $440 million in fiscal year 2020, these grants generally are designed to help create new charter schools; replicate or expand high-quality charter schools; disseminate best practices to charter schools; and expand opportunities for traditionally underserved students to attend charter schools, among other things.1 Charter schools have also been able to use these funds to recruit new students. The effectiveness of and funding for charter schools are debated topics. Questions also have been raised about the extent to which charter schools have enrolled students with disabilities and English learners.\nThe committee report accompanying the House bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2021 includes a provision for GAO to report on CSP grants, with a particular focus on CSP grant-recipient charter schools that eventually closed or never opened, and on student enrollment at CSP grant-recipient charter schools.2 In October 2022, we issued our first report in response to this provision.3\nThis second and final report examines (1) enrollment growth at new charter schools that received CSP grants compared to those that did not, and (2) enrollment differences in student subpopulations for charter schools receiving such grants compared to other charter and traditional public schools.4\nTo identify CSP grant-recipient charters schools, we used Education\u2019s CSP awards data for 2006\u20132020, the most recent years for which complete data were available.5 We combined CSP awards data with selected school characteristics data from the Common Core of Data (CCD) to analyze trends in student enrollment among CSP grant-recipient charter schools and non-CSP charter schools.6 Specifically, we used a multivariate statistical method (matched comparison analysis) to compare student enrollment growth over time between CSP grant-recipient charter schools and similar non-CSP charter schools from 2006\u20132020. Our matched analysis focused on new charter schools and not on existing charter schools that received CSP grants to expand enrollment.7 Although  we looked at data over a 14-year period from 2006\u20132020, the maximum period of time for which we could assess enrollment change was 12 years. This is because we (1) required schools in the matched comparison analysis to be new in the year prior to receiving a grant and (2) designated schools\u2019 first year of operation as the year following receipt of a grant. We estimated proportional change in enrollment from the matching baseline year up to 12 follow-up years, separately for the matched CSP grant-recipient and non-CSP charter schools.8 We also conducted a regression analysis using CSP awards data, CCD, and the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) to compare enrollment differences for various student groups. We evaluated students with disabilities designated as receiving services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and English learners, in CSP grant-recipient charter schools, non-CSP recipient charter schools, and traditional public schools for 2011\u20132015.9\nWe assessed the reliability of these data by reviewing existing reports that used the data, conducting our own electronic data tests, reviewing technical documentation, and interviewing federal officials knowledgeable about the CSP awards data, CCD, and the CRDC. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our analysis. In addition, we reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance and interviewed federal officials. See appendix I for more information on our methodology.\nWe conducted this performance audit from September 2022 to February 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. \nBackground\nCharter schools are publicly funded schools typically governed by a group or organization under a contract\u2014a charter\u2014with the state, the district, or another entity authorized under state law to grant charters to schools. Charter schools are exempt from significant state or local regulations related to operation and management, but otherwise adhere to regulations of public schools. For example, charter schools cannot charge tuition. As of May 2022, charter schools existed in 42 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam. States and school districts are responsible for ensuring that eligible students with disabilities are provided with a free appropriate public education. Education makes an annual determination on the extent to which each state\u2019s special education programs meet federal requirements, and also investigates certain allegations of discrimination.\nEducation has prioritized funding charter schools in economically distressed communities; schools in urban and rural areas; and schools that serve high-need students among the CSP State Educational Agencies/State Entities grants, CSP Charter Management Organization grants, and CSP Non-State Educational Agencies/Developers grants (see table 1).10\n\nSchools Receiving Charter Schools Program Awards\nAccording to our matched comparison analysis, enrollment growth at CSP grant-recipient charter schools was about 1.3 to 1.6 times higher on average compared to similar charter schools that did not receive awards 11 over a 12-year period (see fig. 1). Generally Had Higher Enrollment Growth Compared to Similar Charter Schools That Did Not\nFigure 1: Student Enrollment Growth for Charter Schools Program (CSP) Charter Schools and Similar Non-CSP Charter Schools within 12 Years of Receiving Awards\nNote: GAO examined data for selected CSP grant-recipient charter schools for 2006 through 2020 and matched them to similar, non-CSP charter schools. Over this 14-year period, the maximum years we could assess enrollment change was 12 years. This is because we (1) required schools in the matched comparison analysis to be new in the year prior to receiving a grant and (2) designated schools\u2019 first year of operation as the year following receipt of a grant. Error bars display the 95 percent confidence interval for estimates. We analyzed Education\u2019s CSP awards data as of May 2022.\nGAO\u2019s Matched Comparison Analysis We matched Charter Schools Program (CSP) grant-recipient charter schools to similar non-CSP charter schools. We matched the charter schools in three ways:\n\u2022   (Group 1) Year opened, state, locale (urban, suburban, and rural), and grade level (elementary, middle, and high schools). This matched group covered 48 percent of the original population of charter schools in our scope. \u2022   (Group 2) Year opened, state, school district, and grade level. This matched group covered 10 percent of the original population of charter schools in our scope. \u2022   (Group 3) Year opened, state, and grade level. This matched group covered 60 percent of the original population of charter schools in our scope. Our matched analysis focused on new charter schools and not on existing charter schools that received CSP grants to expand enrollment. Each analysis paired CSP grant-recipient charter schools that were as similar as possible to non-CSP charter schools on a set of variables including student demographics, number of students in the school, free or reduced-price lunch rates, and exact geographic location. For all three group analyses, we found that CSP grant- recipient charter schools were generally more likely to grow at faster rates than similar non-CSP charter schools. We focused on reporting results from the first group for the overall results and third group for the subpopulation findings because these analyses controlled for geography and achieved sufficient coverage of our target population. Results from all three groups are in appendix I. While we controlled for a number of variables to match similar CSP grant-recipient charter schools and non-CSP charter schools, schools may vary in different ways that we cannot control for due to lack of data. For example, CSP grant-recipient charter schools may have been more likely to have the necessary administrative skills or resources to seek and receive CSP awards. These same characteristics could allow CSP grant-recipient charter schools to recruit and retain students. Our analysis is designed to isolate the effects of CSP grant funding, to the extent practical. However, because we could not control for every possible relevant characteristic, differences in student enrollment rates should not be attributed solely to award receipt.\nSource: GAO matched comparison analysis of the Department of Education\u2019s CSP awards data and selected elements of Common Core of Data.  |  GAO-23-106268\nWe examined student enrollment changes in charter schools compared to other public schools (traditional public schools and magnet schools) for school years 2006-07 and 2020-21 (see table 2).\n\u2022   While the vast majority of K-12 public school students attend other public schools, the share of students attending charter schools grew from school years 2006-07 to 2020-21, and the share of students attending other public schools decreased (see table 2). Overall, charter schools\u2019 share of students nearly tripled during this period. \u2022   Enrollment in CSP grant-recipient charter schools grew more than sixfold\u2014from more than 200,000 to 1.4 million. On average, CSP grant-recipient charter schools enrolled about 293 students each in school year 2006-07, compared to about 448 students in school year 2020-21. \u2022   Enrollment in non-CSP charter schools more than doubled. On average, non-CSP charter schools enrolled about 293 students each in school year 2006-07, compared to about 495 students in school year 2020-21.\nTable 2.

CSP grant-recipient charter middle schools had higher enrollment growth than similar non-CSP charter middle schools. \u2022   Locale. CSP grant-recipient charter schools in urban areas had higher enrollment growth than similar non-CSP charter schools. \u2022   Race/ethnicity. CSP grant-recipient charter schools with higher percentages of non-White students generally had higher enrollment growth than similar non-CSP charter schools. \u2022   Percentage of students who receive free or reduced-price lunch. CSP grant-recipient charter schools with 75 percent or more students on free or reduced-price lunch generally had higher enrollment growth than similar non-CSP charter schools. In some schools, like those that were rural or low-poverty, CSP grant- recipient charter schools and similar non-CSP charter schools sometimes experienced similar enrollment growth rates.\nFigure 2: Student Enrollment in Charter Schools Program (CSP) Charter Schools and Non-CSP Charter Schools, by Selected Characteristics, 5 Years after Receiving Awards\nNote: GAO examined data for selected charter schools that received CSP awards for 2006 through 2020 and matched them to similar, non-CSP charter schools. Over this 14-year period, the maximum years we could assess enrollment change was 12 years. This is because we (1) required schools in the matched comparison analysis to be new in the year prior to receiving a grant and (2) designated schools\u2019 first year of operation as the year following receipt of a grant. For results on the 12-year period, see appendix I. Error bars display the 95 percent confidence interval for estimates. We analyzed Education\u2019s CSP awards data as of May 2022.\nWe compared student enrollment in each of the three states that received the most CSP awards and funding\u2014California, Florida, and Texas. We found that CSP grant-recipient charter schools in California and Florida generally experienced higher enrollment growth than similar non-grant charter schools over a 5-year period (see fig. 3).13 In Texas, we estimated similar but statistically insignificant differences.\nFigure 3: Student Enrollment in Charter Schools Program (CSP) Charter Schools and Non-CSP Charter Schools in California, Florida, and Texas 5 Years after Receiving an Award\nNote: GAO examined data for selected charter schools that received a CSP award for 2006 through 2020 and matched them to similar, non-CSP charter schools. Over this 14-year period, the maximum years we could assess enrollment change was 12 years.

For results on the 12-year period, see appendix I. Error bars display the 95 percent confidence interval for estimates. We analyzed Education\u2019s CSP awards data as of May 2022.\nCharter Schools Were Less Likely to Enroll\nOur regression analysis comparing student enrollment and other characteristics in CSP grant-recipient charter schools, non-CSP charter schools, and traditional public schools found:14\nStudents Served under IDEA, or White, Asian, or Multiracial Students Compared to Traditional Public Schools\n\u2022   Schools with higher percentages of students served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), White students, Asian students, and multiracial students were more likely to be traditional public schools than charter schools, regardless of whether the charter school received a CSP grant.15 \u2022   Schools receiving funds under Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended, and schools with higher percentages of students served under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and Hispanic and Black students were more likely to be charter schools regardless of whether they received a CSP grant, compared to traditional public schools.16\n\u2022   Schools with higher percentages of English learners were more likely to be traditional public schools, and less likely to be non-CSP charter schools. There was no relationship between the percentage of English learners in schools and the likelihood of schools being CSP grant- recipient charter schools. \u2022   There was no meaningful relationship between the percentage of American Indian/Alaska Native students and the likelihood of schools being CSP grant-recipient charter, non-CSP charter, or traditional public schools. \nResearchers have investigated potential reasons for student enrollment differences between charter schools and traditional schools for students with disabilities. For example:\n\u2022   Related to students with disabilities served under IDEA, researchers from the National Council on Disability have reported that:17\n\u2022  Charter schools may have practices that discourage parents of students with disabilities from applying to the school. \u2022  Parents of students with disabilities are less likely to apply to charter schools. \u2022  Students with disabilities may already be connected to specialized programs within traditional public schools. Parents may be more familiar with, or may prefer, the services provided by traditional public schools. \u2022  Parents may lack information about charter schools, such as the services available at these schools. All public school districts, including charter schools that operate independently as their own public school district and public school districts that include charter schools, are responsible for complying with relevant federal laws pertaining to students with disabilities.\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees and the Secretary of Education.

{"content": "February 21, 2023\nChair Ranking Member Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Committee on Appropriations United States Senate\nChair Robert Aderholt Ranking Member Rosa DeLauro Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education Committee on Appropriations House of Representatives\nSince 1995, the Department of Education has supported charter schools across the nation through its Charter Schools Program (CSP) grants. Charter schools are publicly funded, semi-autonomous schools of choice. Funded at about $440 million in fiscal year 2020, these grants generally are designed to help create new charter schools; replicate or expand high-quality charter schools; disseminate best practices to charter schools; and expand opportunities for traditionally underserved students to attend charter schools, among other things.1 Charter schools have also been able to use these funds to recruit new students. The effectiveness of and funding for charter schools are debated topics. Questions also have been raised about the extent to which charter schools have enrolled students with disabilities and English learners.\nThe committee report accompanying the House bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2021 includes a provision for GAO to report on CSP grants, with a particular focus on CSP grant-recipient charter schools that eventually closed or never opened, and on student enrollment at CSP grant-recipient charter schools.2 In October 2022, we issued our first report in response to this provision.3\nThis second and final report examines (1) enrollment growth at new charter schools that received CSP grants compared to those that did not, and (2) enrollment differences in student subpopulations for charter schools receiving such grants compared to other charter and traditional public schools.4\nTo identify CSP grant-recipient charters schools, we used Education\u2019s CSP awards data for 2006\u20132020, the most recent years for which complete data were available.5 We combined CSP awards data with selected school characteristics data from the Common Core of Data (CCD) to analyze trends in student enrollment among CSP grant-recipient charter schools and non-CSP charter schools.6 Specifically, we used a multivariate statistical method (matched comparison analysis) to compare student enrollment growth over time between CSP grant-recipient charter schools and similar non-CSP charter schools from 2006\u20132020. Our matched analysis focused on new charter schools and not on existing charter schools that received CSP grants to expand enrollment.7 Although  we looked at data over a 14-year period from 2006\u20132020, the maximum period of time for which we could assess enrollment change was 12 years. This is because we (1) required schools in the matched comparison analysis to be new in the year prior to receiving a grant and (2) designated schools\u2019 first year of operation as the year following receipt of a grant. We estimated proportional change in enrollment from the matching baseline year up to 12 follow-up years, separately for the matched CSP grant-recipient and non-CSP charter schools.8 We also conducted a regression analysis using CSP awards data, CCD, and the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) to compare enrollment differences for various student groups. We evaluated students with disabilities designated as receiving services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and English learners, in CSP grant-recipient charter schools, non-CSP recipient charter schools, and traditional public schools for 2011\u20132015.9\nWe assessed the reliability of these data by reviewing existing reports that used the data, conducting our own electronic data tests, reviewing technical documentation, and interviewing federal officials knowledgeable about the CSP awards data, CCD, and the CRDC. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our analysis. In addition, we reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance and interviewed federal officials. See appendix I for more information on our methodology.\nWe conducted this performance audit from September 2022 to February 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. \nBackground\nCharter schools are publicly funded schools typically governed by a group or organization under a contract\u2014a charter\u2014with the state, the district, or another entity authorized under state law to grant charters to schools. Charter schools are exempt from significant state or local regulations related to operation and management, but otherwise adhere to regulations of public schools. For example, charter schools cannot charge tuition. As of May 2022, charter schools existed in 42 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam. States and school districts are responsible for ensuring that eligible students with disabilities are provided with a free appropriate public education. Education makes an annual determination on the extent to which each state\u2019s special education programs meet federal requirements, and also investigates certain allegations of discrimination.\nEducation has prioritized funding charter schools in economically distressed communities; schools in urban and rural areas; and schools that serve high-need students among the CSP State Educational Agencies/State Entities grants, CSP Charter Management Organization grants, and CSP Non-State Educational Agencies/Developers grants (see table 1).10\n\nSchools Receiving Charter Schools Program Awards\nAccording to our matched comparison analysis, enrollment growth at CSP grant-recipient charter schools was about 1.3 to 1.6 times higher on average compared to similar charter schools that did not receive awards 11 over a 12-year period (see fig. 1). Generally Had Higher Enrollment Growth Compared to Similar Charter Schools That Did Not\nFigure 1: Student Enrollment Growth for Charter Schools Program (CSP) Charter Schools and Similar Non-CSP Charter Schools within 12 Years of Receiving Awards\nNote: GAO examined data for selected CSP grant-recipient charter schools for 2006 through 2020 and matched them to similar, non-CSP charter schools. Over this 14-year period, the maximum years we could assess enrollment change was 12 years. This is because we (1) required schools in the matched comparison analysis to be new in the year prior to receiving a grant and (2) designated schools\u2019 first year of operation as the year following receipt of a grant. Error bars display the 95 percent confidence interval for estimates. We analyzed Education\u2019s CSP awards data as of May 2022.\nGAO\u2019s Matched Comparison Analysis We matched Charter Schools Program (CSP) grant-recipient charter schools to similar non-CSP charter schools. We matched the charter schools in three ways:\n\u2022   (Group 1) Year opened, state, locale (urban, suburban, and rural), and grade level (elementary, middle, and high schools). This matched group covered 48 percent of the original population of charter schools in our scope. \u2022   (Group 2) Year opened, state, school district, and grade level. This matched group covered 10 percent of the original population of charter schools in our scope. \u2022   (Group 3) Year opened, state, and grade level. This matched group covered 60 percent of the original population of charter schools in our scope. Our matched analysis focused on new charter schools and not on existing charter schools that received CSP grants to expand enrollment. Each analysis paired CSP grant-recipient charter schools that were as similar as possible to non-CSP charter schools on a set of variables including student demographics, number of students in the school, free or reduced-price lunch rates, and exact geographic location. For all three group analyses, we found that CSP grant- recipient charter schools were generally more likely to grow at faster rates than similar non-CSP charter schools. We focused on reporting results from the first group for the overall results and third group for the subpopulation findings because these analyses controlled for geography and achieved sufficient coverage of our target population. Results from all three groups are in appendix I. While we controlled for a number of variables to match similar CSP grant-recipient charter schools and non-CSP charter schools, schools may vary in different ways that we cannot control for due to lack of data. For example, CSP grant-recipient charter schools may have been more likely to have the necessary administrative skills or resources to seek and receive CSP awards. These same characteristics could allow CSP grant-recipient charter schools to recruit and retain students. Our analysis is designed to isolate the effects of CSP grant funding, to the extent practical. However, because we could not control for every possible relevant characteristic, differences in student enrollment rates should not be attributed solely to award receipt.\nSource: GAO matched comparison analysis of the Department of Education\u2019s CSP awards data and selected elements of Common Core of Data.  |  GAO-23-106268\nWe examined student enrollment changes in charter schools compared to other public schools (traditional public schools and magnet schools) for school years 2006-07 and 2020-21 (see table 2).\n\u2022   While the vast majority of K-12 public school students attend other public schools, the share of students attending charter schools grew from school years 2006-07 to 2020-21, and the share of students attending other public schools decreased (see table 2). Overall, charter schools\u2019 share of students nearly tripled during this period. \u2022   Enrollment in CSP grant-recipient charter schools grew more than sixfold\u2014from more than 200,000 to 1.4 million. On average, CSP grant-recipient charter schools enrolled about 293 students each in school year 2006-07, compared to about 448 students in school year 2020-21. \u2022   Enrollment in non-CSP charter schools more than doubled.

For example, charter schools cannot charge tuition. As of May 2022, charter schools existed in 42 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Guam. States and school districts are responsible for ensuring that eligible students with disabilities are provided with a free appropriate public education. Education makes an annual determination on the extent to which each state\u2019s special education programs meet federal requirements, and also investigates certain allegations of discrimination.\nEducation has prioritized funding charter schools in economically distressed communities; schools in urban and rural areas; and schools that serve high-need students among the CSP State Educational Agencies/State Entities grants, CSP Charter Management Organization grants, and CSP Non-State Educational Agencies/Developers grants (see table 1).10\n\nSchools Receiving Charter Schools Program Awards\nAccording to our matched comparison analysis, enrollment growth at CSP grant-recipient charter schools was about 1.3 to 1.6 times higher on average compared to similar charter schools that did not receive awards 11 over a 12-year period (see fig. 1). Generally Had Higher Enrollment Growth Compared to Similar Charter Schools That Did Not\nFigure 1: Student Enrollment Growth for Charter Schools Program (CSP) Charter Schools and Similar Non-CSP Charter Schools within 12 Years of Receiving Awards\nNote: GAO examined data for selected CSP grant-recipient charter schools for 2006 through 2020 and matched them to similar, non-CSP charter schools. Over this 14-year period, the maximum years we could assess enrollment change was 12 years. This is because we (1) required schools in the matched comparison analysis to be new in the year prior to receiving a grant and (2) designated schools\u2019 first year of operation as the year following receipt of a grant. Error bars display the 95 percent confidence interval for estimates. We analyzed Education\u2019s CSP awards data as of May 2022.\nGAO\u2019s Matched Comparison Analysis We matched Charter Schools Program (CSP) grant-recipient charter schools to similar non-CSP charter schools. We matched the charter schools in three ways:\n\u2022   (Group 1) Year opened, state, locale (urban, suburban, and rural), and grade level (elementary, middle, and high schools). This matched group covered 48 percent of the original population of charter schools in our scope. \u2022   (Group 2) Year opened, state, school district, and grade level. This matched group covered 10 percent of the original population of charter schools in our scope. \u2022   (Group 3) Year opened, state, and grade level. This matched group covered 60 percent of the original population of charter schools in our scope. Our matched analysis focused on new charter schools and not on existing charter schools that received CSP grants to expand enrollment. Each analysis paired CSP grant-recipient charter schools that were as similar as possible to non-CSP charter schools on a set of variables including student demographics, number of students in the school, free or reduced-price lunch rates, and exact geographic location. For all three group analyses, we found that CSP grant- recipient charter schools were generally more likely to grow at faster rates than similar non-CSP charter schools. We focused on reporting results from the first group for the overall results and third group for the subpopulation findings because these analyses controlled for geography and achieved sufficient coverage of our target population. Results from all three groups are in appendix I. While we controlled for a number of variables to match similar CSP grant-recipient charter schools and non-CSP charter schools, schools may vary in different ways that we cannot control for due to lack of data. For example, CSP grant-recipient charter schools may have been more likely to have the necessary administrative skills or resources to seek and receive CSP awards. These same characteristics could allow CSP grant-recipient charter schools to recruit and retain students. Our analysis is designed to isolate the effects of CSP grant funding, to the extent practical. However, because we could not control for every possible relevant characteristic, differences in student enrollment rates should not be attributed solely to award receipt.\nSource: GAO matched comparison analysis of the Department of Education\u2019s CSP awards data and selected elements of Common Core of Data.  |  GAO-23-106268\nWe examined student enrollment changes in charter schools compared to other public schools (traditional public schools and magnet schools) for school years 2006-07 and 2020-21 (see table 2).\n\u2022   While the vast majority of K-12 public school students attend other public schools, the share of students attending charter schools grew from school years 2006-07 to 2020-21, and the share of students attending other public schools decreased (see table 2). Overall, charter schools\u2019 share of students nearly tripled during this period. \u2022   Enrollment in CSP grant-recipient charter schools grew more than sixfold\u2014from more than 200,000 to 1.4 million. On average, CSP grant-recipient charter schools enrolled about 293 students each in school year 2006-07, compared to about 448 students in school year 2020-21. \u2022   Enrollment in non-CSP charter schools more than doubled. On average, non-CSP charter schools enrolled about 293 students each in school year 2006-07, compared to about 495 students in school year 2020-21.\nTable 2.

CSP grant-recipient charter middle schools had higher enrollment growth than similar non-CSP charter middle schools. \u2022   Locale. CSP grant-recipient charter schools in urban areas had higher enrollment growth than similar non-CSP charter schools. \u2022   Race/ethnicity. CSP grant-recipient charter schools with higher percentages of non-White students generally had higher enrollment growth than similar non-CSP charter schools. \u2022   Percentage of students who receive free or reduced-price lunch. CSP grant-recipient charter schools with 75 percent or more students on free or reduced-price lunch generally had higher enrollment growth than similar non-CSP charter schools. In some schools, like those that were rural or low-poverty, CSP grant- recipient charter schools and similar non-CSP charter schools sometimes experienced similar enrollment growth rates.\nFigure 2: Student Enrollment in Charter Schools Program (CSP) Charter Schools and Non-CSP Charter Schools, by Selected Characteristics, 5 Years after Receiving Awards\nNote: GAO examined data for selected charter schools that received CSP awards for 2006 through 2020 and matched them to similar, non-CSP charter schools. Over this 14-year period, the maximum years we could assess enrollment change was 12 years. This is because we (1) required schools in the matched comparison analysis to be new in the year prior to receiving a grant and (2) designated schools\u2019 first year of operation as the year following receipt of a grant. For results on the 12-year period, see appendix I. Error bars display the 95 percent confidence interval for estimates. We analyzed Education\u2019s CSP awards data as of May 2022.\nWe compared student enrollment in each of the three states that received the most CSP awards and funding\u2014California, Florida, and Texas. We found that CSP grant-recipient charter schools in California and Florida generally experienced higher enrollment growth than similar non-grant charter schools over a 5-year period (see fig. 3).13 In Texas, we estimated similar but statistically insignificant differences.\nFigure 3: Student Enrollment in Charter Schools Program (CSP) Charter Schools and Non-CSP Charter Schools in California, Florida, and Texas 5 Years after Receiving an Award\nNote: GAO examined data for selected charter schools that received a CSP award for 2006 through 2020 and matched them to similar, non-CSP charter schools.

We analyzed Education\u2019s CSP awards data as of May 2022.\nCharter Schools Were Less Likely to Enroll\nOur regression analysis comparing student enrollment and other characteristics in CSP grant-recipient charter schools, non-CSP charter schools, and traditional public schools found:14\nStudents Served under IDEA, or White, Asian, or Multiracial Students Compared to Traditional Public Schools\n\u2022   Schools with higher percentages of students served under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), White students, Asian students, and multiracial students were more likely to be traditional public schools than charter schools, regardless of whether the charter school received a CSP grant.15 \u2022   Schools receiving funds under Title I, Part A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended, and schools with higher percentages of students served under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, and Hispanic and Black students were more likely to be charter schools regardless of whether they received a CSP grant, compared to traditional public schools.16\n\u2022   Schools with higher percentages of English learners were more likely to be traditional public schools, and less likely to be non-CSP charter schools. There was no relationship between the percentage of English learners in schools and the likelihood of schools being CSP grant- recipient charter schools. \u2022   There was no meaningful relationship between the percentage of American Indian/Alaska Native students and the likelihood of schools being CSP grant-recipient charter, non-CSP charter, or traditional public schools. \nResearchers have investigated potential reasons for student enrollment differences between charter schools and traditional schools for students with disabilities. For example:\n\u2022   Related to students with disabilities served under IDEA, researchers from the National Council on Disability have reported that:17\n\u2022  Charter schools may have practices that discourage parents of students with disabilities from applying to the school. \u2022  Parents of students with disabilities are less likely to apply to charter schools. \u2022  Students with disabilities may already be connected to specialized programs within traditional public schools. Parents may be more familiar with, or may prefer, the services provided by traditional public schools. \u2022  Parents may lack information about charter schools, such as the services available at these schools. All public school districts, including charter schools that operate independently as their own public school district and public school districts that include charter schools, are responsible for complying with relevant federal laws pertaining to students with disabilities.\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees and the Secretary of Education.

Washington, DC  20548\nComptroller General of the United States\n May 9, 2023\n Dr. Kilolo Kijakazi Acting Commissioner Social Security Administration 6401 Security Boulevard Windsor Park Building Baltimore, MD 21235\nPriority Open Recommendations: Social Security Administration\nDear Dr. Kijakazi:\nThe purpose of this letter is to provide you with an update on the overall status of the Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) implementation of GAO\u2019s recommendations and to call your continued attention to areas where open recommendations should be given high priority.1 In November 2022, we reported that, on a government-wide basis, 77 percent of our recommendations made 4 years ago were implemented.2 SSA\u2019s recommendation implementation rate was 85 percent. As of March 2023, SSA had 42 open recommendations. Fully implementing these open recommendations could significantly improve SSA\u2019s operations.\nSince our June 2022 letter, SSA has implemented four of six priority recommendations:\n\u2022  SSA implemented our April 2020 recommendation to establish a process to measure the effectiveness of corrective actions for improper payments for Supplemental Security Income and Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance. The new process includes establishing measurements and benchmarks and analyzing data to better evaluate the effectiveness of corrective actions. Measuring the effectiveness of corrective actions increases the certainty they are indeed reducing improper payments.3\n\u2022  SSA took steps to improve its oversight of organizational payees who manage Social Security benefits for vulnerable beneficiaries, including the model used to identify potentially high-risk organizational payees, as we recommended in September 2019. SSA established a plan and time frame to periodically review the model's design and considered potential additional data sources. The agency also documented changes in the model\u2019s design, and its plans to update the model in the future. These efforts will help SSA better target payees for review to ensure they are appropriately managing beneficiary funds.4\n\u2022  To address two of our May 2020 recommendations, SSA collaborated with state and federal agencies and updated its cybersecurity requirements for state agencies to be more consistent with guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. SSA also revised its assessment procedures to incorporate steps for coordinating with federal agencies when assessing state agencies\u2019 cybersecurity. These efforts can help reduce the time and resources required by state officials to respond to varying requirements from multiple federal agencies.5\nWe ask for your attention to the two unimplemented priority recommendations we identified in our 2022 letter. We are adding two new recommendations related to delivering services online and protecting privacy information, bringing the total number of priority recommendations to four. (See the enclosure for the list of recommendations and actions needed to address them.)\nThe four priority recommendations fall into the following areas.\nEnsuring program integrity. Preventing and recovering Disability Insurance (DI) overpayments to beneficiaries and reducing improper payments in Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs is vital. Our two priority recommendations in this area focus on pursuing additional recovery options for overpayments and preventing potential overpayments to individuals receiving concurrent federal workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Implementing these recommendations could better position SSA to strengthen internal controls to prevent potential overpayments and more effectively reduce the potential for other improper payments. Serving vulnerable populations. As SSA has expanded remote service delivery, it has launched new initiatives to reach certain vulnerable populations. However, it is not yet possible for most claimants to apply online: only SSI applicants who also are filing concurrently for DI are able to file for SSI online. Implementing our one priority recommendation in this area for SSA to develop a plan to expand the availability of the online application could help the underserved access benefits and services.\nProtecting sensitive information. Federal agencies collect large amounts of personally identifiable information (PII) for various government programs. One priority recommendation in this area focuses on fully defining the role of the senior agency official for privacy or other designated privacy official to be involved in protecting this sensitive information, which could result in more consistent implementation of the agency\u2019s privacy program.\n-- -- -- -- --\nIn April 2023, we issued our biennial update to our High-Risk List, which identifies government operations with greater vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement or the need for transformation to address economy, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges.6\nOne of our high-risk areas, improving and modernizing federal disability programs, highlights workload challenges and outdated criteria associated with SSA\u2019s disability programs. Resolving this high-risk area will require leadership commitment and action by SSA.\nSeveral other government-wide high-risk areas also have direct implications for SSA and its operations. These include: (1) improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations, (2) improving strategic human capital management, (3) managing federal real property, (4) ensuring the cybersecurity of the nation,7 and (5) establishing a government-wide personnel security clearance process. For example, employing strategic human capital management could help SSA identify strategies to address declines in the number of staff responsible for processing initial disability claims and appeals.\nWe urge your attention to the high-risk issue that involves SSA and the government-wide high- risk issues as they relate to SSA. Progress on high-risk issues has been possible through the concerted actions and efforts of Congress, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the leadership and staff in agencies, including SSA. In March 2022, we issued a report on key practices to successfully address high-risk areas, which can be a helpful resource as your agency continues to make progress to address high-risk issues.8\nIn addition to your continued attention to these issues, Congress plays a key role in providing oversight and maintaining focus on our recommendations to ensure they are implemented and produce their desired results. Legislation enacted in December 2022 includes a provision for GAO to identify any additional congressional oversight actions that can help agencies implement priority recommendations and address any underlying issues relating to such implementation.9\nCongress can use various strategies to address our recommendations, such as incorporating them into legislation. Congress can also use its budget, appropriations, and oversight processes to incentivize executive branch agencies to act on our recommendations and monitor their progress. For example, Congress can hold hearings focused on SSA\u2019s progress in implementing GAO\u2019s priority recommendations, withhold funds when appropriate, or take other actions to provide incentives for agencies to act. Moreover, Congress could follow up during the appropriations process and request periodic updates. Congress also plays a key role in addressing any underlying issues related to the implementation of these recommendations. For example, Congress could pass legislation providing an agency explicit authority to implement a recommendation or requiring an agency to take certain actions to implement a recommendation.\nCopies of this report are being sent to the Director of OMB and the appropriate congressional committees. In addition, the report will be available on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.\nI appreciate SSA\u2019s continued commitment to these important issues. If you have any questions or would like to discuss any of the issues outlined in this letter, please do not hesitate to contact me or Cindy Brown Barnes, Managing Director, Education, Workforce, and Income Security at brownbarnesc@gao.gov or 202-512-7215. Our teams will continue to coordinate with your staff on all 42 open recommendations, as well as those additional recommendations in the high-risk areas for which SSA has a leading role. Thank you for your attention to these matters.\nSincerely yours,\n Gene L.

GAO-15-531. Washington, D.C.: July 8, 2015.\nYear Recommendation Made:  2015\nRecommendation: To improve SSA's ability to detect, prevent, and recover potential DI benefit overpayments due to the concurrent receipt of Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act (FECA) benefits, the Commissioner of Social Security should strengthen internal controls designed to prevent DI overpayments due to the concurrent receipt of FECA benefits by implementing the alternative that provides the greatest net benefits. Action Needed: SSA agreed with this recommendation. As of February 2023, the agency stated that the Department of Labor agreed to move forward with SSA\u2019s request for FECA data. SSA is working to complete and execute the related Computer Matching Agreement in fiscal year 2023. SSA also stated that because system funding is not available in fiscal year 2024, it will re-evaluate funding for fiscal year 2025. SSA plans to use FECA benefit data to improve efficiencies in its ability to offset or reduce DI benefits when an individual is concurrently receiving FECA benefits. To fully implement this recommendation, SSA needs to complete these plans, which could help improve the financial status of the DI program and ensure that SSA does not continue overpaying beneficiaries who may have difficulty repaying debt incurred by overpayments. An estimate of these potential financial benefits is not available.\nDirector: Seto Bagdoyan, Forensic Audits and Investigative Service\nContact Information: BagdoyanS@gao.gov or (202) 512-6722\n Disability Insurance: SSA Needs to Better Track Efforts and Evaluate Options to Recover Debt and Deter Potential Fraud. GAO-16-331. Washington, D.C.: Apr. 13, 2016.\nYear Recommendation Made:  2016\nRecommendation: To ensure effective and appropriate recovery of DI overpayments and administration of penalties and sanctions, the Acting Commissioner of the Social Security Administration should adjust the minimum withholding rate to 10 percent of monthly DI benefits to allow quicker recovery of debt.\nAction Needed: SSA agreed with this recommendation. The agency stated that it submitted legislative proposals in the President\u2019s budgets for fiscal years 2017 through 2021 to establish a minimum withholding for overpayments of 10 percent of a beneficiary's monthly benefit. As of February 2023, SSA stated that it previously pursued this change through regulation, but stopped to address other regulatory priorities related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTo fully implement this recommendation, SSA needs to increase the amount of DI overpayments it recovers by adjusting its minimum benefit withholding rate from $10 per month to 10 percent of monthly benefits. This change would increase scheduled collections and reduce the time it will take to fully recover overpayments, result in tens of millions of dollars in overpayment debt recovered over a 5-year period, and promote equity in how SSA deals with overpayments across its programs.\nPotential Financial Benefits: Tens of Millions over a 5-year period\nDirector: Elizabeth Curda, Education, Workforce, and Income Security\nContact Information: CurdaE@gao.gov or (202) 512-4040\n Serving Vulnerable Populations\nSocial Security Administration: Remote Service Delivery Increased during COVID-19, but More Could be Done to Assist Vulnerable Populations.

We await the agency\u2019s plans to implement this recommendation, which are due in May 2023. Without additional online services, many individuals who would be capable of using SSA\u2019s online services may not be able to do so, and the agency may devote scarce staff resources to assist individuals who otherwise might apply independently online.\nDirector: Elizabeth Curda, Education, Workforce, and Income Security\nContact Information: CurdaE@gao.gov or (202) 512-4040\nProtecting Sensitive Information\nPrivacy: Dedicated Leadership Can Improve Programs and Address Challenges. GAO-22- 105065.  Washington, D.C.: September 22, 2022.\nYear Recommendation Made:   2022\nRecommendation: The Commissioner of SSA should establish a time frame for fully defining the role of the senior agency official for privacy or other designated privacy official in reviewing and approving system categorizations, overseeing privacy control assessments, and reviewing authorization packages, and document these roles.\nAction Needed: SSA agreed with this recommendation. Agency officials noted that the agency is planning to revise its guidance to clarify the role of privacy officials in the risk management process by fiscal year 2024. To fully implement this recommendation, the agency needs to provide time frames for fully defining the role of the senior official or other privacy officials in those processes.

Implementing our one priority recommendation in this area for SSA to develop a plan to expand the availability of the online application could help the underserved access benefits and services.\nProtecting sensitive information. Federal agencies collect large amounts of personally identifiable information (PII) for various government programs. One priority recommendation in this area focuses on fully defining the role of the senior agency official for privacy or other designated privacy official to be involved in protecting this sensitive information, which could result in more consistent implementation of the agency\u2019s privacy program.\n-- -- -- -- --\nIn April 2023, we issued our biennial update to our High-Risk List, which identifies government operations with greater vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement or the need for transformation to address economy, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges.6\nOne of our high-risk areas, improving and modernizing federal disability programs, highlights workload challenges and outdated criteria associated with SSA\u2019s disability programs. Resolving this high-risk area will require leadership commitment and action by SSA.\nSeveral other government-wide high-risk areas also have direct implications for SSA and its operations. These include: (1) improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations, (2) improving strategic human capital management, (3) managing federal real property, (4) ensuring the cybersecurity of the nation,7 and (5) establishing a government-wide personnel security clearance process. For example, employing strategic human capital management could help SSA identify strategies to address declines in the number of staff responsible for processing initial disability claims and appeals.\nWe urge your attention to the high-risk issue that involves SSA and the government-wide high- risk issues as they relate to SSA. Progress on high-risk issues has been possible through the concerted actions and efforts of Congress, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the leadership and staff in agencies, including SSA. In March 2022, we issued a report on key practices to successfully address high-risk areas, which can be a helpful resource as your agency continues to make progress to address high-risk issues.8\nIn addition to your continued attention to these issues, Congress plays a key role in providing oversight and maintaining focus on our recommendations to ensure they are implemented and produce their desired results. Legislation enacted in December 2022 includes a provision for GAO to identify any additional congressional oversight actions that can help agencies implement priority recommendations and address any underlying issues relating to such implementation.9\nCongress can use various strategies to address our recommendations, such as incorporating them into legislation. Congress can also use its budget, appropriations, and oversight processes to incentivize executive branch agencies to act on our recommendations and monitor their progress. For example, Congress can hold hearings focused on SSA\u2019s progress in implementing GAO\u2019s priority recommendations, withhold funds when appropriate, or take other actions to provide incentives for agencies to act. Moreover, Congress could follow up during the appropriations process and request periodic updates. Congress also plays a key role in addressing any underlying issues related to the implementation of these recommendations. For example, Congress could pass legislation providing an agency explicit authority to implement a recommendation or requiring an agency to take certain actions to implement a recommendation.\nCopies of this report are being sent to the Director of OMB and the appropriate congressional committees. In addition, the report will be available on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.\nI appreciate SSA\u2019s continued commitment to these important issues.

GAO-15-531. Washington, D.C.: July 8, 2015.\nYear Recommendation Made:  2015\nRecommendation: To improve SSA's ability to detect, prevent, and recover potential DI benefit overpayments due to the concurrent receipt of Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act (FECA) benefits, the Commissioner of Social Security should strengthen internal controls designed to prevent DI overpayments due to the concurrent receipt of FECA benefits by implementing the alternative that provides the greatest net benefits. Action Needed: SSA agreed with this recommendation. As of February 2023, the agency stated that the Department of Labor agreed to move forward with SSA\u2019s request for FECA data. SSA is working to complete and execute the related Computer Matching Agreement in fiscal year 2023. SSA also stated that because system funding is not available in fiscal year 2024, it will re-evaluate funding for fiscal year 2025. SSA plans to use FECA benefit data to improve efficiencies in its ability to offset or reduce DI benefits when an individual is concurrently receiving FECA benefits. To fully implement this recommendation, SSA needs to complete these plans, which could help improve the financial status of the DI program and ensure that SSA does not continue overpaying beneficiaries who may have difficulty repaying debt incurred by overpayments.

Washington, DC  20548\nComptroller General of the United States\n May 9, 2023\n Dr. Kilolo Kijakazi Acting Commissioner Social Security Administration 6401 Security Boulevard Windsor Park Building Baltimore, MD 21235\nPriority Open Recommendations: Social Security Administration\nDear Dr. Kijakazi:\nThe purpose of this letter is to provide you with an update on the overall status of the Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) implementation of GAO\u2019s recommendations and to call your continued attention to areas where open recommendations should be given high priority.1 In November 2022, we reported that, on a government-wide basis, 77 percent of our recommendations made 4 years ago were implemented.2 SSA\u2019s recommendation implementation rate was 85 percent. As of March 2023, SSA had 42 open recommendations. Fully implementing these open recommendations could significantly improve SSA\u2019s operations.\nSince our June 2022 letter, SSA has implemented four of six priority recommendations:\n\u2022  SSA implemented our April 2020 recommendation to establish a process to measure the effectiveness of corrective actions for improper payments for Supplemental Security Income and Old-Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance. The new process includes establishing measurements and benchmarks and analyzing data to better evaluate the effectiveness of corrective actions. Measuring the effectiveness of corrective actions increases the certainty they are indeed reducing improper payments.3\n\u2022  SSA took steps to improve its oversight of organizational payees who manage Social Security benefits for vulnerable beneficiaries, including the model used to identify potentially high-risk organizational payees, as we recommended in September 2019. SSA established a plan and time frame to periodically review the model's design and considered potential additional data sources. The agency also documented changes in the model\u2019s design, and its plans to update the model in the future. These efforts will help SSA better target payees for review to ensure they are appropriately managing beneficiary funds.4\n\u2022  To address two of our May 2020 recommendations, SSA collaborated with state and federal agencies and updated its cybersecurity requirements for state agencies to be more consistent with guidance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. SSA also revised its assessment procedures to incorporate steps for coordinating with federal agencies when assessing state agencies\u2019 cybersecurity. These efforts can help reduce the time and resources required by state officials to respond to varying requirements from multiple federal agencies.5\nWe ask for your attention to the two unimplemented priority recommendations we identified in our 2022 letter. We are adding two new recommendations related to delivering services online and protecting privacy information, bringing the total number of priority recommendations to four. (See the enclosure for the list of recommendations and actions needed to address them.)\nThe four priority recommendations fall into the following areas.\nEnsuring program integrity. Preventing and recovering Disability Insurance (DI) overpayments to beneficiaries and reducing improper payments in Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs is vital. Our two priority recommendations in this area focus on pursuing additional recovery options for overpayments and preventing potential overpayments to individuals receiving concurrent federal workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Implementing these recommendations could better position SSA to strengthen internal controls to prevent potential overpayments and more effectively reduce the potential for other improper payments. Serving vulnerable populations. As SSA has expanded remote service delivery, it has launched new initiatives to reach certain vulnerable populations. However, it is not yet possible for most claimants to apply online: only SSI applicants who also are filing concurrently for DI are able to file for SSI online.

{"content": "February 15, 2023\nThe Honorable Margaret Wood Hassan Chair Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Spending Oversight Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs United States Senate\nThe Honorable Robert P. Casey, Jr. United States Senate\nThe Honorable Chris Van Hollen United States Senate\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION: Additional Data Collection Would Help Assess the Performance of a Program Supporting College Students with Disabilities\nIn recent years, Congress has provided over $1 billion annually for eight college access grant programs known as the Federal TRIO programs (TRIO). These programs assist approximately 800,000 disadvantaged students with preparing for, enrolling in, and graduating from college. While TRIO programs primarily serve low-income and first-generation college students, some of the programs also target individuals with disabilities and veterans. Authorized under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), TRIO is administered by the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Postsecondary Education. TRIO provides over 3,000 competitive grants to organizations across all 50 states. Grantees are primarily postsecondary institutions such as colleges, but school districts and community organizations also receive these grants. Research has shown that students with disabilities are less likely to complete a postsecondary education, and this lack of further education can have lifelong career and financial consequences.1 You asked us to examine questions related to students with disabilities and TRIO. This report examines the extent to which Education has collected and reported information on students with disabilities served through TRIO. To examine this topic, we reviewed Education's most recent annual report for each TRIO program, as well as its reporting instructions to TRIO grantees. In addition, we interviewed officials from Education\u2019s Office of Postsecondary Education as well as an organization representing TRIO grantees to understand Education\u2019s data collection and performance reporting for TRIO.2 We  examined Education\u2019s performance reporting under certain requirements in the HEA and assessed them against effective performance management practices we have identified in our prior work. We conducted this performance audit from November 2021 to February 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objective. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objective.\n Background\nThe purpose of the TRIO programs is generally to promote achievement in postsecondary education among disadvantaged students. Seven of the eight TRIO programs serve students through grantees such as colleges, while the eighth is a training program for directors and staff of TRIO grants (see table 1). The seven TRIO programs that serve students directly generally require that at least two-thirds of those participating in a grantee\u2019s project be low-income individuals who are or would be first-generation college students. While none of the TRIO programs focuses exclusively on students with disabilities, the HEA specifically states that part of the program design for the Student Support Services (SSS) program is to foster an institutional climate supportive of students with disabilities.\nUpward Bound Math and Science   Prepares high school students for Educational Opportunity Centers College enrollment assistance for adult baccalaureate Achievement Training Program for Federal    Provides professional development for TRIO Programs\nTwo TRIO programs\u2014SSS and Veterans Upward Bound (VUB)\u2014have disability-related eligibility criteria. For SSS, the HEA states that at least two-thirds of participants in a grantee\u2019s project must be individuals with disabilities, or low-income individuals who are first-generation college students.3 For VUB, having a disability is also one way to be eligible. Specifically, to participate in VUB a veteran must be low-income, first-generation in college, or have a high risk for academic failure. Program regulations define having a high risk for academic failure for veterans in three ways, one of which is having a disability.4\nThe HEA requires Education to report on the performance of TRIO programs. Although the HEA does not explicitly require Education to collect data on targeted demographic groups served by TRIO, the HEA requires Education to report annually on the performance of each TRIO program and provide separate information, as applicable, for targeted demographic groups, such as individuals with disabilities. To evaluate and report on program performance, Education collects data on degree completion and other educational outcomes for each TRIO participant.  However, in December 2020, we reported that although Education collects data on educational outcomes for TRIO participants, the agency has gaps in its evidence on program effectiveness. We recommended that the agency develop a plan for assessing the effectiveness of TRIO programs that serve students.5 Education agreed and is exploring options for improving its performance assessment of TRIO programs.\n For the six TRIO programs that do not have disability-related eligibility criteria, Education does not collect information on whether participants have a disability. As noted above, the HEA does not explicitly require Education to collect such data. Focusing on the two TRIO programs with disability-related eligibility criteria, we found: \u2022  Education collects information on the disability status of each VUB participant but does not for SSS participants.\no  For VUB, Education collects information on the disability status of each participant. In 2020, Education reported that about half of the approximately 6,300 VUB participants had a disability in 2016-17, the most recent year reported for that program.\no  For SSS, Education does not collect information on each participant\u2019s disability status, despite evidence that grantees collect this information. Instead, Education collects data from SSS grantees about whether participants meet one of several possible eligibility criteria. Specifically, the criteria are: (1) low-income only; (2) first-generation only; (3) low- income and first-generation; (4) disabled; or (5) disabled and low-income. These data yield incomplete information on SSS participants with disabilities because they could be counted as low-income, first-generation, or both, instead of as disabled. According to Education, in\n2020-21, the most recent year available, over 23,000 students\u2014or about 12 percent of all SSS participants\u2014were eligible by being disabled or being disabled and low-income. Thus, at least that many students with disabilities participated that year, but the precise number could be higher and is unknown. \u2022  Education periodically reports on the performance of VUB and SSS, but does not include performance information for SSS participants with disabilities. For example, Education last reported on VUB in 2020 and on SSS in 2016 and 2019. The VUB report included disaggregated performance information for participants with a disability; however, the SSS reports did not include separate performance information for participants with disabilities. \u2022  Education cited reasons for not collecting data on the disability status of SSS participants, but not capturing this information has consequences. For example, Education officials cited concerns about increasing the workload of SSS grantees who submit data on potentially hundreds of participants. However, according to representatives of TRIO grantees, SSS grantees already collect information from students about each participant\u2019s disability status, as well as other demographic information such as gender and race. Education officials also questioned the usefulness of the agency collecting these data because comparable data on outcomes for students with disabilities may not exist. However, Education could consider the performance of SSS participants with disabilities in various ways. For example, the agency could compare the group\u2019s outcomes over time, or with the outcomes of SSS participants without disabilities as Education did for VUB in 2020.6 As a result of not collecting data on each SSS participant\u2019s disability status, Education cannot fully evaluate and report on the program\u2019s performance for this population. \u2022  HEA requires, and best practices underpin the need for, reporting on SSS for participants with disabilities. The HEA requires Education to report annually to Congress on the performance of TRIO programs, including SSS, focusing on relevant outcome criteria. Such outcome criteria must be disaggregated by, among other groups, individuals with disabilities. Thus, the HEA requires Education to report to Congress on SSS performance using outcome criteria disaggregated by individuals with disabilities. Furthermore, we have reported that to be useful, performance information must meet users\u2019 needs for completeness and validity, among other attributes. As an example, we reported that disaggregating performance information can help managers focus on areas of concern.7\nConclusions SSS, one of the largest TRIO programs, has disability-related eligibility criteria. However, Education does not collect information on the disability status of each SSS participant. In response to our prior recommendation regarding evaluating the effectiveness of TRIO programs that serve students, the agency is exploring options for improving its performance assessment of these programs. As it does, Education has the opportunity to address the data needs for these assessments. Without collecting information on which SSS participants have a disability, Education  cannot fully assess SSS\u2019s performance for individuals with disabilities, and any eventual plan to evaluate and report on the performance of TRIO programs will be incomplete.\nRecommendation for Executive Action Education\u2019s Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education should collect data from SSS grantees on each participant\u2019s disability status and use this information to report on program performance for participants with disabilities.

Casey, Jr. United States Senate\nThe Honorable Chris Van Hollen United States Senate\nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION: Additional Data Collection Would Help Assess the Performance of a Program Supporting College Students with Disabilities\nIn recent years, Congress has provided over $1 billion annually for eight college access grant programs known as the Federal TRIO programs (TRIO). These programs assist approximately 800,000 disadvantaged students with preparing for, enrolling in, and graduating from college. While TRIO programs primarily serve low-income and first-generation college students, some of the programs also target individuals with disabilities and veterans. Authorized under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), TRIO is administered by the Department of Education\u2019s Office of Postsecondary Education. TRIO provides over 3,000 competitive grants to organizations across all 50 states. Grantees are primarily postsecondary institutions such as colleges, but school districts and community organizations also receive these grants. Research has shown that students with disabilities are less likely to complete a postsecondary education, and this lack of further education can have lifelong career and financial consequences.1 You asked us to examine questions related to students with disabilities and TRIO. This report examines the extent to which Education has collected and reported information on students with disabilities served through TRIO. To examine this topic, we reviewed Education's most recent annual report for each TRIO program, as well as its reporting instructions to TRIO grantees. In addition, we interviewed officials from Education\u2019s Office of Postsecondary Education as well as an organization representing TRIO grantees to understand Education\u2019s data collection and performance reporting for TRIO.2 We  examined Education\u2019s performance reporting under certain requirements in the HEA and assessed them against effective performance management practices we have identified in our prior work. We conducted this performance audit from November 2021 to February 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objective. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objective.\n Background\nThe purpose of the TRIO programs is generally to promote achievement in postsecondary education among disadvantaged students. Seven of the eight TRIO programs serve students through grantees such as colleges, while the eighth is a training program for directors and staff of TRIO grants (see table 1). The seven TRIO programs that serve students directly generally require that at least two-thirds of those participating in a grantee\u2019s project be low-income individuals who are or would be first-generation college students. While none of the TRIO programs focuses exclusively on students with disabilities, the HEA specifically states that part of the program design for the Student Support Services (SSS) program is to foster an institutional climate supportive of students with disabilities.\nUpward Bound Math and Science   Prepares high school students for Educational Opportunity Centers College enrollment assistance for adult baccalaureate Achievement Training Program for Federal    Provides professional development for TRIO Programs\nTwo TRIO programs\u2014SSS and Veterans Upward Bound (VUB)\u2014have disability-related eligibility criteria. For SSS, the HEA states that at least two-thirds of participants in a grantee\u2019s project must be individuals with disabilities, or low-income individuals who are first-generation college students.3 For VUB, having a disability is also one way to be eligible. Specifically, to participate in VUB a veteran must be low-income, first-generation in college, or have a high risk for academic failure. Program regulations define having a high risk for academic failure for veterans in three ways, one of which is having a disability.4\nThe HEA requires Education to report on the performance of TRIO programs. Although the HEA does not explicitly require Education to collect data on targeted demographic groups served by TRIO, the HEA requires Education to report annually on the performance of each TRIO program and provide separate information, as applicable, for targeted demographic groups, such as individuals with disabilities. To evaluate and report on program performance, Education collects data on degree completion and other educational outcomes for each TRIO participant.  However, in December 2020, we reported that although Education collects data on educational outcomes for TRIO participants, the agency has gaps in its evidence on program effectiveness. We recommended that the agency develop a plan for assessing the effectiveness of TRIO programs that serve students.5 Education agreed and is exploring options for improving its performance assessment of TRIO programs.\n For the six TRIO programs that do not have disability-related eligibility criteria, Education does not collect information on whether participants have a disability. As noted above, the HEA does not explicitly require Education to collect such data. Focusing on the two TRIO programs with disability-related eligibility criteria, we found: \u2022  Education collects information on the disability status of each VUB participant but does not for SSS participants.\no  For VUB, Education collects information on the disability status of each participant. In 2020, Education reported that about half of the approximately 6,300 VUB participants had a disability in 2016-17, the most recent year reported for that program.\no  For SSS, Education does not collect information on each participant\u2019s disability status, despite evidence that grantees collect this information. Instead, Education collects data from SSS grantees about whether participants meet one of several possible eligibility criteria. Specifically, the criteria are: (1) low-income only; (2) first-generation only; (3) low- income and first-generation; (4) disabled; or (5) disabled and low-income. These data yield incomplete information on SSS participants with disabilities because they could be counted as low-income, first-generation, or both, instead of as disabled. According to Education, in\n2020-21, the most recent year available, over 23,000 students\u2014or about 12 percent of all SSS participants\u2014were eligible by being disabled or being disabled and low-income. Thus, at least that many students with disabilities participated that year, but the precise number could be higher and is unknown. \u2022  Education periodically reports on the performance of VUB and SSS, but does not include performance information for SSS participants with disabilities. For example, Education last reported on VUB in 2020 and on SSS in 2016 and 2019. The VUB report included disaggregated performance information for participants with a disability; however, the SSS reports did not include separate performance information for participants with disabilities. \u2022  Education cited reasons for not collecting data on the disability status of SSS participants, but not capturing this information has consequences. For example, Education officials cited concerns about increasing the workload of SSS grantees who submit data on potentially hundreds of participants. However, according to representatives of TRIO grantees, SSS grantees already collect information from students about each participant\u2019s disability status, as well as other demographic information such as gender and race. Education officials also questioned the usefulness of the agency collecting these data because comparable data on outcomes for students with disabilities may not exist. However, Education could consider the performance of SSS participants with disabilities in various ways. For example, the agency could compare the group\u2019s outcomes over time, or with the outcomes of SSS participants without disabilities as Education did for VUB in 2020.6 As a result of not collecting data on each SSS participant\u2019s disability status, Education cannot fully evaluate and report on the program\u2019s performance for this population. \u2022  HEA requires, and best practices underpin the need for, reporting on SSS for participants with disabilities. The HEA requires Education to report annually to Congress on the performance of TRIO programs, including SSS, focusing on relevant outcome criteria. Such outcome criteria must be disaggregated by, among other groups, individuals with disabilities. Thus, the HEA requires Education to report to Congress on SSS performance using outcome criteria disaggregated by individuals with disabilities. Furthermore, we have reported that to be useful, performance information must meet users\u2019 needs for completeness and validity, among other attributes.

Washington, DC  20548\n August 24, 2023\nThe Honorable Maria Cantwell Chair The Honorable Ted Cruz Ranking Member Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation United States Senate\nThe Honorable Cathy McMorris Rodgers Chair The Honorable Frank Pallone, Jr. Ranking Member Committee on Energy and Commerce House of Representatives\n Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program: Feedback Should Be Provided to Applicants Receiving Equitable Distribution Grants\nTribal access to broadband internet lags behind the rest of the country. However, two recent appropriations totaling $3 billion for the new Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program (TBCP) provided the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) with an opportunity to help increase tribal access to broadband.1\nIn January 2023, we began our second review of TBCP in response to a provision in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (2021 Act).2 This act includes a provision for GAO to review, every six months until funds are expended, TBCP grants awarded during the prior six months.3 This report responds to the statutory deadline for the fourth report and provides timely information about an aspect of the program\u2014feedback to applicants\u2014related to the notice of funding opportunity issued on July 27, 2023. Meanwhile, we are continuing our review of NTIA\u2019s administration of TBCP, including reviewing the post-award process, additional topics related to NTIA\u2019s actions taken to distribute grants on an equitable basis, and the sustainability of projects.\nAs of July 25, 2023, NTIA had announced 191 grants totaling $1.79 billion of the $1.98 billion it planned to award under its original notice of funding opportunity.4 According to NTIA officials, NTIA received 301 applications requesting a total of $5.85 billion. These applications involved 452 out of 596 Tribes.5 The original notice stated that NTIA expected grants to range from $1 million to $50 million for broadband infrastructure deployment projects and from $50,000 to $2.5 million for broadband use and adoption projects. On July 27, 2023, NTIA announced a second notice of funding opportunity, under which almost $1 billion will be made available to eligible entities.6\nThe 2021 Act requires NTIA to make the $1 billion appropriated for TBCP in that act available to eligible entities (e.g., Tribes) on an equitable basis, but it did not define equitable basis.7 The original notice stated that NTIA would allocate up to $500,000 per tribal government to meet this equitable distribution requirement. NTIA officials later clarified to us that this allocation would be available to applicants that passed merit review but did not receive the amount they requested.8 NTIA refers to grants of up to $500,000 per tribal government instead of the larger amount the applicant has requested as equitable distribution grants.9\nAs of July 25, 2023, NTIA had awarded 56 equitable distribution grants to applicants, according to NTIA officials. These 56 equitable distribution grants account for about 30 percent of the 191 announced TBCP grants but account for less than 2 percent of the funds awarded.\nWe examined the extent to which NTIA provided constructive feedback to applicants that received equitable distribution grants. To conduct this work, we reviewed relevant laws, the Department of Commerce Grants and Cooperative Agreements Manual (Commerce Grants Manual), NTIA program documentation, and leading practices for managing broadband grant programs that we developed in prior work.10 In addition, we interviewed Commerce and NTIA  officials regarding Commerce policies and NTIA practices related to providing feedback to applicants that received equitable distribution grants.\nWe obtained views and information through a survey, interviews, and conversations at tribal broadband events as follows.11\n\u2022   We sent a survey to 29 entities we identified as possible recipients of equitable distribution grants. To ensure the questions were clear and interpretable, we conducted two pretests with respondents. Twelve survey recipients did not respond, and four survey recipients indicated they did not expect to receive an equitable distribution grant. Of the remaining 13 respondents, seven reported that they had received an equitable distribution grant, which we confirmed by reviewing NTIA\u2019s award announcements, and six reported that they expected to receive an equitable distribution grant.12\n\u2022   Of the 13 survey respondents that received an equitable distribution grant or reported that they expected to receive an equitable distribution grant, we spoke with four applicants at one or both of two consecutive events we attended in March 2023\u2014a tribal broadband industry event and a Tribal Broadband Leaders Network event. Two of these applicants received equitable distribution grants in April 2023, and two told us they expected to receive an equitable distribution grant. In addition, we interviewed two of the survey respondents that expected to receive equitable distribution grants for our broader study.13 One of these interviews occurred before we administered the survey, and one occurred while we were administering the survey.\nWe analyzed information provided through responses to open-ended survey questions, conversations at conferences, and interviews to identify key themes. We then compared the information to a leading practice related to external communication for the management of broadband grant programs and to the Commerce Grants Manual.\nWe conducted this performance audit from March 2023 to August 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nNTIA Did Not Provide Constructive Feedback to Applicants that Received Equitable Distribution Grants\nNone of the seven applicants we surveyed that received an equitable distribution grant reported that NTIA provided constructive feedback on their application; all seven reported they had requested feedback.14 One survey respondent reported that NTIA officials stated that their decision was based on funding availability, not the application\u2019s merits or quality. Another survey respondent reported that NTIA officials told them that there were other applicants with greater needs. In both cases, these responses lacked constructive information that could help the applicants improve their applications for subsequent rounds, inform decisions about whether to pursue other broadband funding options, or inform other planning activities.\nSome applicants that received or expected to receive equitable distribution grants indicated they were disappointed by the lack of constructive feedback and highlighted the importance of such feedback as follows.\n\u2022   Constructive feedback could help applicants receiving equitable distribution grants improve their application for the second TBCP funding round, which NTIA announced on July 27, 2023. One survey respondent that received an equitable distribution grant and three survey respondents that expected to receive an equitable distribution grant reported believing they could be disadvantaged for the second round without constructive feedback on the first round\u2019s grant decision.\n\u2022   Constructive feedback could help applicants receiving equitable distribution grants decide whether to apply for the second round of TBCP funding. Applying for a federal grant can be complicated and time consuming, particularly for applicants with less experience. One applicant we spoke with that expected to receive an equitable distribution grant said they would want to know if their community\u2019s need is not sufficient before they go to the trouble of applying again.\n\u2022   Constructive feedback could inform Tribes\u2019 approaches toward other funding opportunities, including the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program.15 One applicant we spoke with that received an equitable distribution grant and one respondent that expected to receive an equitable distribution grant said that feedback on their TBCP application would likely be relevant to applications for other broadband programs.\n\u2022  Constructive feedback\u2014particularly information about the process NTIA used to decide which applications passing merit review would receive a full award\u2014could foster confidence in the grant program. One respondent that expected to receive an equitable distribution grant said that a lack of transparency in why some applications are receiving full funding while others are receiving equitable distribution grants could erode confidence in the grant process. In the absence of this information, three applicants we spoke with\u2014one that received an equitable distribution grant and two that expected to receive an equitable distribution grant\u2014shared a variety of explanations for how they thought NTIA made award decisions, such as favoring shovel-ready projects, penalizing applications for having high construction costs, favoring fiber even when fiber would delay provision of service for years, and preferring certain types of applicants over others.\nThe first notice of funding opportunity indicated that unsuccessful applicants would have an opportunity to receive a debriefing after the opportunity officially closed and that unsuccessful applicants must request feedback within 10 business days of notification that their application would not be funded. According to the original notice, NTIA expected to complete its review, select the successful applicants, and process awards by November 29, 2021. However, NTIA began announcing awards on a rolling basis in November 2021, and, as of July 25, 2023, still planned to announce awards in the coming months, according to NTIA officials. As a result, applicants that received notice that their applications were unsuccessful could be awaiting feedback for well over a year after requesting feedback.16\nNTIA officials told us they do not plan to provide constructive feedback to applicants that received equitable distribution grants for three main reasons.\n\u2022  NTIA considers applicants receiving equitable distribution grants to be successful because they were selected for an award. The Commerce Grants Manual and notice of funding opportunity provisions related to providing feedback specify that feedback is for unsuccessful applicants.17 Further, the Commerce Grants Manual does not address situations where grantees do not receive the full amount of funding requested. However, leading practices for managing broadband grant programs indicate agencies should provide feedback for all applicants.18 Commerce attorneys and NTIA officials said that NTIA could choose to provide feedback on any application but the Commerce Grants Manual does not direct them to provide feedback to applicants that did not receive any funding, which does not include equitable distribution grant recipients. However, NTIA officials said that their ability to provide constructive feedback is limited in certain circumstances.19\n\u2022   NTIA officials said that adjustments to the second funding round affect the extent to which first-round feedback would be relevant. For example, the second notice of funding opportunity prioritizes the review of applications for infrastructure deployment from first round recipients of grants for planning, engineering, feasibility, and sustainability projects. NTIA officials said that those equitable distribution grantees with these kinds of projects would accrue similar benefits from completing their projects as they would from receiving feedback from NTIA. In addition, NTIA officials told us that they plan to provide additional technical assistance to applicants during the second round of funding. They further said the technical assistance could be more helpful to applicants than feedback on their first-round applications. NTIA could provide feedback in this way, as long as it is constructive and timely enough to allow applicants to incorporate it into applications for the second round of funding.\n\u2022  According to NTIA officials, the agency faces staffing challenges in providing feedback to applicants and must prioritize program activities. However, providing constructive feedback could help potential second-round applicants decide whether to apply and improve their applications in a way that reduces the time NTIA needs to review applications. It could also reduce the need for NTIA to request additional information to address defects in applications, which we previously identified as a cause of delay in making award decisions.20\nNTIA\u2019s plan to provide technical assistance to applicants, if appropriately timed and tailored to meet applicants\u2019 needs, could represent the kind of constructive feedback applicants receiving equitable distribution grants said they needed. However, without constructive feedback from NTIA\u2014including information on the process NTIA used to decide which applications that passed merit review would receive full funding\u2014applicants receiving equitable distribution grants will not have the information needed to 1) determine whether to apply to the next TBCP funding round, 2) improve their applications in the next funding round if they decide to apply, and 3) determine whether to apply for other funding programs. In addition, applicants may lose confidence in the impartiality of the program\u2019s award process.\nConclusions\nThe Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program provides a historic chance to improve tribal access to broadband and further narrow the digital divide. NTIA has about $1 billion more to distribute in its second round of program funding. In the first round, 56 applicants received equitable distribution grants for a fraction of their original request. NTIA has provided little to no feedback to applicants who received equitable distribution grants. Leading practices indicate that agencies should provide feedback to all applicants. Constructive feedback, possibly in the form of technical assistance for the second round of funding and information about NTIA\u2019s process for deciding which meritorious applications received full funding in the first round, could help these applicants improve their applications and increase confidence in the impartiality of the program\u2019s award process.\nRecommendation for Executive Action\nThe Administrator of NTIA should provide applicants that receive equitable distribution grants in the first round of TBCP with constructive feedback\u2014by providing debriefings or technical assistance\u2014to help these applicants improve their applications for the second round of TBCP funding.

Washington, DC  20548\n August 24, 2023\nThe Honorable Maria Cantwell Chair The Honorable Ted Cruz Ranking Member Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation United States Senate\nThe Honorable Cathy McMorris Rodgers Chair The Honorable Frank Pallone, Jr. Ranking Member Committee on Energy and Commerce House of Representatives\n Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program: Feedback Should Be Provided to Applicants Receiving Equitable Distribution Grants\nTribal access to broadband internet lags behind the rest of the country. However, two recent appropriations totaling $3 billion for the new Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program (TBCP) provided the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) with an opportunity to help increase tribal access to broadband.1\nIn January 2023, we began our second review of TBCP in response to a provision in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (2021 Act).2 This act includes a provision for GAO to review, every six months until funds are expended, TBCP grants awarded during the prior six months.3 This report responds to the statutory deadline for the fourth report and provides timely information about an aspect of the program\u2014feedback to applicants\u2014related to the notice of funding opportunity issued on July 27, 2023. Meanwhile, we are continuing our review of NTIA\u2019s administration of TBCP, including reviewing the post-award process, additional topics related to NTIA\u2019s actions taken to distribute grants on an equitable basis, and the sustainability of projects.\nAs of July 25, 2023, NTIA had announced 191 grants totaling $1.79 billion of the $1.98 billion it planned to award under its original notice of funding opportunity.4 According to NTIA officials, NTIA received 301 applications requesting a total of $5.85 billion. These applications involved 452 out of 596 Tribes.5 The original notice stated that NTIA expected grants to range from $1 million to $50 million for broadband infrastructure deployment projects and from $50,000 to $2.5 million for broadband use and adoption projects. On July 27, 2023, NTIA announced a second notice of funding opportunity, under which almost $1 billion will be made available to eligible entities.6\nThe 2021 Act requires NTIA to make the $1 billion appropriated for TBCP in that act available to eligible entities (e.g., Tribes) on an equitable basis, but it did not define equitable basis.7 The original notice stated that NTIA would allocate up to $500,000 per tribal government to meet this equitable distribution requirement. NTIA officials later clarified to us that this allocation would be available to applicants that passed merit review but did not receive the amount they requested.8 NTIA refers to grants of up to $500,000 per tribal government instead of the larger amount the applicant has requested as equitable distribution grants.9\nAs of July 25, 2023, NTIA had awarded 56 equitable distribution grants to applicants, according to NTIA officials. These 56 equitable distribution grants account for about 30 percent of the 191 announced TBCP grants but account for less than 2 percent of the funds awarded.\nWe examined the extent to which NTIA provided constructive feedback to applicants that received equitable distribution grants. To conduct this work, we reviewed relevant laws, the Department of Commerce Grants and Cooperative Agreements Manual (Commerce Grants Manual), NTIA program documentation, and leading practices for managing broadband grant programs that we developed in prior work.10 In addition, we interviewed Commerce and NTIA  officials regarding Commerce policies and NTIA practices related to providing feedback to applicants that received equitable distribution grants.\nWe obtained views and information through a survey, interviews, and conversations at tribal broadband events as follows.11\n\u2022   We sent a survey to 29 entities we identified as possible recipients of equitable distribution grants. To ensure the questions were clear and interpretable, we conducted two pretests with respondents. Twelve survey recipients did not respond, and four survey recipients indicated they did not expect to receive an equitable distribution grant. Of the remaining 13 respondents, seven reported that they had received an equitable distribution grant, which we confirmed by reviewing NTIA\u2019s award announcements, and six reported that they expected to receive an equitable distribution grant.12\n\u2022   Of the 13 survey respondents that received an equitable distribution grant or reported that they expected to receive an equitable distribution grant, we spoke with four applicants at one or both of two consecutive events we attended in March 2023\u2014a tribal broadband industry event and a Tribal Broadband Leaders Network event. Two of these applicants received equitable distribution grants in April 2023, and two told us they expected to receive an equitable distribution grant. In addition, we interviewed two of the survey respondents that expected to receive equitable distribution grants for our broader study.13 One of these interviews occurred before we administered the survey, and one occurred while we were administering the survey.\nWe analyzed information provided through responses to open-ended survey questions, conversations at conferences, and interviews to identify key themes. We then compared the information to a leading practice related to external communication for the management of broadband grant programs and to the Commerce Grants Manual.\nWe conducted this performance audit from March 2023 to August 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nNTIA Did Not Provide Constructive Feedback to Applicants that Received Equitable Distribution Grants\nNone of the seven applicants we surveyed that received an equitable distribution grant reported that NTIA provided constructive feedback on their application; all seven reported they had requested feedback.14 One survey respondent reported that NTIA officials stated that their decision was based on funding availability, not the application\u2019s merits or quality. Another survey respondent reported that NTIA officials told them that there were other applicants with greater needs. In both cases, these responses lacked constructive information that could help the applicants improve their applications for subsequent rounds, inform decisions about whether to pursue other broadband funding options, or inform other planning activities.\nSome applicants that received or expected to receive equitable distribution grants indicated they were disappointed by the lack of constructive feedback and highlighted the importance of such feedback as follows.\n\u2022   Constructive feedback could help applicants receiving equitable distribution grants improve their application for the second TBCP funding round, which NTIA announced on July 27, 2023. One survey respondent that received an equitable distribution grant and three survey respondents that expected to receive an equitable distribution grant reported believing they could be disadvantaged for the second round without constructive feedback on the first round\u2019s grant decision.\n\u2022   Constructive feedback could help applicants receiving equitable distribution grants decide whether to apply for the second round of TBCP funding. Applying for a federal grant can be complicated and time consuming, particularly for applicants with less experience. One applicant we spoke with that expected to receive an equitable distribution grant said they would want to know if their community\u2019s need is not sufficient before they go to the trouble of applying again.\n\u2022   Constructive feedback could inform Tribes\u2019 approaches toward other funding opportunities, including the Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment Program.15 One applicant we spoke with that received an equitable distribution grant and one respondent that expected to receive an equitable distribution grant said that feedback on their TBCP application would likely be relevant to applications for other broadband programs.\n\u2022  Constructive feedback\u2014particularly information about the process NTIA used to decide which applications passing merit review would receive a full award\u2014could foster confidence in the grant program. One respondent that expected to receive an equitable distribution grant said that a lack of transparency in why some applications are receiving full funding while others are receiving equitable distribution grants could erode confidence in the grant process. In the absence of this information, three applicants we spoke with\u2014one that received an equitable distribution grant and two that expected to receive an equitable distribution grant\u2014shared a variety of explanations for how they thought NTIA made award decisions, such as favoring shovel-ready projects, penalizing applications for having high construction costs, favoring fiber even when fiber would delay provision of service for years, and preferring certain types of applicants over others.\nThe first notice of funding opportunity indicated that unsuccessful applicants would have an opportunity to receive a debriefing after the opportunity officially closed and that unsuccessful applicants must request feedback within 10 business days of notification that their application would not be funded. According to the original notice, NTIA expected to complete its review, select the successful applicants, and process awards by November 29, 2021. However, NTIA began announcing awards on a rolling basis in November 2021, and, as of July 25, 2023, still planned to announce awards in the coming months, according to NTIA officials. As a result, applicants that received notice that their applications were unsuccessful could be awaiting feedback for well over a year after requesting feedback.16\nNTIA officials told us they do not plan to provide constructive feedback to applicants that received equitable distribution grants for three main reasons.\n\u2022  NTIA considers applicants receiving equitable distribution grants to be successful because they were selected for an award. The Commerce Grants Manual and notice of funding opportunity provisions related to providing feedback specify that feedback is for unsuccessful applicants.17 Further, the Commerce Grants Manual does not address situations where grantees do not receive the full amount of funding requested. However, leading practices for managing broadband grant programs indicate agencies should provide feedback for all applicants.18 Commerce attorneys and NTIA officials said that NTIA could choose to provide feedback on any application but the Commerce Grants Manual does not direct them to provide feedback to applicants that did not receive any funding, which does not include equitable distribution grant recipients. However, NTIA officials said that their ability to provide constructive feedback is limited in certain circumstances.19\n\u2022   NTIA officials said that adjustments to the second funding round affect the extent to which first-round feedback would be relevant. For example, the second notice of funding opportunity prioritizes the review of applications for infrastructure deployment from first round recipients of grants for planning, engineering, feasibility, and sustainability projects. NTIA officials said that those equitable distribution grantees with these kinds of projects would accrue similar benefits from completing their projects as they would from receiving feedback from NTIA. In addition, NTIA officials told us that they plan to provide additional technical assistance to applicants during the second round of funding. They further said the technical assistance could be more helpful to applicants than feedback on their first-round applications. NTIA could provide feedback in this way, as long as it is constructive and timely enough to allow applicants to incorporate it into applications for the second round of funding.\n\u2022  According to NTIA officials, the agency faces staffing challenges in providing feedback to applicants and must prioritize program activities. However, providing constructive feedback could help potential second-round applicants decide whether to apply and improve their applications in a way that reduces the time NTIA needs to review applications. It could also reduce the need for NTIA to request additional information to address defects in applications, which we previously identified as a cause of delay in making award decisions.20\nNTIA\u2019s plan to provide technical assistance to applicants, if appropriately timed and tailored to meet applicants\u2019 needs, could represent the kind of constructive feedback applicants receiving equitable distribution grants said they needed. However, without constructive feedback from NTIA\u2014including information on the process NTIA used to decide which applications that passed merit review would receive full funding\u2014applicants receiving equitable distribution grants will not have the information needed to 1) determine whether to apply to the next TBCP funding round, 2) improve their applications in the next funding round if they decide to apply, and 3) determine whether to apply for other funding programs. In addition, applicants may lose confidence in the impartiality of the program\u2019s award process.\nConclusions\nThe Tribal Broadband Connectivity Program provides a historic chance to improve tribal access to broadband and further narrow the digital divide. NTIA has about $1 billion more to distribute in its second round of program funding. In the first round, 56 applicants received equitable distribution grants for a fraction of their original request. NTIA has provided little to no feedback to applicants who received equitable distribution grants. Leading practices indicate that agencies should provide feedback to all applicants. Constructive feedback, possibly in the form of technical assistance for the second round of funding and information about NTIA\u2019s process for deciding which meritorious applications received full funding in the first round, could help these applicants improve their applications and increase confidence in the impartiality of the program\u2019s award process.\nRecommendation for Executive Action\nThe Administrator of NTIA should provide applicants that receive equitable distribution grants in the first round of TBCP with constructive feedback\u2014by providing debriefings or technical assistance\u2014to help these applicants improve their applications for the second round of TBCP funding.

{"content": "U.S. Government Accountability Office DOD Reviews and Responses to GAO Reports: First Semiannual Report Examining Delays GAO-23-106583 Report to Congressional Committees August 14, 2023\nWhy This Matters\n GAO provides audited agencies with an opportunity to comment and review on draft reports before GAO issues the final report.1 For the Department of Defense (DOD), this period is usually 30 days, but it can range from 7 to 30 days.2 Additionally, for any reports that may contain controlled unclassified or classified information, GAO requests that the department complete a review for such information and communicate the results of the review in writing to GAO. Sensitivity reviews are completed to identify sensitive information, such as controlled unclassified information. Reviews for classified information, such as information designated as Secret or Top Secret, are generally referred to as security reviews. Delays in DOD submitting agency comments and sensitivity/security reviews result in GAO issuing products later than mandated or requested by Congress. Given concerns with GAO being able to issue its reports on time to inform Congressional and public debate, the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 included a provision for GAO to report every 6 months over a 2-year period on the extent to which DOD submitted agency comments and sensitivity/security reviews in a timely manner and in accordance with GAO protocols.3 This report is the first in a series of four reports on this topic, covering the period of GAO\u2019s review from December 23, 2022, to May 15, 2023.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022  DOD submitted about half of its agency comments and sensitivity or security reviews to GAO after the deadline. \u2022  DOD took 34 days, on average, to submit agency comments. For half of the reports, DOD took an additional 16 days, on average, to submit agency comments. For one report, DOD took 71 days to provide its comments. \u2022  On average, DOD completed sensitivity reviews in 34 days and security reviews in 31 days. In two cases, DOD took 60 days to complete its reviews. \u2022  In some cases, GAO granted DOD an extension to the deadline for submitting comments or reviews, but DOD did not meet the extension for about half of those reports. For one report, DOD requested multiple extensions but did not meet any of the new deadlines; as a result, GAO took the unusual step of issuing the report without agency comments.\nHow much time did DOD take to provide agency comments on\nBoth the average (34) and median (31) number of days DOD took to provide agency comments exceeded the 30-day deadline. During the period of this review, DOD provided agency comments on 42 reports. GAO reports?\nOf the 42 reports, DOD submitted comments for 21 after the 30-day deadline.4 For those 21 reports, DOD took 16 additional days, on average, to submit agency comments. Across the 21 reports, DOD exceeded the 30-day deadline by as few as 4 days and as much as 71 days. For those reports submitted before the deadline, it took DOD 21 days, on average, to complete agency comments. The average and median number of days DOD took to provide agency comments for on-time and late reports are shown in figure 1.\nFigure 1: Average and Median Number of Calendar Days the Department of Defense (DOD) Took to Provide Agency Comments, December 23, 2022\u2013May 15, 2023\n Note: DOD submitted comments for 21 reports before the 30-day deadline and for 21 reports after the deadline.\nHow much time did DOD take to complete reviews of GAO reports?\nDOD generally completed its reviews beyond the 30-day deadline, taking 34 days, on average, to complete sensitivity reviews and 31 days, on average, to sensitivity and security   complete security reviews. During the period of this review, DOD completed reviews for 23 reports\u201417 requiring a sensitivity review and 6, a security review. For 12 reviews\u201410 sensitivity reviews and 2 security reviews\u2014DOD missed the GAO 30-day deadline. DOD took an additional 12 and 23 days, on average, to complete these sensitivity and security reviews, respectively. For one sensitivity review and one security review, DOD took 60 days to complete the reviews. The average number of days DOD took to complete sensitivity and security reviews for on-time and late reports are shown in figure 2.\nFigure 2: Average Number of Calendar Days the Department of Defense (DOD) Took to Complete Sensitivity/Security Reviews, December 23, 2022\u2013May 15, 2023\n Note: DOD submitted reviews for 11 reports before the 30-day deadline and 12 reports after the deadline. See appendix I for a list of the reports for which DOD missed the 30-day deadline for submitting agency comments and sensitivity or security reviews. The table also shows the number of days DOD took to submit its comments and reviews.\nIf an extension was did DOD submit comments and reviews extension date?\nGAO granted extensions to DOD for agency comments on 17 of 42 reports, but granted, how frequently    DOD did not provide its comments within the extension period for eight reports, as shown in figure 3. For the eight reports whose comments were submitted beyond the new deadline, DOD required 6 additional days, on average, to submit agency comments. For one report, DOD requested three extensions to provide by the agreed-upon its agency comments. However, it did not meet any of these extended deadlines, resulting in GAO having to issue the report without DOD\u2019s comments.\nFigure 3: Number of Reports for Which the Department of Defense (DOD) Was Granted an Extension to Provide Agency Comments, December 23, 2022\u2013May 15, 2023\n GAO granted an extension to DOD for a sensitivity review of five reports and a security review of two reports. DOD completed reviews for three reports (two sensitivity and one security) within the extension period (see fig. 4). For the four reports that DOD submitted to GAO after the new extended deadline, DOD required 7 additional days, on average, to complete its sensitivity reviews, and 17 additional days, on average, to complete its security reviews.\nFigure 4: Number of Reports for Which the Department of Defense (DOD) Was Granted an Extension to Complete Sensitivity/Security Reviews, December 23, 2022\u2013May 15, 2023\n See appendix II for a list of the reports for which GAO granted DOD an extension for agency comments and sensitivity or security reviews. The table also shows the number of additional days DOD took to submit its comments and reviews.\nAgency Comments\nWe provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment. DOD provided written comments, which are reprinted in appendix III. Although we did not make recommendations to DOD in this report, DOD stated in its written comments that it had reviewed and concurs with our conclusions. DOD also stated that it has taken measures to address the identified timeliness deficiencies. Specifically, the department\u2019s audit management team changed to a portfolio-based audit management system and is promoting new processes, such as using a workflow tracker. In addition, DOD stated that working group meetings are held to share best practices for leadership in addressing GAO audits, to include coordination between DOD and GAO to address issues, working on agency comment responses at the exit conference instead of waiting until the draft report is issued, and establishing Standard Operating Procedures and other training materials to ensure all relevant DOD staff are properly trained.\nDOD\u2019s written comments also asserted that aspects of GAO\u2019s processes are contributing factors to delays in DOD\u2019s completion of both agency comments and sensitivity or security reviews. Specifically, DOD stated that to improve the timeliness of DOD\u2019s draft report responses, GAO should increase the timeframe given to DOD for these responses, stating that the 30-day timeframe is not realistic for an agency with the size and complexity of DOD. We disagree. As stated in this report, under our agency protocols, we generally give agencies between 7 and 30 calendar days to comment on a draft product. Of note, these protocols are grounded not only in GAO policy, but also in statute, and are echoed in DOD policy.5 In practice, we almost always give DOD the maximum amount (i.e., 30 days), recognizing that DOD is a very large and complex federal agency. We also note that, in addition to the 30-day agency comment period, we hold an exit conference with each audited agency, including DOD, to confirm that the critical facts and key information used to formulate GAO\u2019s analyses and findings are current, correct, and complete. At this time, we generally provide a Statement of Facts that contains the findings of our draft reports. The exit conference is held several weeks to months before the draft is provided to DOD for agency comment, which provides considerable time before the official agency comment period for the department to begin consideration of the draft report\u2019s findings. Given all of these factors, we do not believe that routinely providing DOD more than 30 days to comment on our draft products is warranted. DOD also stated in its comments that GAO\u2019s processes for handling classified and non-public information in our reports continue to be a large contributing cause of the department\u2019s tardiness in sensitivity and security reviews. Specifically, DOD stated that GAO draft reports are provided for review without any portion markings to identify classified national security information in accordance with requirements for derivative classification, referencing Executive Branch and DOD guidance. DOD further stated that it takes its obligation to protect the Nation\u2019s national security information very seriously and is not at liberty to streamline sensitivity and security review processes and that the protection of national security information is of paramount importance. GAO does not have derivative classification authority. As GAO\u2019s agency protocols state and as is reflected in DOD guidance, GAO does not determine the classification or sensitivity level of its products. We instead request that the relevant agency perform a security review. GAO very much agrees that it is of paramount importance to protect national security information. That is one reason that we rely on security officials within DOD who have the expertise, training, source documentation, and established guidance\u2014particularly the relevant security classification guides\u2014to appropriately conduct sensitivity and security reviews.6 Moreover, we do not encourage DOD to streamline the sensitivity and security review process in any way that would undermine its integrity. To the contrary, we expect the information security professionals and subject matter experts within DOD to independently determine the appropriate classification and marking for specific information, rather than rely upon GAO\u2019s tentative expectations as to classification based upon the information that GAO receives both orally during interviews and from written materials we receive. Instead, for nearly 5 years, we have, as a standard practice, included with every draft classified product sent to DOD a list of classified documents obtained and used in drafting the product. We have included this fact on the cover of our draft products, along with an offer to assist the department officials by providing further details on the specific information extracted from the classified sources. We also offer to meet with DOD officials to walk through the materials, documents, and other information used in our report. In some cases, department officials have accepted this assistance; in others, they have not. These offers of assistance have the goal of helping DOD meet its responsibilities to respond to and review\nGAO reports in a timely manner and, more importantly, to protect our national security. DOD asserts in its comments that ongoing discussions between DOD and GAO over the last decade has not led to any meaningful changes to date in this area. Contrary to this statement, changes have occurred over the last decade, including changes to DOD guidance that reflect the roles of the PAO, CAO, and DOPSR in conducting the security review. Additionally, there have been changes in our standard practices, including sending the list of classified source materials obtained and offering to provide further assistance. We encourage DOD to take GAO up on its offers of assistance more often, which we believe would result in even more meaningful communication and could further help to improve timeliness while reflecting both DOD\u2019s and GAO\u2019s commitment to protecting our national security. While GAO hopes that DOD will commit further to engage GAO on these offers of assistance, GAO will continue to assess additional ways it can assist DOD in timely completion of security reviews.\nHow GAO Did This Study\nGAO identified the reports for which GAO requested agency comments and sensitivity or security reviews from DOD and received DOD\u2019s responses from December 23, 2022, to May 15, 2023.\nGAO used a data collection instrument to gather specific dates for each step in each report\u2019s agency comment and sensitivity/security review process. GAO analyzed these data to determine the average and median number of days between the date GAO provided the report to DOD for comment and the date GAO received comments from DOD. Similarly, GAO assessed the average number of days that DOD took to complete sensitivity or security reviews.\nFor those reports for which GAO granted an extension to DOD for comments or reviews, GAO also analyzed the data collected through the data collection instrument to determine the time frame of the extension and the number of days that DOD took to submit the comments or reviews. To ensure data reliability, GAO compared its data to similar data collected by DOD.\nGAO conducted this performance audit from December 2022 to August 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that GAO plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. GAO believes that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for its findings and conclusions based on its audit objectives.\nList of Addressees\nThe Honorable Jack Reed Chairman The Honorable Roger Wicker Ranking Member Committee on Armed Services United States Senate\nThe Honorable John Tester Chair The Honorable Susan Collins Ranking Member Subcommittee on Defense Committee on Appropriations United States Senate\nThe Honorable Mike Rogers Chairman The Honorable Adam Smith Ranking Member Committee on Armed Services House of Representatives\nThe Honorable Ken Calvert Chair The Honorable Betty McCollum Ranking Member Subcommittee on Defense Committee on Appropriations House of Representatives\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees and the Secretary of Defense.

That report was out of our scope for this engagement. 5Section 718(b)(1) of title 31, U.S. Code, states that the Comptroller General may submit a part of a draft report to an agency for comment for more than 30 days only if the Comptroller General decides, after a showing by the agency, that a longer period is necessary and likely to result in a more accurate report. Department of Defense Instruction 7650.02, Engaging with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) on GAO Audits, which was updated as recently as January 26, 2022, states that it is DOD policy to provide timely responses to GAO reports, in accordance with this statute. 6This expectation is consistent with the roles of the DOD-identified Primary Action Officer, Collateral Action Officers, and the Defense Office of Prepublication and Security Review (DOPSR), as outlined in Department of Defense Instruction 7650.02. See, e.g., DOD Instruction 7650.02, para. 5.5.g (requiring, among other things, that DOD reviewers \u201c[i]dentify specific classified information, or unclassified information that must be withheld from release to the public\u201d and \u201c[i]dentify the level of classification and reasons for withholding the classified or unclassified information\u201d).", "answer": [4, 0, 2, 3, 1], "summaries": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) submitted comments for 21 out of 42 reports after the 30-day deadline, taking an average of 16 additional days to provide agency comments.

That report was out of our scope for this engagement. 5Section 718(b)(1) of title 31, U.S. Code, states that the Comptroller General may submit a part of a draft report to an agency for comment for more than 30 days only if the Comptroller General decides, after a showing by the agency, that a longer period is necessary and likely to result in a more accurate report. Department of Defense Instruction 7650.02, Engaging with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) on GAO Audits, which was updated as recently as January 26, 2022, states that it is DOD policy to provide timely responses to GAO reports, in accordance with this statute. 6This expectation is consistent with the roles of the DOD-identified Primary Action Officer, Collateral Action Officers, and the Defense Office of Prepublication and Security Review (DOPSR), as outlined in Department of Defense Instruction 7650.02. See, e.g., DOD Instruction 7650.02, para. 5.5.g (requiring, among other things, that DOD reviewers \u201c[i]dentify specific classified information, or unclassified information that must be withheld from release to the public\u201d and \u201c[i]dentify the level of classification and reasons for withholding the classified or unclassified information\u201d).", "answer": [3, 0, 2, 1, 4], "summaries": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) missed the 30-day deadline for submitting agency comments and reviews for 12 reports.

{"content": "U.S. Government Accountability Office DOD Reviews and Responses to GAO Reports: First Semiannual Report Examining Delays GAO-23-106583 Report to Congressional Committees August 14, 2023\nWhy This Matters\n GAO provides audited agencies with an opportunity to comment and review on draft reports before GAO issues the final report.1 For the Department of Defense (DOD), this period is usually 30 days, but it can range from 7 to 30 days.2 Additionally, for any reports that may contain controlled unclassified or classified information, GAO requests that the department complete a review for such information and communicate the results of the review in writing to GAO. Sensitivity reviews are completed to identify sensitive information, such as controlled unclassified information. Reviews for classified information, such as information designated as Secret or Top Secret, are generally referred to as security reviews. Delays in DOD submitting agency comments and sensitivity/security reviews result in GAO issuing products later than mandated or requested by Congress. Given concerns with GAO being able to issue its reports on time to inform Congressional and public debate, the James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 included a provision for GAO to report every 6 months over a 2-year period on the extent to which DOD submitted agency comments and sensitivity/security reviews in a timely manner and in accordance with GAO protocols.3 This report is the first in a series of four reports on this topic, covering the period of GAO\u2019s review from December 23, 2022, to May 15, 2023.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022  DOD submitted about half of its agency comments and sensitivity or security reviews to GAO after the deadline. \u2022  DOD took 34 days, on average, to submit agency comments. For half of the reports, DOD took an additional 16 days, on average, to submit agency comments. For one report, DOD took 71 days to provide its comments. \u2022  On average, DOD completed sensitivity reviews in 34 days and security reviews in 31 days. In two cases, DOD took 60 days to complete its reviews. \u2022  In some cases, GAO granted DOD an extension to the deadline for submitting comments or reviews, but DOD did not meet the extension for about half of those reports. For one report, DOD requested multiple extensions but did not meet any of the new deadlines; as a result, GAO took the unusual step of issuing the report without agency comments.\nHow much time did DOD take to provide agency comments on\nBoth the average (34) and median (31) number of days DOD took to provide agency comments exceeded the 30-day deadline. During the period of this review, DOD provided agency comments on 42 reports. GAO reports?\nOf the 42 reports, DOD submitted comments for 21 after the 30-day deadline.4 For those 21 reports, DOD took 16 additional days, on average, to submit agency comments. Across the 21 reports, DOD exceeded the 30-day deadline by as few as 4 days and as much as 71 days. For those reports submitted before the deadline, it took DOD 21 days, on average, to complete agency comments. The average and median number of days DOD took to provide agency comments for on-time and late reports are shown in figure 1.\nFigure 1: Average and Median Number of Calendar Days the Department of Defense (DOD) Took to Provide Agency Comments, December 23, 2022\u2013May 15, 2023\n Note: DOD submitted comments for 21 reports before the 30-day deadline and for 21 reports after the deadline.\nHow much time did DOD take to complete reviews of GAO reports?\nDOD generally completed its reviews beyond the 30-day deadline, taking 34 days, on average, to complete sensitivity reviews and 31 days, on average, to sensitivity and security   complete security reviews. During the period of this review, DOD completed reviews for 23 reports\u201417 requiring a sensitivity review and 6, a security review. For 12 reviews\u201410 sensitivity reviews and 2 security reviews\u2014DOD missed the GAO 30-day deadline. DOD took an additional 12 and 23 days, on average, to complete these sensitivity and security reviews, respectively. For one sensitivity review and one security review, DOD took 60 days to complete the reviews. The average number of days DOD took to complete sensitivity and security reviews for on-time and late reports are shown in figure 2.\nFigure 2: Average Number of Calendar Days the Department of Defense (DOD) Took to Complete Sensitivity/Security Reviews, December 23, 2022\u2013May 15, 2023\n Note: DOD submitted reviews for 11 reports before the 30-day deadline and 12 reports after the deadline. See appendix I for a list of the reports for which DOD missed the 30-day deadline for submitting agency comments and sensitivity or security reviews. The table also shows the number of days DOD took to submit its comments and reviews.\nIf an extension was did DOD submit comments and reviews extension date?\nGAO granted extensions to DOD for agency comments on 17 of 42 reports, but granted, how frequently    DOD did not provide its comments within the extension period for eight reports, as shown in figure 3. For the eight reports whose comments were submitted beyond the new deadline, DOD required 6 additional days, on average, to submit agency comments. For one report, DOD requested three extensions to provide by the agreed-upon its agency comments. However, it did not meet any of these extended deadlines, resulting in GAO having to issue the report without DOD\u2019s comments.\nFigure 3: Number of Reports for Which the Department of Defense (DOD) Was Granted an Extension to Provide Agency Comments, December 23, 2022\u2013May 15, 2023\n GAO granted an extension to DOD for a sensitivity review of five reports and a security review of two reports. DOD completed reviews for three reports (two sensitivity and one security) within the extension period (see fig. 4). For the four reports that DOD submitted to GAO after the new extended deadline, DOD required 7 additional days, on average, to complete its sensitivity reviews, and 17 additional days, on average, to complete its security reviews.\nFigure 4: Number of Reports for Which the Department of Defense (DOD) Was Granted an Extension to Complete Sensitivity/Security Reviews, December 23, 2022\u2013May 15, 2023\n See appendix II for a list of the reports for which GAO granted DOD an extension for agency comments and sensitivity or security reviews. The table also shows the number of additional days DOD took to submit its comments and reviews.\nAgency Comments\nWe provided a draft of this report to DOD for review and comment. DOD provided written comments, which are reprinted in appendix III. Although we did not make recommendations to DOD in this report, DOD stated in its written comments that it had reviewed and concurs with our conclusions. DOD also stated that it has taken measures to address the identified timeliness deficiencies. Specifically, the department\u2019s audit management team changed to a portfolio-based audit management system and is promoting new processes, such as using a workflow tracker. In addition, DOD stated that working group meetings are held to share best practices for leadership in addressing GAO audits, to include coordination between DOD and GAO to address issues, working on agency comment responses at the exit conference instead of waiting until the draft report is issued, and establishing Standard Operating Procedures and other training materials to ensure all relevant DOD staff are properly trained.\nDOD\u2019s written comments also asserted that aspects of GAO\u2019s processes are contributing factors to delays in DOD\u2019s completion of both agency comments and sensitivity or security reviews. Specifically, DOD stated that to improve the timeliness of DOD\u2019s draft report responses, GAO should increase the timeframe given to DOD for these responses, stating that the 30-day timeframe is not realistic for an agency with the size and complexity of DOD. We disagree. As stated in this report, under our agency protocols, we generally give agencies between 7 and 30 calendar days to comment on a draft product. Of note, these protocols are grounded not only in GAO policy, but also in statute, and are echoed in DOD policy.5 In practice, we almost always give DOD the maximum amount (i.e., 30 days), recognizing that DOD is a very large and complex federal agency. We also note that, in addition to the 30-day agency comment period, we hold an exit conference with each audited agency, including DOD, to confirm that the critical facts and key information used to formulate GAO\u2019s analyses and findings are current, correct, and complete. At this time, we generally provide a Statement of Facts that contains the findings of our draft reports. The exit conference is held several weeks to months before the draft is provided to DOD for agency comment, which provides considerable time before the official agency comment period for the department to begin consideration of the draft report\u2019s findings. Given all of these factors, we do not believe that routinely providing DOD more than 30 days to comment on our draft products is warranted. DOD also stated in its comments that GAO\u2019s processes for handling classified and non-public information in our reports continue to be a large contributing cause of the department\u2019s tardiness in sensitivity and security reviews. Specifically, DOD stated that GAO draft reports are provided for review without any portion markings to identify classified national security information in accordance with requirements for derivative classification, referencing Executive Branch and DOD guidance. DOD further stated that it takes its obligation to protect the Nation\u2019s national security information very seriously and is not at liberty to streamline sensitivity and security review processes and that the protection of national security information is of paramount importance. GAO does not have derivative classification authority. As GAO\u2019s agency protocols state and as is reflected in DOD guidance, GAO does not determine the classification or sensitivity level of its products. We instead request that the relevant agency perform a security review. GAO very much agrees that it is of paramount importance to protect national security information. That is one reason that we rely on security officials within DOD who have the expertise, training, source documentation, and established guidance\u2014particularly the relevant security classification guides\u2014to appropriately conduct sensitivity and security reviews.6 Moreover, we do not encourage DOD to streamline the sensitivity and security review process in any way that would undermine its integrity. To the contrary, we expect the information security professionals and subject matter experts within DOD to independently determine the appropriate classification and marking for specific information, rather than rely upon GAO\u2019s tentative expectations as to classification based upon the information that GAO receives both orally during interviews and from written materials we receive. Instead, for nearly 5 years, we have, as a standard practice, included with every draft classified product sent to DOD a list of classified documents obtained and used in drafting the product. We have included this fact on the cover of our draft products, along with an offer to assist the department officials by providing further details on the specific information extracted from the classified sources. We also offer to meet with DOD officials to walk through the materials, documents, and other information used in our report. In some cases, department officials have accepted this assistance; in others, they have not. These offers of assistance have the goal of helping DOD meet its responsibilities to respond to and review\nGAO reports in a timely manner and, more importantly, to protect our national security. DOD asserts in its comments that ongoing discussions between DOD and GAO over the last decade has not led to any meaningful changes to date in this area. Contrary to this statement, changes have occurred over the last decade, including changes to DOD guidance that reflect the roles of the PAO, CAO, and DOPSR in conducting the security review. Additionally, there have been changes in our standard practices, including sending the list of classified source materials obtained and offering to provide further assistance. We encourage DOD to take GAO up on its offers of assistance more often, which we believe would result in even more meaningful communication and could further help to improve timeliness while reflecting both DOD\u2019s and GAO\u2019s commitment to protecting our national security. While GAO hopes that DOD will commit further to engage GAO on these offers of assistance, GAO will continue to assess additional ways it can assist DOD in timely completion of security reviews.\nHow GAO Did This Study\nGAO identified the reports for which GAO requested agency comments and sensitivity or security reviews from DOD and received DOD\u2019s responses from December 23, 2022, to May 15, 2023.\nGAO used a data collection instrument to gather specific dates for each step in each report\u2019s agency comment and sensitivity/security review process. GAO analyzed these data to determine the average and median number of days between the date GAO provided the report to DOD for comment and the date GAO received comments from DOD. Similarly, GAO assessed the average number of days that DOD took to complete sensitivity or security reviews.\nFor those reports for which GAO granted an extension to DOD for comments or reviews, GAO also analyzed the data collected through the data collection instrument to determine the time frame of the extension and the number of days that DOD took to submit the comments or reviews. To ensure data reliability, GAO compared its data to similar data collected by DOD.\nGAO conducted this performance audit from December 2022 to August 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that GAO plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. GAO believes that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for its findings and conclusions based on its audit objectives.\nList of Addressees\nThe Honorable Jack Reed Chairman The Honorable Roger Wicker Ranking Member Committee on Armed Services United States Senate\nThe Honorable John Tester Chair The Honorable Susan Collins Ranking Member Subcommittee on Defense Committee on Appropriations United States Senate\nThe Honorable Mike Rogers Chairman The Honorable Adam Smith Ranking Member Committee on Armed Services House of Representatives\nThe Honorable Ken Calvert Chair The Honorable Betty McCollum Ranking Member Subcommittee on Defense Committee on Appropriations House of Representatives\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees and the Secretary of Defense.

{"content": "United States Government Accountability Office\n Testimony\nBefore  the Subcommittee on Oversight\nand  Investigations, Committee on\n Financial Services, House of Representatives\nFor Release on Delivery Expected at 10:00 a.m. ET Thursday, May 11, 2023 BANK REGULATION Preliminary Review of Agency Actions Related to March 2023 Bank Failures\nStatement of Michael E. Clements, Director, Financial Markets and Community Investment\nGAO-23-106834\nLetter\nLetter\n Chairman Huizenga, Ranking Member Green, and Members of the Subcommittee\nI am pleased to be here today to discuss preliminary findings from our April 2023 report on the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank in March 2023.1 More specifically, my statement provides observations on factors that may have caused the banks to fail and supervisory actions regulators took leading up to the failures.\nAt the time of closure, SVB was the 16th largest U.S. bank and Signature Bank the 29th largest. As of March 28, 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) estimated the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund of resolving SVB to be $20 billion and Signature Bank, $2.5 billion.2 Subsequent to our April 2023 report, on May 1, 2023 First Republic Bank, the 14th largest U.S. bank, failed with an estimated cost of $13 billion to the Deposit Insurance Fund.\nThis statement is based on our April 2023 report. For the topics discussed today, we analyzed regulatory financial data from 2018\u20132022 on the two banks and assessed their condition relative to a peer group of banks. We also reviewed Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRBSF) and FDIC examination records (including schedules, memorandums, and reports) and bank management responses to supervisory concerns for the banks (including supervisory letters and documentation of informal enforcement actions) from January 2018 through March 2023. We focused our review on supervisory activities related to the banks\u2019 liquidity and risk management. We also interviewed staff from FDIC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), and FRBSF. More detailed information on our scope and methodology can be found in our April 2023 report. Our work was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. \nRisky Business Weak Liquidity and Risk Management Contributed to the Recent Bank Failures\nSVB and Signature Bank experienced rapid growth and relied on less stable funding\u2014indicators of risky business strategies. Strategies along with \u2022   From December 2018 to December 2022, SVB\u2019s total assets more than tripled from $56 billion to $209 billion, and Signature Bank\u2019s more than doubled from $47 billion to $110 billion. From 2019 through 2021, the total assets of SVB and Signature Bank grew by 198 percent and 134 percent, respectively\u2014far exceeding growth for a group of 19 peer banks (33 percent growth in median total assets). \u2022   To support their rapid growth, the two banks relied on uninsured deposits, which can be an unstable source of funding because customers with uninsured deposits may be more likely to withdraw their funds during times of stress. At the end of 2021, SVB\u2019s share of uninsured deposits to total assets was 80 percent and Signature\u2019s was 82 percent\u2014approximately two times higher than for a group of peer banks.3 The two banks\u2019 reliance on uninsured deposits may indicate a long-standing concentration of risk. Additionally, SVB and Signature Bank exhibited weak liquidity and risk management.\n\u2022   SVB had exposure to interest rate risk through its investment in longer-term securities to generate yield against its deposits. According to FRBSF staff and examination documents, the bank did not effectively manage the interest rate risk of the securities or develop appropriate risk-management tools for this risk. Federal Reserve and FRBSF staff noted that SVB failed due to ineffective management of its deposits and assets. \u2022   Signature Bank had exposure to deposits from the digital assets industry. According to FDIC officials and examination documents, poor governance and risk-management practices prevented the bank from adequately managing its liquidity risk. FDIC officials noted that poor governance and unsatisfactory risk-management practices were the root cause of Signature Bank\u2019s failure.\nRegulators Did Not Escalate Supervisory Actions in Time to Mitigate Key Risks\nIn the years prior to 2023, FRBSF and FDIC identified liquidity and management risks at SVB and Signature Bank\u2014key drivers of the banks\u2019 failures. However, neither regulator\u2019s actions resulted in management sufficiently mitigating those risks. GAO\u2019s prior work identified the importance of regulators taking timely and effective actions to address underlying problems.\nAssociated with the Bank Failures\nFederal Reserve Identified Risks and Took Supervisory Actions, but Did Not Adequately Escalate Actions Prior to\nFRBSF was generally positive in its ratings of SVB from December 2018 to June 2022, rating SVB\u2019s overall condition as \u201csatisfactory.\u201d During that same period, FRBSF assigned SVB the highest available CAMELS rating for liquidity-management practices and the second-highest available rating for management practices.4 As noted earlier, deficient liquidity and management practices were factors contributing to the bank\u2019s failure. SVB\u2019s Failure Despite the overall satisfactory ratings, FRBSF noted several concerns, which were relevant to the bank\u2019s March 2023 failure. For example, in 2018 FRBSF found that despite liquidity levels appearing strong, funding sources were concentrated and might become volatile with little notice. In 2020, examiners found that stress test modeling showed the bank had ample liquidity over stressed periods but the stress tests did not provide insight into liquidity risks for stressed periods of 30 days or less. In 2018, 2019, and 2020, FRBSF also issued (or had outstanding) matters requiring attention related to risk management and liquidity.\nFRBSF staff generally accepted SVB\u2019s planned actions to correct deficiencies. Our review of examination staff\u2019s acknowledgement of SVB management responses found the staff generally agreed that SVB\u2019s planned actions were reasonably designed to remediate the underlying supervisory issues.\nSubsequent to SVB\u2019s shift into a different examination category, examiners identified additional liquidity and management deficiencies. Increases in asset levels at SVB Financial Group, the holding company for SVB, moved the entity from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Regional Banking Organization category into the Large and Foreign Banking Organization category in June 2021.5 SVB Financial Group became subject to examination under the Large Financial Institution rating system. According to Federal Reserve staff, SVB then had a larger dedicated examination team (with a specific team member covering liquidity) and was subject to more rigorous supervisory requirements.\nMore specifically, in an August 2021 review, FRBSF raised serious concerns around how the institution was managing liquidity risk. It found that liquidity risk-management practices were below supervisory expectations. It issued two matters requiring immediate attention (which reflect serious supervisory concerns) and four matters requiring attention on these issues. FRBSF described the review in its scoping memorandum as a baseline and further noted that it conducted limited supervisory work on liquidity and stress testing over the past two supervisory cycles.6\nA May 2022 target review of SVB Financial Group and SVB\u2014conducted under the Large Financial Institution rating system\u2014found that the bank\u2019s governance and risk-management practices also were below supervisory expectations. In response to these issues, FRBSF issued three matters requiring immediate attention related to risk management.\nOn June 30, 2022, FRBSF downgraded SVB\u2019s ratings. Specifically, FRBSF downgraded the bank\u2019s CAMELS composite rating from a 2 to a 3, its management component rating from a 2 to a 3, and its liquidity  component rating from a 1 to a 2. Examiners found that the bank\u2019s management and board performance needed improvement and were less than satisfactory. For example, the board did not provide effective oversight of implementation of the risk-management framework and did not hold management accountable for the root causes contributing to weaknesses in liquidity risk management and other risks.\nOn August 17, 2022, FRBSF issued a supervisory letter to SVB Financial Group and SVB on its first Large Financial Institution rating. FRBSF rated SVB Financial Group \u201cDeficient-1\u201d for governance and controls, stating its risk-management program was not effective, did not incorporate coverage for all risk categories, and did not address foundational, enterprise-level risk-management matters. FRBSF rated SVB Financial Group\u2019s liquidity as \u201cConditionally Meets Expectations.\u201d It stated that while actual and post-stress liquidity positions reflected a sufficient buffer, the firm lacked several foundational elements for liquidity risk management.\nIn the same supervisory letter, FRBSF stated its intent to initiate an informal, nonpublic enforcement action, in the form of a memorandum of understanding, with SVB Financial Group and SVB. The memorandum\u2019s provisions were focused on correcting the management and liquidity risk issues mentioned above and on holding the bank\u2019s board and executive management accountable for addressing the root causes of the deficiencies.\nFRBSF staff told us that staff started working on the memorandum of understanding after communicating the July 2022 downgrade. In addition, Federal Reserve Bank staff started working with the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Supervision and Regulation and Legal divisions in late August 2022 to develop the memorandum. According to Federal Reserve staff, Federal Reserve Board and FRBSF staff collaborated on provisions of the memorandum, including those related to liquidity and risk management, which required senior-level review. They kept the memorandum open to allow for the completion of additional examination work by FRBSF. However, the Federal Reserve did not finalize the memorandum before SVB failed in March 2023.\nAlthough Federal Reserve staff stated that the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory actions compelled SVB to take steps including replacing the Board Chair, Chief Risk Officer, and Treasurer and revising its incentive compensation program to incorporate risk management as a formal assessment criteria, its supervisory actions were inadequate given the bank\u2019s known liquidity and management deficiencies. Furthermore,\nFRBSF\u2019s actions lacked urgency. For example, FRBSF did not recommend the issuance of a single enforcement action despite the bank\u2019s serious liquidity and management issues before the bank\u2019s failure.\nFDIC Identified Risks and Took Supervisory Actions, but Did Not Adequately Escalate Actions Prior to\nFDIC\u2019s ratings of Signature Bank found that the bank\u2019s overall condition was \u201csatisfactory\u201d from December 2018 to December 2021. In addition, FDIC assigned the second-highest available CAMELS rating for the bank\u2019s management practices. As noted earlier, weak management practices contributed to the bank\u2019s failure. Signature Bank\u2019s Failure Despite FDIC\u2019s overall \u201csatisfactory\u201d assessment during 2018\u20132021, FDIC took numerous supervisory actions to mitigate liquidity and management deficiencies at the bank, including downgrading Signature Bank\u2019s liquidity component from 2 to 3 during the 2019 examination cycle, meaning the bank\u2019s liquidity management practices needed improvement.\nIn its examination documents, FDIC explained that Signature Bank\u2019s practices did not correspond with the bank\u2019s complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations due to weaknesses in areas including liquidity contingency planning and internal controls. These weaknesses prevented the bank from appropriately understanding the potential effects of adverse liquidity events and emergency cash flow needs.\nFDIC also issued matters requiring board attention and supervisory recommendations related to management, liquidity, and corporate governance risks in each year before the bank\u2019s failure. For example, FDIC issued two matters requiring board attention in 2018 and one matter requiring board attention in 2019 related to bank management\u2019s handling of increasing liquidity and management risks. The matters focused on issues including the bank\u2019s adherence to its risk appetite statement and liquidity contingency planning. Many matters and recommendations carried over to later years because they were unresolved. For instance, a 2019 matter on liquidity contingency planning remained outstanding through March 2023.\nFDIC had not completed 2022 examination documents for Signature Bank at the time of its failure. FDIC staff told us they were considering escalating supervisory actions in 2022\u2014including taking enforcement actions and downgrading CAMELS composite or component ratings\u2014 based on the findings of the completed 2022 corporate governance target review and the in-process target reviews for liquidity and other topics.\nThese escalatory actions would have taken place in the second quarter of 2023, after FDIC staff finalized documentation such as the 2022 report of examination and supervisory letters. According to preliminary findings we reviewed from FDIC\u2019s 2022 liquidity target examination, FDIC planned to reiterate its 2019 matter requiring board attention on liquidity contingency planning. It also had drafted a new matter requiring board attention on the bank\u2019s audit program for liquidity and funds management, as well as several supervisory recommendations.\nFDIC stated that because Signature Bank did not mitigate its liquidity and management-related issues in a timely manner, it issued an interim CAMELS rating downgrade on March 11, 2023, the day before Signature Bank was closed. In the downgrade letter, FDIC stated that management failed to demonstrate the capability to properly identify, measure, monitor, and control the bank\u2019s liquidity position. Furthermore, funds management practices were critically deficient for the complexity of the bank\u2019s liquidity risk profile, and the continued viability of the institution was threatened. The lack of urgency, formality, and preparedness around liquidity contingency funding plans reflected poorly on management and was another factor for these downgrades. In the letter, FDIC also notified Signature Bank of its intent to pursue a formal enforcement action against the bank for failure to mitigate concerns outlined in the downgrade letter, but the bank failed the next day.\nSignature Bank\u2019s management failed to take adequate steps to mitigate the bank\u2019s long-standing liquidity and management issues before the bank\u2019s failure. For example, FDIC staff told us that Signature Bank management could sometimes be unresponsive and difficult to work with. They added that Signature Bank management would report to FDIC that it mitigated an issue, only for FDIC staff to find the issue unresolved during transaction testing. This behavior caused FDIC to issue repeat supervisory recommendations to Signature Bank.\nAlthough FDIC took some actions to escalate its supervisory actions in 2019 and 2020, its actions were inadequate given the bank\u2019s longstanding liquidity and management deficiencies. Furthermore, FDIC lacked urgency despite Signature Bank\u2019s repeated failures to remediate liquidity and management issues. FDIC did not pursue more forceful supervisory actions in a timely manner that might have helped the bank correct its liquidity and management issues before its failure in March 2023. For example, FDIC only issued an enforcement action and further downgraded the bank\u2019s composite or component CAMELS ratings the day before Signature Bank\u2019s failure in 2023. Taking more decisive actions in the years prior to Signature Bank\u2019s failure could have helped compel bank management to mitigate the liquidity and management weaknesses that contributed to the bank\u2019s failure.\nGAO\u2019s Past Work Warned about the Risks of Untimely Escalation by Regulators and the Need for Early Triggers\nWe previously noted in a 2015 report that although regulators often identified risky practices well before failures, the regulatory process was not always effective or timely in correcting underlying problems before banks failed.7 Furthermore, GAO has longstanding concerns about escalation of supervisory concerns. In 1991, we found that bank regulators did not always use the most forceful actions available to correct unsafe and unsound banking practices.8 In 2011, we recommended that regulators consider adding noncapital triggers to their framework for prompt corrective action (to help give more advanced warning of deteriorating conditions).9 The regulators considered noncapital triggers, but have not added them to the framework\u2014thus missing a potential opportunity to take early action to address deteriorating conditions at banks.\nChairman Huizenga, Ranking Member Green, and Members of the Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.

Clements, Director, Financial Markets and Community Investment\nGAO-23-106834\nLetter\nLetter\n Chairman Huizenga, Ranking Member Green, and Members of the Subcommittee\nI am pleased to be here today to discuss preliminary findings from our April 2023 report on the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank in March 2023.1 More specifically, my statement provides observations on factors that may have caused the banks to fail and supervisory actions regulators took leading up to the failures.\nAt the time of closure, SVB was the 16th largest U.S. bank and Signature Bank the 29th largest. As of March 28, 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) estimated the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund of resolving SVB to be $20 billion and Signature Bank, $2.5 billion.2 Subsequent to our April 2023 report, on May 1, 2023 First Republic Bank, the 14th largest U.S. bank, failed with an estimated cost of $13 billion to the Deposit Insurance Fund.\nThis statement is based on our April 2023 report. For the topics discussed today, we analyzed regulatory financial data from 2018\u20132022 on the two banks and assessed their condition relative to a peer group of banks. We also reviewed Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRBSF) and FDIC examination records (including schedules, memorandums, and reports) and bank management responses to supervisory concerns for the banks (including supervisory letters and documentation of informal enforcement actions) from January 2018 through March 2023. We focused our review on supervisory activities related to the banks\u2019 liquidity and risk management. We also interviewed staff from FDIC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), and FRBSF. More detailed information on our scope and methodology can be found in our April 2023 report. Our work was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. \nRisky Business Weak Liquidity and Risk Management Contributed to the Recent Bank Failures\nSVB and Signature Bank experienced rapid growth and relied on less stable funding\u2014indicators of risky business strategies. Strategies along with \u2022   From December 2018 to December 2022, SVB\u2019s total assets more than tripled from $56 billion to $209 billion, and Signature Bank\u2019s more than doubled from $47 billion to $110 billion. From 2019 through 2021, the total assets of SVB and Signature Bank grew by 198 percent and 134 percent, respectively\u2014far exceeding growth for a group of 19 peer banks (33 percent growth in median total assets). \u2022   To support their rapid growth, the two banks relied on uninsured deposits, which can be an unstable source of funding because customers with uninsured deposits may be more likely to withdraw their funds during times of stress. At the end of 2021, SVB\u2019s share of uninsured deposits to total assets was 80 percent and Signature\u2019s was 82 percent\u2014approximately two times higher than for a group of peer banks.3 The two banks\u2019 reliance on uninsured deposits may indicate a long-standing concentration of risk. Additionally, SVB and Signature Bank exhibited weak liquidity and risk management.\n\u2022   SVB had exposure to interest rate risk through its investment in longer-term securities to generate yield against its deposits. According to FRBSF staff and examination documents, the bank did not effectively manage the interest rate risk of the securities or develop appropriate risk-management tools for this risk. Federal Reserve and FRBSF staff noted that SVB failed due to ineffective management of its deposits and assets. \u2022   Signature Bank had exposure to deposits from the digital assets industry. According to FDIC officials and examination documents, poor governance and risk-management practices prevented the bank from adequately managing its liquidity risk. FDIC officials noted that poor governance and unsatisfactory risk-management practices were the root cause of Signature Bank\u2019s failure.\nRegulators Did Not Escalate Supervisory Actions in Time to Mitigate Key Risks\nIn the years prior to 2023, FRBSF and FDIC identified liquidity and management risks at SVB and Signature Bank\u2014key drivers of the banks\u2019 failures. However, neither regulator\u2019s actions resulted in management sufficiently mitigating those risks. GAO\u2019s prior work identified the importance of regulators taking timely and effective actions to address underlying problems.\nAssociated with the Bank Failures\nFederal Reserve Identified Risks and Took Supervisory Actions, but Did Not Adequately Escalate Actions Prior to\nFRBSF was generally positive in its ratings of SVB from December 2018 to June 2022, rating SVB\u2019s overall condition as \u201csatisfactory.\u201d During that same period, FRBSF assigned SVB the highest available CAMELS rating for liquidity-management practices and the second-highest available rating for management practices.4 As noted earlier, deficient liquidity and management practices were factors contributing to the bank\u2019s failure. SVB\u2019s Failure Despite the overall satisfactory ratings, FRBSF noted several concerns, which were relevant to the bank\u2019s March 2023 failure. For example, in 2018 FRBSF found that despite liquidity levels appearing strong, funding sources were concentrated and might become volatile with little notice. In 2020, examiners found that stress test modeling showed the bank had ample liquidity over stressed periods but the stress tests did not provide insight into liquidity risks for stressed periods of 30 days or less. In 2018, 2019, and 2020, FRBSF also issued (or had outstanding) matters requiring attention related to risk management and liquidity.\nFRBSF staff generally accepted SVB\u2019s planned actions to correct deficiencies. Our review of examination staff\u2019s acknowledgement of SVB management responses found the staff generally agreed that SVB\u2019s planned actions were reasonably designed to remediate the underlying supervisory issues.\nSubsequent to SVB\u2019s shift into a different examination category, examiners identified additional liquidity and management deficiencies. Increases in asset levels at SVB Financial Group, the holding company for SVB, moved the entity from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Regional Banking Organization category into the Large and Foreign Banking Organization category in June 2021.5 SVB Financial Group became subject to examination under the Large Financial Institution rating system. According to Federal Reserve staff, SVB then had a larger dedicated examination team (with a specific team member covering liquidity) and was subject to more rigorous supervisory requirements.\nMore specifically, in an August 2021 review, FRBSF raised serious concerns around how the institution was managing liquidity risk. It found that liquidity risk-management practices were below supervisory expectations. It issued two matters requiring immediate attention (which reflect serious supervisory concerns) and four matters requiring attention on these issues. FRBSF described the review in its scoping memorandum as a baseline and further noted that it conducted limited supervisory work on liquidity and stress testing over the past two supervisory cycles.6\nA May 2022 target review of SVB Financial Group and SVB\u2014conducted under the Large Financial Institution rating system\u2014found that the bank\u2019s governance and risk-management practices also were below supervisory expectations. In response to these issues, FRBSF issued three matters requiring immediate attention related to risk management.\nOn June 30, 2022, FRBSF downgraded SVB\u2019s ratings. Specifically, FRBSF downgraded the bank\u2019s CAMELS composite rating from a 2 to a 3, its management component rating from a 2 to a 3, and its liquidity  component rating from a 1 to a 2. Examiners found that the bank\u2019s management and board performance needed improvement and were less than satisfactory. For example, the board did not provide effective oversight of implementation of the risk-management framework and did not hold management accountable for the root causes contributing to weaknesses in liquidity risk management and other risks.\nOn August 17, 2022, FRBSF issued a supervisory letter to SVB Financial Group and SVB on its first Large Financial Institution rating. FRBSF rated SVB Financial Group \u201cDeficient-1\u201d for governance and controls, stating its risk-management program was not effective, did not incorporate coverage for all risk categories, and did not address foundational, enterprise-level risk-management matters. FRBSF rated SVB Financial Group\u2019s liquidity as \u201cConditionally Meets Expectations.\u201d It stated that while actual and post-stress liquidity positions reflected a sufficient buffer, the firm lacked several foundational elements for liquidity risk management.\nIn the same supervisory letter, FRBSF stated its intent to initiate an informal, nonpublic enforcement action, in the form of a memorandum of understanding, with SVB Financial Group and SVB. The memorandum\u2019s provisions were focused on correcting the management and liquidity risk issues mentioned above and on holding the bank\u2019s board and executive management accountable for addressing the root causes of the deficiencies.\nFRBSF staff told us that staff started working on the memorandum of understanding after communicating the July 2022 downgrade. In addition, Federal Reserve Bank staff started working with the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Supervision and Regulation and Legal divisions in late August 2022 to develop the memorandum. According to Federal Reserve staff, Federal Reserve Board and FRBSF staff collaborated on provisions of the memorandum, including those related to liquidity and risk management, which required senior-level review. They kept the memorandum open to allow for the completion of additional examination work by FRBSF. However, the Federal Reserve did not finalize the memorandum before SVB failed in March 2023.\nAlthough Federal Reserve staff stated that the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory actions compelled SVB to take steps including replacing the Board Chair, Chief Risk Officer, and Treasurer and revising its incentive compensation program to incorporate risk management as a formal assessment criteria, its supervisory actions were inadequate given the bank\u2019s known liquidity and management deficiencies. Furthermore,\nFRBSF\u2019s actions lacked urgency. For example, FRBSF did not recommend the issuance of a single enforcement action despite the bank\u2019s serious liquidity and management issues before the bank\u2019s failure.\nFDIC Identified Risks and Took Supervisory Actions, but Did Not Adequately Escalate Actions Prior to\nFDIC\u2019s ratings of Signature Bank found that the bank\u2019s overall condition was \u201csatisfactory\u201d from December 2018 to December 2021. In addition, FDIC assigned the second-highest available CAMELS rating for the bank\u2019s management practices. As noted earlier, weak management practices contributed to the bank\u2019s failure. Signature Bank\u2019s Failure Despite FDIC\u2019s overall \u201csatisfactory\u201d assessment during 2018\u20132021, FDIC took numerous supervisory actions to mitigate liquidity and management deficiencies at the bank, including downgrading Signature Bank\u2019s liquidity component from 2 to 3 during the 2019 examination cycle, meaning the bank\u2019s liquidity management practices needed improvement.\nIn its examination documents, FDIC explained that Signature Bank\u2019s practices did not correspond with the bank\u2019s complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations due to weaknesses in areas including liquidity contingency planning and internal controls. These weaknesses prevented the bank from appropriately understanding the potential effects of adverse liquidity events and emergency cash flow needs.\nFDIC also issued matters requiring board attention and supervisory recommendations related to management, liquidity, and corporate governance risks in each year before the bank\u2019s failure. For example, FDIC issued two matters requiring board attention in 2018 and one matter requiring board attention in 2019 related to bank management\u2019s handling of increasing liquidity and management risks. The matters focused on issues including the bank\u2019s adherence to its risk appetite statement and liquidity contingency planning. Many matters and recommendations carried over to later years because they were unresolved. For instance, a 2019 matter on liquidity contingency planning remained outstanding through March 2023.\nFDIC had not completed 2022 examination documents for Signature Bank at the time of its failure. FDIC staff told us they were considering escalating supervisory actions in 2022\u2014including taking enforcement actions and downgrading CAMELS composite or component ratings\u2014 based on the findings of the completed 2022 corporate governance target review and the in-process target reviews for liquidity and other topics.\nThese escalatory actions would have taken place in the second quarter of 2023, after FDIC staff finalized documentation such as the 2022 report of examination and supervisory letters. According to preliminary findings we reviewed from FDIC\u2019s 2022 liquidity target examination, FDIC planned to reiterate its 2019 matter requiring board attention on liquidity contingency planning. It also had drafted a new matter requiring board attention on the bank\u2019s audit program for liquidity and funds management, as well as several supervisory recommendations.\nFDIC stated that because Signature Bank did not mitigate its liquidity and management-related issues in a timely manner, it issued an interim CAMELS rating downgrade on March 11, 2023, the day before Signature Bank was closed. In the downgrade letter, FDIC stated that management failed to demonstrate the capability to properly identify, measure, monitor, and control the bank\u2019s liquidity position. Furthermore, funds management practices were critically deficient for the complexity of the bank\u2019s liquidity risk profile, and the continued viability of the institution was threatened. The lack of urgency, formality, and preparedness around liquidity contingency funding plans reflected poorly on management and was another factor for these downgrades. In the letter, FDIC also notified Signature Bank of its intent to pursue a formal enforcement action against the bank for failure to mitigate concerns outlined in the downgrade letter, but the bank failed the next day.\nSignature Bank\u2019s management failed to take adequate steps to mitigate the bank\u2019s long-standing liquidity and management issues before the bank\u2019s failure. For example, FDIC staff told us that Signature Bank management could sometimes be unresponsive and difficult to work with. They added that Signature Bank management would report to FDIC that it mitigated an issue, only for FDIC staff to find the issue unresolved during transaction testing. This behavior caused FDIC to issue repeat supervisory recommendations to Signature Bank.\nAlthough FDIC took some actions to escalate its supervisory actions in 2019 and 2020, its actions were inadequate given the bank\u2019s longstanding liquidity and management deficiencies.

Clements, Director, Financial Markets and Community Investment\nGAO-23-106834\nLetter\nLetter\n Chairman Huizenga, Ranking Member Green, and Members of the Subcommittee\nI am pleased to be here today to discuss preliminary findings from our April 2023 report on the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank in March 2023.1 More specifically, my statement provides observations on factors that may have caused the banks to fail and supervisory actions regulators took leading up to the failures.\nAt the time of closure, SVB was the 16th largest U.S. bank and Signature Bank the 29th largest. As of March 28, 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) estimated the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund of resolving SVB to be $20 billion and Signature Bank, $2.5 billion.2 Subsequent to our April 2023 report, on May 1, 2023 First Republic Bank, the 14th largest U.S. bank, failed with an estimated cost of $13 billion to the Deposit Insurance Fund.\nThis statement is based on our April 2023 report. For the topics discussed today, we analyzed regulatory financial data from 2018\u20132022 on the two banks and assessed their condition relative to a peer group of banks. We also reviewed Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRBSF) and FDIC examination records (including schedules, memorandums, and reports) and bank management responses to supervisory concerns for the banks (including supervisory letters and documentation of informal enforcement actions) from January 2018 through March 2023. We focused our review on supervisory activities related to the banks\u2019 liquidity and risk management. We also interviewed staff from FDIC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), and FRBSF. More detailed information on our scope and methodology can be found in our April 2023 report. Our work was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. \nRisky Business Weak Liquidity and Risk Management Contributed to the Recent Bank Failures\nSVB and Signature Bank experienced rapid growth and relied on less stable funding\u2014indicators of risky business strategies. Strategies along with \u2022   From December 2018 to December 2022, SVB\u2019s total assets more than tripled from $56 billion to $209 billion, and Signature Bank\u2019s more than doubled from $47 billion to $110 billion. From 2019 through 2021, the total assets of SVB and Signature Bank grew by 198 percent and 134 percent, respectively\u2014far exceeding growth for a group of 19 peer banks (33 percent growth in median total assets). \u2022   To support their rapid growth, the two banks relied on uninsured deposits, which can be an unstable source of funding because customers with uninsured deposits may be more likely to withdraw their funds during times of stress. At the end of 2021, SVB\u2019s share of uninsured deposits to total assets was 80 percent and Signature\u2019s was 82 percent\u2014approximately two times higher than for a group of peer banks.3 The two banks\u2019 reliance on uninsured deposits may indicate a long-standing concentration of risk. Additionally, SVB and Signature Bank exhibited weak liquidity and risk management.\n\u2022   SVB had exposure to interest rate risk through its investment in longer-term securities to generate yield against its deposits. According to FRBSF staff and examination documents, the bank did not effectively manage the interest rate risk of the securities or develop appropriate risk-management tools for this risk. Federal Reserve and FRBSF staff noted that SVB failed due to ineffective management of its deposits and assets. \u2022   Signature Bank had exposure to deposits from the digital assets industry. According to FDIC officials and examination documents, poor governance and risk-management practices prevented the bank from adequately managing its liquidity risk. FDIC officials noted that poor governance and unsatisfactory risk-management practices were the root cause of Signature Bank\u2019s failure.\nRegulators Did Not Escalate Supervisory Actions in Time to Mitigate Key Risks\nIn the years prior to 2023, FRBSF and FDIC identified liquidity and management risks at SVB and Signature Bank\u2014key drivers of the banks\u2019 failures. However, neither regulator\u2019s actions resulted in management sufficiently mitigating those risks. GAO\u2019s prior work identified the importance of regulators taking timely and effective actions to address underlying problems.\nAssociated with the Bank Failures\nFederal Reserve Identified Risks and Took Supervisory Actions, but Did Not Adequately Escalate Actions Prior to\nFRBSF was generally positive in its ratings of SVB from December 2018 to June 2022, rating SVB\u2019s overall condition as \u201csatisfactory.\u201d During that same period, FRBSF assigned SVB the highest available CAMELS rating for liquidity-management practices and the second-highest available rating for management practices.4 As noted earlier, deficient liquidity and management practices were factors contributing to the bank\u2019s failure. SVB\u2019s Failure Despite the overall satisfactory ratings, FRBSF noted several concerns, which were relevant to the bank\u2019s March 2023 failure. For example, in 2018 FRBSF found that despite liquidity levels appearing strong, funding sources were concentrated and might become volatile with little notice. In 2020, examiners found that stress test modeling showed the bank had ample liquidity over stressed periods but the stress tests did not provide insight into liquidity risks for stressed periods of 30 days or less. In 2018, 2019, and 2020, FRBSF also issued (or had outstanding) matters requiring attention related to risk management and liquidity.\nFRBSF staff generally accepted SVB\u2019s planned actions to correct deficiencies. Our review of examination staff\u2019s acknowledgement of SVB management responses found the staff generally agreed that SVB\u2019s planned actions were reasonably designed to remediate the underlying supervisory issues.\nSubsequent to SVB\u2019s shift into a different examination category, examiners identified additional liquidity and management deficiencies. Increases in asset levels at SVB Financial Group, the holding company for SVB, moved the entity from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Regional Banking Organization category into the Large and Foreign Banking Organization category in June 2021.5 SVB Financial Group became subject to examination under the Large Financial Institution rating system. According to Federal Reserve staff, SVB then had a larger dedicated examination team (with a specific team member covering liquidity) and was subject to more rigorous supervisory requirements.\nMore specifically, in an August 2021 review, FRBSF raised serious concerns around how the institution was managing liquidity risk. It found that liquidity risk-management practices were below supervisory expectations. It issued two matters requiring immediate attention (which reflect serious supervisory concerns) and four matters requiring attention on these issues. FRBSF described the review in its scoping memorandum as a baseline and further noted that it conducted limited supervisory work on liquidity and stress testing over the past two supervisory cycles.6\nA May 2022 target review of SVB Financial Group and SVB\u2014conducted under the Large Financial Institution rating system\u2014found that the bank\u2019s governance and risk-management practices also were below supervisory expectations. In response to these issues, FRBSF issued three matters requiring immediate attention related to risk management.\nOn June 30, 2022, FRBSF downgraded SVB\u2019s ratings. Specifically, FRBSF downgraded the bank\u2019s CAMELS composite rating from a 2 to a 3, its management component rating from a 2 to a 3, and its liquidity  component rating from a 1 to a 2. Examiners found that the bank\u2019s management and board performance needed improvement and were less than satisfactory. For example, the board did not provide effective oversight of implementation of the risk-management framework and did not hold management accountable for the root causes contributing to weaknesses in liquidity risk management and other risks.\nOn August 17, 2022, FRBSF issued a supervisory letter to SVB Financial Group and SVB on its first Large Financial Institution rating. FRBSF rated SVB Financial Group \u201cDeficient-1\u201d for governance and controls, stating its risk-management program was not effective, did not incorporate coverage for all risk categories, and did not address foundational, enterprise-level risk-management matters. FRBSF rated SVB Financial Group\u2019s liquidity as \u201cConditionally Meets Expectations.\u201d It stated that while actual and post-stress liquidity positions reflected a sufficient buffer, the firm lacked several foundational elements for liquidity risk management.\nIn the same supervisory letter, FRBSF stated its intent to initiate an informal, nonpublic enforcement action, in the form of a memorandum of understanding, with SVB Financial Group and SVB. The memorandum\u2019s provisions were focused on correcting the management and liquidity risk issues mentioned above and on holding the bank\u2019s board and executive management accountable for addressing the root causes of the deficiencies.\nFRBSF staff told us that staff started working on the memorandum of understanding after communicating the July 2022 downgrade. In addition, Federal Reserve Bank staff started working with the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Supervision and Regulation and Legal divisions in late August 2022 to develop the memorandum. According to Federal Reserve staff, Federal Reserve Board and FRBSF staff collaborated on provisions of the memorandum, including those related to liquidity and risk management, which required senior-level review. They kept the memorandum open to allow for the completion of additional examination work by FRBSF. However, the Federal Reserve did not finalize the memorandum before SVB failed in March 2023.\nAlthough Federal Reserve staff stated that the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory actions compelled SVB to take steps including replacing the Board Chair, Chief Risk Officer, and Treasurer and revising its incentive compensation program to incorporate risk management as a formal assessment criteria, its supervisory actions were inadequate given the bank\u2019s known liquidity and management deficiencies. Furthermore,\nFRBSF\u2019s actions lacked urgency. For example, FRBSF did not recommend the issuance of a single enforcement action despite the bank\u2019s serious liquidity and management issues before the bank\u2019s failure.\nFDIC Identified Risks and Took Supervisory Actions, but Did Not Adequately Escalate Actions Prior to\nFDIC\u2019s ratings of Signature Bank found that the bank\u2019s overall condition was \u201csatisfactory\u201d from December 2018 to December 2021. In addition, FDIC assigned the second-highest available CAMELS rating for the bank\u2019s management practices. As noted earlier, weak management practices contributed to the bank\u2019s failure. Signature Bank\u2019s Failure Despite FDIC\u2019s overall \u201csatisfactory\u201d assessment during 2018\u20132021, FDIC took numerous supervisory actions to mitigate liquidity and management deficiencies at the bank, including downgrading Signature Bank\u2019s liquidity component from 2 to 3 during the 2019 examination cycle, meaning the bank\u2019s liquidity management practices needed improvement.\nIn its examination documents, FDIC explained that Signature Bank\u2019s practices did not correspond with the bank\u2019s complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations due to weaknesses in areas including liquidity contingency planning and internal controls. These weaknesses prevented the bank from appropriately understanding the potential effects of adverse liquidity events and emergency cash flow needs.\nFDIC also issued matters requiring board attention and supervisory recommendations related to management, liquidity, and corporate governance risks in each year before the bank\u2019s failure. For example, FDIC issued two matters requiring board attention in 2018 and one matter requiring board attention in 2019 related to bank management\u2019s handling of increasing liquidity and management risks. The matters focused on issues including the bank\u2019s adherence to its risk appetite statement and liquidity contingency planning. Many matters and recommendations carried over to later years because they were unresolved. For instance, a 2019 matter on liquidity contingency planning remained outstanding through March 2023.\nFDIC had not completed 2022 examination documents for Signature Bank at the time of its failure. FDIC staff told us they were considering escalating supervisory actions in 2022\u2014including taking enforcement actions and downgrading CAMELS composite or component ratings\u2014 based on the findings of the completed 2022 corporate governance target review and the in-process target reviews for liquidity and other topics.\nThese escalatory actions would have taken place in the second quarter of 2023, after FDIC staff finalized documentation such as the 2022 report of examination and supervisory letters. According to preliminary findings we reviewed from FDIC\u2019s 2022 liquidity target examination, FDIC planned to reiterate its 2019 matter requiring board attention on liquidity contingency planning. It also had drafted a new matter requiring board attention on the bank\u2019s audit program for liquidity and funds management, as well as several supervisory recommendations.\nFDIC stated that because Signature Bank did not mitigate its liquidity and management-related issues in a timely manner, it issued an interim CAMELS rating downgrade on March 11, 2023, the day before Signature Bank was closed. In the downgrade letter, FDIC stated that management failed to demonstrate the capability to properly identify, measure, monitor, and control the bank\u2019s liquidity position. Furthermore, funds management practices were critically deficient for the complexity of the bank\u2019s liquidity risk profile, and the continued viability of the institution was threatened. The lack of urgency, formality, and preparedness around liquidity contingency funding plans reflected poorly on management and was another factor for these downgrades. In the letter, FDIC also notified Signature Bank of its intent to pursue a formal enforcement action against the bank for failure to mitigate concerns outlined in the downgrade letter, but the bank failed the next day.\nSignature Bank\u2019s management failed to take adequate steps to mitigate the bank\u2019s long-standing liquidity and management issues before the bank\u2019s failure. For example, FDIC staff told us that Signature Bank management could sometimes be unresponsive and difficult to work with. They added that Signature Bank management would report to FDIC that it mitigated an issue, only for FDIC staff to find the issue unresolved during transaction testing. This behavior caused FDIC to issue repeat supervisory recommendations to Signature Bank.\nAlthough FDIC took some actions to escalate its supervisory actions in 2019 and 2020, its actions were inadequate given the bank\u2019s longstanding liquidity and management deficiencies. Furthermore, FDIC lacked urgency despite Signature Bank\u2019s repeated failures to remediate liquidity and management issues. FDIC did not pursue more forceful supervisory actions in a timely manner that might have helped the bank correct its liquidity and management issues before its failure in March 2023. For example, FDIC only issued an enforcement action and further downgraded the bank\u2019s composite or component CAMELS ratings the day before Signature Bank\u2019s failure in 2023. Taking more decisive actions in the years prior to Signature Bank\u2019s failure could have helped compel bank management to mitigate the liquidity and management weaknesses that contributed to the bank\u2019s failure.\nGAO\u2019s Past Work Warned about the Risks of Untimely Escalation by Regulators and the Need for Early Triggers\nWe previously noted in a 2015 report that although regulators often identified risky practices well before failures, the regulatory process was not always effective or timely in correcting underlying problems before banks failed.7 Furthermore, GAO has longstanding concerns about escalation of supervisory concerns. In 1991, we found that bank regulators did not always use the most forceful actions available to correct unsafe and unsound banking practices.8 In 2011, we recommended that regulators consider adding noncapital triggers to their framework for prompt corrective action (to help give more advanced warning of deteriorating conditions).9 The regulators considered noncapital triggers, but have not added them to the framework\u2014thus missing a potential opportunity to take early action to address deteriorating conditions at banks.\nChairman Huizenga, Ranking Member Green, and Members of the Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.

Clements, Director, Financial Markets and Community Investment\nGAO-23-106834\nLetter\nLetter\n Chairman Huizenga, Ranking Member Green, and Members of the Subcommittee\nI am pleased to be here today to discuss preliminary findings from our April 2023 report on the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank in March 2023.1 More specifically, my statement provides observations on factors that may have caused the banks to fail and supervisory actions regulators took leading up to the failures.\nAt the time of closure, SVB was the 16th largest U.S. bank and Signature Bank the 29th largest. As of March 28, 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) estimated the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund of resolving SVB to be $20 billion and Signature Bank, $2.5 billion.2 Subsequent to our April 2023 report, on May 1, 2023 First Republic Bank, the 14th largest U.S. bank, failed with an estimated cost of $13 billion to the Deposit Insurance Fund.\nThis statement is based on our April 2023 report. For the topics discussed today, we analyzed regulatory financial data from 2018\u20132022 on the two banks and assessed their condition relative to a peer group of banks. We also reviewed Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRBSF) and FDIC examination records (including schedules, memorandums, and reports) and bank management responses to supervisory concerns for the banks (including supervisory letters and documentation of informal enforcement actions) from January 2018 through March 2023. We focused our review on supervisory activities related to the banks\u2019 liquidity and risk management. We also interviewed staff from FDIC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), and FRBSF. More detailed information on our scope and methodology can be found in our April 2023 report. Our work was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. \nRisky Business Weak Liquidity and Risk Management Contributed to the Recent Bank Failures\nSVB and Signature Bank experienced rapid growth and relied on less stable funding\u2014indicators of risky business strategies. Strategies along with \u2022   From December 2018 to December 2022, SVB\u2019s total assets more than tripled from $56 billion to $209 billion, and Signature Bank\u2019s more than doubled from $47 billion to $110 billion. From 2019 through 2021, the total assets of SVB and Signature Bank grew by 198 percent and 134 percent, respectively\u2014far exceeding growth for a group of 19 peer banks (33 percent growth in median total assets). \u2022   To support their rapid growth, the two banks relied on uninsured deposits, which can be an unstable source of funding because customers with uninsured deposits may be more likely to withdraw their funds during times of stress. At the end of 2021, SVB\u2019s share of uninsured deposits to total assets was 80 percent and Signature\u2019s was 82 percent\u2014approximately two times higher than for a group of peer banks.3 The two banks\u2019 reliance on uninsured deposits may indicate a long-standing concentration of risk. Additionally, SVB and Signature Bank exhibited weak liquidity and risk management.\n\u2022   SVB had exposure to interest rate risk through its investment in longer-term securities to generate yield against its deposits. According to FRBSF staff and examination documents, the bank did not effectively manage the interest rate risk of the securities or develop appropriate risk-management tools for this risk. Federal Reserve and FRBSF staff noted that SVB failed due to ineffective management of its deposits and assets. \u2022   Signature Bank had exposure to deposits from the digital assets industry. According to FDIC officials and examination documents, poor governance and risk-management practices prevented the bank from adequately managing its liquidity risk. FDIC officials noted that poor governance and unsatisfactory risk-management practices were the root cause of Signature Bank\u2019s failure.\nRegulators Did Not Escalate Supervisory Actions in Time to Mitigate Key Risks\nIn the years prior to 2023, FRBSF and FDIC identified liquidity and management risks at SVB and Signature Bank\u2014key drivers of the banks\u2019 failures. However, neither regulator\u2019s actions resulted in management sufficiently mitigating those risks. GAO\u2019s prior work identified the importance of regulators taking timely and effective actions to address underlying problems.\nAssociated with the Bank Failures\nFederal Reserve Identified Risks and Took Supervisory Actions, but Did Not Adequately Escalate Actions Prior to\nFRBSF was generally positive in its ratings of SVB from December 2018 to June 2022, rating SVB\u2019s overall condition as \u201csatisfactory.\u201d During that same period, FRBSF assigned SVB the highest available CAMELS rating for liquidity-management practices and the second-highest available rating for management practices.4 As noted earlier, deficient liquidity and management practices were factors contributing to the bank\u2019s failure. SVB\u2019s Failure Despite the overall satisfactory ratings, FRBSF noted several concerns, which were relevant to the bank\u2019s March 2023 failure. For example, in 2018 FRBSF found that despite liquidity levels appearing strong, funding sources were concentrated and might become volatile with little notice. In 2020, examiners found that stress test modeling showed the bank had ample liquidity over stressed periods but the stress tests did not provide insight into liquidity risks for stressed periods of 30 days or less. In 2018, 2019, and 2020, FRBSF also issued (or had outstanding) matters requiring attention related to risk management and liquidity.\nFRBSF staff generally accepted SVB\u2019s planned actions to correct deficiencies. Our review of examination staff\u2019s acknowledgement of SVB management responses found the staff generally agreed that SVB\u2019s planned actions were reasonably designed to remediate the underlying supervisory issues.\nSubsequent to SVB\u2019s shift into a different examination category, examiners identified additional liquidity and management deficiencies. Increases in asset levels at SVB Financial Group, the holding company for SVB, moved the entity from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Regional Banking Organization category into the Large and Foreign Banking Organization category in June 2021.5 SVB Financial Group became subject to examination under the Large Financial Institution rating system.

FRBSF described the review in its scoping memorandum as a baseline and further noted that it conducted limited supervisory work on liquidity and stress testing over the past two supervisory cycles.6\nA May 2022 target review of SVB Financial Group and SVB\u2014conducted under the Large Financial Institution rating system\u2014found that the bank\u2019s governance and risk-management practices also were below supervisory expectations. In response to these issues, FRBSF issued three matters requiring immediate attention related to risk management.\nOn June 30, 2022, FRBSF downgraded SVB\u2019s ratings.

FRBSF rated SVB Financial Group \u201cDeficient-1\u201d for governance and controls, stating its risk-management program was not effective, did not incorporate coverage for all risk categories, and did not address foundational, enterprise-level risk-management matters. FRBSF rated SVB Financial Group\u2019s liquidity as \u201cConditionally Meets Expectations.\u201d It stated that while actual and post-stress liquidity positions reflected a sufficient buffer, the firm lacked several foundational elements for liquidity risk management.\nIn the same supervisory letter, FRBSF stated its intent to initiate an informal, nonpublic enforcement action, in the form of a memorandum of understanding, with SVB Financial Group and SVB.

For example, the total acres burned across the United States has doubled over the past 20 years, breaking records in many states.1 Moreover, wildfires destroyed more than 12,000 homes, businesses, and other structures annually, on average, between 2017 and 2021\u2014more than three times as many, on average, as in the preceding 5-year period, according to information from the National Interagency Fire Center. These increases are straining the federal wildland firefighting workforce.\nIn November 2022, we reported that the federal wildland firefighting workforce was composed of approximately 18,700 firefighters (including fire management and support staff) from the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Forest Service and from four agencies in the Department of the Interior.2 The Interior agencies are the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and National Park Service.\nCongress, the agencies, and others have expressed concern about the capacity of the federal wildland fire workforce and the conditions facing federal firefighters. Enacted in November 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act included a number of provisions related to the federal wildland firefighter workforce.3 Forest Service and Interior officials have also testified about their agencies\u2019 struggles in hiring and retaining wildland firefighters.\nMy statement today will discuss commonly cited barriers to recruiting and retaining federal wildland firefighters, and is based on our November \n2022 report.4 For that report, we identified and described barriers by reviewing laws, regulations, and program guidance and other agency documents. We also interviewed senior officials from the Forest Service and Interior, including both wildland fire and human capital managers, and from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). To gain a broader perspective on barriers, we interviewed a nongeneralizable sample of 16 nonfederal stakeholders, such as nongovernmental organizations involved in firefighting issues. The report provides a more detailed description of our methodology. Our work was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.\nBarriers to Recruiting and Retaining Federal Wildland\nIn our November 2022 report, we identified seven commonly cited barriers to the recruitment and retention of federal wildland firefighters: (1) low pay, (2) career advancement challenges, (3) poor work-life balance, (4) mental health challenges, (5) remote or expensive duty stations, (6) limited workforce diversity, and (7) hiring process challenges (see fig. 1). Firefighters Include Low Pay, Career Advancement Challenges, and Poor\nWork-Life Balance\nFigure 1: Commonly Cited Barriers to Recruitment and Retention of Federal Wildland Firefighters\n Our 2022 report describes the seven barriers in detail, including actions that the agencies had taken to help address the barriers and suggestions from agency officials and selected stakeholders about additional actions that could be taken. All seven barriers are important and need to be addressed if the Forest Service and Interior agencies are to make  continued progress in their efforts to improve firefighter recruitment and retention. This statement highlights findings related to three of those barriers; please see our 2022 report for findings related to the other barriers.5\nLow pay. Forest Service and Interior officials and all 16 stakeholders we interviewed for our 2022 report said that the pay for federal wildland firefighters is low. Officials and eight stakeholders also noted that the pay does not reflect the risk or physical demands of the work. We reported that the Forest Service and Interior agencies in August 2021 implemented an administration initiative to increase the minimum hourly wage for federal wildland firefighters from $13 to $15 per hour.6 We also reported that in June 2022, the agencies worked with OPM to address a provision of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act directing the agencies to increase firefighter salaries by the lesser of $20,000 or 50 percent of base salary in locations where it is difficult to recruit or retain wildland firefighters.7\nHowever, Forest Service and Interior officials and four stakeholders we interviewed said that while steps to increase federal wildland firefighter pay were positive, they believed that pay still did not reflect the demands of the job and was not competitive with nonfederal entities. Officials and two stakeholders also pointed out that authorization for the funding that the agencies had received from Congress ends after fiscal year 2026 and that longer-term solutions are needed. Officials said that they were looking at a long-term pay solution, such as establishing a higher pay rate nationwide for wildland firefighters.\nCareer advancement challenges. The agencies worked with OPM to develop a new occupational series for federal wildland firefighters aimed at better reflecting the duties related to fighting fires and providing a clearer path for firefighters to advance their careers.8 OPM announced the new occupational series in June 2022 and directed the Forest Service and Interior to implement it within 12 months. The new occupational series covers positions for which many of the primary duties involve the prevention, control, suppression, or management of wildland fires. According to an interagency document and agency officials, creation of the new occupational series will provide a clear career path, with defined requirements for career advancement.9\nImplementation of the new occupational series is ongoing. The Forest Service and Interior agencies have the delegated authority to determine the work and grades supportable for their positions, including the firefighter positions under the new occupational series.10 As of August 2022, Forest Service and Interior officials said that they were developing the grade levels for the new occupational series, which is expected to take effect in 2023.\nWe also reported that the Forest Service and Interior agencies had converted some temporary firefighter positions to permanent positions, which may help address some retention challenges, according to officials.\nInterior began converting seasonal positions to permanent in 2021 to facilitate the agency\u2019s efforts to respond to wildfires year-round, according to Interior\u2019s Wildfire Risk Five-Year Monitoring, Maintenance, and Treatment Plan.11 In addition, the Forest Service and Interior are taking steps to convert additional positions, as directed by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.12\nPoor work-life balance. Poor work-life balance was another commonly cited barrier to wildland firefighter recruitment and retention. Forest Service and Interior officials said that longer and more intense fire seasons have increased the number of times that firefighters are deployed during a year, which can make it difficult for firefighters to spend time with family or attend to personal matters.13 Officials and four stakeholders we interviewed for our 2022 report said that the frequent deployments cause some firefighters to leave the workforce or take a break in service for family or personal reasons (e.g., to start a family or care for young children) but that the structure of the retirement system may affect their willingness to return later to firefighting.14\nTwo stakeholders said that federal agencies would be better positioned to recruit former firefighters back to service if firefighters were eligible to  return to the special retirement system after a break in service. However, officials noted that eligibility for the special retirement system is governed by statute, so any change to eligibility requirements would need to be made by Congress.\nIn conclusion, the Forest Service and Interior agencies face a number of barriers to recruiting and retaining federal wildland firefighters, including those discussed here and the others identified in our November 2022 report. As we reported, the agencies have been taking a number of actions\u2014including some with direction and specific funding from Congress\u2014intended to help address these barriers. Implementation of the actions is ongoing, and it is too early to determine the outcomes of these efforts.\nChairman Manchin, Ranking Member Barrasso, and Members of the Committee, this completes my prepared statement.

Specifically, HHS has consistently fallen preparedness for, and response to, short in five areas of an effective national response (see figure). emergencies. For over a decade, GAO has identified deficiencies at HHS that have hindered the nation\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to a variety of past emergencies, including other infectious diseases. This includes the H1N1 influenza pandemic, Zika, and Ebola\u2014 and extreme weather events, such as hurricanes. This statement summarizes key findings from GAO\u2019s January 2022 addition of HHS\u2019s leadership and coordination of public health emergencies to its High-Risk List and related 2023 High-Risk report. What GAO Recommends Through GAO\u2019s body of work in this area, GAO has made 155 recommendations to HHS to improve its leadership and coordination of public health emergency preparedness and response efforts. As of April 2023,\nWe conducted our work in accordance with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance Framework that are relevant to our objectives. The framework requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to meet our stated objectives and to discuss any limitations in our work. We believe that the information and data obtained, and the analysis conducted, provide a reasonable basis for any findings and conclusions in this product.\nBackground\nHHS is responsible for leading and coordinating all matters related to federal public health and medical preparedness for, and response to, emergencies, whether naturally occurring or intentional.3 Preparing for and responding to nationally significant public health emergencies requires a whole-of-nation, multidisciplinary approach involving multiple federal agencies and coordination with nonfederal entities, including state, tribal, and territorial governments, and the private sector.\nWithin HHS, a variety of agencies are involved, including the following:\n\u2022   The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) is to serve as the principal advisor to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on all matters related to federal public health and medical preparedness and response to public health emergencies.4\n\u2022   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) supports public health preparedness efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to new and emerging disease threats. For example, during infectious disease outbreaks, CDC conducts studies to learn about the link between infection and health outcomes, monitors and reports cases of infection, and provides guidance to travelers and health care providers, among other activities. Additionally, CDC typically develops a diagnostic test for an emerging pathogen when no diagnostic test has been approved, cleared, or authorized by the Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) and no adequate alternative is available, such as for H1N1 and Zika. \u2022   FDA plays a critical role in protecting the U.S. from biological threats, including intentional acts and naturally occurring infectious diseases. For example, FDA is responsible for ensuring that medical countermeasures\u2014including drugs, vaccines, diagnostic tests, and personal protective equipment\u2014against these threats are safe and effective.5 FDA may also issue emergency use authorizations to allow the temporary use of unapproved medical products to diagnose, prevent, or treat disease.6\nHHS\u2019s Leadership and Coordination of Public Health\nHHS must improve its leadership and coordination of public health emergencies to save lives, mitigate severe economic impacts, and prepare the nation to respond to multiple simultaneous threats. The Comptroller General of the U.S. has emphasized the importance of sustained attention to this area by the executive branch and Congress. Emergencies Over more than a decade, we have seen, and continue to see, HHS\u2019s efforts fall short in five key areas of an effective national response\u2014 shown in figure 1.\nFigure 1: Five Key Areas of an Effective National Response\n We have evaluated HHS\u2019s actions in these five key areas and made several recommendations to strengthen these efforts. For example:\nClear roles and responsibilities. The unprecedented scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the whole-of-nation response required to address it, highlight the critical importance of clearly defining the roles and responsibilities for the wide range of federal departments and other key partners involved when preparing for pandemics and addressing unforeseen emergencies. For example, we reported that when HHS helped repatriate U.S. citizens from abroad and quarantine them domestically at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent the spread of the virus, significant confusion ensued.7 As a result, HHS put repatriates, its own personnel, and nearby communities at risk due to a lack of clarity as to which HHS agency was in charge, including which HHS agency was responsible for managing infection prevention.\nIn April 2021, we recommended that HHS agencies\u2014ASPR, CDC, and the Administration for Children and Families\u2014revise or develop new plans that clarify agency roles and responsibilities during a pandemic, and regularly exercise these plans with key partners. Regularly exercising preparedness plans with all response partners allows all involved parties to practice operationalizing the plans to help identify any gaps in procedures or barriers to plan implementation so that these can be addressed before an actual event occurs. HHS agreed with our recommendations, which have not been implemented as of April 2023.\nComplete and consistent data. Data are also critical to inform the response to a public health emergency. However, the data HHS has relied on during the COVID-19 pandemic have been, and remain, incomplete and inconsistent, highlighting longstanding concerns in this area. Moreover, we reported in 2010, 2017, and again in 2022 that, although required by statute since 2006, HHS had made little progress in implementing a nationwide public health situational awareness capability through an interoperable network of systems to help ensure timely and complete collection of public health data to aid a response.8 Under the existing process\u2014which HHS has had to rely on during the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014public health data are collected by thousands of different health departments and laboratories, as well as multiple federal agencies. In June 2022, we made 12 recommendations to HHS, including that it prioritize the development of an interoperable network of systems for near real-time public health situational awareness. HHS agreed with 10 and were reviewing two of the recommendations. As of April 2023, the recommendations have not been implemented.\nClear and consistent communication. In the midst of a public health emergency, clear and consistent communication\u2014among all levels of government, with health care providers, and to the public\u2014is paramount.\nOur work over the years has found that HHS has provided unclear and inconsistent communication during critical incidents. For example, this was problematic during the H1N1 response when we found that selected state officials reported being overwhelmed by the large volume of, and sometimes inconsistent, information received from HHS and the Department of Homeland Security.9 Communication problems persisted during subsequent responses. For example, HHS had provided limited information to its response partners and the public regarding its COVID- 19 testing strategies.10 In January 2021, we made a recommendation for HHS to develop and make public testing strategies to ensure these entities were well informed. HHS partially concurred with this recommendation, expressing concern about producing a strategy while responding to a pandemic, among other things. However, we believe this is an important investment in resources that can be done without imposing unnecessary burden. As of April 2023, this recommendation remains unimplemented.\nTransparency and accountability. When agencies need to quickly disseminate funding and information during public health emergencies, transparency and accountability are especially critical to help ensure program integrity and build public trust. However, we have found deficiencies in these areas both during and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, COVID-19 testing guidelines changed several times over the course of the pandemic with little scientific explanation of the rationale behind the changes, thereby confusing providers and public health stakeholder groups implementing the guidelines, and risking the erosion of trust in the federal government.11 To help avoid confusion and mistrust, in November 2020, we recommended that CDC take action to clearly disclose to the public the rationale for guidance changes at the time changes are made. HHS agreed, and as of April 2023, this recommendation has not been implemented.\nKey partners\u2019 capabilities and limitations. We reported in September 2019 that, in general, ASPR\u2019s resource response capacity\u2014personnel and supplies\u2014can support a response to two simultaneous events that occur in different areas in the continental U.S. for 30 days, according to officials.12 Beyond that, ASPR relies on other response partners, but does not have a complete understanding of the capabilities and limitations of those partners, which creates a vulnerability. Furthermore, we have concerns that ASPR lacks the capability to fully execute its own responsibilities. In April 2022, we reported that ASPR had not undertaken key workforce planning steps to support the mission and goals of the new office it created to address medical product supply vulnerabilities highlighted during the pandemic.13 Additionally, in June 2020, we reported that the extent to which ASPR aligned the size of its emergency responder workforce with the agency\u2019s strategic goals and objectives was limited, affecting ASPR\u2019s ability to ensure the size of the workforce could support its mission.14\nThis lack of planning was notable given that we had previously reported that during the 2017 hurricane season, ASPR experienced a shortage of these responders. This contributed to a reliance on the Department of Defense to provide essential public health and medical service functions. We have identified, and shared with HHS, key principles of strategic human capital planning, which include aligning the workforce with the agency\u2019s emergency planning and response mission and goals, and addressing gaps in the skills and competencies of staff.15\nHHS leadership announced agency reforms in 2022 that could help address the concerns we have identified about their capabilities. Specifically, in July 2022, HHS announced that it had elevated ASPR to a stand-alone agency alongside other HHS agencies, such as CDC and\nFDA. According to an HHS statement, this change will ultimately allow ASPR to mobilize a coordinated national emergency response more effectively and efficiently. In August 2022, CDC announced programmatic, scientific, and operational improvements to better support the agency\u2019s public health response during emergencies and in normal operations. These agencies have taken some actions since their initial announcements, which we will continue to monitor. For example, in February 2023, ASPR announced a new organizational structure that, according to ASPR, accounts for the agency\u2019s expanded mission and new capabilities, among other considerations. We have shared key agency reform practices we identified in June 2018 with HHS officials as it implements these reforms.16 These practices indicate that agencies can successfully change if they have clear goals, follow a process to develop proposed reforms, allocate implementation resources, and consider workforce needs during and after the reform.\nIn conclusion, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has an imperative, complex, and far-reaching role as the lead for the federal public health and medical response to public health emergencies. Numerous public health emergencies converging and occurring simultaneously can present significant challenges and tax already strained resources. As devastating as the COVID-19 pandemic and the concurrent fires and hurricanes have been, HHS, its partners, and Congress must be prepared for more frequent disasters and new viruses. Waiting to address the deficiencies we have identified is not an option\u2014it is not possible to know precisely when the next threat will occur; only that it will come.\nImproving HHS\u2019s leadership and coordination of public health emergencies will require sustained leadership and attention from the executive branch and Congress. It will also require effective and ongoing partnership and engagement with nonfederal entities, including state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, and the private sector as a part of a whole-of-nation multidisciplinary approach to preparedness and response.\nWe will continue to monitor HHS\u2019s efforts in this area.

Specifically, HHS has consistently fallen preparedness for, and response to, short in five areas of an effective national response (see figure). emergencies. For over a decade, GAO has identified deficiencies at HHS that have hindered the nation\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to a variety of past emergencies, including other infectious diseases. This includes the H1N1 influenza pandemic, Zika, and Ebola\u2014 and extreme weather events, such as hurricanes. This statement summarizes key findings from GAO\u2019s January 2022 addition of HHS\u2019s leadership and coordination of public health emergencies to its High-Risk List and related 2023 High-Risk report. What GAO Recommends Through GAO\u2019s body of work in this area, GAO has made 155 recommendations to HHS to improve its leadership and coordination of public health emergency preparedness and response efforts. As of April 2023,\nWe conducted our work in accordance with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance Framework that are relevant to our objectives. The framework requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to meet our stated objectives and to discuss any limitations in our work. We believe that the information and data obtained, and the analysis conducted, provide a reasonable basis for any findings and conclusions in this product.\nBackground\nHHS is responsible for leading and coordinating all matters related to federal public health and medical preparedness for, and response to, emergencies, whether naturally occurring or intentional.3 Preparing for and responding to nationally significant public health emergencies requires a whole-of-nation, multidisciplinary approach involving multiple federal agencies and coordination with nonfederal entities, including state, tribal, and territorial governments, and the private sector.\nWithin HHS, a variety of agencies are involved, including the following:\n\u2022   The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) is to serve as the principal advisor to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on all matters related to federal public health and medical preparedness and response to public health emergencies.4\n\u2022   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) supports public health preparedness efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to new and emerging disease threats. For example, during infectious disease outbreaks, CDC conducts studies to learn about the link between infection and health outcomes, monitors and reports cases of infection, and provides guidance to travelers and health care providers, among other activities. Additionally, CDC typically develops a diagnostic test for an emerging pathogen when no diagnostic test has been approved, cleared, or authorized by the Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) and no adequate alternative is available, such as for H1N1 and Zika. \u2022   FDA plays a critical role in protecting the U.S. from biological threats, including intentional acts and naturally occurring infectious diseases. For example, FDA is responsible for ensuring that medical countermeasures\u2014including drugs, vaccines, diagnostic tests, and personal protective equipment\u2014against these threats are safe and effective.5 FDA may also issue emergency use authorizations to allow the temporary use of unapproved medical products to diagnose, prevent, or treat disease.6\nHHS\u2019s Leadership and Coordination of Public Health\nHHS must improve its leadership and coordination of public health emergencies to save lives, mitigate severe economic impacts, and prepare the nation to respond to multiple simultaneous threats. The Comptroller General of the U.S. has emphasized the importance of sustained attention to this area by the executive branch and Congress. Emergencies Over more than a decade, we have seen, and continue to see, HHS\u2019s efforts fall short in five key areas of an effective national response\u2014 shown in figure 1.\nFigure 1: Five Key Areas of an Effective National Response\n We have evaluated HHS\u2019s actions in these five key areas and made several recommendations to strengthen these efforts. For example:\nClear roles and responsibilities. The unprecedented scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the whole-of-nation response required to address it, highlight the critical importance of clearly defining the roles and responsibilities for the wide range of federal departments and other key partners involved when preparing for pandemics and addressing unforeseen emergencies. For example, we reported that when HHS helped repatriate U.S. citizens from abroad and quarantine them domestically at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent the spread of the virus, significant confusion ensued.7 As a result, HHS put repatriates, its own personnel, and nearby communities at risk due to a lack of clarity as to which HHS agency was in charge, including which HHS agency was responsible for managing infection prevention.\nIn April 2021, we recommended that HHS agencies\u2014ASPR, CDC, and the Administration for Children and Families\u2014revise or develop new plans that clarify agency roles and responsibilities during a pandemic, and regularly exercise these plans with key partners. Regularly exercising preparedness plans with all response partners allows all involved parties to practice operationalizing the plans to help identify any gaps in procedures or barriers to plan implementation so that these can be addressed before an actual event occurs. HHS agreed with our recommendations, which have not been implemented as of April 2023.\nComplete and consistent data. Data are also critical to inform the response to a public health emergency. However, the data HHS has relied on during the COVID-19 pandemic have been, and remain, incomplete and inconsistent, highlighting longstanding concerns in this area. Moreover, we reported in 2010, 2017, and again in 2022 that, although required by statute since 2006, HHS had made little progress in implementing a nationwide public health situational awareness capability through an interoperable network of systems to help ensure timely and complete collection of public health data to aid a response.8 Under the existing process\u2014which HHS has had to rely on during the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014public health data are collected by thousands of different health departments and laboratories, as well as multiple federal agencies. In June 2022, we made 12 recommendations to HHS, including that it prioritize the development of an interoperable network of systems for near real-time public health situational awareness. HHS agreed with 10 and were reviewing two of the recommendations. As of April 2023, the recommendations have not been implemented.\nClear and consistent communication. In the midst of a public health emergency, clear and consistent communication\u2014among all levels of government, with health care providers, and to the public\u2014is paramount.\nOur work over the years has found that HHS has provided unclear and inconsistent communication during critical incidents. For example, this was problematic during the H1N1 response when we found that selected state officials reported being overwhelmed by the large volume of, and sometimes inconsistent, information received from HHS and the Department of Homeland Security.9 Communication problems persisted during subsequent responses. For example, HHS had provided limited information to its response partners and the public regarding its COVID- 19 testing strategies.10 In January 2021, we made a recommendation for HHS to develop and make public testing strategies to ensure these entities were well informed. HHS partially concurred with this recommendation, expressing concern about producing a strategy while responding to a pandemic, among other things. However, we believe this is an important investment in resources that can be done without imposing unnecessary burden. As of April 2023, this recommendation remains unimplemented.\nTransparency and accountability. When agencies need to quickly disseminate funding and information during public health emergencies, transparency and accountability are especially critical to help ensure program integrity and build public trust. However, we have found deficiencies in these areas both during and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, COVID-19 testing guidelines changed several times over the course of the pandemic with little scientific explanation of the rationale behind the changes, thereby confusing providers and public health stakeholder groups implementing the guidelines, and risking the erosion of trust in the federal government.11 To help avoid confusion and mistrust, in November 2020, we recommended that CDC take action to clearly disclose to the public the rationale for guidance changes at the time changes are made. HHS agreed, and as of April 2023, this recommendation has not been implemented.\nKey partners\u2019 capabilities and limitations. We reported in September 2019 that, in general, ASPR\u2019s resource response capacity\u2014personnel and supplies\u2014can support a response to two simultaneous events that occur in different areas in the continental U.S. for 30 days, according to officials.12 Beyond that, ASPR relies on other response partners, but does not have a complete understanding of the capabilities and limitations of those partners, which creates a vulnerability. Furthermore, we have concerns that ASPR lacks the capability to fully execute its own responsibilities. In April 2022, we reported that ASPR had not undertaken key workforce planning steps to support the mission and goals of the new office it created to address medical product supply vulnerabilities highlighted during the pandemic.13 Additionally, in June 2020, we reported that the extent to which ASPR aligned the size of its emergency responder workforce with the agency\u2019s strategic goals and objectives was limited, affecting ASPR\u2019s ability to ensure the size of the workforce could support its mission.14\nThis lack of planning was notable given that we had previously reported that during the 2017 hurricane season, ASPR experienced a shortage of these responders. This contributed to a reliance on the Department of Defense to provide essential public health and medical service functions. We have identified, and shared with HHS, key principles of strategic human capital planning, which include aligning the workforce with the agency\u2019s emergency planning and response mission and goals, and addressing gaps in the skills and competencies of staff.15\nHHS leadership announced agency reforms in 2022 that could help address the concerns we have identified about their capabilities. Specifically, in July 2022, HHS announced that it had elevated ASPR to a stand-alone agency alongside other HHS agencies, such as CDC and\nFDA. According to an HHS statement, this change will ultimately allow ASPR to mobilize a coordinated national emergency response more effectively and efficiently. In August 2022, CDC announced programmatic, scientific, and operational improvements to better support the agency\u2019s public health response during emergencies and in normal operations. These agencies have taken some actions since their initial announcements, which we will continue to monitor. For example, in February 2023, ASPR announced a new organizational structure that, according to ASPR, accounts for the agency\u2019s expanded mission and new capabilities, among other considerations. We have shared key agency reform practices we identified in June 2018 with HHS officials as it implements these reforms.16 These practices indicate that agencies can successfully change if they have clear goals, follow a process to develop proposed reforms, allocate implementation resources, and consider workforce needs during and after the reform.\nIn conclusion, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has an imperative, complex, and far-reaching role as the lead for the federal public health and medical response to public health emergencies. Numerous public health emergencies converging and occurring simultaneously can present significant challenges and tax already strained resources. As devastating as the COVID-19 pandemic and the concurrent fires and hurricanes have been, HHS, its partners, and Congress must be prepared for more frequent disasters and new viruses. Waiting to address the deficiencies we have identified is not an option\u2014it is not possible to know precisely when the next threat will occur; only that it will come.\nImproving HHS\u2019s leadership and coordination of public health emergencies will require sustained leadership and attention from the executive branch and Congress. It will also require effective and ongoing partnership and engagement with nonfederal entities, including state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, and the private sector as a part of a whole-of-nation multidisciplinary approach to preparedness and response.\nWe will continue to monitor HHS\u2019s efforts in this area. The 91 outstanding recommendations made in this area to HHS since fiscal year 2007 are a  starting place.17 To ensure the systemic issues we have identified are sustainably addressed, we will evaluate HHS\u2019s efforts against our five high-risk criteria: (1) leadership commitment to addressing risks; (2) capacity to resolve the risks; (3) development of a corrective action plan that defines the root cause, solutions, and corrective measures needed; (4) monitoring to validate the effectiveness and sustainability of corrective measures; and (5) demonstrated progress in the implementation of those measures. By taking actions in these areas, HHS will be better positioned to lead our nation through the next public health emergency, saving lives and lessening the negative impacts to our economy.\nChair Guthrie, Ranking Member Eshoo, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my statement.

Specifically, HHS has consistently fallen preparedness for, and response to, short in five areas of an effective national response (see figure). emergencies. For over a decade, GAO has identified deficiencies at HHS that have hindered the nation\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to a variety of past emergencies, including other infectious diseases. This includes the H1N1 influenza pandemic, Zika, and Ebola\u2014 and extreme weather events, such as hurricanes. This statement summarizes key findings from GAO\u2019s January 2022 addition of HHS\u2019s leadership and coordination of public health emergencies to its High-Risk List and related 2023 High-Risk report. What GAO Recommends Through GAO\u2019s body of work in this area, GAO has made 155 recommendations to HHS to improve its leadership and coordination of public health emergency preparedness and response efforts. As of April 2023,\nWe conducted our work in accordance with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance Framework that are relevant to our objectives. The framework requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to meet our stated objectives and to discuss any limitations in our work. We believe that the information and data obtained, and the analysis conducted, provide a reasonable basis for any findings and conclusions in this product.\nBackground\nHHS is responsible for leading and coordinating all matters related to federal public health and medical preparedness for, and response to, emergencies, whether naturally occurring or intentional.3 Preparing for and responding to nationally significant public health emergencies requires a whole-of-nation, multidisciplinary approach involving multiple federal agencies and coordination with nonfederal entities, including state, tribal, and territorial governments, and the private sector.\nWithin HHS, a variety of agencies are involved, including the following:\n\u2022   The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) is to serve as the principal advisor to the Secretary of Health and Human Services on all matters related to federal public health and medical preparedness and response to public health emergencies.4\n\u2022   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) supports public health preparedness efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to new and emerging disease threats. For example, during infectious disease outbreaks, CDC conducts studies to learn about the link between infection and health outcomes, monitors and reports cases of infection, and provides guidance to travelers and health care providers, among other activities. Additionally, CDC typically develops a diagnostic test for an emerging pathogen when no diagnostic test has been approved, cleared, or authorized by the Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) and no adequate alternative is available, such as for H1N1 and Zika. \u2022   FDA plays a critical role in protecting the U.S. from biological threats, including intentional acts and naturally occurring infectious diseases. For example, FDA is responsible for ensuring that medical countermeasures\u2014including drugs, vaccines, diagnostic tests, and personal protective equipment\u2014against these threats are safe and effective.5 FDA may also issue emergency use authorizations to allow the temporary use of unapproved medical products to diagnose, prevent, or treat disease.6\nHHS\u2019s Leadership and Coordination of Public Health\nHHS must improve its leadership and coordination of public health emergencies to save lives, mitigate severe economic impacts, and prepare the nation to respond to multiple simultaneous threats. The Comptroller General of the U.S. has emphasized the importance of sustained attention to this area by the executive branch and Congress. Emergencies Over more than a decade, we have seen, and continue to see, HHS\u2019s efforts fall short in five key areas of an effective national response\u2014 shown in figure 1.\nFigure 1: Five Key Areas of an Effective National Response\n We have evaluated HHS\u2019s actions in these five key areas and made several recommendations to strengthen these efforts. For example:\nClear roles and responsibilities. The unprecedented scale of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the whole-of-nation response required to address it, highlight the critical importance of clearly defining the roles and responsibilities for the wide range of federal departments and other key partners involved when preparing for pandemics and addressing unforeseen emergencies. For example, we reported that when HHS helped repatriate U.S. citizens from abroad and quarantine them domestically at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to prevent the spread of the virus, significant confusion ensued.7 As a result, HHS put repatriates, its own personnel, and nearby communities at risk due to a lack of clarity as to which HHS agency was in charge, including which HHS agency was responsible for managing infection prevention.\nIn April 2021, we recommended that HHS agencies\u2014ASPR, CDC, and the Administration for Children and Families\u2014revise or develop new plans that clarify agency roles and responsibilities during a pandemic, and regularly exercise these plans with key partners. Regularly exercising preparedness plans with all response partners allows all involved parties to practice operationalizing the plans to help identify any gaps in procedures or barriers to plan implementation so that these can be addressed before an actual event occurs. HHS agreed with our recommendations, which have not been implemented as of April 2023.\nComplete and consistent data. Data are also critical to inform the response to a public health emergency. However, the data HHS has relied on during the COVID-19 pandemic have been, and remain, incomplete and inconsistent, highlighting longstanding concerns in this area. Moreover, we reported in 2010, 2017, and again in 2022 that, although required by statute since 2006, HHS had made little progress in implementing a nationwide public health situational awareness capability through an interoperable network of systems to help ensure timely and complete collection of public health data to aid a response.8 Under the existing process\u2014which HHS has had to rely on during the COVID-19 pandemic\u2014public health data are collected by thousands of different health departments and laboratories, as well as multiple federal agencies. In June 2022, we made 12 recommendations to HHS, including that it prioritize the development of an interoperable network of systems for near real-time public health situational awareness. HHS agreed with 10 and were reviewing two of the recommendations. As of April 2023, the recommendations have not been implemented.\nClear and consistent communication. In the midst of a public health emergency, clear and consistent communication\u2014among all levels of government, with health care providers, and to the public\u2014is paramount.\nOur work over the years has found that HHS has provided unclear and inconsistent communication during critical incidents. For example, this was problematic during the H1N1 response when we found that selected state officials reported being overwhelmed by the large volume of, and sometimes inconsistent, information received from HHS and the Department of Homeland Security.9 Communication problems persisted during subsequent responses. For example, HHS had provided limited information to its response partners and the public regarding its COVID- 19 testing strategies.10 In January 2021, we made a recommendation for HHS to develop and make public testing strategies to ensure these entities were well informed. HHS partially concurred with this recommendation, expressing concern about producing a strategy while responding to a pandemic, among other things. However, we believe this is an important investment in resources that can be done without imposing unnecessary burden. As of April 2023, this recommendation remains unimplemented.\nTransparency and accountability. When agencies need to quickly disseminate funding and information during public health emergencies, transparency and accountability are especially critical to help ensure program integrity and build public trust. However, we have found deficiencies in these areas both during and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, COVID-19 testing guidelines changed several times over the course of the pandemic with little scientific explanation of the rationale behind the changes, thereby confusing providers and public health stakeholder groups implementing the guidelines, and risking the erosion of trust in the federal government.11 To help avoid confusion and mistrust, in November 2020, we recommended that CDC take action to clearly disclose to the public the rationale for guidance changes at the time changes are made. HHS agreed, and as of April 2023, this recommendation has not been implemented.\nKey partners\u2019 capabilities and limitations. We reported in September 2019 that, in general, ASPR\u2019s resource response capacity\u2014personnel and supplies\u2014can support a response to two simultaneous events that occur in different areas in the continental U.S. for 30 days, according to officials.12 Beyond that, ASPR relies on other response partners, but does not have a complete understanding of the capabilities and limitations of those partners, which creates a vulnerability. Furthermore, we have concerns that ASPR lacks the capability to fully execute its own responsibilities. In April 2022, we reported that ASPR had not undertaken key workforce planning steps to support the mission and goals of the new office it created to address medical product supply vulnerabilities highlighted during the pandemic.13 Additionally, in June 2020, we reported that the extent to which ASPR aligned the size of its emergency responder workforce with the agency\u2019s strategic goals and objectives was limited, affecting ASPR\u2019s ability to ensure the size of the workforce could support its mission.14\nThis lack of planning was notable given that we had previously reported that during the 2017 hurricane season, ASPR experienced a shortage of these responders. This contributed to a reliance on the Department of Defense to provide essential public health and medical service functions. We have identified, and shared with HHS, key principles of strategic human capital planning, which include aligning the workforce with the agency\u2019s emergency planning and response mission and goals, and addressing gaps in the skills and competencies of staff.15\nHHS leadership announced agency reforms in 2022 that could help address the concerns we have identified about their capabilities. Specifically, in July 2022, HHS announced that it had elevated ASPR to a stand-alone agency alongside other HHS agencies, such as CDC and\nFDA. According to an HHS statement, this change will ultimately allow ASPR to mobilize a coordinated national emergency response more effectively and efficiently. In August 2022, CDC announced programmatic, scientific, and operational improvements to better support the agency\u2019s public health response during emergencies and in normal operations. These agencies have taken some actions since their initial announcements, which we will continue to monitor. For example, in February 2023, ASPR announced a new organizational structure that, according to ASPR, accounts for the agency\u2019s expanded mission and new capabilities, among other considerations. We have shared key agency reform practices we identified in June 2018 with HHS officials as it implements these reforms.16 These practices indicate that agencies can successfully change if they have clear goals, follow a process to develop proposed reforms, allocate implementation resources, and consider workforce needs during and after the reform.\nIn conclusion, the Secretary of Health and Human Services has an imperative, complex, and far-reaching role as the lead for the federal public health and medical response to public health emergencies. Numerous public health emergencies converging and occurring simultaneously can present significant challenges and tax already strained resources. As devastating as the COVID-19 pandemic and the concurrent fires and hurricanes have been, HHS, its partners, and Congress must be prepared for more frequent disasters and new viruses. Waiting to address the deficiencies we have identified is not an option\u2014it is not possible to know precisely when the next threat will occur; only that it will come.\nImproving HHS\u2019s leadership and coordination of public health emergencies will require sustained leadership and attention from the executive branch and Congress. It will also require effective and ongoing partnership and engagement with nonfederal entities, including state, local, tribal, and territorial governments, and the private sector as a part of a whole-of-nation multidisciplinary approach to preparedness and response.\nWe will continue to monitor HHS\u2019s efforts in this area. The 91 outstanding recommendations made in this area to HHS since fiscal year 2007 are a  starting place.17 To ensure the systemic issues we have identified are sustainably addressed, we will evaluate HHS\u2019s efforts against our five high-risk criteria: (1) leadership commitment to addressing risks; (2) capacity to resolve the risks; (3) development of a corrective action plan that defines the root cause, solutions, and corrective measures needed; (4) monitoring to validate the effectiveness and sustainability of corrective measures; and (5) demonstrated progress in the implementation of those measures. By taking actions in these areas, HHS will be better positioned to lead our nation through the next public health emergency, saving lives and lessening the negative impacts to our economy.\nChair Guthrie, Ranking Member Eshoo, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my statement.

{"content": "United States Government Accountability Office\n Testimony\nBefore  the Subcommittee on Health\nCare  and Financial Services, Committee\n on Oversight and Accountability, House of  Representatives\nFor Release on Delivery Expected at 2:00 p.m. ET Wednesday, May 24, 2023 BANK REGULATION Preliminary Review of Agency Actions Related to March 2023 Bank Failures\nStatement of Michael E. Clements, Director, Financial Markets and Community Investment\nGAO-23-106857\nLetter\nLetter\n Chairwoman McClain, Ranking Member Porter, and Members of the Subcommittee\nI am pleased to be here today to discuss preliminary findings from our April 2023 report on the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank in March 2023.1 More specifically, my statement provides observations on factors that may have caused the banks to fail and supervisory actions regulators took leading up to the failures.\nAt the time of closure, SVB was the 16th largest U.S. bank and Signature Bank the 29th largest. As of March 28, 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) estimated the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund of resolving SVB to be $20 billion and Signature Bank, $2.5 billion.2 Subsequent to our April 2023 report, on May 1, 2023 First Republic Bank, the 14th largest U.S. bank, failed with an estimated cost of $13 billion to the Deposit Insurance Fund.\nThis statement is based on our April 2023 report. For the topics discussed today, we analyzed regulatory financial data from 2018\u20132022 on the two banks and assessed their condition relative to a peer group of banks. We also reviewed Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRBSF) and FDIC examination records (including schedules, memorandums, and reports) and bank management responses to supervisory concerns for the banks (including supervisory letters and documentation of informal enforcement actions) from January 2018 through March 2023. We focused our review on supervisory activities related to the banks\u2019 liquidity and risk management. We also interviewed staff from FDIC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), and FRBSF. More detailed information on our scope and methodology can be found in our April 2023 report. Our work was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. \nRisky Business Weak Liquidity and Risk Management Contributed to the Recent Bank Failures\nSVB and Signature Bank experienced rapid growth and relied on less stable funding\u2014indicators of risky business strategies. Strategies along with \u2022   From December 2018 to December 2022, SVB\u2019s total assets more than tripled from $56 billion to $209 billion, and Signature Bank\u2019s more than doubled from $47 billion to $110 billion. From 2019 through 2021, the total assets of SVB and Signature Bank grew by 198 percent and 134 percent, respectively\u2014far exceeding growth for a group of 19 peer banks (33 percent growth in median total assets). \u2022   To support their rapid growth, the two banks relied on uninsured deposits, which can be an unstable source of funding because customers with uninsured deposits may be more likely to withdraw their funds during times of stress. At the end of 2021, SVB\u2019s share of uninsured deposits to total assets was 80 percent and Signature\u2019s was 82 percent\u2014approximately two times higher than for a group of peer banks.3 The two banks\u2019 reliance on uninsured deposits may indicate a long-standing concentration of risk. Additionally, SVB and Signature Bank exhibited weak liquidity and risk management.\n\u2022   SVB had exposure to interest rate risk through its investment in longer-term securities to generate yield against its deposits. According to FRBSF staff and examination documents, the bank did not effectively manage the interest rate risk of the securities or develop appropriate risk-management tools for this risk. Federal Reserve and FRBSF staff noted that SVB failed due to ineffective management of its deposits and assets. \u2022   Signature Bank had exposure to deposits from the digital assets industry. According to FDIC officials and examination documents, poor governance and risk-management practices prevented the bank from adequately managing its liquidity risk. FDIC officials noted that poor governance and unsatisfactory risk-management practices were the root cause of Signature Bank\u2019s failure.\nRegulators Did Not Escalate Supervisory Actions in Time to Mitigate Key Risks\nIn the years prior to 2023, FRBSF and FDIC identified liquidity and management risks at SVB and Signature Bank\u2014key drivers of the banks\u2019 failures. However, neither regulator\u2019s actions resulted in management sufficiently mitigating those risks. GAO\u2019s prior work identified the importance of regulators taking timely and effective actions to address underlying problems.\nAssociated with the Bank Failures\nFederal Reserve Identified Risks and Took Supervisory Actions, but Did Not Adequately Escalate Actions Prior to\nFRBSF was generally positive in its ratings of SVB from December 2018 to June 2022, rating SVB\u2019s overall condition as \u201csatisfactory.\u201d During that same period, FRBSF assigned SVB the highest available CAMELS rating for liquidity-management practices and the second-highest available rating for management practices.4 As noted earlier, deficient liquidity and management practices were factors contributing to the bank\u2019s failure. SVB\u2019s Failure Despite the overall satisfactory ratings, FRBSF noted several concerns, which were relevant to the bank\u2019s March 2023 failure. For example, in 2018 FRBSF found that despite liquidity levels appearing strong, funding sources were concentrated and might become volatile with little notice. In 2020, examiners found that stress test modeling showed the bank had ample liquidity over stressed periods but the stress tests did not provide insight into liquidity risks for stressed periods of 30 days or less. In 2018, 2019, and 2020, FRBSF also issued (or had outstanding) matters requiring attention related to risk management and liquidity.\nFRBSF staff generally accepted SVB\u2019s planned actions to correct deficiencies. Our review of examination staff\u2019s acknowledgement of SVB management responses found the staff generally agreed that SVB\u2019s planned actions were reasonably designed to remediate the underlying supervisory issues.\nSubsequent to SVB\u2019s shift into a different examination category, examiners identified additional liquidity and management deficiencies. Increases in asset levels at SVB Financial Group, the holding company for SVB, moved the entity from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Regional Banking Organization category into the Large and Foreign Banking Organization category in June 2021.5 SVB Financial Group became subject to examination under the Large Financial Institution rating system. According to Federal Reserve staff, SVB then had a larger dedicated examination team (with a specific team member covering liquidity) and was subject to more rigorous supervisory requirements.\nMore specifically, in an August 2021 review, FRBSF raised serious concerns around how the institution was managing liquidity risk. It found that liquidity risk-management practices were below supervisory expectations. It issued two matters requiring immediate attention (which reflect serious supervisory concerns) and four matters requiring attention on these issues. FRBSF described the review in its scoping memorandum as a baseline and further noted that it conducted limited supervisory work on liquidity and stress testing over the past two supervisory cycles.6\nA May 2022 target review of SVB Financial Group and SVB\u2014conducted under the Large Financial Institution rating system\u2014found that the bank\u2019s governance and risk-management practices also were below supervisory expectations. In response to these issues, FRBSF issued three matters requiring immediate attention related to risk management.\nOn June 30, 2022, FRBSF downgraded SVB\u2019s ratings. Specifically, FRBSF downgraded the bank\u2019s CAMELS composite rating from a 2 to a 3, its management component rating from a 2 to a 3, and its liquidity  component rating from a 1 to a 2. Examiners found that the bank\u2019s management and board performance needed improvement and were less than satisfactory. For example, the board did not provide effective oversight of implementation of the risk-management framework and did not hold management accountable for the root causes contributing to weaknesses in liquidity risk management and other risks.\nOn August 17, 2022, FRBSF issued a supervisory letter to SVB Financial Group and SVB on its first Large Financial Institution rating. FRBSF rated SVB Financial Group \u201cDeficient-1\u201d for governance and controls, stating its risk-management program was not effective, did not incorporate coverage for all risk categories, and did not address foundational, enterprise-level risk-management matters. FRBSF rated SVB Financial Group\u2019s liquidity as \u201cConditionally Meets Expectations.\u201d It stated that while actual and post-stress liquidity positions reflected a sufficient buffer, the firm lacked several foundational elements for liquidity risk management.\nIn the same supervisory letter, FRBSF stated its intent to initiate an informal, nonpublic enforcement action, in the form of a memorandum of understanding, with SVB Financial Group and SVB. The memorandum\u2019s provisions were focused on correcting the management and liquidity risk issues mentioned above and on holding the bank\u2019s board and executive management accountable for addressing the root causes of the deficiencies.\nFRBSF staff told us that staff started working on the memorandum of understanding after communicating the July 2022 downgrade. In addition, Federal Reserve Bank staff started working with the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Supervision and Regulation and Legal divisions in late August 2022 to develop the memorandum. According to Federal Reserve staff, Federal Reserve Board and FRBSF staff collaborated on provisions of the memorandum, including those related to liquidity and risk management, which required senior-level review. They kept the memorandum open to allow for the completion of additional examination work by FRBSF. However, the Federal Reserve did not finalize the memorandum before SVB failed in March 2023.\nAlthough Federal Reserve staff stated that the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory actions compelled SVB to take steps including replacing the Board Chair, Chief Risk Officer, and Treasurer and revising its incentive compensation program to incorporate risk management as a formal assessment criteria, its supervisory actions were inadequate given the bank\u2019s known liquidity and management deficiencies. Furthermore,\nFRBSF\u2019s actions lacked urgency. For example, FRBSF did not recommend the issuance of a single enforcement action despite the bank\u2019s serious liquidity and management issues before the bank\u2019s failure.\nFDIC Identified Risks and Took Supervisory Actions, but Did Not Adequately Escalate Actions Prior to\nFDIC\u2019s ratings of Signature Bank found that the bank\u2019s overall condition was \u201csatisfactory\u201d from December 2018 to December 2021. In addition, FDIC assigned the second-highest available CAMELS rating for the bank\u2019s management practices. As noted earlier, weak management practices contributed to the bank\u2019s failure. Signature Bank\u2019s Failure Despite FDIC\u2019s overall \u201csatisfactory\u201d assessment during 2018\u20132021, FDIC took numerous supervisory actions to mitigate liquidity and management deficiencies at the bank, including downgrading Signature Bank\u2019s liquidity component from 2 to 3 during the 2019 examination cycle, meaning the bank\u2019s liquidity management practices needed improvement.\nIn its examination documents, FDIC explained that Signature Bank\u2019s practices did not correspond with the bank\u2019s complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations due to weaknesses in areas including liquidity contingency planning and internal controls. These weaknesses prevented the bank from appropriately understanding the potential effects of adverse liquidity events and emergency cash flow needs.\nFDIC also issued matters requiring board attention and supervisory recommendations related to management, liquidity, and corporate governance risks in each year before the bank\u2019s failure. For example, FDIC issued two matters requiring board attention in 2018 and one matter requiring board attention in 2019 related to bank management\u2019s handling of increasing liquidity and management risks. The matters focused on issues including the bank\u2019s adherence to its risk appetite statement and liquidity contingency planning. Many matters and recommendations carried over to later years because they were unresolved. For instance, a 2019 matter on liquidity contingency planning remained outstanding through March 2023.\nFDIC had not completed 2022 examination documents for Signature Bank at the time of its failure. FDIC staff told us they were considering escalating supervisory actions in 2022\u2014including taking enforcement actions and downgrading CAMELS composite or component ratings\u2014 based on the findings of the completed 2022 corporate governance target review and the in-process target reviews for liquidity and other topics.\nThese escalatory actions would have taken place in the second quarter of 2023, after FDIC staff finalized documentation such as the 2022 report of examination and supervisory letters. According to preliminary findings we reviewed from FDIC\u2019s 2022 liquidity target examination, FDIC planned to reiterate its 2019 matter requiring board attention on liquidity contingency planning. It also had drafted a new matter requiring board attention on the bank\u2019s audit program for liquidity and funds management, as well as several supervisory recommendations.\nFDIC stated that because Signature Bank did not mitigate its liquidity and management-related issues in a timely manner, it issued an interim CAMELS rating downgrade on March 11, 2023, the day before Signature Bank was closed. In the downgrade letter, FDIC stated that management failed to demonstrate the capability to properly identify, measure, monitor, and control the bank\u2019s liquidity position. Furthermore, funds management practices were critically deficient for the complexity of the bank\u2019s liquidity risk profile, and the continued viability of the institution was threatened. The lack of urgency, formality, and preparedness around liquidity contingency funding plans reflected poorly on management and was another factor for these downgrades. In the letter, FDIC also notified Signature Bank of its intent to pursue a formal enforcement action against the bank for failure to mitigate concerns outlined in the downgrade letter, but the bank failed the next day.\nSignature Bank\u2019s management failed to take adequate steps to mitigate the bank\u2019s long-standing liquidity and management issues before the bank\u2019s failure. For example, FDIC staff told us that Signature Bank management could sometimes be unresponsive and difficult to work with. They added that Signature Bank management would report to FDIC that it mitigated an issue, only for FDIC staff to find the issue unresolved during transaction testing. This behavior caused FDIC to issue repeat supervisory recommendations to Signature Bank.\nAlthough FDIC took some actions to escalate its supervisory actions in 2019 and 2020, its actions were inadequate given the bank\u2019s longstanding liquidity and management deficiencies. Furthermore, FDIC lacked urgency despite Signature Bank\u2019s repeated failures to remediate liquidity and management issues. FDIC did not pursue more forceful supervisory actions in a timely manner that might have helped the bank correct its liquidity and management issues before its failure in March 2023. For example, FDIC only issued an enforcement action and further downgraded the bank\u2019s composite or component CAMELS ratings the day before Signature Bank\u2019s failure in 2023. Taking more decisive actions in the years prior to Signature Bank\u2019s failure could have helped compel bank management to mitigate the liquidity and management weaknesses that contributed to the bank\u2019s failure.\nGAO\u2019s Past Work Warned about the Risks of Untimely Escalation by Regulators and the Need for Early Triggers\nWe previously noted in a 2015 report that although regulators often identified risky practices well before failures, the regulatory process was not always effective or timely in correcting underlying problems before banks failed.7 Furthermore, GAO has longstanding concerns about escalation of supervisory concerns. In 1991, we found that bank regulators did not always use the most forceful actions available to correct unsafe and unsound banking practices.8 In 2011, we recommended that regulators consider adding noncapital triggers to their framework for prompt corrective action (to help give more advanced warning of deteriorating conditions).9 The regulators considered noncapital triggers, but have not added them to the framework\u2014thus missing a potential opportunity to take early action to address deteriorating conditions at banks.\nChairwoman McClain, Ranking Member Porter, and Members of the Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement. I would be pleased to respond to any questions that you may have at this time.\nGAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments\nIf you or your staff have any questions about this testimony, please contact Michael Clements, Director, Financial Markets and Community Investment at (202) 512-8678 or clementsm@gao.gov.

{"content": "United States Government Accountability Office\n Testimony\nBefore  the Subcommittee on Health\nCare  and Financial Services, Committee\n on Oversight and Accountability, House of  Representatives\nFor Release on Delivery Expected at 2:00 p.m. ET Wednesday, May 24, 2023 BANK REGULATION Preliminary Review of Agency Actions Related to March 2023 Bank Failures\nStatement of Michael E. Clements, Director, Financial Markets and Community Investment\nGAO-23-106857\nLetter\nLetter\n Chairwoman McClain, Ranking Member Porter, and Members of the Subcommittee\nI am pleased to be here today to discuss preliminary findings from our April 2023 report on the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank in March 2023.1 More specifically, my statement provides observations on factors that may have caused the banks to fail and supervisory actions regulators took leading up to the failures.\nAt the time of closure, SVB was the 16th largest U.S. bank and Signature Bank the 29th largest. As of March 28, 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) estimated the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund of resolving SVB to be $20 billion and Signature Bank, $2.5 billion.2 Subsequent to our April 2023 report, on May 1, 2023 First Republic Bank, the 14th largest U.S. bank, failed with an estimated cost of $13 billion to the Deposit Insurance Fund.\nThis statement is based on our April 2023 report. For the topics discussed today, we analyzed regulatory financial data from 2018\u20132022 on the two banks and assessed their condition relative to a peer group of banks. We also reviewed Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRBSF) and FDIC examination records (including schedules, memorandums, and reports) and bank management responses to supervisory concerns for the banks (including supervisory letters and documentation of informal enforcement actions) from January 2018 through March 2023. We focused our review on supervisory activities related to the banks\u2019 liquidity and risk management. We also interviewed staff from FDIC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), and FRBSF. More detailed information on our scope and methodology can be found in our April 2023 report. Our work was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. \nRisky Business Weak Liquidity and Risk Management Contributed to the Recent Bank Failures\nSVB and Signature Bank experienced rapid growth and relied on less stable funding\u2014indicators of risky business strategies. Strategies along with \u2022   From December 2018 to December 2022, SVB\u2019s total assets more than tripled from $56 billion to $209 billion, and Signature Bank\u2019s more than doubled from $47 billion to $110 billion. From 2019 through 2021, the total assets of SVB and Signature Bank grew by 198 percent and 134 percent, respectively\u2014far exceeding growth for a group of 19 peer banks (33 percent growth in median total assets). \u2022   To support their rapid growth, the two banks relied on uninsured deposits, which can be an unstable source of funding because customers with uninsured deposits may be more likely to withdraw their funds during times of stress. At the end of 2021, SVB\u2019s share of uninsured deposits to total assets was 80 percent and Signature\u2019s was 82 percent\u2014approximately two times higher than for a group of peer banks.3 The two banks\u2019 reliance on uninsured deposits may indicate a long-standing concentration of risk. Additionally, SVB and Signature Bank exhibited weak liquidity and risk management.\n\u2022   SVB had exposure to interest rate risk through its investment in longer-term securities to generate yield against its deposits. According to FRBSF staff and examination documents, the bank did not effectively manage the interest rate risk of the securities or develop appropriate risk-management tools for this risk. Federal Reserve and FRBSF staff noted that SVB failed due to ineffective management of its deposits and assets. \u2022   Signature Bank had exposure to deposits from the digital assets industry. According to FDIC officials and examination documents, poor governance and risk-management practices prevented the bank from adequately managing its liquidity risk. FDIC officials noted that poor governance and unsatisfactory risk-management practices were the root cause of Signature Bank\u2019s failure.\nRegulators Did Not Escalate Supervisory Actions in Time to Mitigate Key Risks\nIn the years prior to 2023, FRBSF and FDIC identified liquidity and management risks at SVB and Signature Bank\u2014key drivers of the banks\u2019 failures. However, neither regulator\u2019s actions resulted in management sufficiently mitigating those risks. GAO\u2019s prior work identified the importance of regulators taking timely and effective actions to address underlying problems.\nAssociated with the Bank Failures\nFederal Reserve Identified Risks and Took Supervisory Actions, but Did Not Adequately Escalate Actions Prior to\nFRBSF was generally positive in its ratings of SVB from December 2018 to June 2022, rating SVB\u2019s overall condition as \u201csatisfactory.\u201d During that same period, FRBSF assigned SVB the highest available CAMELS rating for liquidity-management practices and the second-highest available rating for management practices.4 As noted earlier, deficient liquidity and management practices were factors contributing to the bank\u2019s failure. SVB\u2019s Failure Despite the overall satisfactory ratings, FRBSF noted several concerns, which were relevant to the bank\u2019s March 2023 failure. For example, in 2018 FRBSF found that despite liquidity levels appearing strong, funding sources were concentrated and might become volatile with little notice. In 2020, examiners found that stress test modeling showed the bank had ample liquidity over stressed periods but the stress tests did not provide insight into liquidity risks for stressed periods of 30 days or less. In 2018, 2019, and 2020, FRBSF also issued (or had outstanding) matters requiring attention related to risk management and liquidity.\nFRBSF staff generally accepted SVB\u2019s planned actions to correct deficiencies. Our review of examination staff\u2019s acknowledgement of SVB management responses found the staff generally agreed that SVB\u2019s planned actions were reasonably designed to remediate the underlying supervisory issues.\nSubsequent to SVB\u2019s shift into a different examination category, examiners identified additional liquidity and management deficiencies. Increases in asset levels at SVB Financial Group, the holding company for SVB, moved the entity from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Regional Banking Organization category into the Large and Foreign Banking Organization category in June 2021.5 SVB Financial Group became subject to examination under the Large Financial Institution rating system. According to Federal Reserve staff, SVB then had a larger dedicated examination team (with a specific team member covering liquidity) and was subject to more rigorous supervisory requirements.\nMore specifically, in an August 2021 review, FRBSF raised serious concerns around how the institution was managing liquidity risk. It found that liquidity risk-management practices were below supervisory expectations. It issued two matters requiring immediate attention (which reflect serious supervisory concerns) and four matters requiring attention on these issues. FRBSF described the review in its scoping memorandum as a baseline and further noted that it conducted limited supervisory work on liquidity and stress testing over the past two supervisory cycles.6\nA May 2022 target review of SVB Financial Group and SVB\u2014conducted under the Large Financial Institution rating system\u2014found that the bank\u2019s governance and risk-management practices also were below supervisory expectations. In response to these issues, FRBSF issued three matters requiring immediate attention related to risk management.\nOn June 30, 2022, FRBSF downgraded SVB\u2019s ratings. Specifically, FRBSF downgraded the bank\u2019s CAMELS composite rating from a 2 to a 3, its management component rating from a 2 to a 3, and its liquidity  component rating from a 1 to a 2. Examiners found that the bank\u2019s management and board performance needed improvement and were less than satisfactory. For example, the board did not provide effective oversight of implementation of the risk-management framework and did not hold management accountable for the root causes contributing to weaknesses in liquidity risk management and other risks.\nOn August 17, 2022, FRBSF issued a supervisory letter to SVB Financial Group and SVB on its first Large Financial Institution rating. FRBSF rated SVB Financial Group \u201cDeficient-1\u201d for governance and controls, stating its risk-management program was not effective, did not incorporate coverage for all risk categories, and did not address foundational, enterprise-level risk-management matters. FRBSF rated SVB Financial Group\u2019s liquidity as \u201cConditionally Meets Expectations.\u201d It stated that while actual and post-stress liquidity positions reflected a sufficient buffer, the firm lacked several foundational elements for liquidity risk management.\nIn the same supervisory letter, FRBSF stated its intent to initiate an informal, nonpublic enforcement action, in the form of a memorandum of understanding, with SVB Financial Group and SVB. The memorandum\u2019s provisions were focused on correcting the management and liquidity risk issues mentioned above and on holding the bank\u2019s board and executive management accountable for addressing the root causes of the deficiencies.\nFRBSF staff told us that staff started working on the memorandum of understanding after communicating the July 2022 downgrade. In addition, Federal Reserve Bank staff started working with the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Supervision and Regulation and Legal divisions in late August 2022 to develop the memorandum. According to Federal Reserve staff, Federal Reserve Board and FRBSF staff collaborated on provisions of the memorandum, including those related to liquidity and risk management, which required senior-level review. They kept the memorandum open to allow for the completion of additional examination work by FRBSF. However, the Federal Reserve did not finalize the memorandum before SVB failed in March 2023.\nAlthough Federal Reserve staff stated that the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory actions compelled SVB to take steps including replacing the Board Chair, Chief Risk Officer, and Treasurer and revising its incentive compensation program to incorporate risk management as a formal assessment criteria, its supervisory actions were inadequate given the bank\u2019s known liquidity and management deficiencies. Furthermore,\nFRBSF\u2019s actions lacked urgency. For example, FRBSF did not recommend the issuance of a single enforcement action despite the bank\u2019s serious liquidity and management issues before the bank\u2019s failure.\nFDIC Identified Risks and Took Supervisory Actions, but Did Not Adequately Escalate Actions Prior to\nFDIC\u2019s ratings of Signature Bank found that the bank\u2019s overall condition was \u201csatisfactory\u201d from December 2018 to December 2021. In addition, FDIC assigned the second-highest available CAMELS rating for the bank\u2019s management practices. As noted earlier, weak management practices contributed to the bank\u2019s failure. Signature Bank\u2019s Failure Despite FDIC\u2019s overall \u201csatisfactory\u201d assessment during 2018\u20132021, FDIC took numerous supervisory actions to mitigate liquidity and management deficiencies at the bank, including downgrading Signature Bank\u2019s liquidity component from 2 to 3 during the 2019 examination cycle, meaning the bank\u2019s liquidity management practices needed improvement.\nIn its examination documents, FDIC explained that Signature Bank\u2019s practices did not correspond with the bank\u2019s complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations due to weaknesses in areas including liquidity contingency planning and internal controls. These weaknesses prevented the bank from appropriately understanding the potential effects of adverse liquidity events and emergency cash flow needs.\nFDIC also issued matters requiring board attention and supervisory recommendations related to management, liquidity, and corporate governance risks in each year before the bank\u2019s failure. For example, FDIC issued two matters requiring board attention in 2018 and one matter requiring board attention in 2019 related to bank management\u2019s handling of increasing liquidity and management risks. The matters focused on issues including the bank\u2019s adherence to its risk appetite statement and liquidity contingency planning. Many matters and recommendations carried over to later years because they were unresolved. For instance, a 2019 matter on liquidity contingency planning remained outstanding through March 2023.\nFDIC had not completed 2022 examination documents for Signature Bank at the time of its failure. FDIC staff told us they were considering escalating supervisory actions in 2022\u2014including taking enforcement actions and downgrading CAMELS composite or component ratings\u2014 based on the findings of the completed 2022 corporate governance target review and the in-process target reviews for liquidity and other topics.\nThese escalatory actions would have taken place in the second quarter of 2023, after FDIC staff finalized documentation such as the 2022 report of examination and supervisory letters. According to preliminary findings we reviewed from FDIC\u2019s 2022 liquidity target examination, FDIC planned to reiterate its 2019 matter requiring board attention on liquidity contingency planning. It also had drafted a new matter requiring board attention on the bank\u2019s audit program for liquidity and funds management, as well as several supervisory recommendations.\nFDIC stated that because Signature Bank did not mitigate its liquidity and management-related issues in a timely manner, it issued an interim CAMELS rating downgrade on March 11, 2023, the day before Signature Bank was closed. In the downgrade letter, FDIC stated that management failed to demonstrate the capability to properly identify, measure, monitor, and control the bank\u2019s liquidity position. Furthermore, funds management practices were critically deficient for the complexity of the bank\u2019s liquidity risk profile, and the continued viability of the institution was threatened. The lack of urgency, formality, and preparedness around liquidity contingency funding plans reflected poorly on management and was another factor for these downgrades. In the letter, FDIC also notified Signature Bank of its intent to pursue a formal enforcement action against the bank for failure to mitigate concerns outlined in the downgrade letter, but the bank failed the next day.\nSignature Bank\u2019s management failed to take adequate steps to mitigate the bank\u2019s long-standing liquidity and management issues before the bank\u2019s failure. For example, FDIC staff told us that Signature Bank management could sometimes be unresponsive and difficult to work with. They added that Signature Bank management would report to FDIC that it mitigated an issue, only for FDIC staff to find the issue unresolved during transaction testing. This behavior caused FDIC to issue repeat supervisory recommendations to Signature Bank.\nAlthough FDIC took some actions to escalate its supervisory actions in 2019 and 2020, its actions were inadequate given the bank\u2019s longstanding liquidity and management deficiencies. Furthermore, FDIC lacked urgency despite Signature Bank\u2019s repeated failures to remediate liquidity and management issues. FDIC did not pursue more forceful supervisory actions in a timely manner that might have helped the bank correct its liquidity and management issues before its failure in March 2023. For example, FDIC only issued an enforcement action and further downgraded the bank\u2019s composite or component CAMELS ratings the day before Signature Bank\u2019s failure in 2023. Taking more decisive actions in the years prior to Signature Bank\u2019s failure could have helped compel bank management to mitigate the liquidity and management weaknesses that contributed to the bank\u2019s failure.\nGAO\u2019s Past Work Warned about the Risks of Untimely Escalation by Regulators and the Need for Early Triggers\nWe previously noted in a 2015 report that although regulators often identified risky practices well before failures, the regulatory process was not always effective or timely in correcting underlying problems before banks failed.7 Furthermore, GAO has longstanding concerns about escalation of supervisory concerns. In 1991, we found that bank regulators did not always use the most forceful actions available to correct unsafe and unsound banking practices.8 In 2011, we recommended that regulators consider adding noncapital triggers to their framework for prompt corrective action (to help give more advanced warning of deteriorating conditions).9 The regulators considered noncapital triggers, but have not added them to the framework\u2014thus missing a potential opportunity to take early action to address deteriorating conditions at banks.\nChairwoman McClain, Ranking Member Porter, and Members of the Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.

As of March 28, 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) estimated the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund of resolving SVB to be $20 billion and Signature Bank, $2.5 billion.2 Subsequent to our April 2023 report, on May 1, 2023 First Republic Bank, the 14th largest U.S. bank, failed with an estimated cost of $13 billion to the Deposit Insurance Fund.\nThis statement is based on our April 2023 report. For the topics discussed today, we analyzed regulatory financial data from 2018\u20132022 on the two banks and assessed their condition relative to a peer group of banks. We also reviewed Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRBSF) and FDIC examination records (including schedules, memorandums, and reports) and bank management responses to supervisory concerns for the banks (including supervisory letters and documentation of informal enforcement actions) from January 2018 through March 2023.

However, the Federal Reserve did not finalize the memorandum before SVB failed in March 2023.\nAlthough Federal Reserve staff stated that the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory actions compelled SVB to take steps including replacing the Board Chair, Chief Risk Officer, and Treasurer and revising its incentive compensation program to incorporate risk management as a formal assessment criteria, its supervisory actions were inadequate given the bank\u2019s known liquidity and management deficiencies. Furthermore,\nFRBSF\u2019s actions lacked urgency. For example, FRBSF did not recommend the issuance of a single enforcement action despite the bank\u2019s serious liquidity and management issues before the bank\u2019s failure.\nFDIC Identified Risks and Took Supervisory Actions, but Did Not Adequately Escalate Actions Prior to\nFDIC\u2019s ratings of Signature Bank found that the bank\u2019s overall condition was \u201csatisfactory\u201d from December 2018 to December 2021. In addition, FDIC assigned the second-highest available CAMELS rating for the bank\u2019s management practices. As noted earlier, weak management practices contributed to the bank\u2019s failure. Signature Bank\u2019s Failure Despite FDIC\u2019s overall \u201csatisfactory\u201d assessment during 2018\u20132021, FDIC took numerous supervisory actions to mitigate liquidity and management deficiencies at the bank, including downgrading Signature Bank\u2019s liquidity component from 2 to 3 during the 2019 examination cycle, meaning the bank\u2019s liquidity management practices needed improvement.\nIn its examination documents, FDIC explained that Signature Bank\u2019s practices did not correspond with the bank\u2019s complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations due to weaknesses in areas including liquidity contingency planning and internal controls. These weaknesses prevented the bank from appropriately understanding the potential effects of adverse liquidity events and emergency cash flow needs.\nFDIC also issued matters requiring board attention and supervisory recommendations related to management, liquidity, and corporate governance risks in each year before the bank\u2019s failure. For example, FDIC issued two matters requiring board attention in 2018 and one matter requiring board attention in 2019 related to bank management\u2019s handling of increasing liquidity and management risks. The matters focused on issues including the bank\u2019s adherence to its risk appetite statement and liquidity contingency planning. Many matters and recommendations carried over to later years because they were unresolved. For instance, a 2019 matter on liquidity contingency planning remained outstanding through March 2023.\nFDIC had not completed 2022 examination documents for Signature Bank at the time of its failure. FDIC staff told us they were considering escalating supervisory actions in 2022\u2014including taking enforcement actions and downgrading CAMELS composite or component ratings\u2014 based on the findings of the completed 2022 corporate governance target review and the in-process target reviews for liquidity and other topics.\nThese escalatory actions would have taken place in the second quarter of 2023, after FDIC staff finalized documentation such as the 2022 report of examination and supervisory letters. According to preliminary findings we reviewed from FDIC\u2019s 2022 liquidity target examination, FDIC planned to reiterate its 2019 matter requiring board attention on liquidity contingency planning. It also had drafted a new matter requiring board attention on the bank\u2019s audit program for liquidity and funds management, as well as several supervisory recommendations.\nFDIC stated that because Signature Bank did not mitigate its liquidity and management-related issues in a timely manner, it issued an interim CAMELS rating downgrade on March 11, 2023, the day before Signature Bank was closed. In the downgrade letter, FDIC stated that management failed to demonstrate the capability to properly identify, measure, monitor, and control the bank\u2019s liquidity position. Furthermore, funds management practices were critically deficient for the complexity of the bank\u2019s liquidity risk profile, and the continued viability of the institution was threatened. The lack of urgency, formality, and preparedness around liquidity contingency funding plans reflected poorly on management and was another factor for these downgrades. In the letter, FDIC also notified Signature Bank of its intent to pursue a formal enforcement action against the bank for failure to mitigate concerns outlined in the downgrade letter, but the bank failed the next day.\nSignature Bank\u2019s management failed to take adequate steps to mitigate the bank\u2019s long-standing liquidity and management issues before the bank\u2019s failure. For example, FDIC staff told us that Signature Bank management could sometimes be unresponsive and difficult to work with. They added that Signature Bank management would report to FDIC that it mitigated an issue, only for FDIC staff to find the issue unresolved during transaction testing. This behavior caused FDIC to issue repeat supervisory recommendations to Signature Bank.\nAlthough FDIC took some actions to escalate its supervisory actions in 2019 and 2020, its actions were inadequate given the bank\u2019s longstanding liquidity and management deficiencies. Furthermore, FDIC lacked urgency despite Signature Bank\u2019s repeated failures to remediate liquidity and management issues. FDIC did not pursue more forceful supervisory actions in a timely manner that might have helped the bank correct its liquidity and management issues before its failure in March 2023. For example, FDIC only issued an enforcement action and further downgraded the bank\u2019s composite or component CAMELS ratings the day before Signature Bank\u2019s failure in 2023. Taking more decisive actions in the years prior to Signature Bank\u2019s failure could have helped compel bank management to mitigate the liquidity and management weaknesses that contributed to the bank\u2019s failure.\nGAO\u2019s Past Work Warned about the Risks of Untimely Escalation by Regulators and the Need for Early Triggers\nWe previously noted in a 2015 report that although regulators often identified risky practices well before failures, the regulatory process was not always effective or timely in correcting underlying problems before banks failed.7 Furthermore, GAO has longstanding concerns about escalation of supervisory concerns. In 1991, we found that bank regulators did not always use the most forceful actions available to correct unsafe and unsound banking practices.8 In 2011, we recommended that regulators consider adding noncapital triggers to their framework for prompt corrective action (to help give more advanced warning of deteriorating conditions).9 The regulators considered noncapital triggers, but have not added them to the framework\u2014thus missing a potential opportunity to take early action to address deteriorating conditions at banks.\nChairwoman McClain, Ranking Member Porter, and Members of the Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement. I would be pleased to respond to any questions that you may have at this time.\nGAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments\nIf you or your staff have any questions about this testimony, please contact Michael Clements, Director, Financial Markets and Community Investment at (202) 512-8678 or clementsm@gao.gov.

{"content": "United States Government Accountability Office\n Testimony\nBefore  the Subcommittee on Health\nCare  and Financial Services, Committee\n on Oversight and Accountability, House of  Representatives\nFor Release on Delivery Expected at 2:00 p.m. ET Wednesday, May 24, 2023 BANK REGULATION Preliminary Review of Agency Actions Related to March 2023 Bank Failures\nStatement of Michael E. Clements, Director, Financial Markets and Community Investment\nGAO-23-106857\nLetter\nLetter\n Chairwoman McClain, Ranking Member Porter, and Members of the Subcommittee\nI am pleased to be here today to discuss preliminary findings from our April 2023 report on the failures of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank in March 2023.1 More specifically, my statement provides observations on factors that may have caused the banks to fail and supervisory actions regulators took leading up to the failures.\nAt the time of closure, SVB was the 16th largest U.S. bank and Signature Bank the 29th largest. As of March 28, 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) estimated the cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund of resolving SVB to be $20 billion and Signature Bank, $2.5 billion.2 Subsequent to our April 2023 report, on May 1, 2023 First Republic Bank, the 14th largest U.S. bank, failed with an estimated cost of $13 billion to the Deposit Insurance Fund.\nThis statement is based on our April 2023 report. For the topics discussed today, we analyzed regulatory financial data from 2018\u20132022 on the two banks and assessed their condition relative to a peer group of banks. We also reviewed Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco (FRBSF) and FDIC examination records (including schedules, memorandums, and reports) and bank management responses to supervisory concerns for the banks (including supervisory letters and documentation of informal enforcement actions) from January 2018 through March 2023. We focused our review on supervisory activities related to the banks\u2019 liquidity and risk management. We also interviewed staff from FDIC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), and FRBSF. More detailed information on our scope and methodology can be found in our April 2023 report. Our work was performed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. \nRisky Business Weak Liquidity and Risk Management Contributed to the Recent Bank Failures\nSVB and Signature Bank experienced rapid growth and relied on less stable funding\u2014indicators of risky business strategies. Strategies along with \u2022   From December 2018 to December 2022, SVB\u2019s total assets more than tripled from $56 billion to $209 billion, and Signature Bank\u2019s more than doubled from $47 billion to $110 billion. From 2019 through 2021, the total assets of SVB and Signature Bank grew by 198 percent and 134 percent, respectively\u2014far exceeding growth for a group of 19 peer banks (33 percent growth in median total assets). \u2022   To support their rapid growth, the two banks relied on uninsured deposits, which can be an unstable source of funding because customers with uninsured deposits may be more likely to withdraw their funds during times of stress. At the end of 2021, SVB\u2019s share of uninsured deposits to total assets was 80 percent and Signature\u2019s was 82 percent\u2014approximately two times higher than for a group of peer banks.3 The two banks\u2019 reliance on uninsured deposits may indicate a long-standing concentration of risk. Additionally, SVB and Signature Bank exhibited weak liquidity and risk management.\n\u2022   SVB had exposure to interest rate risk through its investment in longer-term securities to generate yield against its deposits. According to FRBSF staff and examination documents, the bank did not effectively manage the interest rate risk of the securities or develop appropriate risk-management tools for this risk. Federal Reserve and FRBSF staff noted that SVB failed due to ineffective management of its deposits and assets. \u2022   Signature Bank had exposure to deposits from the digital assets industry. According to FDIC officials and examination documents, poor governance and risk-management practices prevented the bank from adequately managing its liquidity risk. FDIC officials noted that poor governance and unsatisfactory risk-management practices were the root cause of Signature Bank\u2019s failure.\nRegulators Did Not Escalate Supervisory Actions in Time to Mitigate Key Risks\nIn the years prior to 2023, FRBSF and FDIC identified liquidity and management risks at SVB and Signature Bank\u2014key drivers of the banks\u2019 failures. However, neither regulator\u2019s actions resulted in management sufficiently mitigating those risks. GAO\u2019s prior work identified the importance of regulators taking timely and effective actions to address underlying problems.\nAssociated with the Bank Failures\nFederal Reserve Identified Risks and Took Supervisory Actions, but Did Not Adequately Escalate Actions Prior to\nFRBSF was generally positive in its ratings of SVB from December 2018 to June 2022, rating SVB\u2019s overall condition as \u201csatisfactory.\u201d During that same period, FRBSF assigned SVB the highest available CAMELS rating for liquidity-management practices and the second-highest available rating for management practices.4 As noted earlier, deficient liquidity and management practices were factors contributing to the bank\u2019s failure. SVB\u2019s Failure Despite the overall satisfactory ratings, FRBSF noted several concerns, which were relevant to the bank\u2019s March 2023 failure. For example, in 2018 FRBSF found that despite liquidity levels appearing strong, funding sources were concentrated and might become volatile with little notice. In 2020, examiners found that stress test modeling showed the bank had ample liquidity over stressed periods but the stress tests did not provide insight into liquidity risks for stressed periods of 30 days or less. In 2018, 2019, and 2020, FRBSF also issued (or had outstanding) matters requiring attention related to risk management and liquidity.\nFRBSF staff generally accepted SVB\u2019s planned actions to correct deficiencies. Our review of examination staff\u2019s acknowledgement of SVB management responses found the staff generally agreed that SVB\u2019s planned actions were reasonably designed to remediate the underlying supervisory issues.\nSubsequent to SVB\u2019s shift into a different examination category, examiners identified additional liquidity and management deficiencies. Increases in asset levels at SVB Financial Group, the holding company for SVB, moved the entity from the Federal Reserve\u2019s Regional Banking Organization category into the Large and Foreign Banking Organization category in June 2021.5 SVB Financial Group became subject to examination under the Large Financial Institution rating system. According to Federal Reserve staff, SVB then had a larger dedicated examination team (with a specific team member covering liquidity) and was subject to more rigorous supervisory requirements.\nMore specifically, in an August 2021 review, FRBSF raised serious concerns around how the institution was managing liquidity risk. It found that liquidity risk-management practices were below supervisory expectations. It issued two matters requiring immediate attention (which reflect serious supervisory concerns) and four matters requiring attention on these issues. FRBSF described the review in its scoping memorandum as a baseline and further noted that it conducted limited supervisory work on liquidity and stress testing over the past two supervisory cycles.6\nA May 2022 target review of SVB Financial Group and SVB\u2014conducted under the Large Financial Institution rating system\u2014found that the bank\u2019s governance and risk-management practices also were below supervisory expectations. In response to these issues, FRBSF issued three matters requiring immediate attention related to risk management.\nOn June 30, 2022, FRBSF downgraded SVB\u2019s ratings. Specifically, FRBSF downgraded the bank\u2019s CAMELS composite rating from a 2 to a 3, its management component rating from a 2 to a 3, and its liquidity  component rating from a 1 to a 2. Examiners found that the bank\u2019s management and board performance needed improvement and were less than satisfactory. For example, the board did not provide effective oversight of implementation of the risk-management framework and did not hold management accountable for the root causes contributing to weaknesses in liquidity risk management and other risks.\nOn August 17, 2022, FRBSF issued a supervisory letter to SVB Financial Group and SVB on its first Large Financial Institution rating. FRBSF rated SVB Financial Group \u201cDeficient-1\u201d for governance and controls, stating its risk-management program was not effective, did not incorporate coverage for all risk categories, and did not address foundational, enterprise-level risk-management matters. FRBSF rated SVB Financial Group\u2019s liquidity as \u201cConditionally Meets Expectations.\u201d It stated that while actual and post-stress liquidity positions reflected a sufficient buffer, the firm lacked several foundational elements for liquidity risk management.\nIn the same supervisory letter, FRBSF stated its intent to initiate an informal, nonpublic enforcement action, in the form of a memorandum of understanding, with SVB Financial Group and SVB. The memorandum\u2019s provisions were focused on correcting the management and liquidity risk issues mentioned above and on holding the bank\u2019s board and executive management accountable for addressing the root causes of the deficiencies.\nFRBSF staff told us that staff started working on the memorandum of understanding after communicating the July 2022 downgrade. In addition, Federal Reserve Bank staff started working with the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s Supervision and Regulation and Legal divisions in late August 2022 to develop the memorandum. According to Federal Reserve staff, Federal Reserve Board and FRBSF staff collaborated on provisions of the memorandum, including those related to liquidity and risk management, which required senior-level review. They kept the memorandum open to allow for the completion of additional examination work by FRBSF. However, the Federal Reserve did not finalize the memorandum before SVB failed in March 2023.\nAlthough Federal Reserve staff stated that the Federal Reserve\u2019s supervisory actions compelled SVB to take steps including replacing the Board Chair, Chief Risk Officer, and Treasurer and revising its incentive compensation program to incorporate risk management as a formal assessment criteria, its supervisory actions were inadequate given the bank\u2019s known liquidity and management deficiencies. Furthermore,\nFRBSF\u2019s actions lacked urgency. For example, FRBSF did not recommend the issuance of a single enforcement action despite the bank\u2019s serious liquidity and management issues before the bank\u2019s failure.\nFDIC Identified Risks and Took Supervisory Actions, but Did Not Adequately Escalate Actions Prior to\nFDIC\u2019s ratings of Signature Bank found that the bank\u2019s overall condition was \u201csatisfactory\u201d from December 2018 to December 2021. In addition, FDIC assigned the second-highest available CAMELS rating for the bank\u2019s management practices. As noted earlier, weak management practices contributed to the bank\u2019s failure. Signature Bank\u2019s Failure Despite FDIC\u2019s overall \u201csatisfactory\u201d assessment during 2018\u20132021, FDIC took numerous supervisory actions to mitigate liquidity and management deficiencies at the bank, including downgrading Signature Bank\u2019s liquidity component from 2 to 3 during the 2019 examination cycle, meaning the bank\u2019s liquidity management practices needed improvement.\nIn its examination documents, FDIC explained that Signature Bank\u2019s practices did not correspond with the bank\u2019s complexity, risk profile, and scope of operations due to weaknesses in areas including liquidity contingency planning and internal controls. These weaknesses prevented the bank from appropriately understanding the potential effects of adverse liquidity events and emergency cash flow needs.\nFDIC also issued matters requiring board attention and supervisory recommendations related to management, liquidity, and corporate governance risks in each year before the bank\u2019s failure. For example, FDIC issued two matters requiring board attention in 2018 and one matter requiring board attention in 2019 related to bank management\u2019s handling of increasing liquidity and management risks. The matters focused on issues including the bank\u2019s adherence to its risk appetite statement and liquidity contingency planning. Many matters and recommendations carried over to later years because they were unresolved. For instance, a 2019 matter on liquidity contingency planning remained outstanding through March 2023.\nFDIC had not completed 2022 examination documents for Signature Bank at the time of its failure.

Washington, DC  20548\nComptroller General of the United States\n May 11, 2023\n The Honorable Robin Carnahan Administrator General Services Administration 1800 F Street, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20405\nPriority Open Recommendations: General Services Administration\nDear Administrator Carnahan:\nThe purpose of this letter is to provide an update on the overall status of the General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) implementation of GAO\u2019s recommendations and to call your continued personal attention to areas where open recommendations should be given high priority.1 In November 2022, we reported that on a government-wide basis, 77 percent of our recommendations made 4 years ago were implemented.2 GSA\u2019s recommendation implementation rate was 100 percent.3 As of March 2023, GSA had 26 open recommendations. Fully implementing these open recommendations could significantly improve agency operations.\nSince our June 2022 letter, GSA has implemented three of five open priority recommendations that we highlighted to your agency last year. Specifically:\n\u2022  GSA implemented two priority recommendations by assessing its prospectus process for leases and capital projects and communicating the results of the assessment, including any proposed changes that may require legislative action, to GSA\u2019s authorizing committees.4 By taking these steps, GSA identified improvements to the process while ensuring that it did not pursue actions that impeded on the committees' oversight activities.\n\u2022  GSA and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) completed a needs assessment, gap analysis, and analysis of alternatives for leasing and construction alternatives for DHS component agencies to inform DHS\u2019s National Capital Region Real Property Strategy. As a result of these analyses, the agencies are better positioned to demonstrate the justification for the remaining planned construction in the DHS headquarters consolidation project.5\nWe ask that you direct your attention to the remaining priority recommendations. We are also adding four new recommendations related to GSA\u2019s management of real and personal property and information privacy. This brings the total number of priority recommendations to six. (See the enclosure for the list of recommendations and actions needed to implement them.)\nThe six priority recommendations fall into the following three areas:\nFederal real property management: We have identified federal real property management as a high-risk issue since 2003 because of challenges related to managing the federal government\u2019s vast and diverse portfolio that costs billions of dollars annually to operate and maintain. Implementing the four recommendations in this area would improve GSA\u2019s management of real property, ensure greater accuracy in publicly available federal real property data, enhance efforts to reduce the federal government\u2019s real property inventory, and strengthen GSA\u2019s ability to make sound decisions. Two priority recommendations, for example, call for GSA to share information and lessons learned from pilots and other efforts to better manage federal real property.\nFederal personal property management: We identified one recommendation related to the management of federal \u201cpersonal property.\u201d Before purchasing personal property, which ranges from office supplies and food to precious metals, Federal Management Regulation requires executive agencies to consider whether excess property, already owned by the government, can meet their needs. In 2022, we found that such excess property was not a significant source of supply for executive agencies when obtaining personal property. Our recommendation in this area calls for GSA to assess its current efforts to promote the maximum use of excess personal property and take further actions that could increase the use of excess personal property. Implementing this recommendation could help executive agencies more consistently meet the requirement to consider excess property and save millions of taxpayer dollars.\nInformation privacy: We identified one recommendation related to protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information (PII), an element of our \u201censuring the nation\u2019s cybersecurity\u201d high risk area. Federal agencies collect and process large amounts of PII for various government programs. Accordingly, they must ensure that any PII they collect, store, or process is protected from unauthorized access, tampering, or loss. Executive branch agencies must designate a senior agency official with overall responsibility for the agency\u2019s privacy program. We found that GSA had not fully defined and documented the role of its designated privacy official. Doing so would help ensure GSA adequately protects PII from loss or exploitation. \n- -  -  -  -\nIn April 2023, we issued our biennial update to our High-Risk List. This list identifies government operations with greater vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. It also identifies the need for transformation to address economy, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges.6  One of our high-risk areas\u2014managing federal real property\u2014centers directly on GSA.\nSeveral other government-wide, high-risk areas also have direct implications for GSA and its operations. These include (1) improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations, (2) improving strategic human capital management, (3) ensuring the cybersecurity of the nation,7 and (4) managing the government-wide personnel security clearance process.\nWe urge your attention to the GSA and other government-wide, high-risk  issues as they relate to GSA. Progress on high-risk issues has been possible through the concerted actions and efforts of Congress, OMB, and the leadership and staff in agencies, including within GSA. In March 2022, we issued a report on key practices to successfully address high-risk areas, which can be a helpful resource as your agency continues to make progress to address high-risk issues.8\nIn addition to your continued attention on these issues, Congress plays a key role in providing oversight and maintaining focus on our recommendations to ensure they are implemented and produce their desired results. Legislation enacted in December 2022 included a provision for GAO to identify any additional congressional oversight actions that can help agencies implement priority recommendations and address any underlying issues relating to such implementation.9\nThere are various strategies Congress can use in addressing our recommendations, such as incorporating them into legislation. Congress can also use its budget, appropriations, and oversight processes to incentivize executive branch agencies to act on our recommendations and monitor their progress. For example, Congress can hold hearings focused on GSA\u2019s progress in implementing GAO\u2019s priority recommendations, withhold funds when appropriate, or take other actions to provide incentives for agencies to act. Moreover, Congress could follow up during the appropriations process and request periodic updates. Congress also plays a key role in addressing any underlying issues related to the implementation of these recommendations. For example, Congress could pass legislation providing an agency explicit authority to implement a recommendation or requiring an agency to take certain actions to implement a recommendation.\nCopies of this report are being sent to the Director of OMB and the appropriate congressional committees. In addition, the report will be available on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.\nI appreciate GSA\u2019s continued commitment to these important issues. If you have any questions or would like to discuss any of the issues outlined in this letter, please do not hesitate to contact me or David Trimble, Managing Director, Physical Infrastructure, at 202-512-2834 or trimbled@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. Our teams will continue to coordinate with your staff on all of the 26 open recommendations, as well as those additional recommendations in the high-risk areas for which GSA has a leading role.

GAO-14-648. Washington, D.C.: September 19, 2014.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2014\nRecommendation: The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA), after revising the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) headquarters consolidation plans, should work jointly to develop revised cost and schedule estimates for the remaining portions of the consolidation project that conform to GSA guidance and leading practices for cost and schedule estimation, including an independent evaluation of the estimates.\nActions needed: DHS and GSA agreed with this recommendation. The Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act of 2015 required DHS to submit information to congressional committees regarding the current plan. The Act required that DHS, in coordination with GSA, provide information that was consistent with what we recommended, including a comprehensive needs assessment, a costs and benefits analysis, and updated cost and schedule estimates.10\nIn March 2022, DHS\u2014with input from GSA\u2014submitted its report to congressional committees in response to the Act. In August 2022, we found that this report did not contain sufficient information on the costs and schedules of the consolidation project\u2019s components for us to perform a comprehensive cost or schedule assessment. At that time, according to GSA officials, GSA was undertaking a planning and funding reset to include detailed cost and schedule estimates for the project\u2019s components. GSA officials said they expect to provide updated cost and schedule estimates in spring 2023. Once available, we will assess the extent to which the revised estimates address our recommendation and could thereby enable sound decision making related to DHS\u2019s ongoing headquarters consolidation.\nHigh Risk Area: Managing Federal Real Property\nDirector: Christopher Currie, Homeland Security and Justice\nContact Information: curriec@gao.gov, (202) 512-8777\nActing Director: David Marroni, Physical Infrastructure\nContact Information: marronid@gao.gov, (202) 512-2834\nFederal Real Property: GSA Should Improve Accuracy, Completeness, and Usefulness of Public Data. GAO-20-135. Washington, D.C.: February 6, 2020.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2020\nRecommendation: The Administrator of GSA should coordinate with agencies to ensure that street address information in the public database is complete and correctly formatted.\nActions needed: GSA agreed with the recommendation. GSA has taken several actions along with the Federal Real Property Council to improve the quality of the street address information in the Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) public database, such as publishing a web-based geospatial validation tool to assist agencies in identifying and correcting erroneous geographic data elements. In addition, as of February 2023 GSA and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) are reviewing the agency submitted Data Quality Improvement Plan documents, as required by OMB Memorandum M-18-21 (Designation and Responsibilities of Agency Senior Real Property Officers).  We will continue to monitor their effectiveness as results become available in 2023. An effective validation tool and action plan would improve the accuracy of the street address information in the FRPP database.\nHigh Risk Area: Managing Federal Real Property\nActing Director: David Marroni, Physical Infrastructure\nContact Information: marronid@gao.gov, (202) 512-2834\nFederal Real Property: GSA Could Further Support Agencies\u2019 Post-Pandemic Planning for Office Space Use. GAO-22-105105. Washington, D.C.: September 7, 2022.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2022\nRecommendation: The Administrator of GSA should develop a plan to broadly share with federal agencies, including those that do not use GSA services, information learned from GSA\u2019s pilots and other space utilization data collection efforts.\nActions Needed: GSA agreed with this recommendation. In February 2023, GSA took several steps to broadly share information on space utilization data, including pilot programs, through updates to the GSA website and a quarterly newsletter. However, GSA does not have a process to determine whether efforts to publicize this information are reaching agencies that do not use GSA\u2019s services. In addition, because pilot programs are ongoing, GSA has not yet shared detailed information on the costs and benefits of different methods for collecting space utilization data. To fully implement this recommendation, GSA needs to develop processes and procedures to ensure all federal agencies, including those that do not typically use GSA space or portfolio-planning services, are aware of the costs and benefits of various methods and technologies for collecting space utilization data. This action could alleviate agency concerns regarding the costs of collecting such data and help agencies make post-pandemic decisions on potential changes to their real property footprints.\nHigh Risk Area: Managing Federal Real Property\nActing Director: David Marroni, Physical Infrastructure\nContact Information: marronid@gao.gov, (202) 512-2834\nFederal Real Property: GSA Should Leverage Lessons Learned from New Sale and Transfer Process. GAO-23-104815. Washington, D.C.: October 7, 2022.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2023\nRecommendation: The Administrator of GSA, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, should develop a process to collect, share, and apply lessons learned from the implementation of the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016 (FASTA) to improve the final 2024 round and future disposal efforts, including reporting any lessons learned through this process, to Congress.\nActions Needed: GSA agreed with the recommendation. In March 2023, GSA compiled an initial list of lessons learned, including a discussion of underlying assumptions, structural issues, and challenges implementing the FASTA process. While GSA officials noted continuous coordination with stakeholders throughout the FASTA process, GSA did not document its process for working with stakeholders to collect, identify, and assess these lessons learned.  As a result, the extent to which GSA solicited feedback and consulted with stakeholders to develop this initial list is unclear.\nTo fully implement this recommendation, GSA needs to develop a process to work with relevant stakeholders\u2014including the Office of Management and Budget, the Public Buildings Reform Board, and Congress\u2014to identify and implement solutions to address numerous setbacks encountered throughout the FASTA process. This action could leverage stakeholders\u2019 knowledge and experiences with FASTA to make and agree upon necessary changes for the final FASTA round, and identify useful concepts to include as part of future efforts to reduce the federal government\u2019s real property inventory.\nPotential Financial Benefit if Implemented: Millions of dollars\nHigh Risk Area: Managing Federal Real Property\nActing Director: David Marroni, Physical Infrastructure\nContact Information: marronid@gao.gov, (202) 512-2834\nFederal Personal Property Management\nFederal Personal Property: Better Internal Guidance and More Action from GSA Are Needed to Help Agencies Maximize Use of Excess. GAO-22-104626. Washington, D.C.: June 28, 2022.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2022\nRecommendation: The Administrator of GSA should assess its current efforts to promote the maximum use of excess personal property and take further actions that could increase the use of excess personal property; such actions could include promoting additional policies or methods that will help agencies implement guidance to provide assurance that excess property is considered before purchasing new.\nActions Needed:  GSA agreed with this recommendation. As of February 2023, GSA convened the first meeting of an inter-agency working group to assess how agencies acquire personal property, uncover obstacles, and recommend improvements to policies and guidance for acquisition professionals. GSA officials also said that GSA met with offices within GSA to understand how these offices promote excess personal property as the first source of supply. These actions will help inform GSA\u2019s internal action plan to address the recommendation.\nTo fully implement this recommendation, GSA needs to promote recommendations made by the working group that would help improve executive agency policies or guidance to provide assurance that excess property is considered. GSA also needs to complete internal efforts with relevant offices to identify further actions it could take to promote the maximum use of excess property. Implementing this recommendation could help executive agencies more consistently meet the requirement to consider excess property and increase the likelihood that agencies will maximize their use of excess property and save taxpayer dollars.\nPotential Financial Benefit if Implemented: Millions of dollars.\nActing Director: David Marroni, Physical Infrastructure\nContact Information: marronid@gao.gov, (202) 512-2834\nInformation Privacy\nPrivacy: Dedicated Leadership Can Improve Programs and Address Challenges. GAO-22- 105065. Washington, D.C.: September 22, 2022.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2022\nRecommendation:  The Administrator of GSA should fully define and document the role of the senior agency official for privacy or other designated privacy official in reviewing and approving system categorizations, overseeing privacy control assessments, and reviewing authorization packages.\nActions needed: GSA agreed with this recommendation. As of February 2023, GSA had not provided sufficient documentation to show that it had addressed this recommendation. To fully implement this recommendation, the agency needs to document in its policy and procedures how the senior agency official or other privacy officials approve system categorizations, oversee privacy control assessments, and review authorization packages for systems with personally identifiable information. Doing so will help GSA better ensure that privacy protections are adequately incorporated into those systems.\nHigh-risk area: Ensuring the Cybersecurity of the Nation\nDirector: Jennifer R.

{"content": "441 G St. N.W. Washington, DC  20548\nComptroller General of the United States\n May 11, 2023\n The Honorable Robin Carnahan Administrator General Services Administration 1800 F Street, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20405\nPriority Open Recommendations: General Services Administration\nDear Administrator Carnahan:\nThe purpose of this letter is to provide an update on the overall status of the General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) implementation of GAO\u2019s recommendations and to call your continued personal attention to areas where open recommendations should be given high priority.1 In November 2022, we reported that on a government-wide basis, 77 percent of our recommendations made 4 years ago were implemented.2 GSA\u2019s recommendation implementation rate was 100 percent.3 As of March 2023, GSA had 26 open recommendations. Fully implementing these open recommendations could significantly improve agency operations.\nSince our June 2022 letter, GSA has implemented three of five open priority recommendations that we highlighted to your agency last year. Specifically:\n\u2022  GSA implemented two priority recommendations by assessing its prospectus process for leases and capital projects and communicating the results of the assessment, including any proposed changes that may require legislative action, to GSA\u2019s authorizing committees.4 By taking these steps, GSA identified improvements to the process while ensuring that it did not pursue actions that impeded on the committees' oversight activities.\n\u2022  GSA and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) completed a needs assessment, gap analysis, and analysis of alternatives for leasing and construction alternatives for DHS component agencies to inform DHS\u2019s National Capital Region Real Property Strategy. As a result of these analyses, the agencies are better positioned to demonstrate the justification for the remaining planned construction in the DHS headquarters consolidation project.5\nWe ask that you direct your attention to the remaining priority recommendations. We are also adding four new recommendations related to GSA\u2019s management of real and personal property and information privacy. This brings the total number of priority recommendations to six. (See the enclosure for the list of recommendations and actions needed to implement them.)\nThe six priority recommendations fall into the following three areas:\nFederal real property management: We have identified federal real property management as a high-risk issue since 2003 because of challenges related to managing the federal government\u2019s vast and diverse portfolio that costs billions of dollars annually to operate and maintain. Implementing the four recommendations in this area would improve GSA\u2019s management of real property, ensure greater accuracy in publicly available federal real property data, enhance efforts to reduce the federal government\u2019s real property inventory, and strengthen GSA\u2019s ability to make sound decisions. Two priority recommendations, for example, call for GSA to share information and lessons learned from pilots and other efforts to better manage federal real property.\nFederal personal property management: We identified one recommendation related to the management of federal \u201cpersonal property.\u201d Before purchasing personal property, which ranges from office supplies and food to precious metals, Federal Management Regulation requires executive agencies to consider whether excess property, already owned by the government, can meet their needs. In 2022, we found that such excess property was not a significant source of supply for executive agencies when obtaining personal property. Our recommendation in this area calls for GSA to assess its current efforts to promote the maximum use of excess personal property and take further actions that could increase the use of excess personal property. Implementing this recommendation could help executive agencies more consistently meet the requirement to consider excess property and save millions of taxpayer dollars.\nInformation privacy: We identified one recommendation related to protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information (PII), an element of our \u201censuring the nation\u2019s cybersecurity\u201d high risk area. Federal agencies collect and process large amounts of PII for various government programs. Accordingly, they must ensure that any PII they collect, store, or process is protected from unauthorized access, tampering, or loss. Executive branch agencies must designate a senior agency official with overall responsibility for the agency\u2019s privacy program. We found that GSA had not fully defined and documented the role of its designated privacy official. Doing so would help ensure GSA adequately protects PII from loss or exploitation. \n- -  -  -  -\nIn April 2023, we issued our biennial update to our High-Risk List. This list identifies government operations with greater vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. It also identifies the need for transformation to address economy, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges.6  One of our high-risk areas\u2014managing federal real property\u2014centers directly on GSA.\nSeveral other government-wide, high-risk areas also have direct implications for GSA and its operations. These include (1) improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations, (2) improving strategic human capital management, (3) ensuring the cybersecurity of the nation,7 and (4) managing the government-wide personnel security clearance process.\nWe urge your attention to the GSA and other government-wide, high-risk  issues as they relate to GSA. Progress on high-risk issues has been possible through the concerted actions and efforts of Congress, OMB, and the leadership and staff in agencies, including within GSA. In March 2022, we issued a report on key practices to successfully address high-risk areas, which can be a helpful resource as your agency continues to make progress to address high-risk issues.8\nIn addition to your continued attention on these issues, Congress plays a key role in providing oversight and maintaining focus on our recommendations to ensure they are implemented and produce their desired results. Legislation enacted in December 2022 included a provision for GAO to identify any additional congressional oversight actions that can help agencies implement priority recommendations and address any underlying issues relating to such implementation.9\nThere are various strategies Congress can use in addressing our recommendations, such as incorporating them into legislation. Congress can also use its budget, appropriations, and oversight processes to incentivize executive branch agencies to act on our recommendations and monitor their progress. For example, Congress can hold hearings focused on GSA\u2019s progress in implementing GAO\u2019s priority recommendations, withhold funds when appropriate, or take other actions to provide incentives for agencies to act.

{"content": "441 G St. N.W. Washington, DC  20548\nComptroller General of the United States\n May 11, 2023\n The Honorable Robin Carnahan Administrator General Services Administration 1800 F Street, N.W. Washington, D.C. 20405\nPriority Open Recommendations: General Services Administration\nDear Administrator Carnahan:\nThe purpose of this letter is to provide an update on the overall status of the General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) implementation of GAO\u2019s recommendations and to call your continued personal attention to areas where open recommendations should be given high priority.1 In November 2022, we reported that on a government-wide basis, 77 percent of our recommendations made 4 years ago were implemented.2 GSA\u2019s recommendation implementation rate was 100 percent.3 As of March 2023, GSA had 26 open recommendations. Fully implementing these open recommendations could significantly improve agency operations.\nSince our June 2022 letter, GSA has implemented three of five open priority recommendations that we highlighted to your agency last year. Specifically:\n\u2022  GSA implemented two priority recommendations by assessing its prospectus process for leases and capital projects and communicating the results of the assessment, including any proposed changes that may require legislative action, to GSA\u2019s authorizing committees.4 By taking these steps, GSA identified improvements to the process while ensuring that it did not pursue actions that impeded on the committees' oversight activities.\n\u2022  GSA and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) completed a needs assessment, gap analysis, and analysis of alternatives for leasing and construction alternatives for DHS component agencies to inform DHS\u2019s National Capital Region Real Property Strategy. As a result of these analyses, the agencies are better positioned to demonstrate the justification for the remaining planned construction in the DHS headquarters consolidation project.5\nWe ask that you direct your attention to the remaining priority recommendations. We are also adding four new recommendations related to GSA\u2019s management of real and personal property and information privacy. This brings the total number of priority recommendations to six. (See the enclosure for the list of recommendations and actions needed to implement them.)\nThe six priority recommendations fall into the following three areas:\nFederal real property management: We have identified federal real property management as a high-risk issue since 2003 because of challenges related to managing the federal government\u2019s vast and diverse portfolio that costs billions of dollars annually to operate and maintain. Implementing the four recommendations in this area would improve GSA\u2019s management of real property, ensure greater accuracy in publicly available federal real property data, enhance efforts to reduce the federal government\u2019s real property inventory, and strengthen GSA\u2019s ability to make sound decisions. Two priority recommendations, for example, call for GSA to share information and lessons learned from pilots and other efforts to better manage federal real property.\nFederal personal property management: We identified one recommendation related to the management of federal \u201cpersonal property.\u201d Before purchasing personal property, which ranges from office supplies and food to precious metals, Federal Management Regulation requires executive agencies to consider whether excess property, already owned by the government, can meet their needs. In 2022, we found that such excess property was not a significant source of supply for executive agencies when obtaining personal property. Our recommendation in this area calls for GSA to assess its current efforts to promote the maximum use of excess personal property and take further actions that could increase the use of excess personal property. Implementing this recommendation could help executive agencies more consistently meet the requirement to consider excess property and save millions of taxpayer dollars.\nInformation privacy: We identified one recommendation related to protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information (PII), an element of our \u201censuring the nation\u2019s cybersecurity\u201d high risk area. Federal agencies collect and process large amounts of PII for various government programs. Accordingly, they must ensure that any PII they collect, store, or process is protected from unauthorized access, tampering, or loss. Executive branch agencies must designate a senior agency official with overall responsibility for the agency\u2019s privacy program. We found that GSA had not fully defined and documented the role of its designated privacy official. Doing so would help ensure GSA adequately protects PII from loss or exploitation. \n- -  -  -  -\nIn April 2023, we issued our biennial update to our High-Risk List. This list identifies government operations with greater vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement. It also identifies the need for transformation to address economy, efficiency, or effectiveness challenges.6  One of our high-risk areas\u2014managing federal real property\u2014centers directly on GSA.\nSeveral other government-wide, high-risk areas also have direct implications for GSA and its operations. These include (1) improving the management of IT acquisitions and operations, (2) improving strategic human capital management, (3) ensuring the cybersecurity of the nation,7 and (4) managing the government-wide personnel security clearance process.\nWe urge your attention to the GSA and other government-wide, high-risk  issues as they relate to GSA. Progress on high-risk issues has been possible through the concerted actions and efforts of Congress, OMB, and the leadership and staff in agencies, including within GSA. In March 2022, we issued a report on key practices to successfully address high-risk areas, which can be a helpful resource as your agency continues to make progress to address high-risk issues.8\nIn addition to your continued attention on these issues, Congress plays a key role in providing oversight and maintaining focus on our recommendations to ensure they are implemented and produce their desired results. Legislation enacted in December 2022 included a provision for GAO to identify any additional congressional oversight actions that can help agencies implement priority recommendations and address any underlying issues relating to such implementation.9\nThere are various strategies Congress can use in addressing our recommendations, such as incorporating them into legislation. Congress can also use its budget, appropriations, and oversight processes to incentivize executive branch agencies to act on our recommendations and monitor their progress. For example, Congress can hold hearings focused on GSA\u2019s progress in implementing GAO\u2019s priority recommendations, withhold funds when appropriate, or take other actions to provide incentives for agencies to act. Moreover, Congress could follow up during the appropriations process and request periodic updates. Congress also plays a key role in addressing any underlying issues related to the implementation of these recommendations. For example, Congress could pass legislation providing an agency explicit authority to implement a recommendation or requiring an agency to take certain actions to implement a recommendation.\nCopies of this report are being sent to the Director of OMB and the appropriate congressional committees. In addition, the report will be available on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.\nI appreciate GSA\u2019s continued commitment to these important issues. If you have any questions or would like to discuss any of the issues outlined in this letter, please do not hesitate to contact me or David Trimble, Managing Director, Physical Infrastructure, at 202-512-2834 or trimbled@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. Our teams will continue to coordinate with your staff on all of the 26 open recommendations, as well as those additional recommendations in the high-risk areas for which GSA has a leading role. Thank you for your attention to these matters.\nSincerely yours,\n Gene L. Dodaro Comptroller General of the United States Enclosure\n cc:   Nina M.

Shive, Chief Information Officer\nThe Honorable Shalanda Young, Director, Office of Management and Budget\nEnclosure\nPriority Open Recommendations to General Services Administration\nFederal Real Property Management\nFederal Real Property: DHS and GSA Need to Strengthen the Management of DHS Headquarters Consolidation. GAO-14-648. Washington, D.C.: September 19, 2014.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2014\nRecommendation: The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Administrator of the General Services Administration (GSA), after revising the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) headquarters consolidation plans, should work jointly to develop revised cost and schedule estimates for the remaining portions of the consolidation project that conform to GSA guidance and leading practices for cost and schedule estimation, including an independent evaluation of the estimates.\nActions needed: DHS and GSA agreed with this recommendation. The Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act of 2015 required DHS to submit information to congressional committees regarding the current plan. The Act required that DHS, in coordination with GSA, provide information that was consistent with what we recommended, including a comprehensive needs assessment, a costs and benefits analysis, and updated cost and schedule estimates.10\nIn March 2022, DHS\u2014with input from GSA\u2014submitted its report to congressional committees in response to the Act. In August 2022, we found that this report did not contain sufficient information on the costs and schedules of the consolidation project\u2019s components for us to perform a comprehensive cost or schedule assessment. At that time, according to GSA officials, GSA was undertaking a planning and funding reset to include detailed cost and schedule estimates for the project\u2019s components. GSA officials said they expect to provide updated cost and schedule estimates in spring 2023. Once available, we will assess the extent to which the revised estimates address our recommendation and could thereby enable sound decision making related to DHS\u2019s ongoing headquarters consolidation.\nHigh Risk Area: Managing Federal Real Property\nDirector: Christopher Currie, Homeland Security and Justice\nContact Information: curriec@gao.gov, (202) 512-8777\nActing Director: David Marroni, Physical Infrastructure\nContact Information: marronid@gao.gov, (202) 512-2834\nFederal Real Property: GSA Should Improve Accuracy, Completeness, and Usefulness of Public Data. GAO-20-135. Washington, D.C.: February 6, 2020.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2020\nRecommendation: The Administrator of GSA should coordinate with agencies to ensure that street address information in the public database is complete and correctly formatted.\nActions needed: GSA agreed with the recommendation. GSA has taken several actions along with the Federal Real Property Council to improve the quality of the street address information in the Federal Real Property Profile (FRPP) public database, such as publishing a web-based geospatial validation tool to assist agencies in identifying and correcting erroneous geographic data elements. In addition, as of February 2023 GSA and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) are reviewing the agency submitted Data Quality Improvement Plan documents, as required by OMB Memorandum M-18-21 (Designation and Responsibilities of Agency Senior Real Property Officers).  We will continue to monitor their effectiveness as results become available in 2023. An effective validation tool and action plan would improve the accuracy of the street address information in the FRPP database.\nHigh Risk Area: Managing Federal Real Property\nActing Director: David Marroni, Physical Infrastructure\nContact Information: marronid@gao.gov, (202) 512-2834\nFederal Real Property: GSA Could Further Support Agencies\u2019 Post-Pandemic Planning for Office Space Use. GAO-22-105105. Washington, D.C.: September 7, 2022.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2022\nRecommendation: The Administrator of GSA should develop a plan to broadly share with federal agencies, including those that do not use GSA services, information learned from GSA\u2019s pilots and other space utilization data collection efforts.\nActions Needed: GSA agreed with this recommendation. In February 2023, GSA took several steps to broadly share information on space utilization data, including pilot programs, through updates to the GSA website and a quarterly newsletter. However, GSA does not have a process to determine whether efforts to publicize this information are reaching agencies that do not use GSA\u2019s services. In addition, because pilot programs are ongoing, GSA has not yet shared detailed information on the costs and benefits of different methods for collecting space utilization data. To fully implement this recommendation, GSA needs to develop processes and procedures to ensure all federal agencies, including those that do not typically use GSA space or portfolio-planning services, are aware of the costs and benefits of various methods and technologies for collecting space utilization data. This action could alleviate agency concerns regarding the costs of collecting such data and help agencies make post-pandemic decisions on potential changes to their real property footprints.\nHigh Risk Area: Managing Federal Real Property\nActing Director: David Marroni, Physical Infrastructure\nContact Information: marronid@gao.gov, (202) 512-2834\nFederal Real Property: GSA Should Leverage Lessons Learned from New Sale and Transfer Process. GAO-23-104815. Washington, D.C.: October 7, 2022.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2023\nRecommendation: The Administrator of GSA, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, should develop a process to collect, share, and apply lessons learned from the implementation of the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act of 2016 (FASTA) to improve the final 2024 round and future disposal efforts, including reporting any lessons learned through this process, to Congress.\nActions Needed: GSA agreed with the recommendation. In March 2023, GSA compiled an initial list of lessons learned, including a discussion of underlying assumptions, structural issues, and challenges implementing the FASTA process. While GSA officials noted continuous coordination with stakeholders throughout the FASTA process, GSA did not document its process for working with stakeholders to collect, identify, and assess these lessons learned.  As a result, the extent to which GSA solicited feedback and consulted with stakeholders to develop this initial list is unclear.\nTo fully implement this recommendation, GSA needs to develop a process to work with relevant stakeholders\u2014including the Office of Management and Budget, the Public Buildings Reform Board, and Congress\u2014to identify and implement solutions to address numerous setbacks encountered throughout the FASTA process. This action could leverage stakeholders\u2019 knowledge and experiences with FASTA to make and agree upon necessary changes for the final FASTA round, and identify useful concepts to include as part of future efforts to reduce the federal government\u2019s real property inventory.\nPotential Financial Benefit if Implemented: Millions of dollars\nHigh Risk Area: Managing Federal Real Property\nActing Director: David Marroni, Physical Infrastructure\nContact Information: marronid@gao.gov, (202) 512-2834\nFederal Personal Property Management\nFederal Personal Property: Better Internal Guidance and More Action from GSA Are Needed to Help Agencies Maximize Use of Excess. GAO-22-104626. Washington, D.C.: June 28, 2022.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2022\nRecommendation: The Administrator of GSA should assess its current efforts to promote the maximum use of excess personal property and take further actions that could increase the use of excess personal property; such actions could include promoting additional policies or methods that will help agencies implement guidance to provide assurance that excess property is considered before purchasing new.\nActions Needed:  GSA agreed with this recommendation. As of February 2023, GSA convened the first meeting of an inter-agency working group to assess how agencies acquire personal property, uncover obstacles, and recommend improvements to policies and guidance for acquisition professionals. GSA officials also said that GSA met with offices within GSA to understand how these offices promote excess personal property as the first source of supply. These actions will help inform GSA\u2019s internal action plan to address the recommendation.\nTo fully implement this recommendation, GSA needs to promote recommendations made by the working group that would help improve executive agency policies or guidance to provide assurance that excess property is considered. GSA also needs to complete internal efforts with relevant offices to identify further actions it could take to promote the maximum use of excess property. Implementing this recommendation could help executive agencies more consistently meet the requirement to consider excess property and increase the likelihood that agencies will maximize their use of excess property and save taxpayer dollars.\nPotential Financial Benefit if Implemented: Millions of dollars.\nActing Director: David Marroni, Physical Infrastructure\nContact Information: marronid@gao.gov, (202) 512-2834\nInformation Privacy\nPrivacy: Dedicated Leadership Can Improve Programs and Address Challenges. GAO-22- 105065. Washington, D.C.: September 22, 2022.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2022\nRecommendation:  The Administrator of GSA should fully define and document the role of the senior agency official for privacy or other designated privacy official in reviewing and approving system categorizations, overseeing privacy control assessments, and reviewing authorization packages.\nActions needed: GSA agreed with this recommendation. As of February 2023, GSA had not provided sufficient documentation to show that it had addressed this recommendation. To fully implement this recommendation, the agency needs to document in its policy and procedures how the senior agency official or other privacy officials approve system categorizations, oversee privacy control assessments, and review authorization packages for systems with personally identifiable information. Doing so will help GSA better ensure that privacy protections are adequately incorporated into those systems.\nHigh-risk area: Ensuring the Cybersecurity of the Nation\nDirector: Jennifer R.

This action could leverage stakeholders\u2019 knowledge and experiences with FASTA to make and agree upon necessary changes for the final FASTA round, and identify useful concepts to include as part of future efforts to reduce the federal government\u2019s real property inventory.\nPotential Financial Benefit if Implemented: Millions of dollars\nHigh Risk Area: Managing Federal Real Property\nActing Director: David Marroni, Physical Infrastructure\nContact Information: marronid@gao.gov, (202) 512-2834\nFederal Personal Property Management\nFederal Personal Property: Better Internal Guidance and More Action from GSA Are Needed to Help Agencies Maximize Use of Excess. GAO-22-104626. Washington, D.C.: June 28, 2022.\nYear Recommendation Made: 2022\nRecommendation: The Administrator of GSA should assess its current efforts to promote the maximum use of excess personal property and take further actions that could increase the use of excess personal property; such actions could include promoting additional policies or methods that will help agencies implement guidance to provide assurance that excess property is considered before purchasing new.\nActions Needed:  GSA agreed with this recommendation. As of February 2023, GSA convened the first meeting of an inter-agency working group to assess how agencies acquire personal property, uncover obstacles, and recommend improvements to policies and guidance for acquisition professionals. GSA officials also said that GSA met with offices within GSA to understand how these offices promote excess personal property as the first source of supply. These actions will help inform GSA\u2019s internal action plan to address the recommendation.\nTo fully implement this recommendation, GSA needs to promote recommendations made by the working group that would help improve executive agency policies or guidance to provide assurance that excess property is considered. GSA also needs to complete internal efforts with relevant offices to identify further actions it could take to promote the maximum use of excess property. Implementing this recommendation could help executive agencies more consistently meet the requirement to consider excess property and increase the likelihood that agencies will maximize their use of excess property and save taxpayer dollars.\nPotential Financial Benefit if Implemented: Millions of dollars.\nActing Director: David Marroni, Physical Infrastructure\nContact Information: marronid@gao.gov, (202) 512-2834\nInformation Privacy\nPrivacy: Dedicated Leadership Can Improve Programs and Address Challenges.

As of February 2023, GSA had not provided sufficient documentation to show that it had addressed this recommendation. To fully implement this recommendation, the agency needs to document in its policy and procedures how the senior agency official or other privacy officials approve system categorizations, oversee privacy control assessments, and review authorization packages for systems with personally identifiable information.

Washington, DC  20548\nApril 18, 2023\n The Honorable Mark Takano Ranking Member Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs House of Representatives\n CYBERSECURITY: VA Needs to Address Privacy and Security Challenges\nFederal agencies, including the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), collect and process large amounts of personally identifiable information (PII) that are used for various government programs.1 The PII collected by federal agencies, along with the increasing sophistication of technology, highlights the importance of strong programs for ensuring privacy protections. Such programs are especially critical when considering recent breaches involving PII that have affected millions of people.2\nFederal agencies, including VA, rely extensively on IT to carry out their operations and deliver services to constituents. Federal systems and networks, including those of VA, are often interconnected with other internal and external systems and networks, thereby increasing risk and the means used to initiate cyberattacks. Without proper safeguards, computer systems are vulnerable to individuals and groups with malicious intent who can intrude and use their access to obtain sensitive information, commit fraud and identity theft, disrupt operations, or launch attacks against other computer systems and networks. Since 1997, GAO has designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area\u2014a designation that remains today.3\nHealth data, such as those managed by VA\u2019s electronic health record (EHR) system are essential to VA\u2019s ability to deliver health care services to about nine million veterans annually. In particular, the health care sector, including VA, uses a wide array of information systems and technologies across multiple settings, such as physician offices and hospitals. While the increasing use of health IT systems has the potential to improve health care quality, these systems can be vulnerable to the loss or unauthorized disclosure of patients\u2019 PII.\nYou asked us to review VA\u2019s privacy and security efforts. Specifically, we reviewed VA (1) privacy practices and challenges and (2) security challenges. To address both objectives, we reviewed prior reports and testimonies that described privacy and security challenges faced by federal agencies, including VA.4 In addition, we incorporated information on the department\u2019s actions in response to recommendations we made in our previous reports. More detailed information on our objectives, scope, and methodology for work can be found in the issued reports. We also reviewed relevant VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) reports on cybersecurity.5\nWe conducted this performance audit from November 2022 to April 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nBackground\nVA promotes the health, welfare, and dignity of all veterans in recognition of their service to the nation by ensuring that they receive benefits, social support, medical care, and lasting memorials. In carrying out this mission, the department operates one of the largest health care delivery systems in America, providing health care to millions of veterans and their families at more than 1,500 facilities.\nTo provide health care and other benefits to veterans and their dependents, VA relies on IT systems and networks to receive, process, and maintain sensitive data, including veterans\u2019 medical records and associated PII. VA maintains this information in a variety of systems, including in the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA), its legacy EHR system.6 For more than 30 years, VA has relied on VistA to provide EHR system capabilities and support the delivery of health care to veterans. The department has undertaken various attempts over the past two decades to modernize VistA, and we have previously reported on these efforts.7\nImplementing an effective information security program and controls is important for VA in protecting the sensitive health data and PII of veterans. In addition, vulnerabilities arising from VA\u2019s increased dependence on IT can result in the compromise of sensitive personal information, such as inappropriate use, modification, or disclosure. As a result, the corruption of data or the denial or delay of services for veterans due to compromised IT systems and electronic information can create undue hardship for veterans and their dependents.\nMoreover, the federal government, including VA, continues to face challenges in protecting privacy and sensitive data. Information security incidents, many involving PII, continue to affect federal agencies and the privacy of U.S. citizens. For example, federal agencies reported 32,511 incidents to the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in fiscal year (FY) 2021.\nFederal Law and Policy Establish Requirements for Protecting PII and Securing Federal Systems and Information\nFederal laws, along with executive branch guidance, establish agency requirements and responsibilities for ensuring the protection of PII and other sensitive personal information and ensuring privacy protections for agency programs.8 These laws and guidance include:\n\u2022  Privacy Act of 1974. The act places limitations on agencies\u2019 collection, disclosure, and use of personal information maintained in systems of records.9\n\u2022  E-Government Act of 2002. The act requires that agencies conduct, where applicable, a privacy impact assessment (PIA) for each system.10 This assessment is an analysis of how personal information is collected, stored, shared, and managed in a federal system.\n\u2022  Executive Order 13719, Establishment of the Federal Privacy Council. This 2016 executive order established the Federal Privacy Council as the principal interagency forum to improve the government privacy practices of agencies and entities acting on their behalf. Further, it directed the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue a revised policy on the role and designation of the senior agency officials for privacy (SAOP).11\n\u2022  OMB Memorandum M-16-24, Role and Designation of Senior Agency Officials for Privacy. In September 2016, OMB issued guidance to clarify and update the role of the agency SAOP. It provides details on the SAOP\u2019s responsibilities. In particular, it states that  the SAOP should have the skills, knowledge, and expertise to lead the agency\u2019s privacy program and the necessary authority to carry out privacy-related functions.12\nIn addition to laws and guidance focusing specifically on PII, agencies are subject to laws and guidance governing the protection of information and information systems, which includes implementing privacy protections. For example:\n\u2022  Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA). The act requires each agency to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program. FISMA requires agency Inspectors General to annually assess the effectiveness of the information security policies, procedures, and practices of their parent agency. Further, FISMA gives the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) responsibility for developing standards for categorizing information and information systems, security requirements for information and systems, and guidelines for detection and handling of security incidents.13\n\u2022  NIST Special Publication 800-53, Revision 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations. This document provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for systems and organizations.14 While previous revisions of this publication included a separate appendix detailing specific privacy controls, revision 5, issued in September 2020, aims to fully integrate privacy controls into the security control catalog, creating a consolidated and unified set of controls.15\nFederal Guidance Includes Key Practices for Establishing Privacy Programs\nOMB and NIST guidance include key practices for establishing programs for ensuring privacy protections for agency programs.16 Specifically, these include activities that lay the foundation for programs to develop and evaluate privacy policy, manage privacy risks, and ensure compliance with applicable privacy requirements. Based on this guidance, we previously reported on these 10 practices shown in table 1.17 \nVA Implemented Some but Not All Key Practices for Ensuring Privacy Protections\nIn September 2022, we reported that the 24 agencies addressed in the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 199018 varied in the extent to which they established policies and procedures and implemented key practices for ensuring privacy protections.19 Among our recommendations, we made four to VA to fully address these practices in their privacy policies and procedures.\nSpecifically, our September 2022 report highlighted the extent to which VA addressed 10 practices for implementing its privacy programs. For six of the 10 practices, VA had\n\u2022  established policies and procedures for developing system of records notices to identify personal data collected and how they are used; \u2022  established policies and procedures for conducting privacy impact assessments; \u2022  documented a privacy program plan; \u2022  ensured that SAOP and other privacy personnel coordinate with the department\u2019s staff responsible for information security activities; \u2022  defined roles and responsibilities for the SAOP and other privacy officials with respect to responding to privacy incidents including breaches of PII; and \u2022  developed a privacy risk management strategic plan, which discussed the department\u2019s privacy risk tolerance.\nThe department had not fully implemented four of the selected practices. VA subsequently implemented one of the four practices.\n\u2022  Coordinate with IT budget and acquisition activities. VA partially defined and documented a process for the involvement of privacy officials in reviewing budget requests. We recommended that VA establish a process for ensuring that the senior agency official for privacy, or other designated privacy official, reviews IT capital investment plans and budgetary requests, and document this process. VA concurred with our recommendation but, as of February 2023, VA had not yet fully implemented it. Until it does so, VA lacks assurance that privacy requirements and associated controls are explicitly identified and included with respect to any IT resources that will involve PII.\n\u2022  Coordinate with workforce planning activities. VA had not fully defined or documented processes for privacy workforce management. For example, VA described processes for workforce planning but did not provide documentation of the role of the SAOP or other privacy officials in those processes. We recommended that VA fully define and document a process for ensuring that the SAOP, or other designated privacy official, is involved in assessing and addressing the hiring, training, and professional development needs of the agency with respect to privacy. VA concurred with our recommendation but, as of February 2023, VA had not yet fully implemented it. Implementing our recommendation by involving the SAOP or other privacy officials can benefit VA in its ability to identify staffing needs and ensure a well-qualified workforce.\n\u2022  Authorize information systems containing PII. VA partially defined and documented the role of privacy officials in carrying out risk management steps for authorizing information systems with PII. In particular, VA noted that it had processes in place for involving privacy officials in each step, but the involvement of privacy officials was not always documented in the department\u2019s policies and procedures. We recommended that VA fully define and document the role of the SAOP, or other designated privacy official, in reviewing and approving system categorizations, overseeing privacy control assessments, and reviewing authorization packages. VA concurred with our recommendation but, as of February 2023,\nVA had not yet fully implemented it. Until VA implements the recommendation, the department\u2019s privacy program lacks assurance that privacy protections are adequately incorporated into those systems with PII.\n\u2022  Develop a privacy continuous monitoring strategy. VA had not fully developed a continuous monitoring strategy. In particular, while VA had established a strategy, it had not included all elements, such as cataloging its privacy controls. We recommended that VA ensure that its privacy continuous monitoring strategy included a catalog of privacy controls and defined the frequency at which they are to be assessed. VA concurred with our recommendation and implemented it in October 2022.\nChallenges in Implementing Privacy Programs\nPrivacy officials reported experiencing challenges in implementing their privacy programs.20 Figure 1 shows the challenges most frequently identified and the number of agencies reporting each challenge. VA identified each of these challenges as ones facing its department\u2019s privacy program.\nFigure 1: Number of 24 Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 Agencies Reporting Challenges in Implementing Privacy Programs\nVA Has Faced Challenges in Securing Its Information Systems\nCoordination with the information security program is an important practice for ensuring privacy protection. This includes taking a coordinated approach to identifying and managing privacy and security risks and complying with applicable requirements. VA OIG and GAO have highlighted security challenges that VA has faced in safeguarding its information and information systems.21 Specifically, VA OIG\u2019s FY 2021 FISMA report noted that VA faced challenges implementing components of its agency-wide information security program to meet FISMA requirements.22 The report identified continuing significant deficiencies related to access controls, configuration management controls, change management controls, and service continuity practices designed to protect mission-critical systems from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. The report included 26 recommendations for improving VA\u2019s information security program. VA concurred with 21, partially concurred with three, and did not concur with two recommendations. In addition, an OMB report to Congress summarizing FY 2021 agency cybersecurity performance noted that an independent assessment had concluded that VA\u2019s program was not effective.23\nFurther, in July 2019, we reported that the department had fully met one of the five foundational practices for establishing a cybersecurity risk management program by establishing a Cybersecurity Risk Executive.24 However, VA did not meet four other cybersecurity practices. For example, VA did not (1) include key elements in its cybersecurity risk management strategy, (2) have a policy for an agency-wide risk assessment, (3) implement a process to identify enterprise cybersecurity risks, and (4) establish coordination between its cybersecurity risk executive and enterprise risk management functions. We made four recommendations, and the department has since implemented them all.25 Nevertheless, continued attention to these security challenges is important. The provision of timely and quality health care and benefits for veterans and other eligible individuals depends, in large part, on the security functionality and effectiveness, as well as the ease of use of VA\u2019s information systems.\nAgency Comments\nWe provided a draft of this report to VA for review and comment. The department\u2019s audit liaison provided technical comments via email. We incorporated these comments as appropriate.\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and other interested parties.

VA identified each of these challenges as ones facing its department\u2019s privacy program.\nFigure 1: Number of 24 Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 Agencies Reporting Challenges in Implementing Privacy Programs\nVA Has Faced Challenges in Securing Its Information Systems\nCoordination with the information security program is an important practice for ensuring privacy protection. This includes taking a coordinated approach to identifying and managing privacy and security risks and complying with applicable requirements. VA OIG and GAO have highlighted security challenges that VA has faced in safeguarding its information and information systems.21 Specifically, VA OIG\u2019s FY 2021 FISMA report noted that VA faced challenges implementing components of its agency-wide information security program to meet FISMA requirements.22 The report identified continuing significant deficiencies related to access controls, configuration management controls, change management controls, and service continuity practices designed to protect mission-critical systems from unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction. The report included 26 recommendations for improving VA\u2019s information security program. VA concurred with 21, partially concurred with three, and did not concur with two recommendations. In addition, an OMB report to Congress summarizing FY 2021 agency cybersecurity performance noted that an independent assessment had concluded that VA\u2019s program was not effective.23\nFurther, in July 2019, we reported that the department had fully met one of the five foundational practices for establishing a cybersecurity risk management program by establishing a Cybersecurity Risk Executive.24 However, VA did not meet four other cybersecurity practices. For example, VA did not (1) include key elements in its cybersecurity risk management strategy, (2) have a policy for an agency-wide risk assessment, (3) implement a process to identify enterprise cybersecurity risks, and (4) establish coordination between its cybersecurity risk executive and enterprise risk management functions. We made four recommendations, and the department has since implemented them all.25 Nevertheless, continued attention to these security challenges is important. The provision of timely and quality health care and benefits for veterans and other eligible individuals depends, in large part, on the security functionality and effectiveness, as well as the ease of use of VA\u2019s information systems.\nAgency Comments\nWe provided a draft of this report to VA for review and comment.

Washington, DC  20548\nApril 18, 2023\n The Honorable Mark Takano Ranking Member Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs House of Representatives\n CYBERSECURITY: VA Needs to Address Privacy and Security Challenges\nFederal agencies, including the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), collect and process large amounts of personally identifiable information (PII) that are used for various government programs.1 The PII collected by federal agencies, along with the increasing sophistication of technology, highlights the importance of strong programs for ensuring privacy protections. Such programs are especially critical when considering recent breaches involving PII that have affected millions of people.2\nFederal agencies, including VA, rely extensively on IT to carry out their operations and deliver services to constituents. Federal systems and networks, including those of VA, are often interconnected with other internal and external systems and networks, thereby increasing risk and the means used to initiate cyberattacks. Without proper safeguards, computer systems are vulnerable to individuals and groups with malicious intent who can intrude and use their access to obtain sensitive information, commit fraud and identity theft, disrupt operations, or launch attacks against other computer systems and networks. Since 1997, GAO has designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area\u2014a designation that remains today.3\nHealth data, such as those managed by VA\u2019s electronic health record (EHR) system are essential to VA\u2019s ability to deliver health care services to about nine million veterans annually. In particular, the health care sector, including VA, uses a wide array of information systems and technologies across multiple settings, such as physician offices and hospitals. While the increasing use of health IT systems has the potential to improve health care quality, these systems can be vulnerable to the loss or unauthorized disclosure of patients\u2019 PII.\nYou asked us to review VA\u2019s privacy and security efforts. Specifically, we reviewed VA (1) privacy practices and challenges and (2) security challenges. To address both objectives, we reviewed prior reports and testimonies that described privacy and security challenges faced by federal agencies, including VA.4 In addition, we incorporated information on the department\u2019s actions in response to recommendations we made in our previous reports. More detailed information on our objectives, scope, and methodology for work can be found in the issued reports. We also reviewed relevant VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) reports on cybersecurity.5\nWe conducted this performance audit from November 2022 to April 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nBackground\nVA promotes the health, welfare, and dignity of all veterans in recognition of their service to the nation by ensuring that they receive benefits, social support, medical care, and lasting memorials. In carrying out this mission, the department operates one of the largest health care delivery systems in America, providing health care to millions of veterans and their families at more than 1,500 facilities.\nTo provide health care and other benefits to veterans and their dependents, VA relies on IT systems and networks to receive, process, and maintain sensitive data, including veterans\u2019 medical records and associated PII. VA maintains this information in a variety of systems, including in the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA), its legacy EHR system.6 For more than 30 years, VA has relied on VistA to provide EHR system capabilities and support the delivery of health care to veterans. The department has undertaken various attempts over the past two decades to modernize VistA, and we have previously reported on these efforts.7\nImplementing an effective information security program and controls is important for VA in protecting the sensitive health data and PII of veterans. In addition, vulnerabilities arising from VA\u2019s increased dependence on IT can result in the compromise of sensitive personal information, such as inappropriate use, modification, or disclosure. As a result, the corruption of data or the denial or delay of services for veterans due to compromised IT systems and electronic information can create undue hardship for veterans and their dependents.\nMoreover, the federal government, including VA, continues to face challenges in protecting privacy and sensitive data. Information security incidents, many involving PII, continue to affect federal agencies and the privacy of U.S. citizens. For example, federal agencies reported 32,511 incidents to the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in fiscal year (FY) 2021.\nFederal Law and Policy Establish Requirements for Protecting PII and Securing Federal Systems and Information\nFederal laws, along with executive branch guidance, establish agency requirements and responsibilities for ensuring the protection of PII and other sensitive personal information and ensuring privacy protections for agency programs.8 These laws and guidance include:\n\u2022  Privacy Act of 1974. The act places limitations on agencies\u2019 collection, disclosure, and use of personal information maintained in systems of records.9\n\u2022  E-Government Act of 2002. The act requires that agencies conduct, where applicable, a privacy impact assessment (PIA) for each system.10 This assessment is an analysis of how personal information is collected, stored, shared, and managed in a federal system.\n\u2022  Executive Order 13719, Establishment of the Federal Privacy Council. This 2016 executive order established the Federal Privacy Council as the principal interagency forum to improve the government privacy practices of agencies and entities acting on their behalf. Further, it directed the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to issue a revised policy on the role and designation of the senior agency officials for privacy (SAOP).11\n\u2022  OMB Memorandum M-16-24, Role and Designation of Senior Agency Officials for Privacy. In September 2016, OMB issued guidance to clarify and update the role of the agency SAOP. It provides details on the SAOP\u2019s responsibilities. In particular, it states that  the SAOP should have the skills, knowledge, and expertise to lead the agency\u2019s privacy program and the necessary authority to carry out privacy-related functions.12\nIn addition to laws and guidance focusing specifically on PII, agencies are subject to laws and guidance governing the protection of information and information systems, which includes implementing privacy protections. For example:\n\u2022  Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (FISMA). The act requires each agency to develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program. FISMA requires agency Inspectors General to annually assess the effectiveness of the information security policies, procedures, and practices of their parent agency. Further, FISMA gives the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) responsibility for developing standards for categorizing information and information systems, security requirements for information and systems, and guidelines for detection and handling of security incidents.13\n\u2022  NIST Special Publication 800-53, Revision 5, Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations. This document provides a catalog of security and privacy controls for systems and organizations.14 While previous revisions of this publication included a separate appendix detailing specific privacy controls, revision 5, issued in September 2020, aims to fully integrate privacy controls into the security control catalog, creating a consolidated and unified set of controls.15\nFederal Guidance Includes Key Practices for Establishing Privacy Programs\nOMB and NIST guidance include key practices for establishing programs for ensuring privacy protections for agency programs.16 Specifically, these include activities that lay the foundation for programs to develop and evaluate privacy policy, manage privacy risks, and ensure compliance with applicable privacy requirements. Based on this guidance, we previously reported on these 10 practices shown in table 1.17 \nVA Implemented Some but Not All Key Practices for Ensuring Privacy Protections\nIn September 2022, we reported that the 24 agencies addressed in the Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 199018 varied in the extent to which they established policies and procedures and implemented key practices for ensuring privacy protections.19 Among our recommendations, we made four to VA to fully address these practices in their privacy policies and procedures.\nSpecifically, our September 2022 report highlighted the extent to which VA addressed 10 practices for implementing its privacy programs. For six of the 10 practices, VA had\n\u2022  established policies and procedures for developing system of records notices to identify personal data collected and how they are used; \u2022  established policies and procedures for conducting privacy impact assessments; \u2022  documented a privacy program plan; \u2022  ensured that SAOP and other privacy personnel coordinate with the department\u2019s staff responsible for information security activities; \u2022  defined roles and responsibilities for the SAOP and other privacy officials with respect to responding to privacy incidents including breaches of PII; and \u2022  developed a privacy risk management strategic plan, which discussed the department\u2019s privacy risk tolerance.\nThe department had not fully implemented four of the selected practices. VA subsequently implemented one of the four practices.\n\u2022  Coordinate with IT budget and acquisition activities. VA partially defined and documented a process for the involvement of privacy officials in reviewing budget requests. We recommended that VA establish a process for ensuring that the senior agency official for privacy, or other designated privacy official, reviews IT capital investment plans and budgetary requests, and document this process. VA concurred with our recommendation but, as of February 2023, VA had not yet fully implemented it. Until it does so, VA lacks assurance that privacy requirements and associated controls are explicitly identified and included with respect to any IT resources that will involve PII.\n\u2022  Coordinate with workforce planning activities. VA had not fully defined or documented processes for privacy workforce management. For example, VA described processes for workforce planning but did not provide documentation of the role of the SAOP or other privacy officials in those processes. We recommended that VA fully define and document a process for ensuring that the SAOP, or other designated privacy official, is involved in assessing and addressing the hiring, training, and professional development needs of the agency with respect to privacy. VA concurred with our recommendation but, as of February 2023, VA had not yet fully implemented it. Implementing our recommendation by involving the SAOP or other privacy officials can benefit VA in its ability to identify staffing needs and ensure a well-qualified workforce.\n\u2022  Authorize information systems containing PII. VA partially defined and documented the role of privacy officials in carrying out risk management steps for authorizing information systems with PII. In particular, VA noted that it had processes in place for involving privacy officials in each step, but the involvement of privacy officials was not always documented in the department\u2019s policies and procedures. We recommended that VA fully define and document the role of the SAOP, or other designated privacy official, in reviewing and approving system categorizations, overseeing privacy control assessments, and reviewing authorization packages. VA concurred with our recommendation but, as of February 2023,\nVA had not yet fully implemented it. Until VA implements the recommendation, the department\u2019s privacy program lacks assurance that privacy protections are adequately incorporated into those systems with PII.\n\u2022  Develop a privacy continuous monitoring strategy. VA had not fully developed a continuous monitoring strategy. In particular, while VA had established a strategy, it had not included all elements, such as cataloging its privacy controls. We recommended that VA ensure that its privacy continuous monitoring strategy included a catalog of privacy controls and defined the frequency at which they are to be assessed. VA concurred with our recommendation and implemented it in October 2022.\nChallenges in Implementing Privacy Programs\nPrivacy officials reported experiencing challenges in implementing their privacy programs.20 Figure 1 shows the challenges most frequently identified and the number of agencies reporting each challenge.

The report included 26 recommendations for improving VA\u2019s information security program. VA concurred with 21, partially concurred with three, and did not concur with two recommendations. In addition, an OMB report to Congress summarizing FY 2021 agency cybersecurity performance noted that an independent assessment had concluded that VA\u2019s program was not effective.23\nFurther, in July 2019, we reported that the department had fully met one of the five foundational practices for establishing a cybersecurity risk management program by establishing a Cybersecurity Risk Executive.24 However, VA did not meet four other cybersecurity practices. For example, VA did not (1) include key elements in its cybersecurity risk management strategy, (2) have a policy for an agency-wide risk assessment, (3) implement a process to identify enterprise cybersecurity risks, and (4) establish coordination between its cybersecurity risk executive and enterprise risk management functions. We made four recommendations, and the department has since implemented them all.25 Nevertheless, continued attention to these security challenges is important. The provision of timely and quality health care and benefits for veterans and other eligible individuals depends, in large part, on the security functionality and effectiveness, as well as the ease of use of VA\u2019s information systems.\nAgency Comments\nWe provided a draft of this report to VA for review and comment.

{"content": "CYBERSECURITY HIGH-RISK SERIES: Challenges in Protecting Privacy and Sensitive Data\n Overview Federal agencies and our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures\u2014such as energy, transportation systems, communications, and financial services\u2014are dependent on technology systems to carry out fundamental operations and to process, maintain, and report vital information. The security of these systems and data is also vital to safeguarding individual privacy and protecting the nation\u2019s security, prosperity, and well-being. However, risks to these essential technology systems are increasing\u2014in particular, malicious actors are becoming more willing and capable of carrying out cyberattacks. Such attacks could result in serious harm to human safety, national security, the environment, and the economy. Agencies and critical infrastructure owners and operators must protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their systems and effectively respond to cyberattacks. We have designated information security as a government-wide high-risk area since 1997. We expanded this high-risk area in 2003 to include protection of critical cyber infrastructure. In 2015, we expanded it again to include protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information. This is the last in a series of four reports that lay out the main cybersecurity areas the federal government should urgently address. It focuses on protecting privacy and sensitive data.1 We have made 236 recommendations in public reports since 2010 in this area. About 140 of these recommendations were not implemented as of December 2022. Until these are fully implemented, federal agencies will be more limited in their ability to protect private and sensitive data entrusted to them.

In September 2022, our review of 24 agencies found that most had generally established policies and procedures for key privacy program activities. These activities included developing system-of-records notices that identify types of personal data collected, conducting privacy impact assessments, and documenting privacy program plans (see fig. 1).2 \nAgencies varied in establishing policies and procedures for coordinating privacy programs with other agency functions. Further, many agencies did not fully incorporate privacy into their risk management strategies, provide for privacy officials\u2019 input into the authorization of systems containing PII, or develop a continuous monitoring strategy for privacy. Without fully establishing these elements of their privacy programs, agencies have less assurance that they are consistently implementing privacy protections.\nFigure 1: Extent to Which 24 Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 Agencies Addressed Key Practices for Establishing a Privacy Program\nWe also reported that these 24 agencies had each designated a senior agency official for privacy. However, most of these officials did not have privacy as their primary responsibility and had numerous other duties related to managing IT and information security. Legislation establishing a dedicated, senior-level privacy official could enhance the leadership commitment needed to address privacy issues across the government. \uf0d8   We recommended that Congress consider legislation to designate a dedicated, senior-level privacy official at agencies that lacked one. We also made two recommendations to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to facilitate information sharing to help agencies address selected challenges and better implement privacy impact assessments. Finally, we made 62 recommendations to 23 of the 24 agencies we reviewed to fully implement all of the key practices for their privacy programs. Twenty out of 23 agencies, including OMB, agreed with the recommendations. However, the recommendation to Congress and 62 out of 64 recommendations to OMB and agencies had not yet been implemented as of February 2023.\nFoundation; the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; the Office of Personnel Management; the Small Business Administration; the Social Security Administration; and the U.S. Agency for International Development.\nIn December 2021, we reported that federal agencies, including DHS, had reported increasing numbers of privacy incidents that have placed sensitive information at risk of potentially serious impacts on federal operations, assets, and people. Figure 2 shows the number of privacy incidents DHS\u2019s Privacy Office reported to Congress annually from 2015 through 2019.\nFigure 2: Privacy Incidents Reported to Congress by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), 2015 through 2019\nDHS is responsible for a wide variety of functions that are critically important to maintaining the security of our nation\u2019s citizens. To carry out these functions, the department needs to collect and maintain extensive amounts of detailed and sometimes sensitive PII. In many cases, DHS leverages the capabilities and expertise of contractors to assist in its various missions and grants contractors access to PII to perform the work. Federal law and implementing policies and guidance from OMB and the National Institute of Standards and Technology require agencies to ensure that agency information, including information collected or maintained by a contractor, is adequately protected.3 DHS developed policies and procedures to meet these requirements related to the protection of PII that is collected, used, or stored by contractors. We found that the six selected DHS component agencies complied with most of DHS\u2019s policies and procedures, but gaps existed.4 For example, the U.S. Coast Guard did not demonstrate that it identified and addressed gaps in privacy compliance, and DHS\u2019s Headquarters did not administer role-based privacy training. Regarding privacy incidents, one component did not document all necessary remediation activities. Fully documenting remediation activities helps ensure that all appropriate steps have been taken to lessen potential harm that the loss, compromise, or misuse of PII could have on affected individuals. \n\uf0d8   We recommended that the selected DHS components improve their oversight of contractors' privacy protections and remediation of incidents. The seven actions included providing targeted role-based privacy training to contractors who are responsible for privacy protections and ensuring that recommendations to notify affected individuals of privacy incidents are fully documented in the incident database.

Three agencies reported using it on images of the events at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. All fourteen agencies that reported using the technology to support criminal investigations also reported using systems owned by nonfederal entities. However, only one of those 14 was aware of what nonfederal systems employees used. By having a mechanism to track what nonfederal systems employees use and assessing privacy and accuracy- related risks, agencies can better mitigate risks to themselves and the public. \uf0d8   We recommended that 13 federal agencies implement a mechanism to track what nonfederal systems with facial recognition technology employees are using, and assess the risks of using these systems.7 Twelve of the 13 agencies concurred with both recommendations directed towards them. However, 21 of the 26 recommendations had not yet been implemented as of December 2022.\nIn January 2022, we reported that the five federal financial regulators we reviewed had built more than 100 information system applications that regularly collect and use extensive amounts of PII to fulfill their regulatory missions.8 These regulators collect PII directly from individuals and financial institutions and share it with entities such as banks or service providers, contractors and other third parties, and other federal and state regulators. Regulators use the PII to conduct supervisory examinations of financial institutions and to receive and respond to complaints or inquiries from customers (see fig. 4).\nFigure 4: Collection, Use, and Sharing of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) at Selected Federal Financial Regulators\nWe reported that all five financial regulators created privacy programs that generally take steps to protect PII in accordance with key practices in federal guidance. However, four of the regulators did not fully implement key practices in other privacy protection areas. For example, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) and National Credit Union Administration did not document steps taken to minimize the collection and use of PII. We also reported that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and Federal Reserve did not establish agency-wide metrics to monitor privacy controls, and the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency had not fully tracked decisions by program officials on the selection and testing of privacy controls.9 Until these regulators take steps to mitigate these weaknesses, the PII they collect, use, and share could be at increased risk of compromise. \uf0d8   We recommended that federal financial regulators better ensure the privacy of the PII that they collect, use, and share.10 The regulators each described the steps they planned to take to implement the recommendations.

Washington, DC  20548\nMarch 28, 2023\nThe Honorable Bill Cassidy Ranking Member Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions United States Senate\nThe Honorable Virginia Foxx Chairwoman Committee on Education and the Workforce House of Representatives\nNATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD: New Protocols Aim to Prevent Errors When Swearing in Board Members\nThe National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is a federal agency in the executive branch, created to administer and enforce the National Labor Relations Act of 1935.1 NLRB is headed by a five-member Board and General Counsel. Each Board member is to be appointed in accordance with the Appointments Clause of the U.S. Constitution,2 which mandates that \u201cOfficers of the United States\u201d whose appointments are established by law be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. After the President nominates an individual to be a member of the Board, the Senate determines whether to confirm the nomination. If the Senate confirms the nomination, the President can then appoint the confirmed nominee to the position. The appointment is typically memorialized by a signed presidential commission. The President may sign the commission at any time after confirmation, at which time the appointment becomes official.3 The appointee then takes the oath of office to be sworn in as a Board member, with full authority to carry out the responsibilities of the office, for a term of five years. On July 28, 2021, a nominee to the Board was confirmed by the Senate, and on August 28, 2021, the Chairman of the NLRB administered the oath of office to swear in the nominee. On September 22, 2021, twenty-five days after the confirmed nominee was sworn in and began serving as a member of the Board, the White House informed NLRB that the President had signed the nominee\u2019s presidential commission, effectuating his appointment as a Board member. After the confirmed nominee received his signed presidential commission on\nSeptember 22, 2021, the Board Chairman re-administered the oath of office to him. Therefore, the member\u2019s term began on September 22, 2021. Between August 28, 2021, and September 22, 2021, prior to his presidential appointment, the Board member conducted some NLRB work. This has raised questions about NLRB\u2019s protocols for administering the oath of office. You asked us to review what led to NLRB administering the oath of office prior to receiving a signed presidential commission, as well as any procedures NLRB has implemented to prevent a similar error from occurring in the future. This report examines why an NLRB member was sworn in prior to receiving a signed presidential commission, and what actions NLRB has taken to ensure that such an error will not happen in the future. To address our objective, we interviewed NLRB officials and collected documentary evidence regarding: (1) NLRB\u2019s protocols for swearing in members as of August 2021; (2) the steps that resulted in the nominee being sworn in prior to receiving a signed presidential commission; and (3) actions NLRB has taken to prevent this error from occurring again, such as revising its protocols to swear in new members. Additionally, we reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance, along with prior GAO work.4\nIn a separate product, we examined the legal implications of the member\u2019s service prior to his presidential appointment (reprinted in enclosure I).5\nWe conducted the work as a performance audit from March 2022 to March 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Background\nNLRB\u2019s two primary functions are to: (1) investigate and resolve allegations of unfair labor practices by employers and unions (about 90 percent of NLRB\u2019s workload), and (2) conduct secret-ballot elections among employees to determine whether employees wish to be represented by a union (about 10 percent of NLRB\u2019s workload). The Board primarily acts as a quasi-judicial body to decide unfair labor practice and representation cases that have been appealed after a decision by an NLRB Administrative Law Judge or a Regional Director.6 The General Counsel is independent from the Board and is responsible for investigating and prosecuting unfair labor practice cases. The General Counsel also provides general legal and administrative supervision of NLRB regional and headquarters offices in the processing of unfair labor practice cases, as well as representing NLRB in court. NLRB Failed to Fully Follow Its Protocols for Administering Its Oath of Office, but Has Since Added Internal Controls to Avoid Future Mistakes\nNLRB did not fully follow the protocols it had in place to confirm that the presidential commission had been signed prior to administering the oath of office to its new member in August 2021. In May 2021, NLRB established its original protocols outlining steps for the agency to take upon the President nominating a new member to the Board. Among other steps, those protocols instructed NLRB\u2019s Director of the Office of Congressional and Public Affairs (OCPA) to coordinate with the White House to ensure that, once the Senate confirmed the Board nominee, the presidential commission would be signed as soon as possible.7 The protocols said that once the commission is signed, the nominee can be sworn in, adding that it is not necessary to have the physical document in the agency\u2019s possession, assuming that the signature is confirmed. However, the Director of OCPA did not confirm that the commission had been signed. The original protocols did not include a specific check by anyone else at NLRB to confirm that the commission had been signed. NLRB officials said that, upon learning on September 22, 2021, that the presidential commission had not previously been signed, the NLRB Chairman took several actions to address the situation. For example, the Chairman alerted all other Board members and the NLRB Inspector General of the error. Officials said the Chairman also halted cases pending before the Board, and all votes by the Board, while the Chairman investigated the situation. Additionally, the Chairman alerted the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and the House Committee on Education and Labor about the unsigned presidential commission in a letter dated October 8, 2021.8 Further, the Chairman initiated two internal reviews to determine the cause of the error. First, NLRB\u2019s Office of Special Counsel and Labor Relations conducted a personnel investigation to uncover the cause of the error. As noted above, the investigation found that the Director of OCPA failed to verify that the presidential commission had been signed prior to the administration of the oath of office to the new member, mistakenly believing it had been signed previously. Second, the Chairman instructed the Chief of Staff and the Deputy General Counsel to undertake a review of then-current procedures to identify internal controls needed to prevent a similar mistake in the future.9\nBased on that review of procedures, in December 2021, NLRB created new protocols for nominations to the Board. Among other steps, the new protocols established a committee for handling Presidential appointments requiring Senate confirmation, which NLRB refers to as the Presidential Appointment with Senate (PAS) Confirmation committee.10 The PAS committee consists of NLRB\u2019s Director of OCPA, Chief of Staff, Solicitor, Deputy General Counsel, Associate General Counsel in the Division of Legal Counsel, and the Director of Administration. NLRB officials said that NLRB chose those positions specifically to include a combination of non-career and career leadership on the PAS committee. Additionally, NLRB\u2019s new protocols establish several internal controls to ensure the presidential commission has been signed prior to swearing in a new Board member.11 Under these protocols, for example: \u2022  The Director of OCPA will notify Board nominees that they may not be sworn in until the President has signed the nominee\u2019s presidential commission. \u2022  The Director of OCPA will reach out personally to the White House point of contact about the signing of the commission. \u2022  The Director of OCPA will request that the White House email the Director of OCPA when the commission has been signed, and, if possible, provide an electronic copy of any documentation related to the signed commission. \u2022  Upon receiving email confirmation that the President has signed the nominee\u2019s presidential commission, the Director of OCPA will share the email and any related documentation with the PAS committee and the NLRB Chairman. \u2022  NLRB\u2019s Director of Administration will contact the State Department to confirm their understanding that the commission has been signed and begin the process of obtaining the formal commission. \u2022  After all of the above steps have been completed, the PAS committee will convene, in person or virtually, to ensure that all members agree that the nominee has been appointed by the President and may be sworn in by NLRB. If all members agree, then they shall email the NLRB Chairman that the nominee may be sworn in.\n\u2022  After the NLRB Chairman has been notified by the PAS committee that the nominee may be sworn in, the Director of OCPA then will consult with the nominee about scheduling the swearing-in ceremony. The Director of Administration subsequently will maintain records related to the appointment, including the presidential commission. Following each confirmation process, the new protocols state that the PAS committee will meet with the Chairman and the General Counsel to review the process with the goal of identifying and addressing areas of potential improvement. There has not been a Board nominee since the agency adopted the new protocols. As planned, the agency should follow through on its new protocols when a new nominee is put in place to ensure they work as intended.\nAgency Comments\nWe provided NLRB with an opportunity to provide comments on facts and analyses contained in this report.

Washington, DC  20548\n February 2, 2023\nChair Ranking Member Committee on Armed Services United States Senate\nThe Honorable Mike Rogers Chairman The Honorable Adam Smith Ranking Member Committee on Armed Services House of Representatives\nAdministrative Separation Boards: Air Force Should Clarify Member Qualifications Being separated from the armed forces for misconduct, unsatisfactory performance, or other reasons can have lifelong implications.1 Service members who face separation and meet certain conditions may request that an administrative separation board for enlisted personnel or a board of inquiry for officers\u2014referred to collectively in this report as administrative separation boards\u2014be convened to determine whether to uphold the recommended separation action. If a board recommends separation and the decision is upheld, the service member may receive one of three types of discharge: honorable, general (under honorable conditions), or under other than honorable conditions. 2 The type of discharge a service member receives may affect eligibility for veteran\u2019s benefits and future employment opportunities. Section 529B of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 includes a provision for us to review the use of administrative separation boards within the armed forces.3 This report assesses the extent to which the armed forces have: (1) established policies and processes for convening administrative separation boards and selecting the board president, recorder, legal advisor, and others members of these boards; and (2) processes to review cases and outcomes of administrative separation boards. To address these objectives, we reviewed and analyzed relevant laws as well as Department of Defense (DOD) and armed forces policies on active duty enlisted and officer administrative separation boards.4 We compared the armed forces policies with relevant laws and DOD policies, as appropriate, to determine similarities and if any military service (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Space Force) policy or provision of policy conflicted with law or DOD policy.5 We also reviewed these policies to determine requirements for administrative separation board review processes. We conducted interviews with armed forces officials to gather information about these policies and processes for convening administrative separation boards, selecting board members, and reviewing board cases and outcomes.6 We conducted this performance audit from April 2022 to January 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Background Administrative separation boards gather and review evidence to make recommendations regarding whether an armed force should separate (that is, discharge from service) or retain a service member. Service members who meet certain requirements are eligible for administrative separation boards, as shown in table 1. bThe Coast Guard is a service in the Department of Homeland Security. It follows administrative separation policy and procedure established by the Coast Guard pursuant to delegated authority from the Secretary of Homeland Security. cAir Force and Space Force noncommissioned officers are entitled to an enlisted administrative separation board regardless of characterization of discharge or number of years in service. Administrative separation boards recommend one of three types of discharge: honorable, general (under honorable conditions), and under other than honorable conditions. The characterization of service associated with a discharge is based on a service member\u2019s behavior and performance during a specific period of service. The types of discharge are defined below. \u2022   Honorable. This is used when the service member\u2019s service has generally met the standards of acceptable conduct and performance of duty. \u2022   General (Under Honorable Conditions). This is used when the positive aspects of a service member\u2019s conduct or performance outweigh the negative aspects of the service member\u2019s record. \u2022   Under Other than Honorable Conditions. This may be issued when the reason for separation is based on behavior that constitutes a significant departure from the conduct expected of the service member.\nThe Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Reserve Affairs is responsible for developing guidance for administrative separation boards. The Secretaries of the military departments are responsible for developing and implementing board policies in accordance with DOD guidance. The Coast Guard is a service in the Department of Homeland Security.7 It follows administrative separation policy and procedure established by the Coast Guard pursuant to delegated authority from the Secretary of Homeland Security.\nPolicies and Processes for Convening Boards and Selecting Members Are Similar and Generally Align The armed forces have similar policies and processes for convening administrative separation boards and selecting the members of these boards. The military services\u2019 policies and processes generally align with DOD policies and relevant laws. However, provisions in the enlisted Air Force policy regarding the required qualifications for noncommissioned officer board members contain conflicting requirements, and one of these provisions is inconsistent with DOD policy.\nPolicies and Processes for Convening Administrative Separation Boards\nEach of the armed forces has established policies that specify similar processes for convening administrative separation boards. According to these policies, the process for convening boards begins when a service member receives notice in writing of a proposed separation action. The notice includes, (1) the reason(s) for the proposed separation action, (2) the least favorable discharge the service member may receive if separated, and (3) the rights of the service member.8 Service members who are eligible for an administrative separation board may request to have a hearing before the board or can waive that right (see table 1 above for eligibility). If a service member requests a hearing, board members must be selected to serve on the board. \nPolicies and Processes for Selecting Administrative Separation Board Members Each of the armed forces has established policies that specify similar processes for selecting members to serve on administrative separation boards. According to armed forces policies, administrative separation boards are required to have at least three voting board members (a President and two members) and a nonvoting recorder. Additionally, Army (unless operationally unfeasible), Marine Corps, and Air Force policies require a nonvoting legal advisor be appointed to enlisted administrative separation boards. However, Navy and Coast Guard policies do not require a legal advisor for enlisted administrative separation boards; nor does Navy policy require a legal advisor for officer boards of inquiry. Most of the armed forces policies specify the required duties and qualifications each board member must have to serve on these boards (see table 2).\nForce enlisted\n\u2022   Chronicles events of   \u2022   Navy: should be a judge \u2022   Marine Corps: experienced warrant or commissioned officer, or noncommissioned officer with staff judge advocate approval.

According to these officials, some board members are selected on a case-by-case basis, while others serve on a standing board for a given period of time. Officials from the following armed forces provided examples of their respective processes:9\nArmy\n\u2022   Many installations have standing administrative separation boards. Primary and alternate board members are selected to serve, as needed, for approximately 3 to 6 months, but the composition changes so that the same members are not on the same boards every time.\nNavy\n\u2022  Enlisted administrative separation boards are routinely conducted at sea because carriers have a large number of officers and senior enlisted personnel onboard that are selected to serve as board members. \u2022  Except for child and/or spouse abuse cases, the recorder selected to serve on enlisted administrative separation boards does not have to be a judge advocate. Though the position is often filled by a judge advocate, a civilian trained in law, a legal officer who went to legal officer school, a paralegal, or a legal intern can also fill the position. However, officials stated that the recorder for boards of inquiry must be a judge advocate.\n\u2022   The legal advisor, who is a judge advocate, is usually appointed to an enlisted administrative separation board. Legal advisors often do not attend the board hearing and generally only become involved if there is a dispute on the rules of the board, evidence, or challenges to board members. \u2022   A Navy region is conducting a pilot program for officer boards of inquiry in which standing members are appointed to serve, as needed, for approximately 3 months.\nMarine Corps \u2022  Board members for administrative separation boards are appointed by commanders on a case-by-case basis.\nAir Force\n\u2022  Voting board members (President and two members) at installations are generally selected from a list of qualified individuals developed by their legal office. The staff judge advocate at the installation recommends the nonvoting board members (recorder and legal advisor) who are required to be judge advocates.\nCoast Guard \u2022  For enlisted administrative separations conducted at the Coast Guard\u2019s Personnel Service Center, Coast Guard leaders nominate officers and senior enlisted members to serve on these boards. The nominated members complete a questionnaire and the responses are used to select the board members. However, field commands conducting  enlisted administrative separation boards may use a different process for selecting board members. \u2022  All officer boards of inquiry convene at the Coast Guard\u2019s Personnel Service Center. An official at the Center identifies the three voting board members (President and two members) and contacts them to check their qualifications and availability for a certain date.\nAir Force Policy for Noncommissioned Officer Board Member Qualifications Conflict and One Provision Is Inconsistent with DOD Policy\nWhile the policies of the military services generally align with DOD policies and relevant laws, provisions in the Air Force\u2019s policy pertaining to qualifications of noncommissioned officer board members for enlisted separation boards contain conflicting requirements. Additionally, one of these requirements is inconsistent with DOD policy.\nDOD policy requires that a noncommissioned officer who is appointed to serve as a voting member on an enlisted administrative separation board be an E-7 or higher.10 However, Air Force policy in a Department of the Air Force instruction includes conflicting information about the grade requirements for voting members on these boards.11 Specifically, one provision of the policy specifies that noncommissioned officers (which would include E-5 and above) may serve in this capacity, while another states that only senior noncommissioned officers (E-7 and above) may serve. In describing the composition of the board, the instruction states that on the written request of the [service member], \u201cnoncommissioned officers\u201d may serve as board members, but they must outrank the service member. In the same instruction, the table describing the qualifications of the board members states that \u201c[o]nly senior noncommissioned officers\u201d who are senior in rank to the service member can serve on the board. The Secretaries of the military departments are responsible for developing and maintaining policies, standards, and procedures in accordance with DOD policy to provide clear guidance and to ensure the uniform implementation of enlisted administrative separation board policy.12\nAir Force officials told us that the two provisions taken together identify the requirements of voting members to be senior noncommissioned officers (E-7 or higher) and that this is consistent with DOD policy. Officials suggested that the current disconnect in the instruction may have been an oversight made when trying to further clarify this information during the instruction\u2019s most recent revision. Air Force officials acknowledged that the conflicting provisions are confusing. Officials stated that there is a possibility that practitioners might follow the incorrect provision that seemingly allows noncommissioned officers below the rank of E-7 to be appointed to enlisted boards. Officials also stated that appointing noncommissioned officers below the rank of E-7 could lead to a board decision being overturned. However, they added that they believe there are sufficient checks and balances to prevent this from happening.\nAir Force officials told us that they are discussing potential changes to their policy to clarify the conflicting provision. However, officials stated that they are unsure when these changes will be completed. Until the Air Force clarifies the conflicting grade requirements for voting members on enlisted separation boards throughout the policy, the Air Force risks having board results  overturned if voting members are not appointed in a manner that is consistent with the grade requirements specified in DOD policy.\nThe Armed Forces Review Board Cases Before and After Separation The armed forces have processes to review administrative separation board cases and outcomes.13 Specifically, armed forces policies that govern administrative separation boards outline requirements for legal reviews. All of the armed forces officials we interviewed told us they conduct legal reviews of administrative separation board cases to ensure these comply with due process requirements and applicable policies, and are free from errors. According to these officials, they also examine issues raised by the service member\u2019s counsel as part of their legal review. As an example, Army officials told us a service member\u2019s counsel may identity deficiencies in the board\u2019s process. If reviewing officials identify a deficiency, they review the case files for errors, among other things. If they find a substantial error, Army officials stated that they would reject the board\u2019s decision and redo the administrative separation board process. After a service member has been discharged, the service member can also request a review of the decision. There are three types of post-separation review boards. Among other things, these boards provide service members opportunities to request a change to their discharge or characterization of service (see table 3). According to DOD officials, these boards provide another layer of due diligence in the administrative separations process.\nArmed Forcesa of Military/Naval discharge and consider of service and/or reason for discharge, based on standards of propriety or equity. other things). discovering error or of justice).\nAgency Comments We provided a draft of this report to DOD and the Department of Homeland (DHS) for review and comment.

Washington, DC  20548\n February 2, 2023\nChair Ranking Member Committee on Armed Services United States Senate\nThe Honorable Mike Rogers Chairman The Honorable Adam Smith Ranking Member Committee on Armed Services House of Representatives\nAdministrative Separation Boards: Air Force Should Clarify Member Qualifications Being separated from the armed forces for misconduct, unsatisfactory performance, or other reasons can have lifelong implications.1 Service members who face separation and meet certain conditions may request that an administrative separation board for enlisted personnel or a board of inquiry for officers\u2014referred to collectively in this report as administrative separation boards\u2014be convened to determine whether to uphold the recommended separation action. If a board recommends separation and the decision is upheld, the service member may receive one of three types of discharge: honorable, general (under honorable conditions), or under other than honorable conditions. 2 The type of discharge a service member receives may affect eligibility for veteran\u2019s benefits and future employment opportunities. Section 529B of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 includes a provision for us to review the use of administrative separation boards within the armed forces.3 This report assesses the extent to which the armed forces have: (1) established policies and processes for convening administrative separation boards and selecting the board president, recorder, legal advisor, and others members of these boards; and (2) processes to review cases and outcomes of administrative separation boards. To address these objectives, we reviewed and analyzed relevant laws as well as Department of Defense (DOD) and armed forces policies on active duty enlisted and officer administrative separation boards.4 We compared the armed forces policies with relevant laws and DOD policies, as appropriate, to determine similarities and if any military service (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Space Force) policy or provision of policy conflicted with law or DOD policy.5 We also reviewed these policies to determine requirements for administrative separation board review processes. We conducted interviews with armed forces officials to gather information about these policies and processes for convening administrative separation boards, selecting board members, and reviewing board cases and outcomes.6 We conducted this performance audit from April 2022 to January 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Background Administrative separation boards gather and review evidence to make recommendations regarding whether an armed force should separate (that is, discharge from service) or retain a service member. Service members who meet certain requirements are eligible for administrative separation boards, as shown in table 1. bThe Coast Guard is a service in the Department of Homeland Security. It follows administrative separation policy and procedure established by the Coast Guard pursuant to delegated authority from the Secretary of Homeland Security. cAir Force and Space Force noncommissioned officers are entitled to an enlisted administrative separation board regardless of characterization of discharge or number of years in service. Administrative separation boards recommend one of three types of discharge: honorable, general (under honorable conditions), and under other than honorable conditions. The characterization of service associated with a discharge is based on a service member\u2019s behavior and performance during a specific period of service. The types of discharge are defined below. \u2022   Honorable. This is used when the service member\u2019s service has generally met the standards of acceptable conduct and performance of duty. \u2022   General (Under Honorable Conditions). This is used when the positive aspects of a service member\u2019s conduct or performance outweigh the negative aspects of the service member\u2019s record. \u2022   Under Other than Honorable Conditions. This may be issued when the reason for separation is based on behavior that constitutes a significant departure from the conduct expected of the service member.\nThe Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Reserve Affairs is responsible for developing guidance for administrative separation boards. The Secretaries of the military departments are responsible for developing and implementing board policies in accordance with DOD guidance. The Coast Guard is a service in the Department of Homeland Security.7 It follows administrative separation policy and procedure established by the Coast Guard pursuant to delegated authority from the Secretary of Homeland Security.\nPolicies and Processes for Convening Boards and Selecting Members Are Similar and Generally Align The armed forces have similar policies and processes for convening administrative separation boards and selecting the members of these boards. The military services\u2019 policies and processes generally align with DOD policies and relevant laws. However, provisions in the enlisted Air Force policy regarding the required qualifications for noncommissioned officer board members contain conflicting requirements, and one of these provisions is inconsistent with DOD policy.\nPolicies and Processes for Convening Administrative Separation Boards\nEach of the armed forces has established policies that specify similar processes for convening administrative separation boards. According to these policies, the process for convening boards begins when a service member receives notice in writing of a proposed separation action. The notice includes, (1) the reason(s) for the proposed separation action, (2) the least favorable discharge the service member may receive if separated, and (3) the rights of the service member.8 Service members who are eligible for an administrative separation board may request to have a hearing before the board or can waive that right (see table 1 above for eligibility). If a service member requests a hearing, board members must be selected to serve on the board. \nPolicies and Processes for Selecting Administrative Separation Board Members Each of the armed forces has established policies that specify similar processes for selecting members to serve on administrative separation boards. According to armed forces policies, administrative separation boards are required to have at least three voting board members (a President and two members) and a nonvoting recorder. Additionally, Army (unless operationally unfeasible), Marine Corps, and Air Force policies require a nonvoting legal advisor be appointed to enlisted administrative separation boards. However, Navy and Coast Guard policies do not require a legal advisor for enlisted administrative separation boards; nor does Navy policy require a legal advisor for officer boards of inquiry. Most of the armed forces policies specify the required duties and qualifications each board member must have to serve on these boards (see table 2).\nForce enlisted\n\u2022   Chronicles events of   \u2022   Navy: should be a judge \u2022   Marine Corps: experienced warrant or commissioned officer, or noncommissioned officer with staff judge advocate approval.

According to these officials, some board members are selected on a case-by-case basis, while others serve on a standing board for a given period of time. Officials from the following armed forces provided examples of their respective processes:9\nArmy\n\u2022   Many installations have standing administrative separation boards. Primary and alternate board members are selected to serve, as needed, for approximately 3 to 6 months, but the composition changes so that the same members are not on the same boards every time.\nNavy\n\u2022  Enlisted administrative separation boards are routinely conducted at sea because carriers have a large number of officers and senior enlisted personnel onboard that are selected to serve as board members. \u2022  Except for child and/or spouse abuse cases, the recorder selected to serve on enlisted administrative separation boards does not have to be a judge advocate. Though the position is often filled by a judge advocate, a civilian trained in law, a legal officer who went to legal officer school, a paralegal, or a legal intern can also fill the position. However, officials stated that the recorder for boards of inquiry must be a judge advocate.\n\u2022   The legal advisor, who is a judge advocate, is usually appointed to an enlisted administrative separation board. Legal advisors often do not attend the board hearing and generally only become involved if there is a dispute on the rules of the board, evidence, or challenges to board members. \u2022   A Navy region is conducting a pilot program for officer boards of inquiry in which standing members are appointed to serve, as needed, for approximately 3 months.\nMarine Corps \u2022  Board members for administrative separation boards are appointed by commanders on a case-by-case basis.\nAir Force\n\u2022  Voting board members (President and two members) at installations are generally selected from a list of qualified individuals developed by their legal office. The staff judge advocate at the installation recommends the nonvoting board members (recorder and legal advisor) who are required to be judge advocates.\nCoast Guard \u2022  For enlisted administrative separations conducted at the Coast Guard\u2019s Personnel Service Center, Coast Guard leaders nominate officers and senior enlisted members to serve on these boards. The nominated members complete a questionnaire and the responses are used to select the board members. However, field commands conducting  enlisted administrative separation boards may use a different process for selecting board members. \u2022  All officer boards of inquiry convene at the Coast Guard\u2019s Personnel Service Center. An official at the Center identifies the three voting board members (President and two members) and contacts them to check their qualifications and availability for a certain date.\nAir Force Policy for Noncommissioned Officer Board Member Qualifications Conflict and One Provision Is Inconsistent with DOD Policy\nWhile the policies of the military services generally align with DOD policies and relevant laws, provisions in the Air Force\u2019s policy pertaining to qualifications of noncommissioned officer board members for enlisted separation boards contain conflicting requirements. Additionally, one of these requirements is inconsistent with DOD policy.\nDOD policy requires that a noncommissioned officer who is appointed to serve as a voting member on an enlisted administrative separation board be an E-7 or higher.10 However, Air Force policy in a Department of the Air Force instruction includes conflicting information about the grade requirements for voting members on these boards.11 Specifically, one provision of the policy specifies that noncommissioned officers (which would include E-5 and above) may serve in this capacity, while another states that only senior noncommissioned officers (E-7 and above) may serve. In describing the composition of the board, the instruction states that on the written request of the [service member], \u201cnoncommissioned officers\u201d may serve as board members, but they must outrank the service member. In the same instruction, the table describing the qualifications of the board members states that \u201c[o]nly senior noncommissioned officers\u201d who are senior in rank to the service member can serve on the board. The Secretaries of the military departments are responsible for developing and maintaining policies, standards, and procedures in accordance with DOD policy to provide clear guidance and to ensure the uniform implementation of enlisted administrative separation board policy.12\nAir Force officials told us that the two provisions taken together identify the requirements of voting members to be senior noncommissioned officers (E-7 or higher) and that this is consistent with DOD policy. Officials suggested that the current disconnect in the instruction may have been an oversight made when trying to further clarify this information during the instruction\u2019s most recent revision. Air Force officials acknowledged that the conflicting provisions are confusing. Officials stated that there is a possibility that practitioners might follow the incorrect provision that seemingly allows noncommissioned officers below the rank of E-7 to be appointed to enlisted boards. Officials also stated that appointing noncommissioned officers below the rank of E-7 could lead to a board decision being overturned. However, they added that they believe there are sufficient checks and balances to prevent this from happening.\nAir Force officials told us that they are discussing potential changes to their policy to clarify the conflicting provision. However, officials stated that they are unsure when these changes will be completed. Until the Air Force clarifies the conflicting grade requirements for voting members on enlisted separation boards throughout the policy, the Air Force risks having board results  overturned if voting members are not appointed in a manner that is consistent with the grade requirements specified in DOD policy.\nThe Armed Forces Review Board Cases Before and After Separation The armed forces have processes to review administrative separation board cases and outcomes.13 Specifically, armed forces policies that govern administrative separation boards outline requirements for legal reviews. All of the armed forces officials we interviewed told us they conduct legal reviews of administrative separation board cases to ensure these comply with due process requirements and applicable policies, and are free from errors. According to these officials, they also examine issues raised by the service member\u2019s counsel as part of their legal review. As an example, Army officials told us a service member\u2019s counsel may identity deficiencies in the board\u2019s process. If reviewing officials identify a deficiency, they review the case files for errors, among other things. If they find a substantial error, Army officials stated that they would reject the board\u2019s decision and redo the administrative separation board process. After a service member has been discharged, the service member can also request a review of the decision. There are three types of post-separation review boards. Among other things, these boards provide service members opportunities to request a change to their discharge or characterization of service (see table 3). According to DOD officials, these boards provide another layer of due diligence in the administrative separations process.\nArmed Forcesa of Military/Naval discharge and consider of service and/or reason for discharge, based on standards of propriety or equity. other things). discovering error or of justice).\nAgency Comments We provided a draft of this report to DOD and the Department of Homeland (DHS) for review and comment.

To address these objectives, we reviewed and analyzed relevant laws as well as Department of Defense (DOD) and armed forces policies on active duty enlisted and officer administrative separation boards.4 We compared the armed forces policies with relevant laws and DOD policies, as appropriate, to determine similarities and if any military service (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Space Force) policy or provision of policy conflicted with law or DOD policy.5 We also reviewed these policies to determine requirements for administrative separation board review processes. We conducted interviews with armed forces officials to gather information about these policies and processes for convening administrative separation boards, selecting board members, and reviewing board cases and outcomes.6 We conducted this performance audit from April 2022 to January 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

However, provisions in the enlisted Air Force policy regarding the required qualifications for noncommissioned officer board members contain conflicting requirements, and one of these provisions is inconsistent with DOD policy.\nPolicies and Processes for Convening Administrative Separation Boards\nEach of the armed forces has established policies that specify similar processes for convening administrative separation boards. According to these policies, the process for convening boards begins when a service member receives notice in writing of a proposed separation action. The notice includes, (1) the reason(s) for the proposed separation action, (2) the least favorable discharge the service member may receive if separated, and (3) the rights of the service member.8 Service members who are eligible for an administrative separation board may request to have a hearing before the board or can waive that right (see table 1 above for eligibility). If a service member requests a hearing, board members must be selected to serve on the board. \nPolicies and Processes for Selecting Administrative Separation Board Members Each of the armed forces has established policies that specify similar processes for selecting members to serve on administrative separation boards. According to armed forces policies, administrative separation boards are required to have at least three voting board members (a President and two members) and a nonvoting recorder. Additionally, Army (unless operationally unfeasible), Marine Corps, and Air Force policies require a nonvoting legal advisor be appointed to enlisted administrative separation boards. However, Navy and Coast Guard policies do not require a legal advisor for enlisted administrative separation boards; nor does Navy policy require a legal advisor for officer boards of inquiry.

The staff judge advocate at the installation recommends the nonvoting board members (recorder and legal advisor) who are required to be judge advocates.\nCoast Guard \u2022  For enlisted administrative separations conducted at the Coast Guard\u2019s Personnel Service Center, Coast Guard leaders nominate officers and senior enlisted members to serve on these boards. The nominated members complete a questionnaire and the responses are used to select the board members. However, field commands conducting  enlisted administrative separation boards may use a different process for selecting board members. \u2022  All officer boards of inquiry convene at the Coast Guard\u2019s Personnel Service Center. An official at the Center identifies the three voting board members (President and two members) and contacts them to check their qualifications and availability for a certain date.\nAir Force Policy for Noncommissioned Officer Board Member Qualifications Conflict and One Provision Is Inconsistent with DOD Policy\nWhile the policies of the military services generally align with DOD policies and relevant laws, provisions in the Air Force\u2019s policy pertaining to qualifications of noncommissioned officer board members for enlisted separation boards contain conflicting requirements. Additionally, one of these requirements is inconsistent with DOD policy.\nDOD policy requires that a noncommissioned officer who is appointed to serve as a voting member on an enlisted administrative separation board be an E-7 or higher.10 However, Air Force policy in a Department of the Air Force instruction includes conflicting information about the grade requirements for voting members on these boards.11 Specifically, one provision of the policy specifies that noncommissioned officers (which would include E-5 and above) may serve in this capacity, while another states that only senior noncommissioned officers (E-7 and above) may serve. In describing the composition of the board, the instruction states that on the written request of the [service member], \u201cnoncommissioned officers\u201d may serve as board members, but they must outrank the service member. In the same instruction, the table describing the qualifications of the board members states that \u201c[o]nly senior noncommissioned officers\u201d who are senior in rank to the service member can serve on the board. The Secretaries of the military departments are responsible for developing and maintaining policies, standards, and procedures in accordance with DOD policy to provide clear guidance and to ensure the uniform implementation of enlisted administrative separation board policy.12\nAir Force officials told us that the two provisions taken together identify the requirements of voting members to be senior noncommissioned officers (E-7 or higher) and that this is consistent with DOD policy. Officials suggested that the current disconnect in the instruction may have been an oversight made when trying to further clarify this information during the instruction\u2019s most recent revision. Air Force officials acknowledged that the conflicting provisions are confusing. Officials stated that there is a possibility that practitioners might follow the incorrect provision that seemingly allows noncommissioned officers below the rank of E-7 to be appointed to enlisted boards. Officials also stated that appointing noncommissioned officers below the rank of E-7 could lead to a board decision being overturned. However, they added that they believe there are sufficient checks and balances to prevent this from happening.\nAir Force officials told us that they are discussing potential changes to their policy to clarify the conflicting provision. However, officials stated that they are unsure when these changes will be completed. Until the Air Force clarifies the conflicting grade requirements for voting members on enlisted separation boards throughout the policy, the Air Force risks having board results  overturned if voting members are not appointed in a manner that is consistent with the grade requirements specified in DOD policy.\nThe Armed Forces Review Board Cases Before and After Separation The armed forces have processes to review administrative separation board cases and outcomes.13 Specifically, armed forces policies that govern administrative separation boards outline requirements for legal reviews. All of the armed forces officials we interviewed told us they conduct legal reviews of administrative separation board cases to ensure these comply with due process requirements and applicable policies, and are free from errors. According to these officials, they also examine issues raised by the service member\u2019s counsel as part of their legal review. As an example, Army officials told us a service member\u2019s counsel may identity deficiencies in the board\u2019s process. If reviewing officials identify a deficiency, they review the case files for errors, among other things. If they find a substantial error, Army officials stated that they would reject the board\u2019s decision and redo the administrative separation board process. After a service member has been discharged, the service member can also request a review of the decision. There are three types of post-separation review boards. Among other things, these boards provide service members opportunities to request a change to their discharge or characterization of service (see table 3). According to DOD officials, these boards provide another layer of due diligence in the administrative separations process.\nArmed Forcesa of Military/Naval discharge and consider of service and/or reason for discharge, based on standards of propriety or equity. other things). discovering error or of justice).\nAgency Comments We provided a draft of this report to DOD and the Department of Homeland (DHS) for review and comment.

Washington, DC  20548\n February 2, 2023\nChair Ranking Member Committee on Armed Services United States Senate\nThe Honorable Mike Rogers Chairman The Honorable Adam Smith Ranking Member Committee on Armed Services House of Representatives\nAdministrative Separation Boards: Air Force Should Clarify Member Qualifications Being separated from the armed forces for misconduct, unsatisfactory performance, or other reasons can have lifelong implications.1 Service members who face separation and meet certain conditions may request that an administrative separation board for enlisted personnel or a board of inquiry for officers\u2014referred to collectively in this report as administrative separation boards\u2014be convened to determine whether to uphold the recommended separation action. If a board recommends separation and the decision is upheld, the service member may receive one of three types of discharge: honorable, general (under honorable conditions), or under other than honorable conditions. 2 The type of discharge a service member receives may affect eligibility for veteran\u2019s benefits and future employment opportunities. Section 529B of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 includes a provision for us to review the use of administrative separation boards within the armed forces.3 This report assesses the extent to which the armed forces have: (1) established policies and processes for convening administrative separation boards and selecting the board president, recorder, legal advisor, and others members of these boards; and (2) processes to review cases and outcomes of administrative separation boards. To address these objectives, we reviewed and analyzed relevant laws as well as Department of Defense (DOD) and armed forces policies on active duty enlisted and officer administrative separation boards.4 We compared the armed forces policies with relevant laws and DOD policies, as appropriate, to determine similarities and if any military service (Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, and Space Force) policy or provision of policy conflicted with law or DOD policy.5 We also reviewed these policies to determine requirements for administrative separation board review processes. We conducted interviews with armed forces officials to gather information about these policies and processes for convening administrative separation boards, selecting board members, and reviewing board cases and outcomes.6 We conducted this performance audit from April 2022 to January 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. Background Administrative separation boards gather and review evidence to make recommendations regarding whether an armed force should separate (that is, discharge from service) or retain a service member. Service members who meet certain requirements are eligible for administrative separation boards, as shown in table 1. bThe Coast Guard is a service in the Department of Homeland Security. It follows administrative separation policy and procedure established by the Coast Guard pursuant to delegated authority from the Secretary of Homeland Security. cAir Force and Space Force noncommissioned officers are entitled to an enlisted administrative separation board regardless of characterization of discharge or number of years in service. Administrative separation boards recommend one of three types of discharge: honorable, general (under honorable conditions), and under other than honorable conditions. The characterization of service associated with a discharge is based on a service member\u2019s behavior and performance during a specific period of service. The types of discharge are defined below. \u2022   Honorable. This is used when the service member\u2019s service has generally met the standards of acceptable conduct and performance of duty. \u2022   General (Under Honorable Conditions). This is used when the positive aspects of a service member\u2019s conduct or performance outweigh the negative aspects of the service member\u2019s record. \u2022   Under Other than Honorable Conditions. This may be issued when the reason for separation is based on behavior that constitutes a significant departure from the conduct expected of the service member.\nThe Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Reserve Affairs is responsible for developing guidance for administrative separation boards. The Secretaries of the military departments are responsible for developing and implementing board policies in accordance with DOD guidance. The Coast Guard is a service in the Department of Homeland Security.7 It follows administrative separation policy and procedure established by the Coast Guard pursuant to delegated authority from the Secretary of Homeland Security.\nPolicies and Processes for Convening Boards and Selecting Members Are Similar and Generally Align The armed forces have similar policies and processes for convening administrative separation boards and selecting the members of these boards. The military services\u2019 policies and processes generally align with DOD policies and relevant laws. However, provisions in the enlisted Air Force policy regarding the required qualifications for noncommissioned officer board members contain conflicting requirements, and one of these provisions is inconsistent with DOD policy.\nPolicies and Processes for Convening Administrative Separation Boards\nEach of the armed forces has established policies that specify similar processes for convening administrative separation boards. According to these policies, the process for convening boards begins when a service member receives notice in writing of a proposed separation action. The notice includes, (1) the reason(s) for the proposed separation action, (2) the least favorable discharge the service member may receive if separated, and (3) the rights of the service member.8 Service members who are eligible for an administrative separation board may request to have a hearing before the board or can waive that right (see table 1 above for eligibility). If a service member requests a hearing, board members must be selected to serve on the board. \nPolicies and Processes for Selecting Administrative Separation Board Members Each of the armed forces has established policies that specify similar processes for selecting members to serve on administrative separation boards. According to armed forces policies, administrative separation boards are required to have at least three voting board members (a President and two members) and a nonvoting recorder. Additionally, Army (unless operationally unfeasible), Marine Corps, and Air Force policies require a nonvoting legal advisor be appointed to enlisted administrative separation boards. However, Navy and Coast Guard policies do not require a legal advisor for enlisted administrative separation boards; nor does Navy policy require a legal advisor for officer boards of inquiry. Most of the armed forces policies specify the required duties and qualifications each board member must have to serve on these boards (see table 2).\nForce enlisted\n\u2022   Chronicles events of   \u2022   Navy: should be a judge \u2022   Marine Corps: experienced warrant or commissioned officer, or noncommissioned officer with staff judge advocate approval.

According to these officials, some board members are selected on a case-by-case basis, while others serve on a standing board for a given period of time. Officials from the following armed forces provided examples of their respective processes:9\nArmy\n\u2022   Many installations have standing administrative separation boards. Primary and alternate board members are selected to serve, as needed, for approximately 3 to 6 months, but the composition changes so that the same members are not on the same boards every time.\nNavy\n\u2022  Enlisted administrative separation boards are routinely conducted at sea because carriers have a large number of officers and senior enlisted personnel onboard that are selected to serve as board members. \u2022  Except for child and/or spouse abuse cases, the recorder selected to serve on enlisted administrative separation boards does not have to be a judge advocate. Though the position is often filled by a judge advocate, a civilian trained in law, a legal officer who went to legal officer school, a paralegal, or a legal intern can also fill the position. However, officials stated that the recorder for boards of inquiry must be a judge advocate.\n\u2022   The legal advisor, who is a judge advocate, is usually appointed to an enlisted administrative separation board. Legal advisors often do not attend the board hearing and generally only become involved if there is a dispute on the rules of the board, evidence, or challenges to board members. \u2022   A Navy region is conducting a pilot program for officer boards of inquiry in which standing members are appointed to serve, as needed, for approximately 3 months.\nMarine Corps \u2022  Board members for administrative separation boards are appointed by commanders on a case-by-case basis.\nAir Force\n\u2022  Voting board members (President and two members) at installations are generally selected from a list of qualified individuals developed by their legal office. The staff judge advocate at the installation recommends the nonvoting board members (recorder and legal advisor) who are required to be judge advocates.\nCoast Guard \u2022  For enlisted administrative separations conducted at the Coast Guard\u2019s Personnel Service Center, Coast Guard leaders nominate officers and senior enlisted members to serve on these boards. The nominated members complete a questionnaire and the responses are used to select the board members. However, field commands conducting  enlisted administrative separation boards may use a different process for selecting board members. \u2022  All officer boards of inquiry convene at the Coast Guard\u2019s Personnel Service Center.

Washington, DC  20548\n August 18, 2023\nThe Honorable Tammy Baldwin Chair The Honorable Shelley Moore Capitol Ranking Member Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Committee on Appropriations United States Senate\nThe Honorable Robert Aderholt Chair The Honorable Rosa DeLauro Ranking Member Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education Committee on Appropriations House of Representatives\nTrauma-Informed Care: Challenges to Developing and Implementing Performance Partnership Pilots to Serve Children\nTrauma is a widespread, harmful, and costly public health problem. Any frightening, dangerous, or violent event that threatens the life or safety of a child or their loved ones can potentially be traumatic. As we reported in 2019, trauma significantly increases the risk of problems with mental and physical health, social relationships and behavior, and school performance.1\nMany children and families affected by trauma receive services through multiple systems, such as child welfare, health care (including behavioral health care), juvenile justice, and schools. These services may include trauma-informed care, which can refer to evidence-based interventions (treatment) or a broader approach that integrates practices throughout a service delivery system (an organizational culture or paradigm shift). To ensure that youth receive trauma-informed care across systems and in a coordinated manner, communities need support to build infrastructure and capacity.\nCongress may authorize a variety of approaches to help build infrastructure and capacity. Performance partnerships are one approach. Performance partnerships allow a federal agency or multiple federal agencies to provide grant recipients flexibility in how they use funding across two or more programs, among other flexibilities. In exchange for these flexibilities, recipients commit to improve agreed-upon outcomes and assess progress towards them. Senate Report 115-150 includes a provision for us to, among other things, identify barriers or challenges faced by organizations that receive funding from multiple federal programs to serve children exposed to trauma. This report examines challenges state and local governments and other organizations might face in using performance partnership pilots to serve children exposed to trauma.\nTo address this objective, we reviewed Performance Partnership Pilots for Disconnected Youth (P3) reports and issue briefs;2 Building a Multi-System Trauma-Informed Collaborative: A Guide for Adopting a Cross-System, Trauma-Informed Approach Among Child-Serving Agencies and Their Partners;3 federal agency documents; and prior GAO reports. In addition, we interviewed a former Office of Management and Budget official who helped create and implement performance partnership pilots for disconnected youth. We also interviewed individuals who provided technical assistance to and wrote the guide about the Multi-System Trauma-Informed Collaborative, and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration officials who facilitate and coordinate the work of the federal Interagency Task Force on Trauma-Informed Care.4 Through our review of documents and interviews we identified challenges that state and local governments and other organizations may face in developing and implementing performance partnership pilots to serve children exposed to trauma.\nWe conducted this performance audit from January 2023 to August 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nOn June 29, 2023, we briefed Senate staff on the preliminary results of this study. This report formally conveys the information provided during this briefing, as summarized below (see enclosure I for the briefing slides).\n\u2022  State and local governments and other organizations may find it difficult to get partners to coalesce around performance partnership pilots to serve children exposed to trauma. According to Mathematica, trust and buy-in were key factors that influence P3 programs\u2019 use of the flexibilities afforded to them. Leadership in five of the 14 P3 programs noted that they were unable to secure enough trust and buy-in from their state and local partners to implement their planned approaches. American Institutes for Research (AIR) officials told us that states were delayed in beginning their work by about 6 months, in part, because it took time to get people engaged in the initiative.\n\u2022  State and local governments and other organizations may find it difficult to achieve their goals, including systems change, if they do not have sufficient time for planning. AIR officials told us that planning entails getting people to the table; determining infrastructure; assessing agencies\u2019 knowledge, understanding, practices, and policies; and mapping resources. AIR officials noted that if a system is not set up well and the planning process is skipped, then money for services may not be used effectively. Mathematica concluded that dedicated planning time could support accomplishing foundational work for systems change.\n\u2022  Data sharing would be central to developing and implementing performance partnership pilots and trauma-informed systems; however, several issues, such as privacy concerns, may undermine data sharing efforts. Mathematica reported that the seven pilots that planned to incorporate data sharing into their P3 approach were hampered by the lack of capabilities among existing information systems. In addition, they were hampered by the time and effort involved in getting all parties to buy in to data sharing, agencies\u2019 desire to maintain their own information systems, and confidentiality concerns. However, according to AIR officials, individuals need to share data across agencies to prevent families from having to repeatedly provide the same information to multiple agencies, which may re-traumatize children and families.\nAgency Comments\nWe provided the briefing slides to the Department of Health and Human Services for review and comment. HHS provided technical comments, which we incorporated in the report as appropriate.\nIf you and your staff have any questions, please contact Kathryn A. Larin at (202) 512-7215 or larink@gao.gov.

Larin, Director Education, Workforce, and Income Security Issues\nEnclosure-I\nTrauma-Informed Care: Challenges to Developing and Implementing Performance Partnership Pilots to Serve Children\n A Briefing to Congressional Committees June 29, 2023 Updated on August 2, 2023\n For more information, contact Kathyrn A. Larin\nAgenda\n\u2022 Objective \u2022 Background \u2022 Scope and Methodology \u2022 Findings\nObjective\n\u2022 What challenges might state and local governments and other organizations face in using federal programs to develop and implement performance partnership pilots to serve children exposed to trauma?\nBackground: Trauma \u2022 Trauma is a widespread, harmful, and costly public health problem. Any frightening, dangerous, or violent event that threatens the life or safety of a child or their loved ones can potentially be traumatic. While not every child who experiences trauma will suffer lasting effects, studies have shown that for many there are serious short- and long-term consequences. \u2022 As GAO reported in 2019, trauma significantly increases the risk of problems with mental health, social relationships and behavior, physical illness, and school performance.\nBackground: Trauma-Informed Care \u2022  Trauma-informed care can refer to either evidence-based interventions (treatment) or to a broader system-level approach that integrates practices throughout a service delivery system (an organizational culture or paradigm shift).\n\u2022  According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, trauma-informed approaches: (1) realize the widespread impact of trauma and understand potential paths for recovery; (2) recognize the signs and symptoms of trauma in clients, families, staff, and others involved with the system; (3) respond by fully integrating knowledge about trauma into policies, procedures, and practices; and (4) seek to actively resist re-traumatization.\nBackground: A Comprehensive Approach to Addressing Trauma\nBackground: Trauma-Informed Care, cont.\n\u2022  Many children and families affected by trauma receive services through multiple systems, such as child welfare, health care (including behavioral health care), juvenile justice, and schools. \u2022  Ensuring that all service delivery systems adopt a trauma-informed approach allows children, youth, and their families to build resilience and heal in environments, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. \u2022  To ensure that youth receive trauma-informed care across systems and in a coordinated manner, communities need support to build infrastructure and capacity. \u2022  Congress may authorize a variety of approaches to help build infrastructure and capacity. Performance partnerships are one approach.\nBackground: Performance Partnerships \u2022  Performance partnership initiatives allow a federal agency or multiple federal agencies to provide grant recipients flexibility in how they use funding across two or more programs along with additional flexibilities. In exchange for these flexibilities, recipients commit to improve agreed-upon outcomes and assess progress towards them. \u2022  Authorized in fiscal year 2014, Performance Partnership Pilots for Disconnected Youth (P3) allowed funding from multiple programs across multiple agencies to be combined into pilot programs serving youth who are disconnected from school and work. \u2022  The authority enabled pilot sites to blend federal funds and obtain waivers of program requirements, including requirements that are barriers to achieving improved outcomes for youth-serving programs described in the authority. \u2022  Seventeen state, local, and tribal communities have participated in P3 since Congress initially authorized it\u2014nine in FY 2014, one in FY 2015, five in FY 2016, and two in FY 2022. \u2022  To implement their approaches to serving disconnected youth, all pilots brought together partners across workforce development, education, and other domains.\nScope and Methodology To address our objective, we reviewed: Performance Partnership Pilots for Disconnected Youth (P3) reports and issue briefs \u2022 To evaluate P3, the Department of Labor, in 2015, awarded Mathematica and Social Policy Research Associates a 5- year contract. Over the course of the evaluation period, the reports document 14 of the pilots\u2019 efforts to, among other things, promote systems change at the state or community level.1 Mathematica defined systems change as changes in how partner agencies in each pilot worked together through their governance structures, communication practices, and data-sharing approaches. \nFY2016. One community withdrew from participating in P3. Scope and Methodology We also reviewed: Building a Multi-System Trauma-Informed Collaborative: A Guide for Adopting a Cross-System, Trauma-Informed Approach Among Child- Serving Agencies and Their Partners \u2022 In 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, launched the Multi-System Trauma-Informed Collaborative (MSTIC) to build the capacity of state child-serving systems to develop, coordinate, and enhance policies and practices for serving youth exposed to violence and other traumas. \u2022 The guide, developed by Chapin Hall and the American Institutes for Research (AIR), summarizes lessons learned by three state teams\u2019 cross-systems efforts\u2014Connecticut, Illinois, Washington. Federal agency documents and prior GAO reports\nScope and Methodology We conducted interviews with: \u2022   a former Office of Management and Budget (OMB) official who helped create and implement performance partnership pilots for disconnected youth, \u2022   individuals who provided training and technical assistance to and wrote the guide about MSTIC, and \u2022   Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration officials who facilitate and coordinate the work of the federal Interagency Task Force on Trauma-Informed Care.\nThrough our review of documents and interviews we identified common and unique challenges that state and local governments and other organizations may face in developing and implementing performance partnership pilots to serve children exposed to trauma.\nWe conducted this performance audit from January 2023 to August 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nFinding Buy-In from Partners May Be Difficult to Obtain\nState and local governments and other organizations may find it difficult to get partners to coalesce around performance partnership pilots to serve children exposed to trauma. \u2022  According to Mathematica, trust and buy-in were key factors that influence P3s\u2019 use of the flexibilities afforded to them. \u2022  Leadership in five of the 14 P3s noted that they were unable to secure enough trust and buy-in from their state and local partners to implement their planned approaches. \u2022  For example, respondents from one pilot reported a lack of trust among key partners that resulted in the fear of being penalized by the relevant federal agency for blending funds (combining funds into one award), which caused the pilot to braid (coordinate funds) rather than blend funds. \u2022  Chapin Hall and AIR recommend that collaboratives recruit representatives from child-serving public agencies to participate on a cross-system steering committee to support and oversee the strategic planning and implementation process. \u2022  AIR officials told us that states were delayed in beginning their work by about 6 months, in part, because it took time to get people engaged in the initiative.\nFinding Absent Time for Planning, Partners May Not Achieve Goals or Use Resources Effectively State and local governments and other organizations may find it difficult to achieve their goals, including systems change, if they do not have sufficient time for planning. \u2022  Mathematica reported that, 3 of 14 P3s made systems change activities central to their approach. These specific pilots spent years\u2014before they applied for P3\u2014building collaborations across youth-serving agencies to identify and address systems-level issues. \u2022  AIR officials told us that planning entails getting people to the table; determining infrastructure; assessing agencies\u2019 knowledge, understanding, practices, and policies; and mapping resources. AIR officials noted that if a system is not set up well and the planning process is skipped, then money for services may not be used effectively. \u2022  Mathematica concluded that dedicated planning time could support accomplishing foundational work for systems change.\nFinding Capabilities, Buy-In, and Privacy Issues May Hamper Data Sharing Data sharing would be central to developing and implementing performance partnership pilots and trauma-informed systems; however, several issues, such as privacy concerns, may undermine data sharing efforts. \u2022 Mathematica reported that the seven pilots that planned to incorporate data sharing into their P3 approach were hampered by: \u2022 lack of capabilities among existing information systems, \u2022 the time and effort involved in getting all parties to buy in to data sharing, \u2022 agencies\u2019 desire to maintain their own information systems, and \u2022 confidentiality concerns, particularly under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.\nFinding Capabilities, Buy-In, and Privacy Issues May Hamper Data Sharing, cont. \u2022 Mathematica reported that one P3 noted limited communication between system developers and direct-service providers and limited data management experience made it difficult to implement a shared data system. \u2022 Mathematica also reported that partners in one pilot expressed concerns that a shared data system might compromise trust they had built with youth. \u2022 However, according to AIR officials, individuals need to share data across agencies to prevent families from having to repeatedly provide the same information to multiple agencies, which may re-traumatize children and families.\nAdditional Challenges \u2022  Paradigm shift \u2013 GAO reported in 2019 that trauma-informed care involves a culture change and/or paradigm-shift. Trauma-informed practices must become embedded in systems. Developing and implementing a trauma- informed system requires, among other things, training employees throughout and across offices and organizations. \u2022  Leadership - According to AIR officials, to develop and implement a trauma-informed collaborative or system a leader or lead agency has to facilitate cross-agency collaboration. The leader has to have time and money. In addition, there has to be an agency that is willing to prioritize and sustain the effort. \u2022  Blending and braiding funds \u2013 According to Mathematica, pilots\u2019 understanding of the flexibilities available under P3 was important to their ability to fully use these flexibilities. Mathematica reported that leaders in four of the 14 pilots lacked a clear understanding of the difference between blending and braiding funds.\nAdditional Challenges \u2022 Increased workload \u2013 According to a former OMB official, in developing and implementing performance partnerships, officials have to operate their traditional programs while establishing a new initiative, with new people, and few dollars. The official noted that P3 did not provide state and local officials with relief from other work. \u2022 Differences in knowledge and progress \u2013 According to AIR officials,  agencies want to get something out of the collaborative effort. Agencies that are new to trauma-informed care will gain knowledge. However, they said that agencies with more experience need to gain something too. AIR officials provided training and technical assistance to state collaboratives.\nStrategic Planning and External Liaison\nStephen J.

This report examines challenges state and local governments and other organizations might face in using performance partnership pilots to serve children exposed to trauma.\nTo address this objective, we reviewed Performance Partnership Pilots for Disconnected Youth (P3) reports and issue briefs;2 Building a Multi-System Trauma-Informed Collaborative: A Guide for Adopting a Cross-System, Trauma-Informed Approach Among Child-Serving Agencies and Their Partners;3 federal agency documents; and prior GAO reports. In addition, we interviewed a former Office of Management and Budget official who helped create and implement performance partnership pilots for disconnected youth. We also interviewed individuals who provided technical assistance to and wrote the guide about the Multi-System Trauma-Informed Collaborative, and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration officials who facilitate and coordinate the work of the federal Interagency Task Force on Trauma-Informed Care.4 Through our review of documents and interviews we identified challenges that state and local governments and other organizations may face in developing and implementing performance partnership pilots to serve children exposed to trauma.\nWe conducted this performance audit from January 2023 to August 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

This report formally conveys the information provided during this briefing, as summarized below (see enclosure I for the briefing slides).\n\u2022  State and local governments and other organizations may find it difficult to get partners to coalesce around performance partnership pilots to serve children exposed to trauma. According to Mathematica, trust and buy-in were key factors that influence P3 programs\u2019 use of the flexibilities afforded to them.

Mathematica reported that the seven pilots that planned to incorporate data sharing into their P3 approach were hampered by the lack of capabilities among existing information systems. In addition, they were hampered by the time and effort involved in getting all parties to buy in to data sharing, agencies\u2019 desire to maintain their own information systems, and confidentiality concerns. However, according to AIR officials, individuals need to share data across agencies to prevent families from having to repeatedly provide the same information to multiple agencies, which may re-traumatize children and families.\nAgency Comments\nWe provided the briefing slides to the Department of Health and Human Services for review and comment.

This report formally conveys the information provided during this briefing, as summarized below (see enclosure I for the briefing slides).\n\u2022  State and local governments and other organizations may find it difficult to get partners to coalesce around performance partnership pilots to serve children exposed to trauma. According to Mathematica, trust and buy-in were key factors that influence P3 programs\u2019 use of the flexibilities afforded to them. Leadership in five of the 14 P3 programs noted that they were unable to secure enough trust and buy-in from their state and local partners to implement their planned approaches. American Institutes for Research (AIR) officials told us that states were delayed in beginning their work by about 6 months, in part, because it took time to get people engaged in the initiative.\n\u2022  State and local governments and other organizations may find it difficult to achieve their goals, including systems change, if they do not have sufficient time for planning. AIR officials told us that planning entails getting people to the table; determining infrastructure; assessing agencies\u2019 knowledge, understanding, practices, and policies; and mapping resources. AIR officials noted that if a system is not set up well and the planning process is skipped, then money for services may not be used effectively. Mathematica concluded that dedicated planning time could support accomplishing foundational work for systems change.\n\u2022  Data sharing would be central to developing and implementing performance partnership pilots and trauma-informed systems; however, several issues, such as privacy concerns, may undermine data sharing efforts. Mathematica reported that the seven pilots that planned to incorporate data sharing into their P3 approach were hampered by the lack of capabilities among existing information systems. In addition, they were hampered by the time and effort involved in getting all parties to buy in to data sharing, agencies\u2019 desire to maintain their own information systems, and confidentiality concerns. However, according to AIR officials, individuals need to share data across agencies to prevent families from having to repeatedly provide the same information to multiple agencies, which may re-traumatize children and families.\nAgency Comments\nWe provided the briefing slides to the Department of Health and Human Services for review and comment. HHS provided technical comments, which we incorporated in the report as appropriate.\nIf you and your staff have any questions, please contact Kathryn A. Larin at (202) 512-7215 or larink@gao.gov.

Larin\nAgenda\n\u2022 Objective \u2022 Background \u2022 Scope and Methodology \u2022 Findings\nObjective\n\u2022 What challenges might state and local governments and other organizations face in using federal programs to develop and implement performance partnership pilots to serve children exposed to trauma?\nBackground: Trauma \u2022 Trauma is a widespread, harmful, and costly public health problem. Any frightening, dangerous, or violent event that threatens the life or safety of a child or their loved ones can potentially be traumatic. While not every child who experiences trauma will suffer lasting effects, studies have shown that for many there are serious short- and long-term consequences. \u2022 As GAO reported in 2019, trauma significantly increases the risk of problems with mental health, social relationships and behavior, physical illness, and school performance.\nBackground: Trauma-Informed Care \u2022  Trauma-informed care can refer to either evidence-based interventions (treatment) or to a broader system-level approach that integrates practices throughout a service delivery system (an organizational culture or paradigm shift).\n\u2022  According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, trauma-informed approaches: (1) realize the widespread impact of trauma and understand potential paths for recovery; (2) recognize the signs and symptoms of trauma in clients, families, staff, and others involved with the system; (3) respond by fully integrating knowledge about trauma into policies, procedures, and practices; and (4) seek to actively resist re-traumatization.\nBackground: A Comprehensive Approach to Addressing Trauma\nBackground: Trauma-Informed Care, cont.\n\u2022  Many children and families affected by trauma receive services through multiple systems, such as child welfare, health care (including behavioral health care), juvenile justice, and schools. \u2022  Ensuring that all service delivery systems adopt a trauma-informed approach allows children, youth, and their families to build resilience and heal in environments, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. \u2022  To ensure that youth receive trauma-informed care across systems and in a coordinated manner, communities need support to build infrastructure and capacity. \u2022  Congress may authorize a variety of approaches to help build infrastructure and capacity. Performance partnerships are one approach.\nBackground: Performance Partnerships \u2022  Performance partnership initiatives allow a federal agency or multiple federal agencies to provide grant recipients flexibility in how they use funding across two or more programs along with additional flexibilities. In exchange for these flexibilities, recipients commit to improve agreed-upon outcomes and assess progress towards them. \u2022  Authorized in fiscal year 2014, Performance Partnership Pilots for Disconnected Youth (P3) allowed funding from multiple programs across multiple agencies to be combined into pilot programs serving youth who are disconnected from school and work. \u2022  The authority enabled pilot sites to blend federal funds and obtain waivers of program requirements, including requirements that are barriers to achieving improved outcomes for youth-serving programs described in the authority. \u2022  Seventeen state, local, and tribal communities have participated in P3 since Congress initially authorized it\u2014nine in FY 2014, one in FY 2015, five in FY 2016, and two in FY 2022. \u2022  To implement their approaches to serving disconnected youth, all pilots brought together partners across workforce development, education, and other domains.\nScope and Methodology To address our objective, we reviewed: Performance Partnership Pilots for Disconnected Youth (P3) reports and issue briefs \u2022 To evaluate P3, the Department of Labor, in 2015, awarded Mathematica and Social Policy Research Associates a 5- year contract. Over the course of the evaluation period, the reports document 14 of the pilots\u2019 efforts to, among other things, promote systems change at the state or community level.1 Mathematica defined systems change as changes in how partner agencies in each pilot worked together through their governance structures, communication practices, and data-sharing approaches. \nFY2016. One community withdrew from participating in P3. Scope and Methodology We also reviewed: Building a Multi-System Trauma-Informed Collaborative: A Guide for Adopting a Cross-System, Trauma-Informed Approach Among Child- Serving Agencies and Their Partners \u2022 In 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, launched the Multi-System Trauma-Informed Collaborative (MSTIC) to build the capacity of state child-serving systems to develop, coordinate, and enhance policies and practices for serving youth exposed to violence and other traumas. \u2022 The guide, developed by Chapin Hall and the American Institutes for Research (AIR), summarizes lessons learned by three state teams\u2019 cross-systems efforts\u2014Connecticut, Illinois, Washington. Federal agency documents and prior GAO reports\nScope and Methodology We conducted interviews with: \u2022   a former Office of Management and Budget (OMB) official who helped create and implement performance partnership pilots for disconnected youth, \u2022   individuals who provided training and technical assistance to and wrote the guide about MSTIC, and \u2022   Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration officials who facilitate and coordinate the work of the federal Interagency Task Force on Trauma-Informed Care.\nThrough our review of documents and interviews we identified common and unique challenges that state and local governments and other organizations may face in developing and implementing performance partnership pilots to serve children exposed to trauma.\nWe conducted this performance audit from January 2023 to August 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nFinding Buy-In from Partners May Be Difficult to Obtain\nState and local governments and other organizations may find it difficult to get partners to coalesce around performance partnership pilots to serve children exposed to trauma. \u2022  According to Mathematica, trust and buy-in were key factors that influence P3s\u2019 use of the flexibilities afforded to them. \u2022  Leadership in five of the 14 P3s noted that they were unable to secure enough trust and buy-in from their state and local partners to implement their planned approaches. \u2022  For example, respondents from one pilot reported a lack of trust among key partners that resulted in the fear of being penalized by the relevant federal agency for blending funds (combining funds into one award), which caused the pilot to braid (coordinate funds) rather than blend funds. \u2022  Chapin Hall and AIR recommend that collaboratives recruit representatives from child-serving public agencies to participate on a cross-system steering committee to support and oversee the strategic planning and implementation process. \u2022  AIR officials told us that states were delayed in beginning their work by about 6 months, in part, because it took time to get people engaged in the initiative.\nFinding Absent Time for Planning, Partners May Not Achieve Goals or Use Resources Effectively State and local governments and other organizations may find it difficult to achieve their goals, including systems change, if they do not have sufficient time for planning. \u2022  Mathematica reported that, 3 of 14 P3s made systems change activities central to their approach. These specific pilots spent years\u2014before they applied for P3\u2014building collaborations across youth-serving agencies to identify and address systems-level issues. \u2022  AIR officials told us that planning entails getting people to the table; determining infrastructure; assessing agencies\u2019 knowledge, understanding, practices, and policies; and mapping resources. AIR officials noted that if a system is not set up well and the planning process is skipped, then money for services may not be used effectively. \u2022  Mathematica concluded that dedicated planning time could support accomplishing foundational work for systems change.\nFinding Capabilities, Buy-In, and Privacy Issues May Hamper Data Sharing Data sharing would be central to developing and implementing performance partnership pilots and trauma-informed systems; however, several issues, such as privacy concerns, may undermine data sharing efforts. \u2022 Mathematica reported that the seven pilots that planned to incorporate data sharing into their P3 approach were hampered by: \u2022 lack of capabilities among existing information systems, \u2022 the time and effort involved in getting all parties to buy in to data sharing, \u2022 agencies\u2019 desire to maintain their own information systems, and \u2022 confidentiality concerns, particularly under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.\nFinding Capabilities, Buy-In, and Privacy Issues May Hamper Data Sharing, cont. \u2022 Mathematica reported that one P3 noted limited communication between system developers and direct-service providers and limited data management experience made it difficult to implement a shared data system. \u2022 Mathematica also reported that partners in one pilot expressed concerns that a shared data system might compromise trust they had built with youth. \u2022 However, according to AIR officials, individuals need to share data across agencies to prevent families from having to repeatedly provide the same information to multiple agencies, which may re-traumatize children and families.\nAdditional Challenges \u2022  Paradigm shift \u2013 GAO reported in 2019 that trauma-informed care involves a culture change and/or paradigm-shift. Trauma-informed practices must become embedded in systems. Developing and implementing a trauma- informed system requires, among other things, training employees throughout and across offices and organizations. \u2022  Leadership - According to AIR officials, to develop and implement a trauma-informed collaborative or system a leader or lead agency has to facilitate cross-agency collaboration. The leader has to have time and money. In addition, there has to be an agency that is willing to prioritize and sustain the effort. \u2022  Blending and braiding funds \u2013 According to Mathematica, pilots\u2019 understanding of the flexibilities available under P3 was important to their ability to fully use these flexibilities. Mathematica reported that leaders in four of the 14 pilots lacked a clear understanding of the difference between blending and braiding funds.\nAdditional Challenges \u2022 Increased workload \u2013 According to a former OMB official, in developing and implementing performance partnerships, officials have to operate their traditional programs while establishing a new initiative, with new people, and few dollars. The official noted that P3 did not provide state and local officials with relief from other work. \u2022 Differences in knowledge and progress \u2013 According to AIR officials,  agencies want to get something out of the collaborative effort. Agencies that are new to trauma-informed care will gain knowledge. However, they said that agencies with more experience need to gain something too. AIR officials provided training and technical assistance to state collaboratives.\nStrategic Planning and External Liaison\nStephen J.

This report examines challenges state and local governments and other organizations might face in using performance partnership pilots to serve children exposed to trauma.\nTo address this objective, we reviewed Performance Partnership Pilots for Disconnected Youth (P3) reports and issue briefs;2 Building a Multi-System Trauma-Informed Collaborative: A Guide for Adopting a Cross-System, Trauma-Informed Approach Among Child-Serving Agencies and Their Partners;3 federal agency documents; and prior GAO reports. In addition, we interviewed a former Office of Management and Budget official who helped create and implement performance partnership pilots for disconnected youth. We also interviewed individuals who provided technical assistance to and wrote the guide about the Multi-System Trauma-Informed Collaborative, and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration officials who facilitate and coordinate the work of the federal Interagency Task Force on Trauma-Informed Care.4 Through our review of documents and interviews we identified challenges that state and local governments and other organizations may face in developing and implementing performance partnership pilots to serve children exposed to trauma.\nWe conducted this performance audit from January 2023 to August 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Thompson Director, Federal Housing Finance Agency\nManagement Report: Federal Housing Finance Agency Should Improve Controls over Personnel and Payroll Information\nDear Director Thompson:\nOn November 15, 2022, we issued our auditor\u2019s report on the results of our audit of the fiscal years 2022 and 2021 financial statements of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA).1 As we reported in connection with our audit, FHFA maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2022. However, we identified other deficiencies in FHFA\u2019s internal controls that we do not consider to be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies.2 These deficiencies warrant FHFA management\u2019s attention. This report presents the control deficiencies we identified and our recommendations related to these deficiencies. There were no prior recommendations outstanding for FHFA related to past financial statement audits. This report is intended for FHFA management\u2019s use.\nObjective, Scope, and Methodology\nAs part of our audit of FHFA\u2019s fiscal years 2022 and 2021 financial statements, we evaluated FHFA\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. To accomplish this objective, we reviewed FHFA policies and procedures; interviewed FHFA management and staff; observed controls in operation; and conducted tests of controls to determine whether controls were designed, implemented, and operating effectively. A full discussion of our scope and methodology is included in our auditor\u2019s reports of FHFA\u2019s fiscal years 2022 and 2021 financial statements.3 During the course of our work, we communicated our findings to FHFA management. We plan to follow up with FHFA to determine the status of corrective actions taken to address our recommendations as part of our audit of FHFA\u2019s fiscal year 2023 financial statements.\nWe performed our audit in accordance with U.S. generally accepted government auditing standards. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our findings and recommendations in this report. \nDeficiencies in Controls over the Processing of Personnel and Payroll Information\nDuring our audit of FHFA\u2019s fiscal years 2022 and 2021 financial statements, we identified deficiencies in FHFA\u2019s internal control over the processing of personnel and payroll information. While we did not consider these deficiencies to be material weaknesses or significant deficiencies, either individually or collectively, they nonetheless warrant FHFA management\u2019s attention. Specifically, we found that FHFA did not reasonably assure that (1) it accurately recorded employee benefits information, (2) gross cost information in its financial statements was supported by detailed employee time charges, and (3) cash awards paid to employees and recorded in its financial statements matched the amounts management authorized.\nWe are making four recommendations pertaining to these identified control deficiencies.\nInaccurate Employee Benefits Information\nWhen FHFA hires new employees, its Human Resources (HR) Department performs procedures to record employee information into the Federal Personnel Payroll System (FPPS).4 If a new employee has prior federal service, HR must obtain information from the employee\u2019s prior federal employer, including forms documenting the employee\u2019s benefit elections.5 Once FHFA obtains this information, HR is responsible for verifying that all benefit election forms are complete and consistent with the employee elections it recorded in FPPS.\nCondition. During our audit, we found that FHFA\u2019s FPPS employee records contained inaccurate information for employees who had prior federal service. Specifically, we identified the following errors:\n\u2022  We found one instance where FHFA enrolled an employee in the wrong retirement plan. Because the employee had prior federal service, the employee was eligible for the federal retirement plan that was in effect at the employee\u2019s start date with the federal government. However, FHFA enrolled the employee into the retirement plan that was in effect when the employee started working at FHFA in 2014. As a result of FHFA\u2019s error, the agency did not contribute enough to the employee\u2019s retirement plan. This, in turn, led to FHFA understating its retirement contributions for the employee and its payroll expenses in the financial statements.\n\u2022  We found one instance where FHFA did not verify that it enrolled an employee into the life insurance plan that the employee elected. When this employee started working at FHFA in 2021, FHFA was not able to timely obtain the employee\u2019s most recent Standard Form (SF) 2817.6 Consequently, FHFA enrolled the employee into the life insurance plan that the employee\u2019s prior federal employer recorded. When FHFA subsequently obtained the employee\u2019s SF 2817, HR did not verify that the employee\u2019s life insurance election documented on the SF 2817 matched the life insurance plan election it recorded. The plan FHFA recorded for the employee would pay designated beneficiaries the employee\u2019s annual salary in the event of the employee\u2019s death. However, the SF 2817 indicated the employee had selected a plan that would pay beneficiaries five times the employee\u2019s annual salary in the event of the employee\u2019s death.\nCriteria. FHFA\u2019s HR policies and procedures require HR personnel to perform quality assurance checks before new employee personnel information is recorded and processed in its information systems. Additionally, FHFA\u2019s accounting policy states that the information supporting its financial reporting must be accurate. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government also states that management should (1) design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks, including designing appropriate types of control activities for the entity\u2019s control system, such as accurate and timely recording of transactions; (2) implement control activities by documenting responsibilities through policies and periodically reviewing control activities; and (3) establish and operate monitoring activities to monitor the internal control system and evaluate the results.7\nCause. While FHFA designed and implemented control activities to prevent errors when recording benefits information in its personnel records, FHFA personnel did not properly execute the internal control activities. These existing control activities failed to prevent or detect the errors that occurred, and management was not aware that the controls were not operating effectively.\nEffect. Without management action to (1) identify and correct existing errors in personnel records and (2) reasonably assure that its internal controls over recording new employees\u2019 benefit information are operating as intended, FHFA increases the risk that its financial reporting will be inaccurate. In addition, FHFA increases the risk that employees who are affected by such errors will continue to suffer undue burden as a result.\nRecommendations for Executive Action. The Director of FHFA should ensure that the appropriate management officials undertake a detailed review of existing personnel records to identify and correct errors. (Recommendation 1)\nThe Director of FHFA should ensure that the appropriate management officials develop and implement a process to monitor controls over the recording of benefits information for employees with prior federal service to reasonably assure that these controls are operating as designed. (Recommendation 2)\nReported Cost by Strategic Goal Not Supported by Detailed Employee Time Charges\nFHFA reports its gross program cost by strategic goal on its Consolidated Statement of Net Cost (SNC) and in note 10 of its financial statements.8 The Department of the Treasury\u2019s Fiscal Service Administrative Resource Center (Fiscal Service ARC) provides accounting services for FHFA and generates FHFA\u2019s reported gross cost amounts from its Oracle system. FHFA\u2019s Budget and Accounting Office performs quarterly and year-end reviews of gross cost by strategic goal information on the SNC and works with Fiscal Service ARC to resolve any issues.\nTo prepare the gross cost information for financial reporting, Fiscal Service ARC uses summarized payroll information from the Department of the Interior\u2019s Business Center (IBC). IBC provides payroll processing services for FHFA and uses FPPS to process and transmit summarized payroll information. IBC uses information from WebTA in processing FHFA\u2019s payroll transactions.9 FHFA employees use WebTA to record their biweekly time charges and associated strategic goal selection, and supervisors review and approve the time charges and associated strategic goal selections in this system. Once the supervisor certifies an employee\u2019s time charges in WebTA, FHFA transmits the information to IBC.\nCondition. We found one instance where strategic goal hours in Fiscal Service ARC\u2019s Oracle system did not match the employee\u2019s time and attendance record in WebTA.\nCriteria. FHFA\u2019s accounting policy states that the information supporting its financial reporting must be accurate. Additionally, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks, including designing appropriate types of control activities for the entity\u2019s control system, such as accurate and timely recording of transactions. Further, the standards state that management should implement control activities by documenting responsibilities through policies and periodically reviewing control activities.10\nCause. FHFA did not have adequate controls in place to reasonably assure that the gross cost information on its financial statements matched detailed employee time charges. While FHFA designed control activities to reasonably assure that the gross cost information on its financial statements reconciled to summarized payroll information, FHFA\u2019s review did not detect this error. Specifically, when FHFA\u2019s Budget and Accounting Office performed reviews of gross cost information, its existing process was not designed to verify that gross cost amounts by strategic goal trace back to detailed employee time charges as submitted in WebTA. In this instance, FHFA transmitted revised time charges through WebTA for the specific employee to IBC\u2019s FPPS. However, IBC\u2019s FPPS computer programs failed to recognize the updated time charges when compiling the summarized payroll information transmitted to Fiscal Service ARC.\nEffect. Without management action to develop control activities to reasonably assure that the gross cost information in FHFA\u2019s financial statements matches detailed employee time charges, FHFA increases the risk that its financial reporting will be inaccurate.\nRecommendation for Executive Action. The Director of FHFA should ensure that the appropriate management officials develop a process to periodically verify that gross cost information in FHFA\u2019s financial statements is supported by detailed employee time charges. (Recommendation 3)\nAward Amount Paid to Employee Not Authorized by Management\nFHFA has various cash awards for recognizing employee performance. It also has a process to include additional amounts for certain awards, so that an employee receives the specified award amount after taxes and other deductions are taken as part of FHFA\u2019s normal payroll processing procedures. However, not all awards are authorized to include those additional amounts. HR  initiates and processes cash awards in FPPS. FHFA policies include various levels of review and authorization of such awards.\nCondition. We found one instance where FHFA paid a cash award to an employee that was above what management authorized. Specifically, management intended to award an employee $1,000 before taxes and other deductions. Instead FHFA paid the employee $1,430, as if the award was approved for $1,000 after taxes and other deductions.\nCriteria. FHFA policies require its Human Capital Manager to review and approve in FPPS all personnel actions documented on an SF 52.11 Additionally, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks, including designing appropriate types of control activities for the entity\u2019s control system, such as accurate and timely recording of transactions. Further, the standards state that management should implement control activities by documenting responsibilities through policies and periodically reviewing control activities.12\nCause. While FHFA has control activities in place to reasonably assure employee award amounts are granted and authorized in accordance with its policies, it did not have a control procedure in place to reasonably assure that the award information an HR specialist enters into FPPS for final payment matches what management authorized and approved on the SF 52.\nEffect. Without management action to implement a control procedure to reasonably assure the accuracy of cash award information recorded for final payment, FHFA increases the risk that recorded transactions are not authorized in accordance with management policy.\nRecommendation for Executive Action. The Director of FHFA should ensure that appropriate management officials develop a process to reasonably assure that recorded cash award payments match what management authorized as documented on the approved SF 52. (Recommendation 4)\nAgency Comments\nWe provided a draft of this report to FHFA for comment. In its comments, reproduced in the enclosure, FHFA stated that it agreed with the four recommendations in this report and described actions it has taken, or plans to take, to address the recommendations related to controls over the processing of personnel and payroll information. We will evaluate the effectiveness of FHFA\u2019s efforts during our audit of its fiscal year 2023 financial statements.\n- - - - - - -\nWe are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Chairperson of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, appropriate congressional committees, and other interested parties.

Specifically, we found that FHFA did not reasonably assure that (1) it accurately recorded employee benefits information, (2) gross cost information in its financial statements was supported by detailed employee time charges, and (3) cash awards paid to employees and recorded in its financial statements matched the amounts management authorized.\nWe are making four recommendations pertaining to these identified control deficiencies.\nInaccurate Employee Benefits Information\nWhen FHFA hires new employees, its Human Resources (HR) Department performs procedures to record employee information into the Federal Personnel Payroll System (FPPS).4 If a new employee has prior federal service, HR must obtain information from the employee\u2019s prior federal employer, including forms documenting the employee\u2019s benefit elections.5 Once FHFA obtains this information, HR is responsible for verifying that all benefit election forms are complete and consistent with the employee elections it recorded in FPPS.\nCondition. During our audit, we found that FHFA\u2019s FPPS employee records contained inaccurate information for employees who had prior federal service. Specifically, we identified the following errors:\n\u2022  We found one instance where FHFA enrolled an employee in the wrong retirement plan. Because the employee had prior federal service, the employee was eligible for the federal retirement plan that was in effect at the employee\u2019s start date with the federal government. However, FHFA enrolled the employee into the retirement plan that was in effect when the employee started working at FHFA in 2014. As a result of FHFA\u2019s error, the agency did not contribute enough to the employee\u2019s retirement plan. This, in turn, led to FHFA understating its retirement contributions for the employee and its payroll expenses in the financial statements.\n\u2022  We found one instance where FHFA did not verify that it enrolled an employee into the life insurance plan that the employee elected. When this employee started working at FHFA in 2021, FHFA was not able to timely obtain the employee\u2019s most recent Standard Form (SF) 2817.6 Consequently, FHFA enrolled the employee into the life insurance plan that the employee\u2019s prior federal employer recorded. When FHFA subsequently obtained the employee\u2019s SF 2817, HR did not verify that the employee\u2019s life insurance election documented on the SF 2817 matched the life insurance plan election it recorded. The plan FHFA recorded for the employee would pay designated beneficiaries the employee\u2019s annual salary in the event of the employee\u2019s death. However, the SF 2817 indicated the employee had selected a plan that would pay beneficiaries five times the employee\u2019s annual salary in the event of the employee\u2019s death.\nCriteria. FHFA\u2019s HR policies and procedures require HR personnel to perform quality assurance checks before new employee personnel information is recorded and processed in its information systems. Additionally, FHFA\u2019s accounting policy states that the information supporting its financial reporting must be accurate. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government also states that management should (1) design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks, including designing appropriate types of control activities for the entity\u2019s control system, such as accurate and timely recording of transactions; (2) implement control activities by documenting responsibilities through policies and periodically reviewing control activities; and (3) establish and operate monitoring activities to monitor the internal control system and evaluate the results.7\nCause. While FHFA designed and implemented control activities to prevent errors when recording benefits information in its personnel records, FHFA personnel did not properly execute the internal control activities. These existing control activities failed to prevent or detect the errors that occurred, and management was not aware that the controls were not operating effectively.\nEffect. Without management action to (1) identify and correct existing errors in personnel records and (2) reasonably assure that its internal controls over recording new employees\u2019 benefit information are operating as intended, FHFA increases the risk that its financial reporting will be inaccurate. In addition, FHFA increases the risk that employees who are affected by such errors will continue to suffer undue burden as a result.\nRecommendations for Executive Action. The Director of FHFA should ensure that the appropriate management officials undertake a detailed review of existing personnel records to identify and correct errors. (Recommendation 1)\nThe Director of FHFA should ensure that the appropriate management officials develop and implement a process to monitor controls over the recording of benefits information for employees with prior federal service to reasonably assure that these controls are operating as designed. (Recommendation 2)\nReported Cost by Strategic Goal Not Supported by Detailed Employee Time Charges\nFHFA reports its gross program cost by strategic goal on its Consolidated Statement of Net Cost (SNC) and in note 10 of its financial statements.8 The Department of the Treasury\u2019s Fiscal Service Administrative Resource Center (Fiscal Service ARC) provides accounting services for FHFA and generates FHFA\u2019s reported gross cost amounts from its Oracle system. FHFA\u2019s Budget and Accounting Office performs quarterly and year-end reviews of gross cost by strategic goal information on the SNC and works with Fiscal Service ARC to resolve any issues.\nTo prepare the gross cost information for financial reporting, Fiscal Service ARC uses summarized payroll information from the Department of the Interior\u2019s Business Center (IBC). IBC provides payroll processing services for FHFA and uses FPPS to process and transmit summarized payroll information. IBC uses information from WebTA in processing FHFA\u2019s payroll transactions.9 FHFA employees use WebTA to record their biweekly time charges and associated strategic goal selection, and supervisors review and approve the time charges and associated strategic goal selections in this system. Once the supervisor certifies an employee\u2019s time charges in WebTA, FHFA transmits the information to IBC.\nCondition. We found one instance where strategic goal hours in Fiscal Service ARC\u2019s Oracle system did not match the employee\u2019s time and attendance record in WebTA.\nCriteria. FHFA\u2019s accounting policy states that the information supporting its financial reporting must be accurate. Additionally, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks, including designing appropriate types of control activities for the entity\u2019s control system, such as accurate and timely recording of transactions. Further, the standards state that management should implement control activities by documenting responsibilities through policies and periodically reviewing control activities.10\nCause. FHFA did not have adequate controls in place to reasonably assure that the gross cost information on its financial statements matched detailed employee time charges. While FHFA designed control activities to reasonably assure that the gross cost information on its financial statements reconciled to summarized payroll information, FHFA\u2019s review did not detect this error. Specifically, when FHFA\u2019s Budget and Accounting Office performed reviews of gross cost information, its existing process was not designed to verify that gross cost amounts by strategic goal trace back to detailed employee time charges as submitted in WebTA. In this instance, FHFA transmitted revised time charges through WebTA for the specific employee to IBC\u2019s FPPS. However, IBC\u2019s FPPS computer programs failed to recognize the updated time charges when compiling the summarized payroll information transmitted to Fiscal Service ARC.\nEffect. Without management action to develop control activities to reasonably assure that the gross cost information in FHFA\u2019s financial statements matches detailed employee time charges, FHFA increases the risk that its financial reporting will be inaccurate.\nRecommendation for Executive Action. The Director of FHFA should ensure that the appropriate management officials develop a process to periodically verify that gross cost information in FHFA\u2019s financial statements is supported by detailed employee time charges. (Recommendation 3)\nAward Amount Paid to Employee Not Authorized by Management\nFHFA has various cash awards for recognizing employee performance. It also has a process to include additional amounts for certain awards, so that an employee receives the specified award amount after taxes and other deductions are taken as part of FHFA\u2019s normal payroll processing procedures. However, not all awards are authorized to include those additional amounts. HR  initiates and processes cash awards in FPPS. FHFA policies include various levels of review and authorization of such awards.\nCondition. We found one instance where FHFA paid a cash award to an employee that was above what management authorized. Specifically, management intended to award an employee $1,000 before taxes and other deductions. Instead FHFA paid the employee $1,430, as if the award was approved for $1,000 after taxes and other deductions.\nCriteria. FHFA policies require its Human Capital Manager to review and approve in FPPS all personnel actions documented on an SF 52.11 Additionally, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks, including designing appropriate types of control activities for the entity\u2019s control system, such as accurate and timely recording of transactions. Further, the standards state that management should implement control activities by documenting responsibilities through policies and periodically reviewing control activities.12\nCause. While FHFA has control activities in place to reasonably assure employee award amounts are granted and authorized in accordance with its policies, it did not have a control procedure in place to reasonably assure that the award information an HR specialist enters into FPPS for final payment matches what management authorized and approved on the SF 52.\nEffect. Without management action to implement a control procedure to reasonably assure the accuracy of cash award information recorded for final payment, FHFA increases the risk that recorded transactions are not authorized in accordance with management policy.\nRecommendation for Executive Action. The Director of FHFA should ensure that appropriate management officials develop a process to reasonably assure that recorded cash award payments match what management authorized as documented on the approved SF 52. (Recommendation 4)\nAgency Comments\nWe provided a draft of this report to FHFA for comment. In its comments, reproduced in the enclosure, FHFA stated that it agreed with the four recommendations in this report and described actions it has taken, or plans to take, to address the recommendations related to controls over the processing of personnel and payroll information. We will evaluate the effectiveness of FHFA\u2019s efforts during our audit of its fiscal year 2023 financial statements.\n- - - - - - -\nWe are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Chairperson of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, appropriate congressional committees, and other interested parties.

{"content": "441 G St. N.W. Washington, DC  20548\n May 3, 2023\nThe Honorable Mariannette J. Miller-Meeks Chairwoman Subcommittee on Health Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs House of Representatives\nThe Honorable Jen Kiggans Chairwoman The Honorable Frank J. Mrvan Ranking Member Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs House of Representatives\nThe Honorable Tracey Mann House of Representatives\nThe Honorable Chris Pappas House of Representatives\nVA Whistleblowers: Resolution Process for Retaliation Claims\nFederal employee whistleblowers can potentially help protect the government from fraud, waste, and abuse by reporting allegations of wrongdoing, such as a violation of law, abuse of authority, or gross mismanagement. However, these whistleblowers may risk reprisal from their agencies for their disclosures, such as demotion, reassignment, or termination. The Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 provided protections for whistleblower disclosures and created the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), now an independent federal investigative and prosecutorial agency. OSC is responsible for investigating prohibited personnel practices (PPP), including complaints of whistleblower retaliation.\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is one of the largest federal agencies, with around 400,000 employees across hundreds of medical facilities, clinics, and benefits offices. In addition to protections under the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, VA employees who make a whistleblower disclosure are also protected under the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act of 2017. This law established the Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection (OAWP). OAWP\u2019s functions include investigating allegations of misconduct against senior agency officials and receiving and referring whistleblower disclosures. Additionally, the VA has implemented administrative reforms in response to claims and reports of inadequate whistleblower protections within the agency over the last few years.\nVA whistleblowers who suspect retaliation can submit complaints both externally, to agencies such as OSC, or internally to OAWP.1 In some cases, the VA may enter into a settlement agreement with the whistleblower. Negotiated settlements provide legally binding resolution of the case and can help avoid lengthy litigation.\nYou asked us to provide information on VA whistleblower retaliation investigations and settlement agreements. This report describes\n(1) The process, length, and outcomes of OSC investigations of whistleblower retaliation allegations from VA employees, and\n(2) How VA resolves allegations of whistleblower retaliation through settlement agreements.\nOn February 23, 2023, we briefed staff on our preliminary observations. This report transmits a final version of the briefing slides (see enclosure I). We have also included additional data tables on case volume, case length, and favorable actions across federal agencies (see enclosure II). This is an interim product. We have ongoing work that expands on the topics covered in this report, including on OAWP investigations.\nFor both objectives, we reviewed OSC and VA documents related to whistleblower retaliation investigations, and we interviewed agency officials about the process for settling whistleblower retaliation claims. To address the first objective, we also analyzed OSC case management system data to provide a summary of the volume, length, and outcomes of whistleblower retaliation cases involving VA employees from fiscal years 2018 through 2022.2 PPP cases investigated by OSC can have multiple allegations, and whistleblower retaliation cases are those that include whistleblower retaliation allegations, though these cases may cover other issues as well. We defined whistleblower retaliation to include allegations of retaliation for disclosures protected under federal law, as well as other protected activities that can be related to whistleblowing, such as exercising an appeal right. To assess the outcomes of cases, we analyzed the percentage of cases that were closed with favorable actions, which are actions that could result in a benefit to the complainant (i.e., whistleblower).3\nWe assessed the reliability of these data by reviewing available technical documentation, interviewing knowledgeable officials, and performing electronic testing of data. We determined the data were sufficiently reliable for describing the volume, length, and outcomes of OSC investigations of allegations of whistleblower retaliation against VA employees. OSC implemented a new case management system in August 2019, but the data fields we analyzed are generally comparable between the old and new system across the time period analyzed. \nFor the second objective, we also interviewed VA officials from OAWP and the Office of General Counsel (OGC) to understand policies surrounding settlement agreements to resolve claims of whistleblower retaliation. Specifically, we discussed the available guidance on the negotiation process, legal representation, and monetary settlements for agreements that resolve whistleblower retaliation claims. We also asked about VA\u2019s process for tracking data on settlement agreements that resolve whistleblower retaliation claims.\nWe conducted this performance audit from June 2022 to May 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nIn summary, cases alleging whistleblower retaliation comprised a majority of OSC PPP cases involving VA employees. These cases generally took longer to close than PPP cases overall and have increasingly closed with favorable actions in recent years. Over two-thirds (69 percent) of OSC PPP cases involving VA employees included allegations of whistleblower retaliation from fiscal years 2018 through 2022, according to our analysis of OSC\u2019s data. During that period, cases with whistleblower retaliation allegations took OSC a median of 94 days to close, compared to a median of 83 days for all PPP cases involving VA employees. Whistleblower retaliation cases that closed with favorable actions took longer to close (a median case length of 391 days). An increase in the percentage of cases closed with favorable action has contributed to longer case times overall, according to officials. In fiscal year 2018, 3 percent of VA whistleblower retaliation cases closed with favorable actions, compared to 10 percent in fiscal year 2022.4 OSC closed a majority (59 percent) of VA whistleblower retaliation allegations over this period due to insufficient evidence for further action.\nThe VA and a complainant can settle claims of whistleblower retaliation in the office where a dispute arises and various parties are involved in the process. Settlement negotiations can happen at any point in the complaint process. A VA settlement official, who represents the office where the dispute occurred, is responsible for negotiating and approving the terms of the agreement. This is done in conjunction with an assigned VA attorney, who provides legal representation and advice to the agency\u2019s settlement official. A complainant has the right to legal or non-legal representation, or they can represent themselves. VA has general guidance available regarding the clearance authority required for monetary settlements above a certain amount. While there are no VA guidance documents that pertain specifically to whistleblower retaliation settlement agreements, VA attorneys provide legal advice based on precedential case law. This advice can include the appropriate corrective action or level of monetary compensation. While OAWP does not have a role in settlement agreements, it implemented a system in 2022 to track data on whistleblower retaliation settlement agreements in response to Congressional inquiries.\nAgency Comments\nWe provided a draft of this report to VA and OSC for review and comment. VA and OSC both provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.\nWe are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional committees, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and the Special Counsel.

{"content": "U.S. Government Accountability Office Audit Recommendations: Opportunities for Agencies to Improve GAO-IG Act Reports GAO-23-106596 Report to the Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch, Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives June 5, 2023\nWhy This Matters\n GAO and the Inspectors General (IG) make recommendations to federal agencies on an ongoing basis. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-50 Revised, published in 1982, directed agencies to assure prompt implementation of audit recommendations.1 While agencies continue to implement the majority of GAO\u2019s recommendations, our recommendation database contained more than 4,800 unimplemented recommendations across the federal government, as of May 2023. If implemented, these recommendations could result in significant benefits, including increased savings and revenues, enhanced services to the public, and improved federal programs. The Good Accounting Obligation in Government Act (GAO-IG Act), enacted in 2019, generally requires agencies to report on the status of unimplemented GAO and IG recommendations with their annual budget justification.2 According to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, the reporting requirements are designed to (1) increase public accountability for unimplemented recommendations and (2) inform the federal budget process.3 House Report 117-389 includes a provision for us to review agency compliance with GAO-IG Act reporting requirements and identify any barriers to compliance.4 This report examines 24 federal agencies\u2019 GAO-IG Act reporting with their fiscal year 2024 budget justifications. We reviewed the extent to which these agencies included selected required reporting elements and followed the submission process requirements. Additionally, we identified challenges to producing the reports and opportunities to improve the usefulness of the information.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022  Sixteen of 24 agencies both included the selected reporting elements with their fiscal year 2024 budget justifications and followed the submission process, but the level of detail in their reporting varied. \u2022  Some agencies described practices that helped facilitate compliance and useful reporting that could benefit other agencies if adopted. \u2022  Improved guidance from OMB could increase reporting consistency. \u2022  We recommend OMB clarify the reporting requirements and instruct agencies to adopt practices, as appropriate, to improve their reporting.\nHow many agencies included the selected elements and followed the submission\nThe majority of the agencies in our review (20 of 24) generally included the selected required elements\u2014reporting on open recommendations and providing status information on their implementation\u2014in their GAO-IG Act reporting for 5 their fiscal year 2024 budget justification.  The four other agencies reported but did not provide status information for each recommendation listed. process? More than half of the agencies in our review (16 of 24) also generally followed the submission process requirements\u2014which include publishing the GAO-IG Act report on time with their budget justification and sending copies of the report to us and their IG (see fig. 1). Most of the other agencies did not follow the process because they did not provide copies of their report to us and their IG. Some of these agencies had assumed the public availability of their report was sufficient.\nFigure 1: Federal Agency Reporting for Good Accounting Obligation in Government Act Reporting for Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Justification\nWhat observations did we make about these reports?\nWe observed variations in how agencies reported the implementation status of open recommendations. For example, some agencies directed readers to GAO or the IG for the recommendation status or stated that the recommendation was \u201copen\u201d without providing any details about the implementation status. Other agencies provided limited information, such as stating the implementation was \u201cin progress\u201d without any details about actions taken. In contrast, some agencies included detailed information about actions they have taken and plan to take to address the open recommendations (see fig. 2).\nFigure 2: Presentation of Recommendation Status in Good Accounting Obligation in Government Act Reporting by Select Agencies\nWe also observed variations in the timeframes agencies used to identify open recommendations, such as the number of years of open recommendations the agencies included and what cut-off date they used. For example, some agencies included only one year of open recommendations while others included multiple years of open recommendations. In addition, for the fiscal year 2024 budget justification cycle, one agency did not include any recommendations issued after January 2021 while another included recommendations issued as recently as January 2023. We also observed that only some of the agencies included statements about (1) whether their open recommendations had clear budget implications or (2) any discrepancies between their list of recommendations and ours or their IG\u2019s.6 The requirement to include these reporting elements is contingent on, respectively, there being a clear budget implication or a discrepancy between lists. It was not possible for us to determine if the absence of these elements in certain reports was because there were no budget implications or discrepancies, or because the agency did not consider those elements. However, some reports were notable for explicitly presenting this information (see fig. 3). For example, the Department of Commerce stated that it had no discrepancies.\nFigure 3: Presentation of Budget Implications and Discrepancies in Good Accounting Obligation in Government Act Reporting by Select Agencies\nWhat opportunities exist to improve the reports?\n As discussed above, we observed variations in how agencies addressed the reporting requirements. Some agencies indicated that the requirements were either confusing or subject to interpretation. For example, one agency noted there was no definition for a clear budget implication. In response to our question about what would help agencies fully comply with the reporting requirements, some agencies indicated that additional guidance and clarification from OMB would be helpful.\nOMB\u2019s primary role is to oversee the federal budget process. OMB issues Circular No. A-11 each year to provide guidance to agencies on how to prepare their budget and budget justification materials.7 For example, OMB Circular No. A-11 contains a reminder about a different act\u2014the Congressional Budget Justification Transparency Act\u2014with additional guidance on the requirements (see fig. 4). The same page of OMB Circular No. A-11 contains a reminder about the GAO-IG Act, but without any clarification or additional guidance on the reporting requirements.\nFigure 4: Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-11 Guidance, August 2022\nAccording to OMB staff, this section of OMB Circular No. A-11 contains the guidance on what agencies should include in their budget justification related to the GAO-IG Act. However, the observations we make on the variations of agency reporting suggest that the published guidance\u2014on its own\u2014has not been sufficient to help ensure consistency across agencies, limiting the usefulness of the information for readers of this information.\nProviding additional clarification and guidance\u2014such as in OMB Circular No. A- 11\u2014would better ensure agencies have the information they need to prepare more compliant and useful reports. In turn, this would improve reporting and better meet the needs of Congress and the public.\nWhat can agencies learn from each other?\nSome agencies stated they faced challenges\u2014such as technology limitations or having limited staff resources\u2014in producing compliant reports with all the necessary elements. Other agencies described practices they follow to address challenges and help them produce reports efficiently, accurately, and consistently within the agency. For example, these agencies:\n\u2022  Coordinate regularly with IG and GAO liaisons. Some agencies indicated that regular coordination with their IG and GAO liaisons helps improve their compliance. For example, the Department of State and GAO communicate regularly about the status of open recommendations, including during the lead-up to the Congressional Budget Justification report. In addition, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2019s (NRC) IG provides a monthly report to NRC on the status of open recommendations and due dates. According to NRC, this regular reporting helps identify any errors in recordkeeping or missed deadlines, thereby reducing the possibility of discrepancies between NRC and IG reporting.\n\u2022  Leverage IT systems. Some agencies indicated that using technology to maintain up-to-date status information on open recommendations helped to facilitate efficient and accurate reporting. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) created a portal to better track GAO and IG audits and to export GAO-IG Act information for the purposes of its status report.\n\u2022  Develop internal guidance and templates. Some agencies indicated that they developed internal guidance, procedures, and templates to assist staff in preparing compliant GAO-IG Act reports. For example, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) developed prompts for agency staff to follow when drafting the implementation status of recommendations. The Department of Defense (DOD) and HHS developed FAQ documents to help ensure consistency and quality of reporting across the agency.\nIn addition, we found other notable practices that could improve the usefulness of GAO-IG Act reporting. For example, we identified agencies that: \u2022  Published the report as a standalone document. We found that GAO- IG Act reports published as clearly labeled, standalone documents with the budget justification were easier to locate. For example, HHS presented GAO-IG Act content on a webpage, which was linked to its budget justification webpage. We found this increased the visibility and accessibility of the information. \u2022  Included high level summaries. At least one agency\u2014HHS\u2014included high-level summaries of the status of its open recommendations before listing the individual recommendations. The summary included a figure that presented the number of unimplemented recommendations for each year. \u2022  Submitted recommendations in a downloadable spreadsheet. Three agencies\u2014DOD, HHS, and the Department of Labor\u2014provided links to downloadable spreadsheets that contained various data elements for each of their open recommendations with the ability to filter and sort the recommendations based on a reader\u2019s interests and needs.\nConclusions\nThe GAO-IG Act was created to increase public accountability for unimplemented recommendations and inform the federal budget process. Without detailed guidance and clarification on the reporting requirements, some agencies have not been including the level of detail required by the Act. While some agencies may benefit from adopting notable practices from other agencies, all agencies would benefit from clarification and guidance on the requirements. This would ensure greater consistency in reporting across the government and would improve the reporting for each agency.\nRecommendations for Executive Action\nWe are making the following two recommendations to OMB: The Director of OMB should clarify the reporting requirements of the GAO-IG Act in annual budget guidance. Such clarification could include, for example, the level of detail required and the date ranges for included recommendations. (Recommendation 1) The Director of OMB should instruct agencies to consider adopting, as appropriate, the notable practices for improving GAO-IG Act reporting that were identified in this report. (Recommendation 2)\nAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\nWe provided a draft of this report to the Director of OMB and the agencies included in our review (see fig. 1) for review and comment. OMB told us that it had no comments on the report. We received written comments from the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Agency for International Development (USAID), which are summarized below and reprinted in appendices I and II. We also received comments from the Department of Justice, which we summarize below. In addition, HHS and DHS provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. SSA said it had no comments on the draft report. USAID said the report accurately acknowledges and reflects USAID\u2019s program status and compliance. USAID also stated that it routinely monitors all open audit recommendations and implementation plans to ensure timely and proper close-out of these recommendations, and that the annual status of any unimplemented recommendations is reported to GAO as it is included in the annual budget submission. The Department of Justice neither agreed nor disagreed with the findings but commented that the notable practices listed in this report are suggestions and not required for compliance with the GAO-IG Act. The agency also stated that the two recommendations we make to OMB could potentially expand the requirements and that agencies would need time to implement any new requirements in their next submission. As our findings indicate, guidance could improve consistency in reporting. Similarly, the notable practices we identified have the potential to improve the usefulness of the reports. The remaining agencies\u2014with the exception of the Department of the Interior\u2014 informed us that they had no comments. We requested comments from Interior, but none were provided. We also provided a draft of this report to the IGs for the agencies included in our review, for their review and comment. Twenty-two of the IGs said that they had no comments; the other two did not respond.\nHow GAO Did This Study\nTo conduct this work, we selected the agencies listed in the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, as amended (CFO Act).8 We selected the CFO Act agencies because they are generally the largest federal agencies. For example, in 2022, they accounted for about 95 percent of outlays by government agencies. We developed a standardized set of questions\u2014consisting of both closed-ended and open-ended questions\u2014for agencies to complete and submit with supporting documentation. We also developed a standardized evaluation tool to analyze agencies\u2019 responses and documentation with selected reporting requirements of the GAO-IG Act. We coordinated with each agency\u2019s IG office to complete a similar evaluation tool, focused on the IG recommendations. To assess agency reporting, we compared GAO\u2019s and IG\u2019s evaluation tools for each agency. Any discrepancies between how GAO and the IG evaluated the agency were reviewed and resolved by a team of GAO analysts. We then compiled, analyzed, and summarized the results of the evaluation tools. We also used this standardized set of questions and evaluation tools to (1) gather perspectives on challenges to producing GAO-IG Act reports and identify any consistent themes, and (2) identify notable practices that helped address the requirements and enhance the use and usefulness of the submissions.\nIn cases where we asked a closed-ended question of all agencies, we report the number of agencies with a given response. For open-ended questions\u2014where agencies provided a range of responses\u2014we use the word \u201csome\u201d to indicate that more than one agency mentioned the same topic.\nWe conducted this performance audit from January 2023 to June 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nList of Addressees\nThe Honorable Mark Amodei Chair The Honorable Adriano Espaillat Ranking Member Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch Committee on Appropriations United States House of Representatives\nGAO Contact Information\nFor more information, contact: Jessica Lucas-Judy at (202) 512-6806 or LucasJudyJ@gao.gov Chuck Young, Managing Director, Public Affairs, YoungC1@gao.gov, (202) 512- 4800 A.

{"content": "U.S. Government Accountability Office Audit Recommendations: Opportunities for Agencies to Improve GAO-IG Act Reports GAO-23-106596 Report to the Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch, Committee on Appropriations, House of Representatives June 5, 2023\nWhy This Matters\n GAO and the Inspectors General (IG) make recommendations to federal agencies on an ongoing basis. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-50 Revised, published in 1982, directed agencies to assure prompt implementation of audit recommendations.1 While agencies continue to implement the majority of GAO\u2019s recommendations, our recommendation database contained more than 4,800 unimplemented recommendations across the federal government, as of May 2023. If implemented, these recommendations could result in significant benefits, including increased savings and revenues, enhanced services to the public, and improved federal programs. The Good Accounting Obligation in Government Act (GAO-IG Act), enacted in 2019, generally requires agencies to report on the status of unimplemented GAO and IG recommendations with their annual budget justification.2 According to the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, the reporting requirements are designed to (1) increase public accountability for unimplemented recommendations and (2) inform the federal budget process.3 House Report 117-389 includes a provision for us to review agency compliance with GAO-IG Act reporting requirements and identify any barriers to compliance.4 This report examines 24 federal agencies\u2019 GAO-IG Act reporting with their fiscal year 2024 budget justifications. We reviewed the extent to which these agencies included selected required reporting elements and followed the submission process requirements. Additionally, we identified challenges to producing the reports and opportunities to improve the usefulness of the information.\nKey Takeaways\n\u2022  Sixteen of 24 agencies both included the selected reporting elements with their fiscal year 2024 budget justifications and followed the submission process, but the level of detail in their reporting varied. \u2022  Some agencies described practices that helped facilitate compliance and useful reporting that could benefit other agencies if adopted. \u2022  Improved guidance from OMB could increase reporting consistency. \u2022  We recommend OMB clarify the reporting requirements and instruct agencies to adopt practices, as appropriate, to improve their reporting.\nHow many agencies included the selected elements and followed the submission\nThe majority of the agencies in our review (20 of 24) generally included the selected required elements\u2014reporting on open recommendations and providing status information on their implementation\u2014in their GAO-IG Act reporting for 5 their fiscal year 2024 budget justification.  The four other agencies reported but did not provide status information for each recommendation listed. process? More than half of the agencies in our review (16 of 24) also generally followed the submission process requirements\u2014which include publishing the GAO-IG Act report on time with their budget justification and sending copies of the report to us and their IG (see fig. 1). Most of the other agencies did not follow the process because they did not provide copies of their report to us and their IG. Some of these agencies had assumed the public availability of their report was sufficient.\nFigure 1: Federal Agency Reporting for Good Accounting Obligation in Government Act Reporting for Fiscal Year 2024 Budget Justification\nWhat observations did we make about these reports?\nWe observed variations in how agencies reported the implementation status of open recommendations. For example, some agencies directed readers to GAO or the IG for the recommendation status or stated that the recommendation was \u201copen\u201d without providing any details about the implementation status. Other agencies provided limited information, such as stating the implementation was \u201cin progress\u201d without any details about actions taken. In contrast, some agencies included detailed information about actions they have taken and plan to take to address the open recommendations (see fig. 2).\nFigure 2: Presentation of Recommendation Status in Good Accounting Obligation in Government Act Reporting by Select Agencies\nWe also observed variations in the timeframes agencies used to identify open recommendations, such as the number of years of open recommendations the agencies included and what cut-off date they used. For example, some agencies included only one year of open recommendations while others included multiple years of open recommendations. In addition, for the fiscal year 2024 budget justification cycle, one agency did not include any recommendations issued after January 2021 while another included recommendations issued as recently as January 2023. We also observed that only some of the agencies included statements about (1) whether their open recommendations had clear budget implications or (2) any discrepancies between their list of recommendations and ours or their IG\u2019s.6 The requirement to include these reporting elements is contingent on, respectively, there being a clear budget implication or a discrepancy between lists. It was not possible for us to determine if the absence of these elements in certain reports was because there were no budget implications or discrepancies, or because the agency did not consider those elements. However, some reports were notable for explicitly presenting this information (see fig. 3). For example, the Department of Commerce stated that it had no discrepancies.\nFigure 3: Presentation of Budget Implications and Discrepancies in Good Accounting Obligation in Government Act Reporting by Select Agencies\nWhat opportunities exist to improve the reports?\n As discussed above, we observed variations in how agencies addressed the reporting requirements. Some agencies indicated that the requirements were either confusing or subject to interpretation. For example, one agency noted there was no definition for a clear budget implication. In response to our question about what would help agencies fully comply with the reporting requirements, some agencies indicated that additional guidance and clarification from OMB would be helpful.\nOMB\u2019s primary role is to oversee the federal budget process. OMB issues Circular No. A-11 each year to provide guidance to agencies on how to prepare their budget and budget justification materials.7 For example, OMB Circular No. A-11 contains a reminder about a different act\u2014the Congressional Budget Justification Transparency Act\u2014with additional guidance on the requirements (see fig. 4). The same page of OMB Circular No. A-11 contains a reminder about the GAO-IG Act, but without any clarification or additional guidance on the reporting requirements.\nFigure 4: Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-11 Guidance, August 2022\nAccording to OMB staff, this section of OMB Circular No. A-11 contains the guidance on what agencies should include in their budget justification related to the GAO-IG Act. However, the observations we make on the variations of agency reporting suggest that the published guidance\u2014on its own\u2014has not been sufficient to help ensure consistency across agencies, limiting the usefulness of the information for readers of this information.\nProviding additional clarification and guidance\u2014such as in OMB Circular No. A- 11\u2014would better ensure agencies have the information they need to prepare more compliant and useful reports. In turn, this would improve reporting and better meet the needs of Congress and the public.\nWhat can agencies learn from each other?\nSome agencies stated they faced challenges\u2014such as technology limitations or having limited staff resources\u2014in producing compliant reports with all the necessary elements. Other agencies described practices they follow to address challenges and help them produce reports efficiently, accurately, and consistently within the agency. For example, these agencies:\n\u2022  Coordinate regularly with IG and GAO liaisons. Some agencies indicated that regular coordination with their IG and GAO liaisons helps improve their compliance. For example, the Department of State and GAO communicate regularly about the status of open recommendations, including during the lead-up to the Congressional Budget Justification report. In addition, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\u2019s (NRC) IG provides a monthly report to NRC on the status of open recommendations and due dates. According to NRC, this regular reporting helps identify any errors in recordkeeping or missed deadlines, thereby reducing the possibility of discrepancies between NRC and IG reporting.\n\u2022  Leverage IT systems. Some agencies indicated that using technology to maintain up-to-date status information on open recommendations helped to facilitate efficient and accurate reporting. For example, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) created a portal to better track GAO and IG audits and to export GAO-IG Act information for the purposes of its status report.\n\u2022  Develop internal guidance and templates. Some agencies indicated that they developed internal guidance, procedures, and templates to assist staff in preparing compliant GAO-IG Act reports. For example, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) developed prompts for agency staff to follow when drafting the implementation status of recommendations. The Department of Defense (DOD) and HHS developed FAQ documents to help ensure consistency and quality of reporting across the agency.\nIn addition, we found other notable practices that could improve the usefulness of GAO-IG Act reporting. For example, we identified agencies that: \u2022  Published the report as a standalone document. We found that GAO- IG Act reports published as clearly labeled, standalone documents with the budget justification were easier to locate. For example, HHS presented GAO-IG Act content on a webpage, which was linked to its budget justification webpage. We found this increased the visibility and accessibility of the information. \u2022  Included high level summaries. At least one agency\u2014HHS\u2014included high-level summaries of the status of its open recommendations before listing the individual recommendations. The summary included a figure that presented the number of unimplemented recommendations for each year. \u2022  Submitted recommendations in a downloadable spreadsheet. Three agencies\u2014DOD, HHS, and the Department of Labor\u2014provided links to downloadable spreadsheets that contained various data elements for each of their open recommendations with the ability to filter and sort the recommendations based on a reader\u2019s interests and needs.\nConclusions\nThe GAO-IG Act was created to increase public accountability for unimplemented recommendations and inform the federal budget process. Without detailed guidance and clarification on the reporting requirements, some agencies have not been including the level of detail required by the Act. While some agencies may benefit from adopting notable practices from other agencies, all agencies would benefit from clarification and guidance on the requirements. This would ensure greater consistency in reporting across the government and would improve the reporting for each agency.\nRecommendations for Executive Action\nWe are making the following two recommendations to OMB: The Director of OMB should clarify the reporting requirements of the GAO-IG Act in annual budget guidance. Such clarification could include, for example, the level of detail required and the date ranges for included recommendations. (Recommendation 1) The Director of OMB should instruct agencies to consider adopting, as appropriate, the notable practices for improving GAO-IG Act reporting that were identified in this report. (Recommendation 2)\nAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\nWe provided a draft of this report to the Director of OMB and the agencies included in our review (see fig. 1) for review and comment. OMB told us that it had no comments on the report. We received written comments from the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Agency for International Development (USAID), which are summarized below and reprinted in appendices I and II. We also received comments from the Department of Justice, which we summarize below. In addition, HHS and DHS provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. SSA said it had no comments on the draft report. USAID said the report accurately acknowledges and reflects USAID\u2019s program status and compliance. USAID also stated that it routinely monitors all open audit recommendations and implementation plans to ensure timely and proper close-out of these recommendations, and that the annual status of any unimplemented recommendations is reported to GAO as it is included in the annual budget submission. The Department of Justice neither agreed nor disagreed with the findings but commented that the notable practices listed in this report are suggestions and not required for compliance with the GAO-IG Act. The agency also stated that the two recommendations we make to OMB could potentially expand the requirements and that agencies would need time to implement any new requirements in their next submission. As our findings indicate, guidance could improve consistency in reporting. Similarly, the notable practices we identified have the potential to improve the usefulness of the reports. The remaining agencies\u2014with the exception of the Department of the Interior\u2014 informed us that they had no comments. We requested comments from Interior, but none were provided. We also provided a draft of this report to the IGs for the agencies included in our review, for their review and comment. Twenty-two of the IGs said that they had no comments; the other two did not respond.\nHow GAO Did This Study\nTo conduct this work, we selected the agencies listed in the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, as amended (CFO Act).8 We selected the CFO Act agencies because they are generally the largest federal agencies. For example, in 2022, they accounted for about 95 percent of outlays by government agencies. We developed a standardized set of questions\u2014consisting of both closed-ended and open-ended questions\u2014for agencies to complete and submit with supporting documentation. We also developed a standardized evaluation tool to analyze agencies\u2019 responses and documentation with selected reporting requirements of the GAO-IG Act. We coordinated with each agency\u2019s IG office to complete a similar evaluation tool, focused on the IG recommendations. To assess agency reporting, we compared GAO\u2019s and IG\u2019s evaluation tools for each agency. Any discrepancies between how GAO and the IG evaluated the agency were reviewed and resolved by a team of GAO analysts. We then compiled, analyzed, and summarized the results of the evaluation tools. We also used this standardized set of questions and evaluation tools to (1) gather perspectives on challenges to producing GAO-IG Act reports and identify any consistent themes, and (2) identify notable practices that helped address the requirements and enhance the use and usefulness of the submissions.\nIn cases where we asked a closed-ended question of all agencies, we report the number of agencies with a given response. For open-ended questions\u2014where agencies provided a range of responses\u2014we use the word \u201csome\u201d to indicate that more than one agency mentioned the same topic.\nWe conducted this performance audit from January 2023 to June 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nList of Addressees\nThe Honorable Mark Amodei Chair The Honorable Adriano Espaillat Ranking Member Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch Committee on Appropriations United States House of Representatives\nGAO Contact Information\nFor more information, contact: Jessica Lucas-Judy at (202) 512-6806 or LucasJudyJ@gao.gov Chuck Young, Managing Director, Public Affairs, YoungC1@gao.gov, (202) 512- 4800 A.

Without detailed guidance and clarification on the reporting requirements, some agencies have not been including the level of detail required by the Act. While some agencies may benefit from adopting notable practices from other agencies, all agencies would benefit from clarification and guidance on the requirements. This would ensure greater consistency in reporting across the government and would improve the reporting for each agency.\nRecommendations for Executive Action\nWe are making the following two recommendations to OMB: The Director of OMB should clarify the reporting requirements of the GAO-IG Act in annual budget guidance. Such clarification could include, for example, the level of detail required and the date ranges for included recommendations. (Recommendation 1) The Director of OMB should instruct agencies to consider adopting, as appropriate, the notable practices for improving GAO-IG Act reporting that were identified in this report. (Recommendation 2)\nAgency Comments and Our Evaluation\nWe provided a draft of this report to the Director of OMB and the agencies included in our review (see fig. 1) for review and comment. OMB told us that it had no comments on the report. We received written comments from the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Agency for International Development (USAID), which are summarized below and reprinted in appendices I and II. We also received comments from the Department of Justice, which we summarize below. In addition, HHS and DHS provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. SSA said it had no comments on the draft report. USAID said the report accurately acknowledges and reflects USAID\u2019s program status and compliance. USAID also stated that it routinely monitors all open audit recommendations and implementation plans to ensure timely and proper close-out of these recommendations, and that the annual status of any unimplemented recommendations is reported to GAO as it is included in the annual budget submission.

The remaining agencies\u2014with the exception of the Department of the Interior\u2014 informed us that they had no comments. We requested comments from Interior, but none were provided. We also provided a draft of this report to the IGs for the agencies included in our review, for their review and comment. Twenty-two of the IGs said that they had no comments; the other two did not respond.\nHow GAO Did This Study\nTo conduct this work, we selected the agencies listed in the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, as amended (CFO Act).8 We selected the CFO Act agencies because they are generally the largest federal agencies. For example, in 2022, they accounted for about 95 percent of outlays by government agencies. We developed a standardized set of questions\u2014consisting of both closed-ended and open-ended questions\u2014for agencies to complete and submit with supporting documentation. We also developed a standardized evaluation tool to analyze agencies\u2019 responses and documentation with selected reporting requirements of the GAO-IG Act. We coordinated with each agency\u2019s IG office to complete a similar evaluation tool, focused on the IG recommendations.

We also used this standardized set of questions and evaluation tools to (1) gather perspectives on challenges to producing GAO-IG Act reports and identify any consistent themes, and (2) identify notable practices that helped address the requirements and enhance the use and usefulness of the submissions.\nIn cases where we asked a closed-ended question of all agencies, we report the number of agencies with a given response. For open-ended questions\u2014where agencies provided a range of responses\u2014we use the word \u201csome\u201d to indicate that more than one agency mentioned the same topic.\nWe conducted this performance audit from January 2023 to June 2023 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.\nList of Addressees\nThe Honorable Mark Amodei Chair The Honorable Adriano Espaillat Ranking Member Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch Committee on Appropriations United States House of Representatives\nGAO Contact Information\nFor more information, contact: Jessica Lucas-Judy at (202) 512-6806 or LucasJudyJ@gao.gov Chuck Young, Managing Director, Public Affairs, YoungC1@gao.gov, (202) 512- 4800 A.
