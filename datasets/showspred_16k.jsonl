Thanks for meeting me here so quickly. Sit, sit, sit.\" said by Michael\n\"No thanks needed. I know you just came from seeing diane. Hopefully, you have some good news for me.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, I have news. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not good.\" said by Michael\n\"Okay, I\u2019m listening.\" said by Jack\n\"I have a contact in the coroner\u2019s office in the jurisdiction near pheasant lake.\" said by Michael\n\"Where they found stark\u2019s body.\" said by Jack\n\"Um, off the record, she has agreed to share his presumed manner of death.\" said by Michael\n\"So suicide? Accidental drowning? Have they done a toxicology screening?\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, they\u2019re doing an autopsy. Until it\u2019s finished, none of these findings are conclusive. But according to my source, it appears to be a homicide.\" said by Michael\n\"Hey, baby. I know it\u2019s a shock. I know it\u2019s a shock.\" said by Phyllis\n\"I got\u2013 I got this call from somebody offering to explain what happened to my mom. But I didn\u2019t know that it was you. It didn\u2019t sound like you.\" said by Summer\n\"I was in a coffee shop, and I\u2013 I gave the waitress some money. She\u2019s the one who called you.

You\u2019re the only one who can know that I\u2019m alive. I mean it. You\u2019re the only one I can trust. You\u2019re the only one who can know what happened.

Whatever this is, this\u2013 this stunt that you pulled. You\u2019ve hurt so many people. And daniel and I have been devastated, but we need you. So whatever you did, it doesn\u2019t matter.

I bet she will love to go.\" said by Audra\n\"I hadn\u2019t thought about inviting elena. I wouldn\u2019t want to seem unprofessional by asking if my girlfriend could tag along.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, um, I\u2019m sorry. I might have misunderstood. I just thought that you invited her last time you were traveling on business.\" said by Audra\n\"I did. Good thing she couldn\u2019t make it because it was nonstop work. She would have been bored stiff.\" said by Nick\n\"Homicide?\" said by Jack\n\"Apparently.\" said by Michael\n\"How is that\u2013 how can they know for sure?\" said by Jack\n\"No longer being the D.A., I can only get so much information. My source was taking a risk by telling me as much as she did.\" said by Michael\n\"Wow. There\u2019s a lot to wrap my head around.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, join the club.\" said by Michael\n\"If they think it\u2019s murder, there\u2019s going to be a full out investigation, right?\" said by Jack\n\"By the local sheriff\u2019s department? Yes. Since the lake itself is in an unincorporated area.\" said by Michael\n\"You know as much as I do, and I don\u2019t have a whole lot to go on, jack. But what I do know, what I do know, in terms of diane\u2019s defense, this is a double edged sword.\" said by Michael\n\"That makes no sense. I would think stark\u2019s death would indicate there was much more at play. Especially if he\u2019s murdered.\" said by Jack\n\"All right, listen\u2013\" said by Michael\n\"Diane is out of commission. I mean, unless somebody thinks she\u2019s a mob boss who can call a hit inside prison and have it carried out while she\u2019s in there. No. Basic\u2013 basic intelligence would tell you she\u2019s not involved in that. She didn\u2019t kill stark, she didn\u2019t kill phyllis. And this latest development\u2013\" said by Jack\n\"Jack! Jack, until I learned more about stark\u2019s murder, I don\u2019t know what any of this means.\" said by Michael\n\"At least we know this guy can\u2019t testify against her in court.\" said by Jack\n\"True. However, he also can\u2019t exonerate her. We used to struggle with greasy messes.\" said by Michael\n\"Dad actually warned you about mccall and what would happen if you didn\u2019t acquire it?\" said by Nick\n\"It wasn\u2019t so much a warning as an I told you so. Just tell me, please, that you turned down his offer.\" said by Victoria\n\"Vic, come on. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m bailing on you to go and babysit adam. I\u2019m pretty sure mom\u2019s not going anywhere either.\" said by Nick\n\"Can you imagine our mother and adam running a company together? That\u2019ll be the day. So what else did dad have to share? Any other suggestions that I should know about?\" said by Victoria\n\"Uh, didn\u2019t learn much, except that mccall seems to be in shambles, and\u2026 he thinks adam\u2019s going to need the full support of the family to write the ship.\" said by Nick\n\"He\u2019s gonna need a lot more than that.\" said by Victoria\n\"I actually think this was just some play to get me and adam to back away from sally.\" said by Nick\n\"Yes, that seems about right.\" said by Victoria\n\"Once I realized what he was up to, I rejected his offer and walked out.\" said by Nick\n\"You know, leave it to our father to buy an entire conglomerate so he can try to manipulate all the people around him.\" said by Victoria\n\"He doesn\u2019t seem to know when he needs to let people manage their own lives. And with a baby on the way, it\u2019s just going to get worse. He can\u2019t see it. I mean, the more he pushes sally away, the more he risks being shut out of his granddaughter\u2019s life.\" said by Nick\n\"Listen to me. Okayyou need to listen to me. I wish I could come home\u2026 but unfortunately, it can\u2019t happen.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Why? None of this makes any sense.\" said by Summer\n\"I made some mistakes. [ Sighing ] I did some stupid things. I trusted the wrong man.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Stark?\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Tell me what happened.\" said by Summer\n\"He manipulated me, you know? Um\u2026 he played on my deepest, darkest fears, you know? And he convinced me to marry him and then we had this plan to take diane down and put her in prison for the rest of her life.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Mom\u2026 what have you done?\" said by Summer\n\"I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just being honest with you. I\u2019m just being honest, summer.\" said by Phyllis\n\"How did you think that it was gonna\u2013\" said by Summer\n\"I wasn\u2019t thinking. I was out of my mind. I wasn\u2019t thinking. Then, when I finally came to my senses\u2026 and I told him I didn\u2019t want to go forward with the plan anymore, he threatened me. He was gonna kill me.\" said by Phyllis\n\"The more I think about it, the more I believe that stark\u2019s death proves diane didn\u2019t kill phyllis.\" said by Jack\n\"I don\u2019t understand your logic, jack. Yeah, I agree that diane being in jail rules her out as a suspect in stark\u2019s murder, but how? How does that absolve her of phyllis\u2019s death?\" said by Michael\n\"To me, it\u2019s obvious. Phyllis is poisoned. Days later, stark is murdered. That\u2019s just a coincidence? Come on, one person could have killed both of them.\" said by Jack\n\"There\u2019s no evidence to suggest that.\" said by Michael\n\"Yet. And maybe there never will be any. But think about it. Stark is a known criminal, out on parole, involved in fraud and money laundering and god knows what else on an international scale. He\u2019s been hanging out with some very dangerous people who are experts at hiding evidence. Maybe he crossed one of them. His past caught up with him and phyllis. I\u2019m steve, I lost 138 pounds in nine months on golo\" said by Jack\n\"I get why stark would be the target of a killer, but why phyllis?\" said by Michael\n\"I don\u2019t know. Diane was never certain where stark got the funding to carry out his schemes. Whoever he was dealing with back then maybe felt shorted when he went to prison and they wanted their money back. And maybe that was the money that he was pressuring diane for.\" said by Jack\n\"If that were the case, why wouldn\u2019t stark have taken the money you offered him initially?\" said by Michael\n\"No, that was a direct response to diane. A not-so-veiled threat that this is about more than just money.\" said by Jack\n\"Even if your theory were correct, despite the lack of evidence, it only accounts for a hit on stark. Again, why phyllis?\" said by Michael\n\"She was his new wife. Whoever these people are came to town knowing that his former partner in crime lived in genoa city. Maybe they thought that was phyllis.\" said by Jack\n\"It was diane.\" said by Michael\n\"Well, we know that. They thought they were looking for taylor jensen. Any woman in town could have been taylor jensen. Maybe phyllis\u2019s murder is a case of mistaken identity. Maybe she\u2019s just collateral damage.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, I know you\u2019re looking for an answer, but that is not it. There is a mountain of evidence that exists, and it points to a premeditated crime perpetrated by diane.\" said by Michael\n\"I will do anything I can to get justice for phyllis. I feel she deserves at least that from me. Diane didn\u2019t do this. I have to defend her.\" said by Jack\n\"Okay, jack, the two of us are committed to the same two causes. Justice for phyllis and diane. But right now, we only know one thing. Diane is the only suspect in phyllis\u2019s murder that is still alive to talk about it.\" said by Michael\n\"Hi.\" said by Nate\n\"Hey. Your message said you have some news. What\u2019s up?\" said by Elena\n\"I have to go home and pack.\" said by Nate\n\"Okay. Why? I\u2019m heading to L.A. For work.\" said by Elena\n\"For how long?\" said by Elena\n\"Just a few days. But when I get back, I would love to go somewhere with you. A short vacation, you know? One week, just the two of us. Where would you like to go?\" said by Nate\n\"Okay, wait, back up. So, you\u2019re going away on business?\" said by Elena\n\"Wall to wall meetings out west with some streamers we\u2019d like to acquire. But I realize what I really want to do right now is get away with you somewhere. You know? No work involved.\" said by Nate\n\"I see.\" said by Elena\n\"We\u2019ve been kicking it around for quite a while now. Why not make it happen?\" said by Nate\n\"We can discuss it. But who is we?\" said by Elena\n\"What do you mean?\" said by Nate\n\"Well, you just said that there are some streamers on the west coast that we would like to acquire, so I\u2019m wondering, are you going alone or are you going with someone else?\" said by Elena\n\"You know, it makes no difference what you and sally think. Once that baby arrives, there\u2019s no way in hell that you\u2019re gonna be able to keep it away from dad. Not to mention, this is not your fight. Sally and adam are the parents, so really, it\u2019s up to them.\" said by Victoria\n\"Thank you for the reminder.\" said by Nick\n\"It\u2019s the truth, nick. Hey, um, I\u2019m gonna be going to los angeles for a couple of days, and I need you to take the reins. I hope that\u2019s not too much to ask.\" said by Victoria\n\"Sure. Mom going with you?\" said by Nick\n\"No, she\u2019ll be here.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, she\u2019s the co-ceo. Shouldn\u2019t she be in charge?\" said by Nick\n\"Look, we both know how much she loves seeing you in more of a leadership role. So the job is yours for a couple of days. Deal with it.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay. Um\u2026 you going alone?\" said by Nick\n\"No. Did you have a chance to look over those p&l reports that I sent you?\" said by Victoria\n\"Hold up. If mom\u2019s not going out of town, who are you going with? Don\u2019t tell me\u2013\" said by Nick\n\"I know what I\u2019m doing, nick. Leave it alone.\" said by Victoria\n\"Why didn\u2019t you come to me before? Why didn\u2019t you tell me that stark was making threats? Jack got all this extra security for us. He could have had you covered, too.\" said by Summer\n\"Jack wouldn\u2019t have lifted a finger for me. And then, you and daniel\u2026 I thought you hated me. I thought everyone hated me.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Mom, daniel and I, we never hated you. Yes, we disagreed with you, but, mom, we love you. We\u2019ve been wrecks since that night.\" said by Summer\n\"I know. I know. I\u2019ve been watching you. I saw how much pain you were in. I\u2019m so sorry. [ Sobbing ] That\u2019s why I needed to meet with you. I wanted you to know that I am okay. I couldn\u2019t go through with it. And listen, I understand. I really understand if you and your brother hate me and never want to forgive me.\" said by Phyllis\n\"No, no. Those days are over, mom. That\u2019s not gonna happen. We are on your side, no matter what.\" said by Summer\n\"Summer\u2026 when you find out what I did\u2026 I don\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna feel that way. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re gonna be on my side.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Mom\u2026 how guilty are you? Welcome to my digestive system.\" said by Summer\n\"You telling me to leave it alone makes me ten times more concerned.\" said by Nick\n\"Okay, let me make this easy for you. As ceo of newman media, nate will be accompanying me to los angeles. The meetings that we will be attending pertain to the various streaming platforms that we would like to acquire. While I could certainly handle them on my own, it makes sense that the head of newman media would be present, don\u2019t you think?\" said by Victoria\n\"I\u2019m sure you know all of the reasons why this is a terrible idea.\" said by Nick\n\"And I\u2019m sure that you\u2019re aware that I\u2019m really not interested in your opinion.\" said by Victoria\n\"So yeah, I\u2019ll be on my own in california.\" said by Nate\n\"Sounds dull. Wish I could join you.\" said by Elena\n\"Too last minute, huh?\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah, but when you get back, I should be able to take some time off.\" said by Elena\n\"Great. Any thoughts on where you\u2019d like to go?\" said by Nate\n\"No, but I\u2019ll look into it while you\u2019re away. Maybe something scenic, maybe something intimate. You have any preferences?\" said by Elena\n\"Surprise me. As long as I\u2019m with you, I\u2019ll be happy.\" said by Nate\n\"That\u2019s really sweet of you.\" said by Elena\n\"Okay, let me get home and figure out what I\u2019m packing.\" said by Nate\n\"Mm, I hear cali\u2019s having a heat wave, so it should be pretty hot.\" said by Elena\n\"I will keep that in mind. Bye-bye.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, what I did, it\u2019s not important. The important thing is that jeremy stark manipulated the whole situation to make it look like\u2026\" said by Phyllis\n\"So\u2026 none of it was real?

I heard the psycho was staying at the athletic club. I mean, what a clever hideout. Nobody would ever think to look there.\" said by Adam\n\"Adam, okay, that\u2019s enough, all right? You don\u2019t know the whole story. Chance was a hero yesterday.\" said by Sharon\n\"A hero? Really?\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah, if he hadn\u2019t arrived when he did, faith and i might not be here right now.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, maybe if he had found kirsten sooner, faith wouldn\u2019t have been kidnapped at all.\" said by Adam\n\"Be nice. You and chance actually have a lot in common.\" said by Faith\n\"Okay, somehow I doubt that.\" said by Adam\n\"You risked your lives to save mine. So, like it or not, you\u2019re both heroes in my book.\" said by Faith\n\"No, I\u2019m no hero.\" said by Adam\n\"Give me a minute. Hey.\" said by Sharon\n\"Hey. I\u2019m sorry for the lack of manners back there.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, you\u2019ve been through a lot in the last 24 hours.\" said by Sharon\n\"I don\u2019t know. Probably another day or two. I\u2019m not sure, she\u2019s not speaking to me.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay, well, do me a favor.\" said by Sharon\n\"Mm-hmm? What\u2019s that?\" said by Adam\n\"Be kind to yourself.\" said by Sharon\n\"You know, elena recommended that same thing. H-how do you do that? How do you be so generous after what I\u2019ve done to you in the past, sharon? I let you think you lost a baby. A lot of people would say I deserve to be going through every bit of hell that I\u2019m going through right now.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay, if anybody says that to you, they have no decency. A lot of people have been through the kind of loss you\u2019ve suffered and no one deserves that.\" said by Sharon\n\"Your stance on this wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with the fact that you have someone eagerly waiting in the wings to jump behind nicholas\u2019 desk, would it?\" said by Nikki\n\"Mom, let me say this again. This is not some attempt to remove nicholas from the company permanently. He is far too valuable for that. It\u2019s merely a tactical move for newman and it\u2019s in nick\u2019s best interest.\" said by Victoria\n\"And if you care about his best interest, you will see that it needs to be his choice.\" said by Nikki\n\"This a bad time?\" said by Nate\n\"It\u2019s perfect timing, as usual.\" said by Victoria\n\"Nikki. Oh, I\u2019m sorry if I\u2019m interrupting you.\" said by Nate\n\"No, no. Good morning. I, uh, just had some ideas I want to run by victoria.\" said by Nikki\n\"Uh, ideas for newman media or newman enterprises?\" said by Nikki\n\"Uh, for my purview, newman media, of course. I would never presume to suggest ideas for the parent company when victoria does such a great job of leading us.\" said by Nate\n\"Ah. Spoken like a man in favor of her agenda regarding nicholas.\" said by Nikki\n\"I remember victoria bringing up the matter of nick\u2019s leave to you and victor, but I don\u2019t know of any agenda.\" said by Nate\n\"Did adam know you felt this way before you went to the hospital?\" said by Nick\n\"I mean, it all happened so fast. But I mean, even if there was time, there\u2019s no way that I was letting myself think that things could have gone like this.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s no way adam, you know, had any idea it would end like this either. But if I know my brother, I know, in that moment, he was focused on you, sally. He was trying to calm you down and help you through this. But when you lost consciousness, he was all his own, he\u2026 he was faced with the worst possible scenario. It\u2019s an impossible choice. So, he went with his first instinct. That instinct to say he loves you. He will always, always put you first.\" said by Nick\n\"I have to ask. Faced with your own impossible choice\u2026 would you have saved sharon over faith?\" said by Sally\n\"Like you said\u2026 it\u2019s not the same situation.\" said by Nick\n\"You would\u2019ve just saved faith, wouldn\u2019t you? A girl with her whole life ahead of her. Would you have saved my little girl, too? Trelegy for copd.\" said by Sally\n\"All right. I have a meeting, so I will speak with you later. And I know how you get when you\u2019ve made your mind up about something.\" said by Nikki\n\"I will take that under advisement.\" said by Victoria\n\"And if you insist on forcing this, don\u2019t count on me to back you up. Nate.\" said by Nikki\n\"I apologize for my mother. That was borderline rude.\" said by Victoria\n\"Something tells me she\u2019s not too keen on the idea of me picking up the slack if nick takes that leave.\" said by Nate\n\"But that\u2019s not mom\u2019s call to make. My brother needs to take some personal time off. And I want you more involved in the bigger corporate picture.\" said by Victoria\n\"I like the sound of that.\" said by Nate\n\"Don\u2019t do that, adam, okay? Don\u2019t try to look for reasons to say that this is karma or payback or some kind of cosmic judgment of your past because it\u2019s not. This was a medical emergency. You\u2013 you are capable of\u2013 of a lot of love and compassion, even if you don\u2019t want anyone to know about it.\" said by Sharon\n\"Okay, I am not feeling very loving or compassionate right now.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay, well, that\u2019s understandable. You\u2019ve been through quite a loss and it\u2019s gonna take some time to get over.\" said by Sharon\n\"Get over? My baby died because of me. My one true pure bond with sally is gone and she hates me for it, and I don\u2019t blame her.\" said by Adam\n\"Sorry, let me just take this.\" said by Nick\n\"Mom told me about sharon and faith, and about sally losing the baby.\" said by Victoria\n\"It\u2019s been a rough couple days, I\u2019m sure you can imagine.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, that\u2019s why I feel bad asking you this given everything you\u2019re dealing with, but\u2026 is there any way that you can come by the office later? There are some things that we need to discuss.\" said by Victoria\n\"[ Sighing ] Vic, it\u2019s got to be tomorrow, all right? I\u2019m with sally in the hospital.\" said by Nick\n\"Just go do what you need to do.\" said by Sally\n\"I don\u2019t want to leave you.\" said by Nick\n\"No, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m exhausted. I\u2013 I need to get some sleep anyway.\" said by Sally\n\"Nick?\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m here. Um, yeah. All right. I\u2019ll, uh\u2013 I\u2019ll swing by the office, but I got to go out and check on sharon and faith first.\" said by Nick\n\"All right. I appreciate it. I\u2019ll see you later.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah. I hate leaving you.\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2019m okay, really. I\u2019m half asleep anyway.\" said by Sally\n\"Look, I don\u2019t wanna talk about adam.\" said by Sally\n\"He loved that little girl as much as you do, sally. His dreams for her were just as big.\" said by Nick\n\"God, you\u2019re such a good man, standing up for your brother whether or not he deserves it.\" said by Sally\n\"He does. And I\u2019m not just saying it for his sake, all right? Yours too. With everything that\u2019s going on, you don\u2019t need the added stress of hating adam right now. I promise you, if you can find some way to let that go, you will heal faster. I\u2019ve been thinking about what\u2019s important to me. You\u2019re important to me. And I love you. And I don\u2019t know how you feel about this, but when you get out of here\u2026 what would you say to moving in with me?\" said by Nick\n\"You want to live together?\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, I do. But don\u2019t decide right now. Take some time and think about it, all right? Sometimes, the lows of bipolar depression\" said by Nick\n\"\u201cThe young and the restless\u201d will continue.\" said by Announcer\n\"Medicinal sugar and caffeine. Call me if you need to talk.\" said by Sharon\n\"Hey. Have you, uh, been to the hospital?\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah, I have.\" said by Nick\n\"Sally was, uh, asleep when I got there. I mean, how\u2019s she doing? How does she seem?\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, you know, she\u2019s, uh\u2013 she\u2019s going through a rough time.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Scoffs ] Yeah. Because of me.\" said by Adam\n\"Because of events that were out of your control. Look, I\u2019ve already told you, I think you made the best decision in the moment that you could.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, and she never wants to talk to me again. You know, if I could talk to her, if I could make her understand the situation\u2013\" said by Adam\n\"Look, adam, if I were you, I would just give her some space, all right? She needs some time to deal with her emotions. See ya.\" said by Nick\n\"My heart goes out to him.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, me too. I mean, we know as well as anyone, losing a kid is just the worst thing in the world.\" said by Nick\n\"We came very close to that again last night.\" said by Sharon\n\"But we didn\u2019T. Because you\u2019re a badass mama bear. And you did what you needed to do to save our daughter. There she is. Oh, you don\u2019t mind if I just sort of hang on for really long time, right?\" said by Nick\n\"[ Laughing ] Dad.\" said by Faith\n\"How you doing?\" said by Nick\n\"Considering everything? Great. So, I don\u2019t want you to freak out when I tell you I want to get out of here.\" said by Faith\n\"Yeah, go ahead. It\u2019s a slow morning. Go home, go do whatever you want.\" said by Sharon\n\"I mean genoa city.\" said by Faith\n\"Wait, what? You want to leave town?\" said by Nick\n\"I thought that I might be able to still pick up a summer class, get a head start on next fall or get a job near campus.\" said by Faith\n\"Well, you have been through a major trauma. I don\u2019t know if right now is a good time to be making big decisions.\" said by Sharon\n\"I\u2019m with your mom on this.\" said by Nick\n\"It\u2019s just\u2026 that man was in our house. He was here. He found me at chancellor park. Now\u2026 everywhere I look, or I go\u2026\" said by Faith\n\"Well, it\u2019s not that healthy to just run away from the memories.\" said by Sharon\n\"I\u2019m not running away. I just want to live my normal life again. Be normal again with my friends. I promise. I\u2019m not flipping out or gonna do anything crazy. I can handle this. And I have amazing parents who are a phone call away.\" said by Faith\n\"Well, she\u2019s not wrong. I mean, we are amazing.\" said by Nick\n\"So, is that a yes?\" said by Faith\n\"Yeah, if this is what you really want.\" said by Sharon\n\"It is.\" said by Faith\n\"And you promise to call every day-ish?\" said by Sharon\n\"[ Whispers ] Every day.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, you know. Okay, I guess we can live with that.\" said by Sharon\n\"Thank you.\" said by Faith\n\"Your mother isn\u2019t too happy about this decision. And I doubt victor will be pleased. Are you sure this is the move you want to make?\" said by Nate\n\"You know I haven\u2019t made this decision lightly. Nicholas has been through such hell in the last few days. There\u2019s no way, given the trauma that he suffered, that he\u2019s gonna be able to do his job. He needs time to heal. So, I\u2019m just\u2013\" said by Victoria\n\"You aren\u2019t afraid he\u2019ll see this not as a sister looking out for him, but as some unilateral move to remove him as coo? Because you will have a battle on your hands.\" said by Nate\n\"That\u2019s not a battle I want to fight.\" said by Victoria\n\"It\u2019s not easy being at the top.\" said by Nate\n\"It\u2019s a lot easier when you have somebody that you trust by your side.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, I will let you prepare for this meeting and I will come back later with those ideas of mine which were, in fact, for newman enterprises, not newman media.\" said by Nate\n\"No, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s what\u2019s always impressed me about you. Thinking big. You\u2019re always two steps ahead. Like what you did with the door.\" said by Victoria\n\"What do you mean?\" said by Nate\n\"I know that you closed it so we could have some privacy.\" said by Victoria\n\"I know that you don\u2019t want to\u2026 see me, but\u2026 I couldn\u2019t stay away, I\u2013 I had to come. Had to talk to you, and\u2026 try to explain.\" said by Adam\n\"[ Clears throat ] So, um, where are we on the white paper for the streamer that you\u2019re interested in newman acquiring?\" said by Victoria\n\"You will have it by the end of the day. Audra\u2019s all over it.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah, I saw you two with your heads together at the club last night.\" said by Victoria\n\"You should have joined us.\" said by Nate\n\"No, it looked like you were in the middle of something, I didn\u2019t want to interrupt. Besides, it\u2019s not like we hadn\u2019t spent the entire evening together.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, and I\u2019m so sad it had to end. Audra is actually working on the white paper, and I had some questions.\" said by ", "answer": "Nate"}
{"content": "\"Hello, stranger.\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019ve been out of touch, but I can explain.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, I hope you don\u2019t think we have to be joined at the hip. But what\u2019s going on?\" said by Sally\n\"I had my hands full of something that\u2019s not nearly as fun as being here with you. But I\u2019m here now, and I want to hear everything. How\u2019s baby girl? Is she still doing somersaults in there?\" said by Nick\n\"Actually, things could be better.\" said by Sally\n\"I thought I smelled you baking something. What\u2019s going on?\" said by Faith\n\"I\u2019m cleaning and baking.\" said by Sharon\n\"To distract yourself from current events?\" said by Faith\n\"It had to be done. Now is as good a time as any. Are you in the mood for some cookies or some croquet? How are your roommates doing?\" said by Sharon\n\"Completely freaked out for me. Sad for borgnine. He didn\u2019t deserve that. And they\u2019re worried about you.\" said by Faith\n\"Me? Why?\" said by Sharon\n\"When the mom who sends the best care packages is in trouble, the ladies at five west give a damn.\" said by Faith\n\"Are you worried?\" said by Sharon\n\"I mean, it does kind of feel like we\u2019re living in a horror movie. Dead cat and a stalker? Just don\u2019t go in the basement.\" said by Faith\n\"That\u2019s not going to happen, okay? We\u2019re going to sort this out.\" said by Sharon\n\"What the\u2013 mom.\" said by Faith\n\"Are you expecting anyone?\" said by Sharon\n\"You?\" said by Faith\n\"No.\" said by Sharon\n\"Thank you for meeting me.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah, I had a few minutes. I\u2019m assuming this is about phyllis?\" said by Chance\n\"Have you heard anything yet?\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, you\u2019ll be the third or fourth person to know.\" said by Chance\n\"What would it take to call off the all-points bulletin?\" said by Summer\n\"Already told you. Bring her in.\" said by Chance\n\"Treating her like she\u2019s a threat to public safety, it\u2019s giving the wrong\u2013\" said by Summer\n\"Look, she killed a man, summer.\" said by Chance\n\"Not by choice. It was kill or be killed.\" said by Summer\n\"All right, well, we need to hear the full story from her. Now, if that\u2019s all you have to talk about, I got a lot of stuff to do.\" said by Chance\n\"No, wait. I\u2013 I\u2019m just\u2013 I\u2019m trying to picture it in my head so that I can manage my expectations.\" said by Summer\n\"For what?\" said by Chance\n\"My mom\u2019s return. I mean, I didn\u2019t think that it was possible for so long.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah. You, uh\u2013 you got lucky.\" said by Chance\n\"I got lucky?\" said by Summer\n\"You have to call me back, supergirl. Even if it\u2019s bad news, please call me back.\" said by Phyllis\n\"I meant what I said. For every aspect of planning a wedding, there are too many choices. I give up.\" said by Diane\n\"So, you\u2019re okay with exchanging vows in a cow pasture?\" said by Jack\n\"[ Laughs ] With goats and hens as our guests? I don\u2019t know. They might be better behaved than some.\" said by Diane\n\"Wedding planning? I\u2019m going to get as far away from here as possible.\" said by Kyle\n\"Seems like only yesterday that you were planning your own vow renewal ceremony.\" said by Jack\n\"Ah, I loved that setting. It was so romantic, until tucker landed a helicopter in the backyard. Oh, we wanted to ask harrison to be our ring bearer.\" said by Diane\n\"I\u2019m sure he would love that, but he was our ring bearer.\" said by Kyle\n\"Is that a problem?\" said by Jack\n\"Dad, if I were you, I would do the exact opposite of what summer and I did. I think our vow renewal ceremony was bad luck. Everything was going along just fine, and then\u2026\" said by Kyle\n\"Hey, hey. What\u2019s gotten into you? Why are you talking like this?\" said by Jack\n\"Additional\" said by Announcer\n\"Kyle, is there something going on you want to talk to us about?\" said by Jack\n\"No. Nothing. There is nothing I want to talk about. In fact, I don\u2019t want any of this happening in my life at all, nothing\u2013 nothing feels right.\" said by Kyle\n\"Because of summer? You two are such a team. Is she still sleeping in the pool house?\" said by Diane\n\"We have a lot going on.\" said by Kyle\n\"I know, I know, and I\u2019m really sorry about that.\" said by Diane\n\"Anyway, I\u2013 I\u2013 this should be a happy time for y\u2019all and I don\u2019t wanna bring you down.\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, you know that parents can\u2019t be happy unless their children are. Even an adult child.\" said by Diane\n\"Yeah, I\u2019d better go.\" said by Kyle\n\"Hey, you want some company?\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, I\u2019m just gonna go to work. I have to solve a few problems there.\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle. We love you.\" said by Diane\n\"Knock, knock. Is anybody home? Guess who forgot their key.\" said by Mariah\n\"Mariah.\" said by Sharon\n\"Hey! I\u2019m so, so sorry. I forgot my key at home and I didn\u2019t think that I would be interrupting a croquet match?\" said by Mariah\n\"Um, I was just cleaning out a closet.\" said by Sharon\n\"Mom, if you were really that scared, you should have called the police.\" said by Mariah\n\"Next time, say something sooner, so we don\u2019t have to panic.\" said by Faith\n\"I\u2019m sorry\u2013\" said by Mariah\n\"You know that cameron is still out there.\" said by Faith\n\"I know, I know. I\u2013 I wasn\u2019t thinking.\" said by Mariah\n\"This just has us all on edge, which is why I want to apologize for what I\u2019m about to say.\" said by Sharon\n\"What?\" said by Faith\n\"Faith, I think it\u2019s time you leave.\" said by Sharon\n\"I\u2019m so sorry I wasn\u2019t here.\" said by Nick\n\"You have a life.\" said by Sally\n\"You\u2019re a big part of that life.\" said by Nick\n\"And I want to hear all about it.\" said by Sally\n\"It\u2019s not a contest. Ladies first. What\u2019s going on?\" said by Nick\n\"Don\u2019t be alarmed. Doctor says we are not in the danger zone yet.\" said by Sally\n\"Already not liking this conversation.\" said by Nick\n\"What exactly do you know about pre-eclampsia?\" said by Sally\n\"Unfortunately, a lot. I\u2019ve been down this road. Elevated blood pressure in pregnancies can lead to complications.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, well, um, I don\u2019t have it\u2026 yet. And as long as I keep my blood pressure down, and maybe, get, I don\u2019t know, approved for some prenatal yoga classes, then\u2026\" said by Sally\n\"You sure you\u2019re okay?\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah. Yeah, and I\u2019m gonna keep it that way, you know? Very, very peaceful. Very calm. If I could just meditate this headache away.\" said by Sally\n\"Did you tell your doctor about that?\" said by Nick\n\"Yes, yeah. They said it could be from my medication, so I\u2019m just going to grit my teeth and bear it.\" said by Sally\n\"You\u2019re just gonna tough it out.\" said by Nick\n\"For now, yeah.\" said by Sally\n\"What can I do? What do you need from me?\" said by Nick\n\"Just you being here makes me feel better. I\u2019ve told you this before, but you\u2019re like magic.\" said by Sally\n\"I wish that trick worked in every other part of my life.\" said by Nick\n\"What fire were you putting out whenever I was trying to track you down?\" said by Sally\n\"Trying to figure out what will stress you more. Knowing or not knowing.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Sighs ] Okay. Cards on the table. All of \u2019em.\" said by Sally\n\"Okay. Several years ago, sharon and i put away a very bad man, but now he\u2019s back and he is dangerous. (Tap, tap)\" said by Nick\n\"You want me to leave? I can\u2019t abandon you. That\u2019s against family policy. Tell her, mariah.\" said by Faith\n\"You\u2019re going to have to give me the updated terms, \u2019cause I don\u2019t really know what rule she\u2019s breaking.\" said by Mariah\n\"Times get tough, we stick together.\" said by Faith\n\"If anything happened to you, do you think I\u2019d be able to forgive myself?\" said by Sharon\n\"But I can protect myself.\" said by Faith\n\"He knows who you are, where to find you. He knows how much you mean to me.\" said by Sharon\n\"You\u2019re her achilles heel.\" said by Mariah\n\"He knows that I would do anything for you and he is evil enough to use that against me.\" said by Sharon\n\"And as a newly minted member of the mom club, mom\u2019s gonna be a lot stronger knowing that you\u2019re safe.\" said by Mariah\n\"But\u2013 no. Don\u2019t you see?\" said by Faith\n\"I\u2019ll be fine.\" said by Sharon\n\"You won\u2019t because you\u2019ll be alone.\" said by Faith\n\"What are you talking about?\" said by Sharon\n\"If I leave, who is going to protect you? How the heck did he get past security? And what if it happens again? We don\u2019t have rey anymore, mom. Mariah\u2019s busy with the baby. Who\u2019s gonna be here to play croquet? Or hold your hand when you\u2019re scared, huh?\" said by Faith\n\"I will be fine.\" said by Sharon\n\"You always say that.\" said by Faith\n\"That\u2019s because it\u2019s always true. Besides, I have nick, your grandparents, and the security team here is actually quite top tier.\" said by Sharon\n\"But he got past them anyways, which means cameron is really that dangerous.\" said by Faith\n\"I love that you want to protect me, but that\u2019s not your job.\" said by Sharon\n\"Sorry, kid.\" said by Mariah\n\"I want you someplace safe, okay? So I don\u2019t have to worry about you.\" said by Sharon\n\"You can\u2019t just push me away like that. This is so not fair.\" said by Faith\n\"Faith, do this for me.\" said by Sharon\n\"I will go, but I\u2019m not happy about it. When I text, I want answers immediately, or I\u2019m calling emergency numbers and I\u2019m on the next plane back.\" said by Faith\n\"Well, thanks for the warning.\" said by Sharon\n\"And the second that psycho is back behind bars, I\u2019m coming home. I mean it.\" said by Faith\n\"Yeah.\" said by Sharon\n\"It was self-defense. He coerced her into doing everything she did. I mean\u2013 chance, you know my mom, she\u2019s not a criminal. She was doing what she had to do to survive.\" said by Summer\n\"Like I said, it would help to hear all of this from phyllis.\" said by Chance\n\"Why don\u2019t you interview nate hastings and elena dawson? I mean, they were there. They were at the gala, they examined my mom, and they said, in their medical opinions, she was in distress. I mean, that\u2019s gotta mean something, right?\" said by Summer\n\"Just gonna help explain some things\u2013\" said by Chance\n\"He drugged her! He gave something to her that affected her physically and mentally. I mean, how else would he have gotten her to go along with this scheme?\" said by Summer\n\"You don\u2019t know that for a fact.\" said by Chance\n\"But it\u2019s possible. Shadow of a doubt, it could help strengthen her case.\" said by Summer\n\"Look, the only thing that we found in her system was the poison, that\u2019s it.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, did they check for an agent that could have affected her brain? Did they check for that?\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, there is no evidence to back up phyllis\u2019 side of the story, none.\" said by Chance\n\"Chance, she\u2019s been through enough, I just want her to be able to come home.\" said by Summer\n\"You do know that any actions you take could result in you being treated as an accessory?\" said by Chance\n\"I don\u2019t scare easily anymore. The only thing that really scares me is the idea of losing my mom forever because I\u2019ve been through that once, and that was enough.\" said by Summer\n\"Look, summer, in the eyes of the law\u2013\" said by Chance\n\"Oh, you mean, in the eyes of christine. \u2018Cause she\u2019s the problem, right? She\u2019s got a vendetta against my mom.\" said by Summer\n\"This case has nothing to do with personal grievances.\" said by Chance\n\"Are you new here?\" said by Summer\n\"Okay, so you don\u2019t think she can be fair?\" said by Chance\n\"I think that christine has the opportunity to publicly humiliate my mom. Sure, justice might be blind, but our enemies don\u2019t forget. And that\u2019s when you\u2019re\u2013 you\u2019re supposed to be able to turn to your friends, and I\u2013 chance, I\u2019m just asking you is there anything that you can do?\" said by Summer\n\"So, I gave the guy a very strongly-worded suggestion that he leave town immediately. We will see how brave he is.\" said by Nick\n\"Did this suggestion have anything to do with your knuckles?\" said by Sally\n\"Nobody got hurt. And I can take care of myself. Right now, I\u2019m more concerned about you. Are those tears in your eyes?\" said by Nick\n\"It\u2019s just the cat. And your hand. Gosh, this is the saddest thing I\u2019ve ever heard.\" said by Sally\n\"I probably shouldn\u2019t have brought up the cat.\" said by Nick\n\"I mean, who does that? Seriously, the poor thing was so defenseless, I\u2013 god, what a monster.\" said by Sally\n\"The cat was just a message letting us know that he can get to us whenever he wants.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, that guy better hope that I never see him.\" said by Sally\n\"Listen to me, sally. If you do see him, you run. You call the police, okay? You don\u2019t talk to him, you don\u2019t even catch him looking at you.\" said by Nick\n\"Okay, well, what does he look like?\" said by Sally\n\"Here.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, my god. I know him.\" said by Sally\n\"You recognize him? You saw him? Where?\" said by Nick\n\"In the park. I met him. Oh, my god.\" said by Sally\n\"I need you to tell me everything cameron said or did. Did he say or do anything that made you feel threatened?\" said by Nick\n\"No. He couldn\u2019t have been nicer. You\u2019re the one that\u2019s scaring me.\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just, if you knew this guy the way I do\u2013\" said by Nick\n\"He was like, two feet away from me.\" said by Sally\n\"This face?\" said by Nick\n\"Yes. Absolutely.\" said by Sally\n\"Tell me everything.\" said by Nick\n\"Okay, well, I was walking through the park when I got dizzy, double vision.\" said by Sally\n\"Right.\" said by Nick\n\"And then, a man, this man, just came up to me\u2013\" said by Sally\n\"Son of a bitch!\" said by Nick\n\"And he asked me if I was okay, and I\u2013 I told him that I had someone else to call.\" said by Sally\n\"Then you called me?\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, and then, he stayed with me until help came.\" said by Sally\n\"That guy?\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah. He was nice.\" said by Sally\n\"He\u2019s not nice, sally. He\u2019s not. All right, cameron kirsten is dangerous as hell.\" said by Nick\n\"Okay, well, he couldn\u2019t possibly know that you and I are together.\" said by Sally\n\"He is thorough. He is making his way into sharon\u2019s inner circle. I mean, he showed himself to you and to faith.\" said by Nick\n\"Okay, okay, but there\u2019s no way that this guy could\u2019ve staged to be my knight in shining armor. I mean, he was in the right place at the right time. It was a coincidence. It wasn\u2019t some targeted strike.\" said by Sally\n\"How can you be sure of that?\" said by Nick\n\"First of all, no one could have possibly known that I was gonna get dizzy. Not even me. And I have also staged a few accidental meet and greets in the past, I know what it looks like, I know what it takes. This was not choreographed. He had no idea who I was.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, we need to make sure it stays that way.\" said by Nick\n\"Here you go.\" said by Diane\n\"Thank you. Kyle\u2019s right, you know.\" said by Jack\n\"About the curse of vow renewals?\" said by Diane\n\"No, we need to get back to the business of planning our wedding.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Sighs ] Did you get the feeling that there\u2019s more going on with him than he\u2019s telling us?\" said by Diane\n\"Kyle is a grown man entitled to keep the details of his marriage to himself.\" said by Jack\n\"Yes, but how can we help him if don\u2019t know what the problem is?\" said by Diane\n\"By staying out of it.\" said by Jack\n\"This is all phyllis\u2019 fault.\" said by Diane\n\"Look, all we can do is be here for kyle when he needs us. In the meantime, we have other problems brewing.\" said by Jack\n\"I kickbox and I know how to use my pepper spray.\" said by Mariah\n\"At the same time? I\u2019m scared.\" said by Kyle\n\"Oh, kyle.\" said by Mariah\n\"What was that warning for? Everything all right?\" said by Kyle\n\"No, it wasn\u2019t\u2013 it wasn\u2019t a warning, it was\u2013 listing my special skills. You know, like you do at the end of a resume. I juggle, I waterski, I speak french.\" said by Mariah\n\"None of which is true.\" said by Kyle\n\"Like you don\u2019t lie on your resume, kyle?\" said by Mariah\n\"Oh, in terms of special skills, I got you beat. I know how to marry the woman of my dreams and turn her into the invisible woman with a heart of stone.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m so sorry, I don\u2019t mean to laugh, it\u2019s just\u2013 you look awful. Like you\u2019ve been sleeping on the wrong side of the bed.\" said by Mariah\n\"God, that\u2019s odd, \u2019cause I\u2019ve had the whole bed to myself.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2013 what can I say? Grief is\u2013 is rough.\" said by Mariah\n\"It\u2019s true. But summer stopped grieving a long time ago.\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, it\u2019s been three months. Her mother just died.\" said by Mariah\n\"Mariah, can you keep a secret?\" said by Kyle\n\"Why would you ask me that? You know I can\u2019t keep a secret.\" said by Mariah\n\"Well, you have to keep this one.\" said by Kyle\n\"Um, okay. Yes, I can do that for you. So, what\u2019s happening?\" said by Mariah\n\"It feels like everything\u2019s happening. And what I do next will change the course of my and summer\u2019s lives.\" said by Kyle\n\"Hi. Oh, gosh. I\u2019ve been texting you like a crazy person.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Well, I have been busy.\" said by Summer\n\"I should think so after kyle showing up here.\" said by Phyllis\n\"I have bad news.\" said by Summer\n\"All right. How bad?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Everything is about to hit the fan.\" said by Summer\n\"Everything everything? Okay. You told kyle the whole truth, didn\u2019t you? ( )\" said by Phyllis\n\"The young and the restless will continue. And we\u2019re done.\" said by Announcer\n\"You look like you need to go.\" said by Sally\n\"I really do. I have to check on sharon and faith. If I leave you here alone, will you be okay?\" said by Nick\n\"Um, yes. Yeah, yeah. I will be extra careful and I already have the voice assistant programmed on my phone. All I have to do is\u2013 hold on, watch this. Call nick.\" said by Sally\n\"I mean, extra points for ingenuity. I\u2019m not kidding. If you see this man again, you treat him like he is poison, okay?\" said by Nick\n\"Okay. But the same goes for you. Please don\u2019t get into any more fist fights. Even if it is just an innocent wall.\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2019ve called in backup. The right people are on alert. My dad\u2019s security team, gcpd, they\u2019re on this. Cameron kirsten\u2019s time is up.\" said by Nick\n\"So that\u2019s what\u2019s been going on. What do you think I should do?\" said by Kyle\n\"No, you\u2013 you can\u2019t ask me to do that.\" said by ", "answer": "Mariah"}

I know we\u2019ve had our chance, the two of us, to celebrate our good fortune. We told summer and kyle. We told my sister traci.

Everyone we know and love will all be there.\" said by Jack\n\"Genoa city\u2019s bicentennial?\" said by Diane\n\"What is more glamorous than a gala?\" said by Jack\n\"[ Exhales sharply ] Some people have minor joint pain plus stomach problems.\" said by Diane\n\"Are you sure you want to go so public with our news?\" said by Diane\n\"Why not go big?

What did she want?\" said by Jack\n\"Well, she said she was meeting summer, and then she got a text from summer saying they were meeting somewhere else.\" said by Diane\n\"Well, I think it\u2019s normal for summer to have second thoughts about inviting her here.\" said by Jack\n\"No, it was just so soon after seeing phyllis and jeremy together, you know? And her behavior was really off. Well, more off than usual. Jack, I don\u2019t know what it is, but I am pretty sure the two of them are up to something.\" said by Diane\n\"I mean, I know exactly what this woman\u2019s gonna do.

I\u2019m not gonna be able to help you with either of those scenarios.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah, me neither. I guess we\u2019re going to have to do some research, try to figure out what it\u2019s like to be raised by a difficult, nontraditional, maternal type.\" said by Chelsea\n\"That\u2019s gonna be tough.\" said by Daniel\n\"I really think if we put our heads together, we can come up with a magical world where we help people navigate certain pitfalls and help them come out the other side.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Thanks to omega sphere.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah.

Have you talked to him? I haven\u2019T.\" said by Diane\n\"Well, not about that specifically. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s just worried it\u2019s too good to be true.

So, perhaps I should be the one to end it.\" said by Jill\n\"Jill, what\u2019s going on?\" said by Lily\n\"There seems to be a new development in our case.\" said by Amanda\n\"Perhaps this would be the perfect time for a break.\" said by Jill\n\"After the one we\" said by Ms. Shannon\n\"Oh. Well, I know it\u2019s extraordinary, but how about a mini break? Okay? And then I can explain things to everyone.\" said by Jill\n\"We\u2019re just returning from a recess.\" said by Christine\n\"If there was a chance to avoid litigation so you could seek a mutually beneficial outcome, you should have done it before you started arbitration.\" said by Ms. Shannon\n\"You know what? You are absolutely right. Devon, lily, this is urgent.

Where do you want to go?\" said by Lily\n\"Hang on a second. Just \u2014 can you tell us what this is about, please?\" said by Devon\n\"If I could just have a few words with my client?\" said by Christine\n\"Yeah.

That meant a lot to me.\" said by Jack\n\"She was a decent woman, jack. Just not a mother. I hope you found it in your heart to forgive her.\" said by Mamie\n\"You talked to me a lot about forgiveness back in the day. Yeah. Yeah, we found peace before dina died. I took it pretty hard. Seems like I\u2019ve just come out of it lately. Last few months.\" said by Jack\n\"Hmm. You\u2019re in love, jackie.\" said by Mamie\n\"Wow. You can still read me like a book.\" said by Jack\n\"Diane?\" said by Mamie\n\"Yes, diane. Oh, I want you to meet the woman she has become.

But that does not matter. You are in love and you\u2019re happy. And I can see that. Now, that\u2019s all that matters.\" said by Mamie\n\"I hope I didn\u2019t keep you waiting long.\" said by Diane\n\"Oh, not a problem.

She knows how dangerous that man is.\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, and guess who i saw today with the never-even-left stark. None other than your mother-in-law.\" said by Diane\n\"[ Sighs ] Okay.\" said by Kyle\n\"What are you doing?\" said by Diane\n\"Letting summer know we have more irrefutable proof that her mother has teamed up with a monster.\" said by Kyle\n\"You\u2019re confident? So, let me get this straight. You think you\u2019re just gonna walk into the party and then walk out and no one\u2019s gonna be the wiser?\" said by Phyllis\n\"There\u2019s nothing to worry about. It\u2019s what I do.\" said by Jeremy\n\"I have a lot on the line here.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Okay. I\u2019ll be keeping a careful eye on you behind the mask.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Okay. If any element of this plan goes awry \u2014\" said by Phyllis\n\"I am aware that things need to happen with clockwork precision. And it will.\" said by Jeremy\n\"This is life or death for me.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Okay, we are both taking huge risks here, okay? And I\u2019m not going back to prison.\" said by Jeremy\n\"[ Voice breaking ] It\u2019s my daughter.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Hey. What\u2019s going on? Are you having a change of heart? I\u2019m not a doctor.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Amanda. I bet you had a lot of fun today going after me and tearing me down in front of everyone, didn\u2019t you?\" said by Devon\n\"If you think that, you can add me to the long list of things that you will never understand.\" said by Amanda\n\"Well, did i misunderstand when you said that watching me fail was one of the perks of your job?\" said by Devon\n\"[ Scoffs ] You know, every time I had to point out your flaws, highlight your shortcomings, put your lack of loyalty on display, it was a painful reminder of the pain that you caused me because I failed at choosing a good man, one that would respect me and love me and not humiliate me in such a hurtful way. I mean, abby. Abby, of all people. You know, I have to admit, i never saw that coming. And cheating? I remembered how broken you were when elena cheated on you with nate. I helped you pick up the pieces, remember? I thought you didn\u2019t give your heart so easily to anyone. But here we are. So, no, devon, I take no pleasure in any of this. I hate remembering how deeply you hurt me. You know, I really \u2014 I thought you were a good man.

Thanks for letting me know.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah, and there\u2019s something else I\u2019d like to talk to you about.\" said by Diane\n\"The engagement.\" said by Kyle\n\"I was wondering if you\u2019d given any more thought to the fact that your parents are finally getting married.\" said by Diane\n\"Maybe we should discuss this together, the three of us, so there\u2019s no misunderstandings.\" said by Kyle\n\"So, you\u2019re living in this big place all by yourself?\" said by Mamie\n\"Uh, not exactly.

I guess.\" said by Mamie\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Jack\n\"Well, ashley\u2019s probably happy as a clam that you\u2019re about to marry diane, isn\u2019t she?\" said by Mamie\n\"Oh, yeah, she \u2014 she\u2019s just thrilled. I was hoping I could get them to sign a peace treaty, but that doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s gonna happen.\" said by Jack\n\"Sounds like fun.\" said by Mamie\n\"Oh, yeah, it\u2019s a regular barrel of monkeys, mame.\" said by Jack\n\"Hey, jack! You get my voicemail? Let\u2019s talk!\" said by Billy\n\"[ Gasps ]\" said by Mamie\n\"Mamie? Oh, my goodness, mamie.\" said by Billy\n\"Billy abbott, look at you, all grown up! You have your father\u2019s eyes.\" said by Mamie\n\"Oh, my goodness. Come here. It is so great to see you. Everyone is gonna be thrilled that you are here.\" said by Billy\n\"Like your mother?\" said by Mamie\n\"She\u2019ll be pretty far down that list.\" said by Billy\n\"Mm. How is she?\" said by Mamie\n\"She is about the same as she\u2019s always been.\" said by Billy\n\"Mnh, that\u2019s too bad.\" said by Mamie\n\"[ Laughs ]\" said by Billy\n\"Mamie, your room is ready.

It feels like home.\" said by Mamie\n\"Did you know this was happening?\" said by Billy\n\"I had no idea. She just showed up. She\u2019s here for the gala.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, finally a reason to go to the gala.\" said by Billy\n\"Is the purpose of your visit \u2014 does it have anything to do with my job offer?\" said by Jack\n\"Yes, it does, jack. Put me in. I\u2019m ready.\" said by Billy\n\"Wait. At jabot? Are you serious? I know you left chancellor-winters to get away from the business world.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, I know, but I\u2019ve been \u2014 been thinking a lot about this, and, uh, it feels like the right time. You know, with everything that I\u2019ve seen and everything that I\u2019ve learned, I actually think I\u2019ll do the old man proud this time around. You know, mamie says I have his eyes, so I feel like that\u2019s a good start.\" said by Billy\n\"There has been a change in you. I think it has something to do with hanging around chelsea.\" said by Jack\n\"Why do you say that?\" said by Billy\n\"I don\u2019t know. You\u2019re more mature, more centered, more thoughtful.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Chuckles ] Well, maybe I finally figured out what I want to do when i grow up.\" said by Billy\n\"Oh, no, no, no, no, don\u2019t pass over this with a joke. I mean it. You feel like you\u2019ve changed?\" said by Jack\n\"I don\u2019t know. You know, I\u2019ve shared a little bit with you about everything that chelsea has been going through with her anxiety and her depression, you know? She\u2019s been through hell, and I\u2019ve been beside her the whole way. And, uh, you see something like that up close, the real life and death of it, you quickly realize that if it doesn\u2019t destroy you, it makes you stronger. And I hope that chelsea and i both come out on the right side of that.\" said by Billy\n\"I could not be happier for you \u2014 or for me!\" said by Jack\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Billy\n\"Everything that you\u2019ve been through \u2014 and you\u2019ve been through a lot\u2026\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah.\" said by Billy\n\"\u2026Brought you back to jabot.

Oh, no.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, that fresh air felt nice.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, is that why we went for a stroll \u2014 fresh air?

I would enjoy knowing where things stand with the sale of your company.\" said by Victor\n\"Really? You want to talk business right here, right now?\" said by Tucker\n\"No, of course I don\u2019t, and neither do you. But I\u2019m starting to get the sense that you\u2019re taunting me. So, why don\u2019t you just give me something solid?\" said by Victoria\n\"I\u2019m still weighing my options when it comes to McCall. Uh, although I do have a strong preference as to who I would like to see make the deal.\" said by Tucker\n\"These are all preliminary ideas, but they\u2019ve been flooding my brain for days, and I would love your input. Do you think they would work with the mental-health concept we\u2019re developing?\" said by Chelsea\n\"I think they all sound great. Pursue as many of them as you like.\" said by Daniel\n\"Really?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Daniel\n\"Thanks.\" said by Chelsea\n\"No. Thank you for putting so much thought into this.\" said by Daniel\n\"Do you have any idea about timelines, next best steps?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, that would be a question for Lily, who I\u2019m here with tonight, but it seems as though she\u2019s stepped away. The Newmans dedicated the lounge to Neil. They converted it into a jazz club.\" said by Daniel\n\"Aww.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s very fitting.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah. It is. Definitely worth checking out when you get a chance. But you know Lily. She got a little emotional, which is understandable. So, just wanted to give her some space.\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, that\u2019s nice. I\u2019m glad she has someone in her life who is sensitive to her feelings. Do you like\u2026\" said by Billy\n\"[ Exhales sharply ] Oh. Zippy is missing.\" said by Summer\n\"Ah.\" said by Kyle\n\"Not Harrison. Thank god.\" said by Summer\n\"Where has she looked so far?\" said by Kyle\n\"Um, Linda, Kyle wants to know where you\u2019ve looked so far. Have you checked the media room? Oh, no, trust me. We know. Harrison cannot fall asleep without that fox. I \u2014 I can barely hear you. Hold on. I\u2019m gonna go outside so that we can brainstorm. Hang on just one second.\" said by Summer\n\"Sorry.\" said by Kyle\n\"So, tell me about, um, your preferred option. Or do I already know?\" said by Victoria\n\"Tell you about my preferred option. Oh. Uh, I\u2019d like to sell to Devon. That hasn\u2019t changed.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, I see. I guess we\u2019ll just have to revisit that when he turns you down.\" said by Victoria\n\"You\u2019re on.\" said by Tucker\n\"In the meantime, uh [Chuckles] What I\u2019m really, really curious about is your role in this, Ashley. What is your angle?\" said by Victoria\n\"Why would I have to have an angle? I\u2019m just here celebrating my hometown\u2019s birthday, Victoria.\" said by Ashley\n\"I\u2019m not sure which one of you is more deceptive, really.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, that\u2019s so sweet, Victoria. Do you hear that? She\u2019s \u2014 she\u2019s compared me to you. What a lovely compliment.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yes.\" said by Ashley\n\"Gee, you seem low.\" said by Tucker\n\"Uh, mm-hmm.\" said by Ashley\n\"Would you like to get another?\" said by Tucker\n\"I would love one.\" said by Ashley\n\"Okay.\" said by Tucker\n\"Excuse us.\" said by Ashley\n\"Excuse us.\" said by Tucker\n\"What was that all about?\" said by Victor\n\"The Neil Winters Jazz Lounge.\" said by Elena\n\"Pretty fantastic, huh?\" said by Nate\n\"It is. That was really thoughtful of the Newmans.\" said by Elena\n\"Yeah, it was. Lily and Devon were so touched. You know, maybe this reminder of their dad will help things thaw a bit.\" said by Nate\n\"I\u2019d like to think it\u2019s possible.\" said by Elena\n\"[ Sighs ] Lily, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s left to say. I mean \u2014\" said by Devon\n\"Devon, what do you mean? Jill canceled the IPO. That changes everything.\" said by Lily\n\"Right. And do you know that Victor Newman is the one who convinced her to do that?\" said by Devon\n\"No. I didn\u2019t know that. She told me that a friend had helped her see a better solution. Did Jill tell you that?\" said by Lily\n\"Well, when I asked her, she made it pretty obvious. And then I saw them both with their heads together inside.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay, so, then you don\u2019t know if it were Victor then?\" said by Lily\n\"I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s an educated guess.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay. Well, I-I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it were Victor. He cares about you. He always has, since you were a teenager. Look, Devon, everything that you were worried about is gone now. You were worried about losing control of the company. That\u2019s gone. Even the people you were worried about \u2014 Nate, Audra, I mean, even Billy. They\u2019re all gone. It\u2019s just us. So, look, we can streamline operations, you know? I\u2019ll back off and give you everything that you need to do to run your division how you want.\" said by Lily\n\"And you expect me to do the same thing for you?\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. We can each run our own operations the way that we see fit. You know, we won\u2019t have shareholders breathing over our shoulders. This can finally be the united family business that we\u2019ve dreamed of\u2026 if you say yes.\" said by Lily\n\"They\u2019re not keeping it a secret any longer. They are out in the open.\" said by Michael\n\"Mm. I\u2019m not even sure they\u2019re aware that there\u2019s anyone else in this room.\" said by Lauren\n\"Hmm. Maybe we should challenge them to a dance-off.\" said by Michael\n\"Uh, wha\u2013\" said by Lauren\n\"Follow me.\" said by Michael\n\"[ Laughs ]\" said by Lauren\n\"Mm-hmm!\" said by Michael\n\"You two look like you\u2019re having the time of your life.\" said by Lauren\n\"[ Chuckles ] We are. It\u2019s a night to remember.\" said by Diane\n\"I can\u2019t tell you the last time I went out and just enjoyed music and dance. I love it.\" said by Jack\n\"And you\u2019re not rusty at all, Jack, are you?\" said by Michael\n\"[ Laughs ] He\u2019s just jealous of your grace and fluidity. In fact, he would like to challenge you to a dance-off.\" said by Lauren\n\"[ Laughs ]\" said by Diane\n\"Is that so?\" said by Jack\n\"[ Laughing ] Oh, honey!\" said by Lauren\n\"This might sound crazy, but\u2026was that Jeremy?\" said by Diane\n\"I was just thinking the same thing.\" said by Jack\n\"Have a great time.\" said by Sharon\n\"Thank you. Oh, there\u2019s Christine.\" said by Lauren\n\"Hey, Daniel.\" said by Michael\n\"Absolutely. Bye.\" said by Daniel\n\"So, you\u2019re flying solo tonight. What does Paul have on the agenda now he\u2019s the retired chief of police?\" said by Lauren\n\"Uh, actually, Paul\u2019s in Portugal. Heather and Lucy\u2019s visit wasn\u2019t long enough, so he went there to visit.\" said by Christine\n\"Ah. Well, that sounds like fun. I can\u2019t wait to see pictures.\" said by Lauren\n\"[ Chuckles ] Oh, so, do I have this right? You two are responsible for the amazing food and beverages tonight? [ Laughs ]\" said by Christine\n\"Actually, Lauren was the brains of the operation. I was on tasting duty.\" said by Michael\n\"Ah, very well done, both of you.\" said by Christine\n\"Thank you. Thank you.\" said by Lauren\n\"I know Nikki doesn\u2019t want us talking about business tonight, but, uh, I have to ask. Between you and me, how\u2019s the arbitration going?\" said by Michael\n\"I mean, do you think I\u2019m gonna tell you?\" said by Christine\n\"[ Laughs ]\" said by Lauren\n\"No, but like I said, I had to ask.\" said by Michael\n\"No, you really didn\u2019t. You didn\u2019t. Because we\u2019re not talking business tonight.\" said by Christine\n\"Okay, I can tell you this \u2014 once the case is settled, I\u2019m considering making a move.\" said by Christine\n\"What? Where?\" said by Michael\n\"My old job.\" said by Christine\n\"District attorney?\" said by Lauren\n\"Yeah, I mean, an interim basis maybe. I haven\u2019t accepted the offer, but I think it would be good for me. I, um\u2026 I need a change.\" said by Christine\n\"Thank you.

I just want to say hello.\" said by Esther\n\"Oh, good question. I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t seen Devon and Lily in a while. Huh. Maybe there\u2019s a story there. See you later.\" said by Leanna\n\"I\u2019m gonna find that man. If it really is Jeremy Stark, I\u2019m gonna throw him out of here. If it\u2019s not, it gives us some peace of mind.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, please don\u2019t confront him.\" said by Diane\n\"We don\u2019t want him wandering around this party. He\u2019s only gonna cause trouble.\" said by Jack\n\"Just wait. Wait. Um, I-I know we \u2014 we put it on hold, announcing our engagement, because we didn\u2019t want to trample on the excitement about Neil\u2019s club.\" said by Diane\n\"You having second thoughts?\" said by Jack\n\"Well\u2026you said that we\u2019d know when the time was right, and, you know, here we are, surrounded by practically everyone we know and there\u2019s buckets of Champagne flowing and I just \u2014 I just think it might be a good idea if we do it right now, don\u2019t you?\" said by Diane\n\"I\u2019m the guy who wanted to announce it to the whole world. You\u2019re the one that put the brakes on. I just went along with you.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, I\u2019ve reconsidered.\" said by Diane\n\"Well, you\u2019ll get no argument from me. That\u2019s why I want to deal with Stark \u2014 so he doesn\u2019t ruin our moment. I\u2019m just gonna talk to the club security staff, okay?\" said by Jack\n\"Alright. I\u2019ll go with you.\" said by Diane\n\"No, no, no. You \u2014 you\u2019re upset. Stay here. Take a breath.

Jack\u2026 something is bothering you. What\u2019s going on?\" said by Victor\n\"You wouldn\u2019t believe me if I told you.\" said by Jack\n\"Try me.\" said by Victor\n\"You look so serious. Is everything all right?\" said by Diane\n\"Um\u2026 you might wanna sit down.\" said by Kyle\n\"No, I\u2019ll\u2013 I\u2019ll stand. Is this about my case? Please, kyle, just\u2026 just tell me, how bad is it?\" said by Diane\n\"It\u2019s potentially good, mom. Very good. Diabetes can serve up a lot of questions,\" said by Kyle\n\"It\u2019s understandable that you would feel that way. I didn\u2019t exactly handle the breakup with your mom very well, after all.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah, no kidding.\" said by Summer\n\"Look, summer, whatever issues that we have between us, I think it\u2019s important that you know that I really respected phyllis. She was one of a kind, pure energy. That power wasn\u2019t always used for good, but with that heart of hers, she loved the hell outta you and your brother.\" said by Billy\n\"I know that my mom loves me\u2013 loved me. But that love could be\u2026 overwhelming. I mean, she\u2013 she gave so much, but she demanded a lot in return.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah. She was all or nothing. She lived life out loud and she expected everyone else to do the same, which didn\u2019t exactly make it easy for the ones that cared for her. Look, summer, I hope I\u2019m not overstepping by saying this. I know how much you loved her. But you two had your fair share of ups and downs.\" said by Billy\n\"She was so impulsive and reckless. She would act without thinking, you know? She would get something in her head and there was no talking her out of it. And she\u2019d end up hurting people she loved and hurting herself even more in the process. All because she had decided that it was her against the world, even when it wasn\u2019T.\" said by Summer\n\"That pretty much sums her up.\" said by Billy\n\"[ Scoffs ] That\u2019s the thing. It didn\u2019t have to be like that. She was never alone, not really. I was always on her side. Always. I just\u2013 I don\u2019t know why she couldn\u2019t see that.\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m all for good news, but you don\u2019t look like it\u2019s good.\" said by Diane\n\"Um, mom, there\u2013 there is a real possibility that the murder charges against you can go away.\" said by Kyle\n\"What? How? Have\u2013 have the police found evidence or proof that I\u2019m innocent?\" said by Diane\n\"No. No. Not\u2013 not exactly.\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, then how has anything changed? Kyle? Kyle, you\u2019re not going to do anything illegal to protect me, are you? Because I will not have you putting yourself at risk for me.\" said by Diane\n\"Look, the only person who has done anything illegal is phyllis.\" said by Kyle\n\"Victor, I\u2013 I know we\u2019re on better terms these days, but trust only goes so far.\" said by Jack\n\"Uh-huh. Now, jack, you and I have known each other for a long time. Okay? Something is going on. What\u2019s bothering you?\" said by Victor\n\"Let it go, please?\" said by Jack\n\"Maybe you\u2019re waiting for your fianc\u00e9e to join you. However, she is wearing a beautiful ankle bracelet, courtesy of the authority.\" said by Victor\n\"Not for long.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, yeah? What are they doing now? Issuing get-out-of-jail-free cards to murderers?\" said by Victor\n\"Diane did not kill phyllis.\" said by Jack\n\"If she didn\u2019t, she belongs behind bars. She\u2019s a bad woman and you know it.\" said by Victor\n\"If anyone belongs behind bars it\u2013\" said by Jack\n\"What are you gonna say? Who belongs behind bars? Who?\" said by Victor\n\"Christine.\" said by Jack\n\"Gentlemen. Is there a problem?\" said by Christine\n\"Oh, my goodness. Christine, how do you do?\" said by Victor\n\"Hi.\" said by Christine\n\"All right. Well, you two have a nice dinner. Thank you.\" said by Victor\n\"Thank you so much for coming.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, I really shouldn\u2019t be here. I mean, meeting you before diane\u2019s trial is completely inappropriate. I\u2019m only doing it as a courtesy to a friend.\" said by Christine\n\"If\u2013 if you will just keep an open mind and listen to me for a few minutes, there will be no need for a trial.\" said by Jack\n\"Is that why you called me here? To lobby me to drop the case? Wait, this is\u2013\" said by Christine\n\"No, no, no. Christine, don\u2019t go. You need to hear this. This is something you wanna know.\" said by Jack\n\"What could possibly be so earthshattering that it would change the course of the case against diane?\" said by Christine\n\"Phyllis is alive.\" said by Jack\n\"Phyllis did something illegal? I don\u2019t understand. She\u2019s dead. How could whatever she did, legal or otherwise, affect my case or the charges against me? Is this connected to jeremy? Did they find proof that he killed her?\" said by Diane\n\"No one killed phyllis, mom. It was all stageD. She\u2019s alive. She set up the entire thing to frame you.\" said by Kyle\n\"What do you do when you wanna help someone, but trying to protect them just might make matters even worse?\" said by Daniel\n\"Oh, I can relate. You just wanna help \u2019em, but you\u2019re not sure what the right course is.\" said by Chelsea\n\"What\u2019s going on with you?\" said by Daniel\n\"Connor. He\u2019s been handed a curve ball lately and getting through to him has been difficult. You know, I just try to get him to open up, but he just shuts me down.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, I\u2019ve been there.\" said by Daniel\n\"Any advice?\" said by Chelsea\n\"You know, I don\u2019t think that I\u2019m the right person to ask.\" said by Daniel\n\"I swear, the only thing harder than being a parent is being a kid. All the stuff the world throws at them. Um, which is why, actually recently, I came up with an idea.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Really?\" said by Daniel\n\"This is something I\u2019ve been working on. An omega sphere world for kids. I mean, they\u2019re the ultimate gamers anyway, right? Why not create a space that they already feel comfortable in? Help them feel safe feeling their feelings, whether they\u2019re sad or happy or confused. You know, a parent-free zone. No judgments. No timeouts.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well\u2026 I think I could\u2019ve used something like this when I was a kid. You know, since we\u2019re here, since we\u2019re caffeinated, clearly, um, why don\u2019t we dive into where we\u2019re at with the current game, and I\u2019ll give you some updates?\" said by Daniel\n\"Are you sure? I\u2013 I mean, I\u2013 are you in the right mindset? You\u2019ve been going through a lot lately. If you wanna do it a different day, we can.\" said by Chelsea\n\"No. This is exactly what I need right now. Distractions are the only things that are keeping me sane these days.\" said by Daniel\n\"Look, I\u2019m no expert on grief, but I know that when you lose someone that you love, \u201cwhy,\u201d that can send you into the weeds. \u201cWhy,\u201d I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the best question. I think maybe \u201cwhat.\u201d As in, what would your mom want you to do? I know you and daniel, you were everything to her. Her heart and soul. She lived for you. She would die for you. And she would want you to find happiness again.\" said by Billy\n\"I don\u2019t really think that that\u2019s possible.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, see, right there? No, that\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s not a phyllis attitude. She was a fighter. She didn\u2019t back down. When the going got rough, she doubled down.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah. It could be exhausting.\" said by Summer\n\"[ Laughs ] Yeah. Unless she was in your corner. Then you knew you had someone to believe in you. Because she would go to the wall to protect you. I see a lot of phyllis in you. The good parts. Summer, you are smart and you are strong. You know what you want and you go after it and you don\u2019t give a crap about what anyone else thinks. And for the people that are lucky enough to be loved by you, well, they know that you\u2019re gonna do everything in your power to protect them. Over time, this will get a little bit easier. And look, you\u2019re gonna miss her. But that part of her, that\u2013 that good part, it\u2019ll stay alive for you, I promise. And here I am yammering on, and all you wanted was a little peace and quiet.\" said by Billy\n\"Billy?\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah.\" said by Billy\n\"I\u2019m sorry.\" said by Summer\n\"Sorry for what?\" said by Billy\n\"For being rude earlier about you and my mom.\" said by Summer\n\"[ Sighs ] Can I ask you one more question?\" said by Billy\n\"Could I stop you?\" said by Summer\n\"I think I know the answer to this. But why are you sitting here alone when you got a whole house full of people that love you and all they wanna do is help you? Now, look, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re gonna say because you believe that you can handle this on your own. I hate to say this, but you can\u2019T.\" said by Billy\n\"You don\u2019t\u2013\" said by Summer\n\"No, you can push me away. That\u2019s fine. Okay? But don\u2019t push all those people that love you and care about you. Don\u2019t\u2013 don\u2019t push them away. Like your friends and your family. Especially not kyle. He is crazy in love with you.\" said by Billy\n\"I don\u2019t think that kyle or anyone knows what\u2019s going through my head right now.\" said by Summer\n\"Phyllis and stark staged her poisoning.\" said by Kyle\n\"[ Scoffs ] But the ambulance crash, the\u2013 the explosion?\" said by Diane\n\"All orchestrated by phyllis and stark to fake her death.\" said by Jack\n\"But why?\" said by Christine\n\"Phyllis wanted revenge on you so badly she was willing to go to any extreme to get what she wanted.\" said by Kyle\n\"But phyllis has come to regret her decision. She has secretly reached out to daniel.\" said by Jack\n\"She\u2019s scared and on the run.\" said by Kyle\n\"But she\u2019s alive.\" said by Diane\n\"I know it\u2019s hard to believe.\" said by Kyle\n\"But it\u2019s all true.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Sighs ] Well, that\u2019s quite a story, jack, but that\u2019s all it is. Fiction.\" said by Christine\n\"It is the truth, christine.\" said by Jack\n\"It\u2019s desperation.\" said by Christine\n\"Tell me something. Why would daniel, of all people, invent something to help diane\u2019s case?\" said by Jack\n\"Phyllis faked her death to frame me.\" said by Diane\n\"We are almost ready to test the prototype.\" said by Daniel\n\"That\u2019s so exciting. What does that mean? Sorry, I\u2019m a newbie, remember?\" said by Chelsea\n\"It\u2019s essentially our first major milestone. We\u2019ll run a test version, then we\u2019ll take a look at functionality, user experience, gameplay, um, the art style. We figure out what works, what doesn\u2019t work, and then we build from there.\" said by Daniel\n\"Cool. But we can still tinker around with it?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Absolutely.\" said by Daniel\n\"Great. \u2018Cause the deeper I dive into all this stuff, the more research I do, the more possibilities I see. Did you know some of these games can qualify to be fda-approved as therapy?\" said by Chelsea\n\"I do know that. Isn\u2019t that something?\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah, it really is. I\u2013 I just want this to be the best game, best tool. Resource. So, I\u2019ve been meeting with experts to try to fine-tune everything we\u2019ve been working on.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Hmm. Well, you keep fine-tuning, because that prototype\u2019s gonna be out before you know it.\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, I can\u2019t wait. And listen, thank you for taking the time to noodle around with all this.\" said by Chelsea\n\"You have no idea how much I needed this.\" said by Daniel\n\"I know you\u2019ve been through something agonizing, and it\u2019s really hard to find your way back from that. But from where I\u2019m standing, you\u2019ve got a lot to be proud of.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Thank you. Not sure everyone else would see it the same way, though.\" said by Daniel\n\"Daniel, I need to know what you\u2019re thinking. What we\u2019re gonna do next. Has mom called you again? Oh, I hope that she has. Even if she doesn\u2019t say anything, I think it means that she\u2019s thinking about coming home. We have to help her, daniel. We have to find her, no matter what it takes. \u2018Cause I\u2019m not gonna let her disappear on us. I have some ideas about how to bring her home safely. So, please just\u2013 just call me\" said by Summer\n\"Phyllis has nearly destroyed my life and\u2013 and the lives of the people who love her. How can she be so hateful? So selfish? You know what? I have half a mind to hunt her down and drag her back here by her hair.\" said by Diane\n\"Which is why michael didn\u2019t want us to tell you.\" said by Kyle\n\"Oh. Oh, you mean my lawyer is trying to protect his best friend somehow?\" said by Diane\n\"No, he\u2019s trying to protect you. He was\u2013 this is what he was afraid of. That you would get so upset, you\u2019d try to break house arrest.\" said by Kyle\n\"And that\u2019s what I should do. I should hunt that bitch down and bring her back here.\" said by Diane\n\"Mom, I know you\u2019re angry. I understand. But you need to calm down.\" said by Kyle\n\"Calm down? What? And\u2013 and\u2013 and\u2013 and do nothing? Oh, my god. Where\u2013 where are the police in all this? Why haven\u2019t they found her? And if phyllis is so remorseful and misses her kids so much, then why is she still in hiding?\" said by Diane\n\"She\u2019s probably facing legal consequences.\" said by Kyle\n\"You mean like life in prison for murder, which was my future, thanks to her.\" said by Diane\n\"There is a process.\" said by Kyle\n\"What process? Phyllis is alive.\" said by Diane\n\"Yeah. Well, we don\u2019t have proof. Just daniel\u2019s word. But I swear to you, dad and i will do everything we can to get the evidence we need. He\u2019s with christine right now trying to convince her to put the gcpd on it.\" said by Kyle\n\"I can\u2019t believe your father wanted to keep this from me. When I asked him what was going on, he outright lied to me.\" said by Diane\n\"No, he only wanted to protect you. He didn\u2019t want you to get your hopes up.\" said by Kyle\n\"But this is happening, right? I mean, I\u2019m going to be free again?\" said by Diane\n\"It\u2019s only a matter of time.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019m going to be free. Thank you for telling me. No, thank you. [ Laughs ] Oh, my gosh. I can take harrison to the park again. I\u2013 I\u2019m going to be able to go out to dinner. I can hold my head high. I mean, whatever process is ahead, I can get through it knowing that my freedom is on the other side. Does summer know?\" said by Diane\n\"I wanted to tell her as much as I wanted to tell you, but daniel begged me not to.\" said by Kyle\n\"Why? Can\u2019t he see how much she\u2019s suffering?\" said by Diane\n\"He was afraid it would crush her knowing that phyllis put her through all of this. And that phyllis reached out to daniel, not summer, when she was ready to reveal herself.\" said by Kyle\n\"You know, how heartless can phyllis be? I mean, she put getting revenge above the well-being of her children.\" said by Diane\n\"We\u2019re long past that, mom.\" said by Kyle\n\"Tell summer. She needs to know that her mother\u2019s alive.\" said by Diane\n\"Even if it breaks her heart?\" said by Kyle\n\"Sh\u2013 she has you. And the sooner she knows, the sooner she can heal and the sooner your relationship can heal. And kyle, it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s your choice. But the toll a secret this big can take\u2026 I don\u2019t know if a marriage can survive that.\" said by Diane\n\"If phyllis is so remorseful and determined to be with her children, why is she god knows where and not home?\" said by Christine\n\"She is afraid of prosecution, fraud, falsifying evidence, obstruction of justice. Whatever you can throw at somebody who\u2019s trying to fake their own death. And she\u2019s got a da who\u2019s not a fan of hers, who will make the charges stick.\" said by Jack\n\"I don\u2019t suppose daniel has any evidence, a photograph, a recording?\" said by Christine\n\"No, but he\u2019s willing to sign an affidavit.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, which means nothing, jack. Come on, there\u2019s more questions than answers. There\u2019s no evidence. We\u2019re taking the word of a grieving son.\" said by Christine\n\"Okay. There is one other charge phyllis could be afraid of.\" said by Jack\n\"And what might that be?\" said by Christine\n\"Murder.\" said by Jack\n\"Excuse me?\" said by Christine\n\"Phyllis killed jeremy stark.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, you know, this is ridiculous.\" said by Christine\n\"You have another suspect? You have any leads that might lead you to who killed him? I\u2019m giving you one. Phyllis. Is that enough to get your attention? Is that enough to get you to get the gcpd involved in this?\" said by Jack\n\"You know what? You\u2019ve given me a crazy story that\u2019s very light on facts. Okay? So, we\u2019re done here.\" said by Christine\n\"I\u2019ll give you one more fact. Phyllis killed jeremy stark with a pair of scissors. Head & shoulders is launching something huge.\" said by Jack\n\"Mm. Have you noticed how much of our relationship involves pastries? Cinnamon buns in particular?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Is that a bad thing?\" said by Billy\n\"Nope.\" said by Chelsea\n\"You know, when I walked in here, I saw you and daniel wrapped up in the world of omega sphere. If you wanna keep working, I can take this cinnamon bun somewhere else.\" said by Billy\n\"No way. You and this bun stay here.\" said by Chelsea\n\"All right.\" said by Billy\n\"Especially because we\u2019re celebrating.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Is that right? What are we celebrating?\" said by Billy\n\"The prototype is almost ready.\" said by Chelsea\n\"That\u2019s amazing.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah. So, this game, it\u2019s not just a hope or a\u2013 or a dream or a wish. It\u2019s really happening.\" said by Chelsea\n\"That\u2019s fantastic. Congratulations.\" said by Billy\n\"Thank you. And I\u2019m actually bringing a new aspect to it that involves kids. So, it\u2019s gonna be new lessons, new challenges that help them deal with real life.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Are we still talking about omega sphere or does this have more to do with connor now?\" said by Billy\n\"[ Sighs ] Billy, I am so worried about him. He\u2019s become so withdrawn.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Yeah. He\u2019s got a lot going on and he\u2019s just trying to figure out all those feelings.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah. Maybe it\u2019s my fault.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Why would you say that?\" said by Billy\n\"My life. My\u2026 episode. Maybe he feels like he can\u2019t lean on me, or else I\u2019m gonna fall apart. Or maybe, I don\u2019t know, maybe he\u2019s stuffed down all of these feelings over the past few months that are finally coming to the surface. Or\u2026 maybe he\u2019s angry at me for almost leaving him.\" said by Chelsea\n\"I think you\u2019re being too hard on yourself. You\u2019re being a concerned, attentive parent. You\u2019re doing all the right things.\" said by Billy\n\"Am I? [ Laughs ] Adam and I are not shining examples of healthy behavior, let\u2019s be honest. And it worries me what that could mean for our son.\" said by Chelsea\n\"I mean, I understand that. I look at johnny and katie sometimes and think their dad has got a very addictive personality. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s locked in their genes or if that\u2019s something that can be stopped.\" said by Billy\n\"[ Exhales ] Well, certainly not something we can solve tonight. But you know what we can do?\" said by ", "answer": "Chelsea"}

Don\u2019t you think?\" said by Adam\n\"I\u2019ll be the judge of that, really.\" said by Victor\n\"And what is it you wanted to discuss?\" said by Adam\n\"Well, my goodness, if it isn\u2019t jack and billy boy abbott.\" said by Victor\n\"I feel like I\u2019m witnessing a nature documentary here with the two newmans out in the wild. Leader of the pack showing the young upstart how to take over the world.\" said by Billy\n\"You see, this is why I\u2019d rather be at the office \u2019cause they let guys like him in here.\" said by Adam\n\"How are you two gentlemen doing this glorious morning?\" said by Jack\n\"Well, jack, you are in a good mood given the circumstances.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, circumstances be damned. Everything\u2019s coming up roses for me. Personal life and professional.\" said by Jack\n\"Ain\u2019t that something? You know, I think you\u2019ve been around your own perfume too much. You seem delirious.\" said by Victor\n\"Oh, how so?\" said by Jack\n\"You let my son go and you put billy boy abbott into his position. And I understand that you are engaged to of all people, diane jenkins.\" said by Victor\n\"I am sorry, victor. Nothing you say can possibly spoil my mood this morning.\" said by Jack\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Victor\n\"Nate. Uh, come join me. Well, we can have an impromptu strategy session. Or we can go somewhere else, uh, more private if you want.\" said by Audra\n\"Audra, I\u2019m sorry, but, um, I have to get\u2013\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, hey.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, uh, I didn\u2019t know you two decided to meet. Anything I can do to help?\" said by Audra\n\"Uh, thanks, but no. Nate and I, we have a few things that we need to hash out. You know, I just remembered, I left a couple of those files up in the newman executive suite.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, uh, newman keeps a suite here?\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah, we have for years.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, um, we might as well just discuss it up there then? I\u2019ll loop you in later if necessary.\" said by Nate\n\"Don\u2019t you just hate when that happens?

Don\u2019t you think?\" said by Sharon\n\"But when you see him, he\u2019s totally a borgnine. Definitely not a fluffy or a felix. Where is borgy anyway? He wasn\u2019t upstairs. I thought he was down here.\" said by Faith\n\"Oh. It\u2019s just an alert about a sale at fenmore\u2019S. It\u2019s nothing about cameron.\" said by Sharon\n\"Good. Maybe that jerk finished getting his kicks out of playing his sick little mind games and left.\" said by Faith\n\"I hope so. But, you know, we need to stay on alert just in case he is still around.\" said by Sharon\n\"I was thinking about going out for a little bit. That\u2019s okay, right?\" said by Faith\n\"Um, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s such a good idea right now.\" said by Sharon\n\"I\u2019m just going to the tack house to see the baby.

That should be safe, but stay close and be careful.\" said by Sharon\n\"I will.\" said by Faith\n\"Faith, what happened? Are you all right?\" said by Sharon\n\"Borgnine. He\u2019s not breathing.

Now.\" said by Sharon\n\"Morning.\" said by Summer\n\"How could I? Did you?\" said by Kyle\n\"Is anyone else here?\" said by Summer\n\"I sent harrison out with the nanny. Everyone else has left for the day.\" said by Kyle\n\"So early.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah. Maybe now, you\u2019ll finally come clean and tell me the truth.\" said by Kyle\n\"Additional sponsorship provided by\u2026\" said by Announcer\n\"You already know the truth. I mean, as crazy as it is, you know everything that\u2019s important.\" said by Summer\n\"Do I? Do I know the whole truth really?\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, my mom is alive. Don\u2019t you see how incredible that is? And your mom is off the hook.\" said by Summer\n\"You never answered my question.\" said by Kyle\n\"What question?\" said by Summer\n\"Last night, I asked you and I wanna know, how long have you known phyllis was alive?\" said by Kyle\n\"You know how long I\u2019ve known. You\u2019re the one that told me that daniel saw her. I mean, what\u2013 what difference does it make anyway?\" said by Summer\n\"It makes a big difference and you know it. So just tell me, tell me, when was the first time you saw phyllis?\" said by Kyle\n\"Yesterday. Just like you. And, uh, no, I didn\u2019t call you the second I got in there. And maybe\u2013 maybe that was a mistake, but I was so overwhelmed seeing my mom and I wasn\u2019t hiding the truth from you.\" said by Summer\n\"No, you didn\u2019t seem that overwhelmed when I got there.\" said by Kyle\n\"That\u2019s because I had been in the room for a second at that point. I had a little bit of time to get used to seeing my mom.\" said by Summer\n\"You didn\u2019t have that much time. I was following you, summer. I wasn\u2019t that far behind you. I know you didn\u2019t have enough time to react to phyllis being alive. A few minutes at most, that is not enough time to get used to the fact that your mother, who you believed was dead was standing there alive and well in front of you. So just tell me.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019ve told you!\" said by Summer\n\"You have known a lot longer, haven\u2019t you?\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, come on.\" said by Summer\n\"Why can\u2019t you just be honest with me?\" said by Kyle\n\"I don\u2019t even know why you would think that. I don\u2019T.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay, I had all night to think back on everything has happened. So many interactions. Little things that just didn\u2019t make sense at the time.\" said by Kyle\n\"What are you talking about?\" said by Summer\n\"The arguments between you and your brother, phrases you used in fights, little glances. Even last night when phyllis said she hid out nearby so she could be close to her kids. That was not the first time she reached out to you.\" said by Kyle\n\"I don\u2019t know why she didn\u2019T.\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, that could not have been the first time you saw your mother. What about yesterday when I found you at the club after you said you were going to work?\" said by Kyle\n\"Wait, is that why you started following me around like a criminal?\" said by Summer\n\"No, that\u2019s not the reason I was following you, but I\u2019m glad I did. All of the times that you ran off without an explanation and lame ones at best, you were going to see phyllis, weren\u2019t you? When were you gonna tell me what you\u2019ve been hiding?\" said by Kyle\n\"Jack, I really hope that just because diane is not declared a murderer doesn\u2019t mean that she won\u2019t send your life down to rack and ruin.\" said by Victor\n\"Oh, victor, I am far too happy with diane\u2019s freedom and jabot\u2019s latest profit projections to let you get to me today.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, isn\u2019t that nice?\" said by Victor\n\"And you know me, I\u2019m not one to pat myself on the back, but I will take some credit for the profit margins off the men\u2019s product line. You know the one that you dropped the ball on, adam?\" said by Billy\n\"You must be very proud. Grooming products for men. It\u2019s like you\u2019re starting a revolution, billy.\" said by Adam\n\"We are shooting for the moon these days, adam. With billy by my side and diane free and happy, nothing\u2019s stopping us.\" said by Jack\n\"Do me a favor, jack and just keep diane jenkins grubby hands away from my wife\u2019s jewelry. That would be a move in the right direction.\" said by Victor\n\"On that note?\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah.\" said by Jack\n\"Enjoy your breakfast.\" said by Adam\n\"Thank you.\" said by Billy\n\"Okay. You two are good to relax now. I got an officer taking your cat in for examination. Two others searching the property. I would like to ask you a couple questions.\" said by Chance\n\"You guys okay?\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2019m fine. Just a little shaken up, that\u2019s all.\" said by Faith\n\"Yeah, me too, but we\u2019re gonna be fine, okay? We\u2019ll be all right.\" said by Sharon\n\"What happened?\" said by Nick\n\"Faith was on her way to the tack house when she found the cat that she brought home from college just laying on the front doorstep, dead.\" said by Sharon\n\"Poor borgnine.\" said by Faith\n\"Do you know how old the cat was or if he had any signs of illness?\" said by Chance\n\"I don\u2019t know his exact age, but he was in good health. I took him to the vet right before I left for break. He had all his shots and a full exam.\" said by Faith\n\"Okay. Well, we\u2019re gonna get our forensics team to examine him, see if we can find out exactly what happened, okay?\" said by Chance\n\"That\u2019s good. But I\u2019m pretty sure I know what those results are gonna say.\" said by Nick\n\"So do I. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind about what happened, nick. This was cameron\u2019s doing.\" said by Sharon\n\"That bastard could still be on the ground somewhere.\" said by Nick\n\"We got that covered. Don\u2019t worry about it.\" said by Chance\n\"I\u2019m gonna go find him myself.\" said by Nick\n\"There\u2019s no need. I got a full team searching the property. Let the professionals handle it.\" said by Chance\n\"Nobody knows this property better than me. I know where to look.\" said by Nick\n\"Nick. Nick!\" said by Chance\n\"So, what\u2019s up?\" said by Billy\n\"You sound suspicious.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, something\u2019s going on. I can tell by the way you were grandstanding with victor. Not everything is perfect right now, is it?\" said by Billy\n\"We have had our share of triumphs lately, but there has been a recent very troubling development.\" said by Jack\n\"What is that?\" said by Billy\n\"I assume you haven\u2019t spoken with ashley recently?\" said by Jack\n\"No, not lately. Why?\" said by Billy\n\"She made quite an announcement last night at the house.\" said by Jack\n\"Good news? Bad news?\" said by Billy\n\"She and tucker are planning on getting married as soon as possible.\" said by Jack\n\"Just so you know, tucker, I happen to have had private meetings with nate up in my own suite.\" said by Audra\n\"Hmm. But not the same caliber of meeting that victoria\u2019s getting right about now.\" said by Tucker\n\"Our meetings are the kind that I prefer. Strictly business.\" said by Audra\n\"Is your name audra charles?\" said by Tucker\n\"Yes, tucker.\" said by Audra\n\"\u2018Cause I don\u2019t remember any of our meetings being strictly business.\" said by Tucker\n\"That was the past.\" said by Audra\n\"Ah!\" said by Tucker\n\"Mm-hmm. I am focused on the bigger prize now. The top spot at newman media.\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah, but nate. Hmm. Nate. He gets under your skin, don\u2019t he? And it\u2019s just killing you right now how close he\u2019s getting to victoria.\" said by Tucker\n\"Now, where did you say you put those files?\" said by Nate\n\"I don\u2019t know. Maybe they\u2019re in the bed under the sheets. Did you look there?\" said by Victoria\n\"No, but that looks like a much more comfortable place for files than that hard desk in your office.\" said by Nate\n\"I think that work can wait. I mean, newman media\u2019s bottom line is doing great these days.\" said by Victoria\n\"I agree.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah.\" said by Victoria\n\"Our ratings are up too. Our audiences across all platforms has almost doubled.\" said by Nate\n\"Really? Tell me more.\" said by Victoria\n\"Our demographics are right on target.\" said by Nate\n\"Right? What does that do to our bottom line?\" said by Victoria\n\"The second quarter projections will outperform.\" said by Nate\n\"Mm-hmm. Year to date or rolling 12 months?\" said by Victoria\n\"Uh, it will exceed every quarter in the last three fiscal.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, god. Speaking of outperforming.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, leaving jabot was the right move.\" said by Adam\n\"Jack abbott is so full of hot air.\" said by Victor\n\"Yeah, you were right about that all along. There was no way that I was gonna fit in there. God. All those abbotts.\" said by Adam\n\"Very glad you are ready to move on, son.\" said by Victor\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Adam\n\"Now, let\u2019s talk about mccall. I have some\u2013 some ideas.\" said by Victor\n\"Okay. Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Before you go any further, I\u2019m already in the process of making some major moves in the company. I\u2019m planning on shaking up a few things around there.\" said by Adam\n\"I know you, summer. I can tell you are hiding something from me. I hate to ask you this, but can I see your phone?\" said by Kyle\n\"Wait. Are you serious? Kyle, there\u2019s nothing on my phone.\" said by Summer\n\"Then, you will prove me wrong and I will feel horrible about it. And if that happens, I will apologize profusely. What are these?\" said by Kyle\n\"What?\" said by Summer\n\"All of these texts from a number that\u2019s not in your contacts. \u201cLet\u2019s meet, please.\u201d \u201cWhere are you?\u201d\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2013 I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know that number.\" said by Summer\n\"\u201cWe need to talk.\u201d \u201cBring bro for fam peace.\u201d All of these messages from the same number. And you replied. These were from phyllis, weren\u2019t they? But it\u2013 it sounds like she hadn\u2019t seen daniel. I\u2013 how could that be? He told us he\u2019d seen her, that\u2019s how he knew for sure she was alive.\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, can we please drop this?\" said by Summer\n\"No, daniel wasn\u2019t the first one she reached out to. He wasn\u2019t the first one who saw her alive. It was you. You were the one she reached out to from the beginning, but\u2013 but why? Why? Or because you were the one she knew would lie for her.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah. [ Sniffling ] She knew that I would help her. That to protect her I would look you in your eyes and lie to your face.\" said by Summer\n\"What the hell, summer? You lied about something that directly affected all of our lives for months. How could you do that?\" said by Kyle\n\"But kyle, it\u2019s over. It\u2019s finally over. I\u2019m relieved that this secret is out. I\u2013 I hated having to lie to you.\" said by Summer\n\"No, no, no, no. You didn\u2019t have to lie.\" said by Kyle\n\"You\u2019re right. But kyle, I was stuck between a rock and a hard place. Yes, I am furious at my mom for what she did and the position that she put me in, but I was just so happy that she was even alive.\" said by Summer\n\"Come on.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2013 I was desperate to keep her out of jail.\" said by Summer\n\"No. So, wait. Daniel was covering for you all this time? Why? What would make him do that? Why would it have been so bad if you were the one who shared your mother\u2019s secret?\" said by Kyle\n\"I don\u2019t know. He just didn\u2019t want me to have to deal with the questions or accusations, I guess.\" said by Summer\n\"No, he was protecting you. If you saw phyllis first, that means you saw her when my mother was in jail. You could have cleared my mother\u2019s name and set her free. You could have gotten her out of that god awful place, but instead, you decide to sit back and do nothing!\" said by Kyle\n\"We gotta stop this. You know that, right? I mean, there\u2019s no way that we can let ashley marry that conman.\" said by Billy\n\"Ashley marrying tucker mccall would be a colossal mistake, but I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re gonna stop it.\" said by Jack\n\"I don\u2019t know either. But we gotta do something. I mean, we can\u2019t just sit here and let our sister put her faith in that scam artist.\" said by Billy\n\"I\u2019d like to think ashley would realize that herself.\" said by Jack\n\"You know, I was gonna give him the benefit of the doubt until all of this coup stuff started to happen. Because I guarantee you, he is the one driving this.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, I\u2019m not gonna be the one to talk her out of it. She doesn\u2019t listen to me. Listen, I have tried to reason with her for months to no avail.\" said by Jack\n\"How does she not learn her lesson?\" said by Billy\n\"You know, when they first mentioned this engagement, I thought it was just a jab at diane after she\u2019d gotten her freedom, but no, I\u2019m starting to think this wedding is imminent.\" said by Jack\n\"Not if I have anything to say about it.\" said by Billy\n\"Ashley keeps saying that her relationship with tucker is just like my relationship with diane. It is nothing like it. They have nothing in common.\" said by Jack\n\"No, but, you know, let\u2019s just be honest, right? They both have a scandalous past of bad behavior.\" said by Billy\n\"Hold on. She caught him red-handed with jabot financial documents in his hotel suite. She knew he was coming after the family company. She alerted us so we could stop him. Now, we\u2019re supposed to just forget that?\" said by Jack\n\"No. No, ashley\u2019s too smart for that. I don\u2019t think any of this is forgotten.\" said by Billy\n\"What does that mean?\" said by Jack\n\"I think she has something up her sleeve with this marriage thing. It\u2019s too calculated. And I don\u2019t know if tucker\u2019s involved or not, but I guarantee you it has something to do with jabot.\" said by Billy\n\"So, I\u2019ve been, uh, doing my research and mccall desperately needs to be streamlined. It\u2019s crucial that we cut the fat and we sell it off.\" said by Adam\n\"Like what?\" said by Victor\n\"The music department. It\u2019s the company\u2019s least profitable sector and it\u2019s weighing the company down. There\u2019s absolutely no upside.\" said by Adam\n\"Do you realize that music is the very foundation of what tucker built? It\u2019s it cornerstone.\" said by Victor\n\"It was. But going forward, I\u2019ll be focused on newer media and the streaming divisions.\" said by Adam\n\"You realize that a move like that will put you in direct competition with newman media?\" said by Victor\n\"Exactly.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, good. You\u2019re back.\" said by Sharon\n\"There\u2019s no sight of him anywhere. Ranch security and gcpd are combing the property.\" said by Nick\n\"I think I was more worried that you would find him.\" said by Sharon\n\"I\u2019m sure he is long gone. He\u2019d be a fool to stick around and risk getting caught.\" said by Nick\n\"If he was even here. We don\u2019t even know how the cat died yet.\" said by Chance\n\"I\u2019m gonna head upstairs and start calling my friends to break the sad news. They trusted me with borgnine.\" said by ", "answer": "Faith"}
{"content": "\"Hey [ Sighs ] I, uh, I hope I didn\u2019t keep you waiting too long.\" said by Adam\n\"Uh, no. I just got here. I\u2019m glad you could join me.\" said by Sally\n\"You kidding? You know, any chance to sit down with you and discuss, uh, possibilities at mccall, sign me up.\" said by Adam\n\"That\u2019s what I wanted to talk to you about. Your job offer.\" said by Sally\n\"Excellent. Uh, well, I have some wonderful ideas that I think you\u2019re gonna love\u2013\" said by Adam\n\"No, no\u2013 the answer is no.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, it\u2019s great to put a face to the voice on the other end of the phone. Let\u2019s talk real soon. Hi, elena.\" said by Nick\n\"Nick. Hey.\" said by Elena\n\"You, uh, having dinner?\" said by Nick\n\"Um, no. I am actually staying here these days.\" said by Elena\n\"Right.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah. Turns out you were right about nate.\" said by Elena\n\"Come in.\" said by Victoria\n\"This is just beyond unbelievable.\" said by Jack\n\"No, this is proof that mom is innocent. She and summer need to know. We need to get them here.\" said by Kyle\n\"No one can know. End of story.\" said by Michael\n\"My mother\u2019s get-out-of-jail card is out there somewhere, alive. Why do we have to keep this under wraps?\" said by Kyle\n\"Oh. You\u2019re that guy.\" said by Michael\n\"What guy?\" said by Kyle\n\"You know that one guy who\u2019s never kept a secret from his mother or his wife? Give me a break. And give that guy a medal. You\u2019re a saint, kyle. Oh, but you\u2019re also the one that we\u2019ll point to when the judge asks, \u201cwho unleashed a fury of this magnitude?\u201d\" said by Michael\n\"Phyllis is alive. Summer needs to know so she can stop grieving her mother and treating mine like she\u2019s a murderer.\" said by Kyle\n\"That\u2019s the warm and tender version. But in the real world, where we live, you\u2019ll pay now and for the rest of your days.\" said by Michael\n\"Michael, I don\u2019t see how that may be.\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, if diane finds out that phyllis tried to frame her for murder, she will gnaw off her ankle, hunt phyllis down, and there won\u2019t be anything left to bury.\" said by Michael\n\"Summer needs to know that daniel saw phyllis.\" said by Kyle\n\"No, she doesn\u2019T.\" said by Daniel\n\"I promised diane\u2013\" said by Jack\n\"Gentlemen, gentlemen. Sometimes secrets are kept out of kindness, or to avoid false hopes or massive bloodshed. This is definitely the latter. So leave it alone until we can come up with solid evidence.\" said by Michael\n\"Yeah. Total silence. We all need to be quiet until we can be sure that we can bring my mom back safely.\" said by Daniel\n\"Diane!\" said by Michael\n\"Hey there.\" said by Jack\n\"Hello. I thought I heard voices.\" said by Diane\n\"I hope we didn\u2019t disturb you.\" said by Jack\n\"Is there news about the case? Is there something I should know? We live our lives on our home\u2019s fabrics.\" said by Diane\n\"It\u2019s just when you offered me the job of my choice at mccall, I knew it was a terrible idea. Like, what were you thinking? Look\u2026 we can never, ever work together again.\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2019m assuming that you and nick arrived at this decision together.\" said by Adam\n\"No.\" said by Sally\n\"Sorry. I just thought he would be the one to make such a reckless decision.\" said by Adam\n\"Reckless?\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2013 I don\u2019t know. Brave? Crazy? Call it what you want. I\u2013 I\u2019m giving you a chance to write your own ticket, sally. To choose your own job, to create your own culture. It\u2019s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to design the job of your dreams.\" said by Adam\n\"Just so we\u2019re clear, just because I\u2019m with your brother doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t make my own decisions.\" said by Sally\n\"Okay. Of course you do. That\u2019s why I gave you carte blanche. Hasty of me. I\u2013 I guess I was just excited about the idea of us working together again.\" said by Adam\n\"We had our moments.\" said by Sally\n\"We can have them again. But this time on our own terms, answering to no one.\" said by Adam\n\"We were lightning in a bottle, adam.\" said by Sally\n\"You can\u2019t tell me that you don\u2019t want that again.\" said by Adam\n\"I want different things now. And I have made my decision. There isn\u2019t a newman alive who will ever sign my paychecks again.\" said by Sally\n\"So, how long have you known about nate and victoria?\" said by Elena\n\"For reasons I hope you understand, I cannot talk about that or answer any questions on the topic.\" said by Nick\n\"Fair. I am in a kill-the-messenger kinda mood.\" said by Elena\n\"I will say, we can start with \u201cnate is a complete jackass.\u201d\" said by Nick\n\"True.\" said by Elena\n\"And you deserve so much more than him. I mean, you\u2019re out there fighting for the two of you to stay together, and he\u2019s doing what he\u2019s doing.\" said by Nick\n\"You are good at this.\" said by Elena\n\"You wanna know what helps everything? Ice cream. What do you say we crush some mint chocolate chip or cookie dough? Whatever you want.\" said by Nick\n\"You\u2019ve got yourself a deal.\" said by Elena\n\"All right.\" said by Nick\n\"Michael, I didn\u2019t realize you were coming by.\" said by Diane\n\"How are you, diane?\" said by Michael\n\"So\u2026 who\u2019s going to be the one to tell me what this is all about?\" said by Diane\n\"We were just brainstorming.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh! Well, I doubt that daniel is interested in helping plan my defense strategy. Hello, daniel.\" said by Diane\n\"Diane.\" said by Daniel\n\"I\u2013 I want you to know that my heart breaks for you every day. Uh, to lose a parent like that under such, um, tragic and complicated circumstances\u2026\" said by Diane\n\"Thank you.\" said by Daniel\n\"I am just destroyed by what happened. And, um, I just hope that you can leave yourself open to believing that I\u2019m innocent. And I\u2013 I know that the evidence that\u2019s out there says otherwise, and that I\u2019ve already been tried and convicted in the court of public opinion, but maybe one day you\u2019ll see that I\u2013\" said by Diane\n\"You\u2019re not going to prison, diane.\" said by Daniel\n\"[ Chuckles ] Well, that\u2019s very kind of you to say, but\u2026 why do you sound strangely certain?\" said by Diane\n\"Uh, what daniel probably means is with the help of a highly skilled attorney such as myself\u2013\" said by Michael\n\"Hang on, michael. Daniel, is that right? Is that why you\u2019re saying I\u2019m not going to prison?\" said by Diane\n\"Uh, you know what? I will tell you why. Hi, I\u2019m michael,\" said by Jack\n\"Well, the first thing we\u2019re gonna do is stuff the suggestion box and demand they get a way better options of ice cream.\" said by Nick\n\"Right? I mean, this is a hotel. It\u2019s gotta be overflowing with heartbreak and cheaters. They are missing out on a revenue stream.\" said by Elena\n\"So tonight, we drink. Unless, of course, you have to work later.\" said by Nick\n\"No. I got my shift covered for a favor I did for a friend. Which, you know, is really reassuring. It\u2019s nice to know that there are still people in the world that believe in fairness and honoring commitments.\" said by Elena\n\"Yeah. You know what? Tonight\u2019s on me.\" said by Nick\n\"No. You\u2019re not paying anything. It\u2019s not your fault that nate has no moral compass. But\u2026 if you do want to make up for your sister, you could cover my hotel bill.\" said by Elena\n\"Really hate what she did, but that is not gonna happen.\" said by Nick\n\"\u2018Cause she\u2019s family. I get it. And I promise I will not trash her in front of you. At least not right now.\" said by Elena\n\"Is that the good stuff?\" said by Nate\n\"[ Chuckles ] It\u2019s the decent stuff. We wouldn\u2019t wanna get carried away again, would we?\" said by Victoria\n\"[ Inhales ] Uh, where do I begin? Uh, as far as the langston project goes\u2013\" said by Nate\n\"No, no. We\u2019re\u2013 we\u2019re good on the business end. I\u2019m\u2013 I mean, you\u2019ve made tremendous progress with langston and everything else.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah.\" said by Nate\n\"I\u2019m talking about us. How are you? How are things with elena?\" said by Victoria\n\"She moved out.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh\u2026\" said by Victoria\n\"Got home to find she destroyed a picture of the two of us and left her keys behind.\" said by Nate\n\"That must have been very difficult for you.\" said by Victoria\n\"I never wanted her to get hurT.\" said by Nate\n\"No. Nor did I. I guess we just\u2013 we just got wrapped up in the excitement.\" said by Victoria\n\"It was more than that. For me, anyway.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, that could be problematic for you if you\u2019re hoping to reconcile. I mean, is that\u2013 is that your goal?\" said by Victoria\n\"Things between elena and me are broken beyond repair.\" said by Nate\n\"You can\u2019t do anything to fix them?\" said by Victoria\n\"The real issue is, I don\u2019t want to.\" said by Nate\n\"So you have, uh, a no-newman clause in your contracts?\" said by Adam\n\"It\u2019s not exactly in writing, but\u2026\" said by Sally\n\"I mean, clarify this for me. Is it the name? Genetics? Is it anybody with newman dna, or is it everyone in\u2013 in the family of which you\u2019re about to be a part of?\" said by Adam\n\"It\u2019s you and nick, for obvious reasons.\" said by Sally\n\"Has there been any movement with chancellor-winters?\" said by Adam\n\"No, there hasn\u2019t been any movement, but, you know, there\u2019s other ways to grow our business, and if there\u2019s one thing that chloe and I do best, it is pivot. You know, turn on a dime, make things happen. Will you respect my decision?\" said by Sally\n\"Sally\u2026 what don\u2019t I respect about you?\" said by Adam\n\"Jack, you were about to tell me why daniel is sure that I\u2019m not going to prison.\" said by Diane\n\"I think daniel just meant that if he thinks you\u2019re innocent, it should be very easy to persuade a judge that you are.\" said by Jack\n\"Isn\u2019t that right, daniel?\" said by Michael\n\"Um, yeah. Yeah, I mean, it\u2019s taken some time, but, um, you know, I\u2019ve been confronted with some undeniable truths. I mean, it had to be stark, right?\" said by Daniel\n\"Yes. I\u2019ve always known he was involved.\" said by Diane\n\"I\u2013 I think it\u2019s a shame how he used you and my mom just to build his bank account and get revenge.\" said by Daniel\n\"So you really believe me?\" said by Diane\n\"I do.\" said by Daniel\n\"Really? I mean, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m sorry, it\u2019s just my life has been such a nightmare lately, and I\u2019ve almost given up hope. I mean, I\u2019m wearing this ankle monitor, but\u2026 but now I have your belief in me. And, I mean, if you can believe me with all the manufactured evidence that\u2019s out there, then anything\u2019s possible, right? Look, I know how passionately summer believes that I\u2019m guilty, so I can only imagine what this is costing you. I mean, I\u2013 I know it\u2019s just so hard to figure out the right thing to do when your whole world is turned upside-down. So your secret\u2019s safe with us, daniel. You\u2019re a good man. And I hope you know that phyllis was so very proud of you, and I can see why.\" said by Diane\n\"I\u2013 I can\u2019t do this.\" said by Daniel\n\"I\u2019m\u2013 daniel, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to upset you. I just\u2013 I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with me.\" said by Diane\n\"The only thing you need to know right now is that everyone in this room knows you are innocent, and we are gonna work like the devil to make sure everyone else knows as well.\" said by Jack\n\"It\u2019s a very generous endorsement, daniel. Thank you. Now, would you mind swearing to that in front of a judge and jury? [ Laughs ] I mean, it couldn\u2019t hurt, right?\" said by Diane\n\"Well, I think we\u2019re gonna keep daniel\u2019s support of our case kinda safely tucked into our back pocket until we figure out a way to fit him into our narrative. I mean, there are a lot of moving parts, and elements of this case are changing every day.\" said by Michael\n\"I know, I know. Let the professionals do their job.\" said by Diane\n\"You sure there\u2019s nothing we can do, dad, to make this more bearable for mom?\" said by Kyle\n\"We have the very best lawyer. With any luck, we will find the evidence we need.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, and\u2013 and the proof we\u2019re looking for, uh, it can be a bit slippery. That\u2019s why we didn\u2019t wanna raise your hopes.\" said by Michael\n\"Oh, well, I\u2019m sorry to disappoint you, but you already have. I have daniel in my corner now. So good things can happen. I\u2019ll just\u2026 I\u2019ll just keep hoping for more. All right.\" said by Diane\n\"See that? The way she latched on to daniel\u2019s support?\" said by Kyle\n\"I am not going to break her heart with more false promises.\" said by Jack\n\"We need phyllis.\" said by Kyle\n\"We\u2019ve gotta get her to come back home.\" said by Michael\n\"And make it safe for her to turn herself in. No prison time.\" said by Daniel\n\"I can\u2019t even begin to touch that case. I\u2019m focused on diane. And we say nothing to her until we have phyllis in hand.\" said by Michael\n\"Truth is, I\u2019m not the same man I was when elena and I met. I want different things.\" said by Nate\n\"You were both doctors.\" said by Victoria\n\"Those hours, that lifestyle, it was so easy to just fall into a rhythm. Everything became so routine.\" said by Nate\n\"That\u2019s natural. But it just seemed like your heart wasn\u2019t in it anymore.\" said by Victoria\n\"Mmm. Once this went, the passion for the job did too. And after that, the relationship. But\u2026 coming here, it made me see my world in a new light. Who I am. The man I wanna be.\" said by Nate\n\"And who is that?\" said by Victoria\n\"Who they say I am in the papers. Unstoppable and exceeding expectations.\" said by Nate\n\"You\u2019re on that road.\" said by Victoria\n\"But when it comes to relationships, I am lost.\" said by Nate\n\"Maybe I was right when I said that you needed more than elena could give you.\" said by Victoria\n\"She wants the version of me that doesn\u2019t exist anymore. And she just couldn\u2019t understand it or accept it. But\u2026 I never wanted her to get hurt.\" said by Nate\n\"No, of course not.\" said by Victoria\n\"But I wouldn\u2019t have allowed myself to act on this connection I feel toward you if I hadn\u2019t been looking for something else. Something more.\" said by Nate\n\"[ Sighs ] You can\u2019t say things like that, adam.\" said by Sally\n\"Look, that\u2019s not what I meant. Okay, maybe it came out the wrong way. You\u2019ll have to forgive me.\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah, but everything has. And I don\u2019t want you to lose sight of that, \u2019cause\u2026 I haven\u2019T.\" said by Sally\n\"Okay, wait. You\u2013 you think what I said was some grand romantic pronouncement?\" said by Adam\n\"I think it just slipped out, which makes it even more dangerous than if it was a planned attack. Look, we\u2013 we have boundaries. And I think you need to do a better job of paying attention.\" said by Sally\n\"You think that I need to watch what I say?\" said by Adam\n\"If that\u2019s what it takes. Look, I want you to be a part of this child\u2019s life and to be the best father that you can be. But that is all that I want from you.\" said by Sally\n\"Um, look, I\u2013 I realize that you were trying to do the right thing\u2013\" said by Adam\n\"You need to stop accidentally saying things that you shouldn\u2019t say to someone who isn\u2019t yours. This baby is yours. But I\u2019m with nick. Type 2 diabetes?\" said by Sally\n\"All right, it\u2019s that time. It\u2019s everyone\u2019s favorite time, you know, when I offer my unsolicited advice. I\u2019m just a dude who\u2019s been there on both sides, so take that for what you wilL.\" said by Nick\n\"I guess that\u2019s what makes it worth more than you think.\" said by Elena\n\"In that case, treat this like a root canal. Do nothing. I\u2019m serious, elena. Nothing. Don\u2019t drunk dial. No big financial decisions. Just chill. Just give yourself time to breathe.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, and what about the podcast I\u2019m supposed to do with newman?\" said by Elena\n\"You can do whatever you want. I\u2019m serious. It\u2019s your call. You can keep it. You can kick it to the curb. We can find some workaround. We can make sure you will never see nate if you want. You could even work remotely if you\u2019d like. But you never have to see him.\" said by Nick\n\"Must be tough for you. Not having the same luxury, with your family expanding in unexpected ways.\" said by Elena\n\"[ Chuckles ] Ah. Talking about, uh, me, sally, adam, and the baby.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah. It can\u2019t be easy.\" said by Elena\n\"Well, despite the onslaught of negative comments from my parents, adam\u2019s constant hovering, and sally feeling like she\u2019s being torn in nine different directions\u2026\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, I\u2019m so sorry.\" said by Elena\n\"That\u2019s all right. This might sound crazy\u2026 um, my parents think I\u2019m beyond help. But you wanna know something?\" said by Nick\n\"What?\" said by Elena\n\"I\u2019m the happiest I\u2019ve been in a very long time. And it just hit me that is a terrible thing to say to someone who just had their heart broken. I apologize.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Laughs ] Stop. You\u2019re in love, and that is a beautiful and rare thing. Embrace it. Revel in it. Celebrate it.\" said by Elena\n\"Yeah, maybe I will.\" said by Nick\n\"Maybe? You better. Do it for me. Do it for her. Do it for love.\" said by Elena\n\"I\u2019m sorry. I got ahead of myself. Guess I was just excited about the possibility of us working together again.\" said by Adam\n\"You have to move on.\" said by Sally\n\"Just find somebody? Fall in love again?\" said by Adam\n\"You deserve that. Someone who\u2019s meant for you. Someone who sees what an incredible man you are. A woman who you can give your whole heart to.\" said by Sally\n\"And you really think that there\u2019s someone like that out there from me?\" said by Adam\n\"Of course. And when you look at each other, you\u2019ll think \u201cthat\u2019s my whole world.\u201d\" said by Sally\n\"And just live happily ever after?\" said by Adam\n\"Why not? Look, I have a feeling whenever you hold our little girl in your arms, you are gonna realize that you were meant for one woman. And she\u2019s gonna make you wanna be the best adam that there can be. This girl\u2019s gonna change your life.\" said by Sally\n\"She already has.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, good. There\u2019s just one other thing that I really need you to do, and I need you to take this to heart. You need to find a way to let me go.\" said by Sally\n\"Who were the bodies they used for dead phyllis and the emt?\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019d like to know the answer to that myself. I\u2019ve got an investigator on it.\" said by Michael\n\"It\u2019s probably one of the darkest things about this whole issue. John and jane doe already dead, unknowingly giving their bodies to a lie.\" said by Daniel\n\"And then, of course, there\u2019s the proof out there that is living and breathing, and no one knows about it but us. When can we tell christine that her murder victim is alive?\" said by Jack\n\"When we\u2019re in contact with phyllis, d she\u2019s in town and she\u2019s under surveillance, whether she wants to be or not. She knows coming back here, she could be charged for stark\u2019s murder.\" said by Michael\n\"She should be arrested as soon as they find her, for her security, for our safety. She needs to testify or sign a sworn statement.\" said by Jack\n\"Summer will run out there and find phyllis herself.\" said by Kyle\n\"It\u2019s one of the many reasons why we agreed that we have to hold off on telling her.\" said by Daniel\n\"Hey, you\u2019re not the ones who have to look into her eyes every day. If she finds out phyllis is alive\u2013\" said by Kyle\n\"She will.\" said by Daniel\n\"When the time is right.\" said by Michael\n\"Michael, daniel, uh, thank you. Michael, for all you do. Daniel, thank you for sharing your encounter with phyllis. You didn\u2019t have to tell us any of that, and it changes everything for us.\" said by Jack\n\"I hope so. I gotta run.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah. I\u2019ll be in touch.\" said by Michael\n\"Okay, go ahead. Say it. I know you have very strong feelings against my decision.\" said by Jack\n\"I hate it. Summer needs to know.\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, she will know eventually. We can\u2019t tell her\u2013\" said by Jack\n\"Because I know what it\u2019s like to have people tell you that your mother is dead. I look into her eyes and I know what she feels, how much she misses her, how much it hurts. How she wants to hold her one more time, make more memories. Thing is? She can do all of that, because her mother is out there somewhere, alive. But I have a wife who is crying herself to sleep and blaming my mother for phyllis\u2019s supposed death. We could be out there living our lives again. I\u2019m not doing this any longer. I am telling summer.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019m not sure what I was looking for. This is all uncharted territory for me. An adventure I could have never anticipated.\" said by Nate\n\"I feel the same way.\" said by Victoria\n\"And I find myself drawn to you. Explain to me how we can know each other for so many years in so many ways, and now, when it\u2019s insanely inappropriate\u2026\" said by Nate\n\"This attraction\u2026\" said by Victoria\n\"Constantly wanting more of you.\" said by Nate\n\"I feel the same way.\" said by Victoria\n\"So you want me?\" said by Nate\n\"Isn\u2019t obvious?\" said by Victoria\n\"Agreed.\" said by Nate\n\"However\u2026\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, no strings. No buts.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, that\u2019s good, because that means that your future is completely in your hands. Your own hands.\" said by Victoria\n\"What makes you think that I haven\u2019t let you go?\" said by Adam\n\"I can see it in the way that you look at me. In the way that you smile at me. Your words.\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2013 I can\u2019t be happy?\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah. Be overjoyed about the baby, but from a respectful distance. Look, this is not a request, okay? It\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s a requirement.\" said by Sally\n\"Okay, um, is there an expiration date on my banishment? Should I expect a birth announcement by email, or\u2013 or what?\" said by Adam\n\"[ Scoffs ] Okay, adam. I will keep you abreast on all the doctor\u2019s appointments.\" said by Sally\n\"Oh, thank you. Thank you.\" said by ", "answer": "Adam"}
{"content": "\"Have you seen your mother?\" said by Jack\n\"No, but I\u2019m sure she\u2019s around here somewhere. House arrest humor.\" said by Kyle\n\"Not funny. And don\u2019t let your mother hear you joking like that.\" said by Jack\n\"Have you seen summer this morning by chance?\" said by Kyle\n\"No. Have you tried texting her?\" said by Jack\n\"I was hoping I wouldn\u2019t have to. Last night, it felt like we were reconnecting. She apologized for being distant and pulling away, but she\u2019s left without a word to me. Again, I wish it didn\u2019t get to me, but it does.\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, we\u2019re all under a pressure cooker. There\u2019s no telling how anyone\u2019s going to react.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, the conquering hero has returned.\" said by Diane\n\"Well, I don\u2019t know about hero, but I got a book.\" said by Jack\n\"Yes, from a bookstore. So, you spoke to people. Thank you.\" said by Diane\n\"When you are a free woman, I will take you anywhere you want to go.\" said by Jack\n\"You know what? Let\u2019s just go now, okay? Come with me, jack. Let\u2019s just get out of here.\" said by Diane\n\"There she is, my favorite district attorney. Beautiful morning, isn\u2019t it? I assume, since you picked the restaurant, I\u2019m gonna pay.\" said by Michael\n\"Always a pleasure, michael.\" said by Christine\n\"Oh, oh, and you\u2019re gonna offer, um, an insulting plea bargain, I\u2019m gonna let you know right now that my client will most assuredly decline it, in the light of the fact that her supposed victim is, um, wait for it, still alive. Boom.\" said by Michael\n\"No deal.\" said by Christine\n\"And if I\u2019m not paying, then why are you wasting my time?\" said by Michael\n\"There\u2019s been a development.\" said by Christine\n\"Getting coffee?\" said by Summer\n\"No. I\u2019m picking up something for lucy.\" said by Daniel\n\"Let me guess, cinnamon bun?\" said by Summer\n\"How do you know that?\" said by Daniel\n\"We\u2019re a family of cinnamon lovers.\" said by Summer\n\"Must\u2019ve skipped me.\" said by Daniel\n\"Like so many other traits.\" said by Summer\n\"Hm?\" said by Daniel\n\"Let\u2019s just skip it.\" said by Summer\n\"Good idea. How are you doing?\" said by Daniel\n\"I don\u2019t know. My mom is in exile, jack and kyle just want to drag her back so she can be arrested and diane is dying to be my bestie, so I\u2019m pretty much living a nightmare.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, I know one thing that can make all your worries just disappear.\" said by Daniel\n\"Magic?\" said by Summer\n\"Mom comes home. No matter the consequences. Just like that.\" said by Daniel\n\"Just like that? I don\u2019t see that happening anytime soon.\" said by Summer\n\"You know, when I talked this through with lily earlier, she made a lot of good points about accepting responsibility and earning forgiveness.\" said by Daniel\n\"You told lily? All of it? Wow. Daniel, are you seriously incapable in keeping a secret? What\u2019s wrong with you?\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m sorry, because I want our mother to come home? Yes, how dare I?\" said by Daniel\n\"She\u2019s not home if she\u2019s in a prison cell. That part doesn\u2019t seem to bother you at all, does it? But, there\u2019s still time. Our special guest hasn\u2019t arrived yet.\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m gonna stop by later. I\u2019m, uh, really calling about cameron. Have you talked to chance? Does he know anything about cameron\u2019s location?\" said by Nick\n\"Not yet. But on the bright side, I haven\u2019t received anymore creepy postcards or bloody souvenirs.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, let\u2019s hope it stays that way.\" said by Nick\n\"You know, maybe this is all a misunderstanding and cameron\u2019s still in prison. The twisted gifts are the last desperate acts of a man who\u2019s locked away from society.\" said by Sharon\n\"But why reach out now? You know, after all this time?\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2019m trying to set this aside for today.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, I hear you, sharon, but until we hear from chance though, we have to err on the side of caution. If cameron has been released, you have to protect yourself and you can\u2019t do that until you know for sure.\" said by Nick\n\"Nicholas?\" said by Nikki\n\"I gotta run. Call me if you learn anything, okay?\" said by Nick\n\"I will. Bye.\" said by Sharon\n\"That\u2019s how you welcome your daughter? What are you doing?\" said by Faith\n\"Um, I\u2019m cleaning up. Come in. You\u2019re here. You\u2019re home. You made it.\" said by Sharon\n\"Oh, mom. It\u2019s so good to see you.\" said by Faith\n\"Let me look at you, my sweet girl.\" said by Sharon\n\"Wait. I brought someone home from school. He didn\u2019t have anywhere to go. I really hope you don\u2019t mind.\" said by Faith\n\"We should be ready to close that deal once we get the paperwork back from legal.\" said by Nick\n\"To hell with the paperwork. Cameron\u2019s been released? Where is that monster now?\" said by Nikki\n\"Ah.\" said by Cameron\n\"Additional sponsorship provided by\u2026\" said by Announcer\n\"We don\u2019t know if cameron\u2019s been released. It\u2019s just speculation at this point.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, how did this issue even come up?\" said by Nikki\n\"It\u2019s just curiosity. Nothing more.\" said by Nick\n\"Because if he has been released\u2013\" said by Nikki\n\"Mom, we will be all over it. I promise you, if anything changes, I will tell you.\" said by Nick\n\"Please do. Because we can\u2019t have a repeat of that situation. How\u2019s everything else?\" said by Nikki\n\"Well, I\u2019m glad you asked. We need to talk.\" said by Nick\n\"Okay, if it\u2019s about the abu dhabi deal\u2013\" said by Nikki\n\"It\u2019s not. It\u2019s about vic and nate. What\u2019s your opinion about that? Actually, let me give you mine first. It is a disaster waiting to happen.\" said by Nick\n\"Do you even\u2026 do you even know what loyalty is? Or\u2013 or how to keep a secret?\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah, you might be used to this level of chaos and deception. I am not.\" said by Daniel\n\"Right. Your life is perfect and righteous. I forgot.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah, I needed one person to talk to. Someone who wasn\u2019t going to condemn me. Someone who could maybe see my side of things. That person happened to be lily and you just can\u2019t accept it. You gotta turn it into this huge betrayal.\" said by Daniel\n\"Fine. Have a friend, but you better hope that she is better at keeping a secret than you are. I\u2019m so stupid. Like, why did I even tell you any of this?\" said by Summer\n\"It doesn\u2019t matter. Mom called me too. She may not have spoken on the phone, but I knew it was her. So, I would\u2019ve figured it out eventually.\" said by Daniel\n\"You know what, daniel? You need to be careful. Because if other people start finding out about this. I don\u2019t know, people who\u2026 own media companies, then you are putting our mom in serious danger.\" said by Summer\n\"You seem to be the one with all the knowledge. So, what do you suggest we do?\" said by Daniel\n\"She stays hidden. Until we can prove that the situation she was in was kill or be killed. I don\u2019t know, maybe we\u2013 we try to find the emt. Stark must\u2019ve paid him off to do what he did.\" said by Summer\n\"That\u2019s a good point.\" said by Daniel\n\"So, we find him, we get him to corroborate mom\u2019s story\u2013\" said by Summer\n\"We can\u2019t put all our trust in one guy though. Especially when his whereabouts are unknown.\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, what else are we gonna do? We can\u2019t just do nothing.\" said by Summer\n\"What about kyle?\" said by Daniel\n\"What about kyle?\" said by Summer\n\"You know that this is upsetting him. You know he doesn\u2019t like seeing his mother suffer like this.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah, living in the lap of luxury, surrounded by her family. Poor diane.\" said by Summer\n\"Mom started this. She\u2019s the one who chose this path.\" said by Daniel\n\"People make mistakes, daniel. Chance. Hi.\" said by Summer\n\"Hey.\" said by Chance\n\"What\u2019s up, man?\" said by Daniel\n\"A lot, actually. I have some news.\" said by Chance\n\"How bad is it?\" said by Summer\n\"Depends on how you look at it.\" said by Chance\n\"Uh, can I get you anything?\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah, yeah. A night at the movies. A day at the park. Feeding the ducks at the pond with harrison.\" said by Diane\n\"We will have all of that if we just show patience and a little bit of faith.\" said by Jack\n\"I\u2019m trying.\" said by Diane\n\"I know.\" said by Jack\n\"I was worried you were gonna bolt. Set off the alarm bells.\" said by Kyle\n\"No. I\u2019m not running anywhere. I have too much to stay for. But phyllis, on the other hand, she\u2019s probably off on some island, sunning herself.\" said by Diane\n\"I know it\u2019s frustrating, but we\u2019re not giving up, are we?\" said by Jack\n\"Someone will find her, the charges will be dropped, and we\u2019ll all go back to our normal lives.\" said by Kyle\n\"But time is running out.\" said by Diane\n\"Wait, why do you say that?\" said by Jack\n\"Because the longer it takes to find her, the farther away she can get. She can change her name. She can meet all the right people who will help her do all the wrong things. Trust me, trust me. I know how easy it is for a motivated person to disappear.\" said by Diane\n\"They are going to find her.\" said by Kyle\n\"I don\u2019t know. By then, I may be rotting away in some prison cell. I think\u2013 I think we all just need to come to terms with it. It is what it is.\" said by Diane\n\"Hi. Um, come in.\" said by Kyle\n\"Sorry to barge in like this.\" said by Christine\n\"But this is one of those times where you, um, don\u2019t wanna kill the messenger.\" said by Michael\n\"Has something happened?\" said by Jack\n\"I wanna see the look on diane\u2019s face when she gets the news.\" said by Michael\n\"We\u2019re dropping the charges.\" said by Christine\n\"What?\" said by Diane\n\"Yes! I knew it.\" said by Kyle\n\"Some prayers are answered. Wow.\" said by Jack\n\"Wait. It\u2013 it\u2019s true? This is real? It\u2019s over?\" said by Diane\n\"It\u2019s really over.\" said by Christine\n\"Oh, god. Kayaking is my thing.\" said by Diane\n\"You\u2013 you brought a friend home?\" said by Sharon\n\"I hope it\u2019s not a big deal. I told him it wouldn\u2019t be.\" said by Faith\n\"Well, it\u2019s not moses, is it?\" said by Sharon\n\"No, but moses loves him too. I\u2019ll be right back.\" said by Faith\n\"You know, if you\u2019d told me that you were bringing someone, I would\u2019ve straightened up the guest room.\" said by Sharon\n\"He can fall asleep anywhere. You\u2019ll love him. Everybody does. Mom, borgnine. Borgnine, mom. He\u2019s a cat.\" said by Faith\n\"Yeah. Well, welcome borgnine. As long as you\u2019re here, you\u2019re family.\" said by Sharon\n\"Speaking of family, when do I get to meet my new niece? I can\u2019t wait to cuddle something that doesn\u2019t shed on me.\" said by Faith\n\"Did we hear someone asking about a niece?\" said by Tessa\n\"Hey! Come on in. Come in. Ah, I love having a full house. Everybody please, take a seat.\" said by Sharon\n\"What is going on here?\" said by Mariah\n\"Um, this is a cat.\" said by Sharon\n\"Oh.\" said by Mariah\n\"Who is staying in faith\u2019s room, right now. Just a sec.\" said by Sharon\n\"Wow.\" said by Mariah\n\"Is this our bundle of love?\" said by Faith\n\"Oh, yes. Aria, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re awake because you are about to meet somebody very important.\" said by Mariah\n\"See, this beautiful young woman is your aunt faith.\" said by Tessa\n\"Hello, aria. I\u2019m so happy to finally meet you. I have waited for this moment for such a long time. Normally, I would tell you that I\u2019ll be the one to take you for your first tattoo or concert, but since your moms came pre-loaded with that stuff, I\u2019m pretty sure it won\u2019t be a problem.\" said by Faith\n\"Well, that will be a long way off.\" said by Tessa\n\"Thank you.\" said by Mariah\n\"She\u2019s so beautiful. I love her already. Welcome to the family, aria.\" said by Faith\n\"Well, it\u2019s a shame that elena had to be hurt in this. She\u2019s a lovely young woman. But victoria seems very happy.\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh yeah, she was real happy about ashton too. And we know how that turned out.\" said by Nick\n\"Yes. But, there was no way she could have known that he was the monster he turned out to be and anyway, we all welcomed him into the family.\" said by Nikki\n\"No, not all of us.\" said by Nick\n\"All right. The thing is, victoria does not need a chaperone.\" said by Nikki\n\"We\u2019ll agree to disagree on that.\" said by Nick\n\"What do you have against nate? I mean, we\u2019ve known him forever.\" said by Nikki\n\"He was different then. Now, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s like he can\u2019t operate, so now he\u2019s just stabbing everybody in the back. This isn\u2019t gonna end well. Not for any of us.\" said by Nick\n\"Latte delivery.\" said by Nate\n\"You\u2019re a mind reader. Thanks. Come in. Tell me everything I need to know.\" said by Audra\n\"What? About the streaming deal?\" said by Nate\n\"You said that you had some updated numbers that we can plug in.\" said by Audra\n\"Ah, yes. I meant to bring that printout, but I got distracted by something else.\" said by Nate\n\"Something\u2026 important?\" said by Audra\n\"Breakfast with victor.\" said by Nate\n\"What did he want? And how bad did it get?\" said by Audra\n\"Oh, it was going great. And then, we started talking about his daughter. And my future.\" said by Nate\n\"No murder charge? No\u2013 no trial? It\u2019s all just wiped away?\" said by Diane\n\"The lead detective found evidence that phyllis was alive at the time of her memorial.\" said by Christine\n\"No body, no murder, no crime.\" said by Michael\n\"This is unbelievable.\" said by Diane\n\"But how?\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, chance followed up on the strand of hair that you found at the motel, which led him to finding a program from phyllis\u2019 memorial.\" said by Christine\n\"Yeah. The lab examined the evidence, they found phyllis\u2019 fingerprints as well as her dna, which proved that she was very much alive after she was declared dead.\" said by Michael\n\"There it is. What did I tell you? The proof we\u2019ve been hoping for.\" said by Jack\n\"You made it, mom. You\u2019re free.\" said by Kyle\n\"So, on behalf of the prosecutor\u2019s office, and myself, I just, want to apologize. These were extraordinary circumstances.\" said by Christine\n\"So, what happens now? Now that you know that phyllis is alive? What happens to phyllis?\" said by Diane\n\"So, the lab ran some tests on evidence I found and they just called me back with the results.\" said by Chance\n\"Is it a match to our mom?\" said by Daniel\n\"You were right to believe your brother. Phyllis is alive. And you did see her, like you said.\" said by Chance\n\"So everything daniel said is true.\" said by Summer\n\"I would imagine that this means D.A. Will drop the charges against diane.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah. They\u2019re telling her right now.\" said by Chance\n\"Oh, she must be thrilled. I\u2019m sure you are too, right? Is this what you hoped? Diane is free. But what about my mom? What\u2019s gonna happen to her?\" said by Summer\n\"Look, it\u2019s out of my hands at this point. All I know is that when we find phyllis, she will be facing charges.\" said by Chance\n\"If you find her.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, we\u2019ll find her. Christine is not gonna let her get away with this. I guarantee, she\u2019ll call a press conference and have a perp walk when we find her.\" said by Chance\n\"Christine has always had a grudge against my mom.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, after the money, the man hours, and the embarrassment, phyllis is now the poster girl for what happens to the rich and powerful when they bend the law. Christine wants her to pay.\" said by Chance\n\"Is it possible that aria\u2019s even cuter when she\u2019s asleep?\" said by Faith\n\"No, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying.\" said by Tessa\n\"You can wake her up and do a comparison.\" said by Faith\n\"Don\u2019t you dare.\" said by Tessa\n\"I will kill you.\" said by Mariah\n\"I\u2019m kidding. I would never.\" said by Faith\n\"We have house rules.\" said by Mariah\n\"You wake her up, you put her back.\" said by Tessa\n\"I want to know everything. Every time that mom calls, she\u2019s always too busy to asking me about myself to tell me what I\u2019m missing.\" said by Faith\n\"Well, some things you need to hear about in person.\" said by Sharon\n\"I mean, you know about the gala. And phyllis.\" said by Mariah\n\"It\u2019s awful. Poor summer. I\u2019ve called and texted but she never answers.\" said by Faith\n\"Don\u2019t take that personally. She needs time.\" said by Sharon\n\"How\u2019s dad?\" said by Faith\n\"You will see for yourself soon.\" said by Sharon\n\"And how about new motherhood to the world\u2019s cutest baby?\" said by Faith\n\"It\u2019s the hardest job we\u2019ll ever love.\" said by Tessa\n\"I love that. Anything else I\u2019m missing?\" said by Faith\n\"Um, I\u2019m just happy to have all my ladies here with me. Other than that, um, nothing unusual.\" said by Sharon\n\"Money doesn\u2019t have much of a conscience.\" said by Cameron\n\"Yeah. Well, what about you, mr. Kirsten?\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, my conscience is, um, is kind of like my lawyer, my accountant. I can consult it, but, uh I don\u2019t always follow its advice.\" said by Cameron\n\"If you ever, ever, mention to my husband having met me before, I will make sure that the whole world knows what a sicko you are.\" said by Sharon\n\"Don\u2019t threaten me. Because you know what? I got nothing to hide. Now you, on the other hand, you seem to feel you have quite a bit to lose.\" said by Cameron\n\"My children are young, okay? They need me. Now, what possible pleasure could you get out of harming them? Well, that was a stupid question, wasn\u2019t it?\" said by Sharon\n\"Not at all. I like that you came looking for me. So, we can discuss this privately.\" said by Cameron\n\"Please tell nicholas that you can\u2019t make this dinner.\" said by Sharon\n\"Let me ask you something. Do I get a, uh, a little something in return?\" said by Cameron\n\"At the very least, phyllis is guilty of fraud and obstruction of justice. On the other end of the spectrum, we have the murder of jeremy stark.\" said by Christine\n\"Which was reportedly self-defense.\" said by Michael\n\"Yeah.\" said by Diane\n\"Once they can track down how the ambulance crash was staged and how the bodies were switched out, that list is gonna get longer and longer.\" said by Christine\n\"It finally happened. Kyle, what do you think?\" said by Jack\n\"It\u2019s great. I mean, we can pick back up where we left off, wherever that was.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019m just glad that diane can be back with her family, for good. We both are.\" said by Daniel\n\"Right. Yeah. Of course.\" said by Summer\n\"I just wish we could do the same for mom.\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, look. Everything\u2019s up in the air until we get a statement. I gotta run, but I\u2019ll be in touch with any updates.\" said by Chance\n\"Wait, chance. That can\u2019t be it. You must\u2019ve found something else in the motel. Evidence to prove that it was self-defense?\" said by Summer\n\"The room wasn\u2019t even preserved a crime scene. I was lucky to find what I did. Any sign of struggle, it was long gone somewhere.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, how am I supposed to help my mom?\" said by Summer\n\"You know I can\u2019t advise you on that.\" said by Chance\n\"But she is innocent until proven guilty, right? All I\u2019m asking for is that she\u2019s able to come home without an extended prison stay. Look, any guidance that you can give me.\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019ll do what I can. Within the bounds of the law, okay?\" said by Chance\n\"Of course. I wouldn\u2019t expect anything else.\" said by Summer\n\"First of all, phyllis needs to come home and she needs to make a statement. We all need to hear this from her lips. (Wheezing)\" said by Chance\n\"The young and the restless will continue.\" said by Announcer\n\"You went toe-to-toe with victor newman himself and lived to talk about it.\" said by Audra\n\"It wasn\u2019t toe-to-toe. It was a friendly conversation.\" said by Nate\n\"Does victor do friendly? He was trying to get a read on you, which basically determines your entire future. So, tell me all the details.\" said by Audra\n\"Well first, we started talking about my past as a physician. All the while, I\u2019m trying to figure out what this meeting was about. Then, he brought up victoria.\" said by ", "answer": "Nate"}
{"content": "\"[ Big breaths ] Nate.\" said by Sally\n\"Hey.\" said by Nate\n\"Hey. Hey.\" said by Sally\n\"How\u2019s it going?\" said by Nate\n\"Um, not great. Actually, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m really sorry to bother you, but I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m not feeling very well.\" said by Sally\n\"Okay. Uh, in\u2013 in what way? What\u2019s the problem?\" said by Nate\n\"I think something might be wrong with my baby.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, this is detective chancellor. I was hoping to find out when I could expect the toxicology report on the blood that was drawn from phyllis summers. I apologize for the rush request. I understand that these things take time. I could just really use this one as soon as possible. Okay. Thank you. Thank you for understanding. Yeah, I\u2019ll be expecting your call. All right.\" said by Detective chancellor\n\"Hi, chance.\" said by Abby\n\"Hey sharon. Can I, uh, get my usual?\" said by Adam\n\"Uh. I\u2019m sorry, what?\" said by Sharon\n\"Uh, I was just trying to order some coffee. Everything okay?\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah. Um\u2026 I\u2019m just having a hard time focusing this morning. I guess I\u2019m still processing. Wait, you don\u2019t know.\" said by Sharon\n\"Uh, apparently not. What is it that I don\u2019t know?\" said by Adam\n\"Well, there\u2019s no easy way to say this, but\u2026 last night phyllis passed away.\" said by Sharon\n\"Hey.\" said by Devon\n\"Hey.\" said by Lily\n\"Thank you for coming over. Yeah. I\u2013 I know it\u2019s been a heavy morning. How you doing?\" said by Devon\n\"I mean, I don\u2019t know. I was with daniel last night. I will say I know phyllis wasn\u2019t everyone\u2019s favorite person, but she loved her kids, and her kids loved her.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah. Of course. They have to be in shock right now.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah.\" said by Lily\n\"There\u2019s just\u2026 nothing ever prepares you for losing a parent this young in life. I\u2019m sure daniel\u2019s grateful though to have you around since, you know exactly what he\u2019s going through.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. Well, I wish you and I didn\u2019t know it so well.\" said by Lily\n\"Me too. But\u2026 when you deal with loss, they can make you put things into perspective and realize that you can\u2019t wait around to right the wrongs in your life. You have to do it now while you\u2019re here, and while you can. Which is one of the reasons why I asked you to come over, actually. I want to continue our conversation about chancellor-winters.\" said by Devon\n\"Thank you, sweetheart.\" said by Victor\n\"I can\u2019t stop thinking about nicholas.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah.\" said by Victor\n\"How\u2019s he doing?\" said by Victoria\n\"I think he needs some time.\" said by Victor\n\"Poor summer. My heart goes out to her.\" said by Victoria\n\"Thank you. I know. We saw her this morning. She seems to be teetering between being too composed and on the verge of a breakdown. And she\u2019s insisting on planning phyllis\u2019 memorial.\" said by Nikki\n\"Well, she shouldn\u2019t have to deal with that right now. I can help her.\" said by Victoria\n\"No, she doesn\u2019t want any help.\" said by Nikki\n\"Well, that\u2019s crazy. She\u2019s in no shape to take that on.\" said by Victoria\n\"No, she\u2019s not. But those are her wishes. So, I just told her that we\u2019re there for her and ready to help her with whatever she needs, and we\u2019ll give her her space.\" said by Nikki\n\"Well, then I guess I shouldn\u2019t go see her today.\" said by Victoria\n\"It might be better if you wait for her emotions to settle down a bit.\" said by Nikki\n\"By the way, sweetheart. You saw tucker? How did that go?\" said by Victor\n\"Oh, well, that\u2019s very easy to answer. Nowhere.\" said by Victoria\n\"What? You weren\u2019t able to make any headway with him?\" said by Victor\n\"I withdrew our offer to buy the company. I\u2019m no longer interested in mccall unlimited.\" said by Victoria\n\"Why would\" said by Victor\n\"Why would you withdraw the offer?\" said by Victor\n\"It\u2019s already been too much of a headache and I can only see more migraines in the future.\" said by Victoria\n\"You know damn well that a deal of this size brings with it headaches.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, in this case, the\u2013 the pitfalls outweigh any upside, both for the company and for the family. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it, dad. And I told tucker myself last night.\" said by Victoria\n\"This was not your decision to make alone. You should have consulted with your father.\" said by Victor\n\"I am the ceo of newman enterprises, aren\u2019t I?\" said by Victoria\n\"Are you forgetting who put you in this chair?\" said by Victor\n\"Then I take it that you don\u2019t agree with my decision.\" said by Victoria\n\"No, I don\u2019T. And all this nonsense about headaches and obstacles. The real issue is adam, isn\u2019t it?\" said by Victor\n\"You\u2019re mistaken. Adam is your concern. For me, it\u2019s all about the business and what\u2019s best for the business.\" said by Victoria\n\"That\u2019s what you keep on saying.\" said by Victor\n\"Yes. Well, I\u2019ve reevaluated the pros and the cons and the potential risks. Now, you know what? I just changed my mind. Yes, dad. And you know what? There\u2019s no potential room for growth. There\u2019s just not. I would be so happy to show you the numbers.\" said by Victoria\n\"And I\u2019m sure you called all the numbers to support your position. What I\u2019m questioning is is your motivation.\" said by Victor\n\"I always have this company and our family\u2019s best interests at heart. That\u2019s my motivation, dad. And if you don\u2019t believe that, then why did you trust me to be the custodian of your legacy?\" said by Victoria\n\"Why are you so reluctant to have adam reunite with his family? Why are you so against him having his own success?\" said by Victor\n\"How is handing him a company a success of his own? Look, if you want to acquire mccall unlimited and hand it to adam, well, by all means, feel free to do so. But do it independent of newman because this company should have no part of it.\" said by Victoria\n\"Don\u2019t ever forget who handed you this company.\" said by Victor\n\"In the blink of an eye, phyllis is gone. What was she doing marrying stark of all people? That sounds off. I\u2019m sure.\" said by Adam\n\"Sadly, we\u2019ll never be able to ask her.\" said by Sharon\n\"Uh, have you spoken to nick about it?\" said by Adam\n\"Well, not since last night. I was with him when all of the information was rolling in and then when phyllis\u2019 death was confirmed, obviously, he was very focused on summer.\" said by Sharon\n\"Hmm. Well, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll reach out to you when he gets the chance to.\" said by Adam\n\"I hope he does. You know, he was really there for me when ray died and I want him to know that I can be that person for him now, especially since the situations are so similar.\" said by Sharon\n\"You two have been through something like this before. Together. I\u2019m sure that he will reach out.\" said by Adam\n\"Losing cassie and ray, I feel especially qualified to help people through this. I know what it feels like when fate reaches out and snatches the person you love and the inevitable guilt of things that were said, things that were left unsaid and how that weighs on you.\" said by Sharon\n\"Sharon, nick will reach out. Okay? And you will be a great comfort to him. But you can\u2019t be everything to everyone all the time, even though you try. You have to take care of yourself too.\" said by Adam\n\"I will, if you will.\" said by Sharon\n\"[ Laughs ] Deal.\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah, of course.\" said by Sharon\n\"Okay. I\u2019ll check back in with you.\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah.\" said by Sharon\n\"The news about phyllis is sickening.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah. Um, I feel sorry for summer and for daniel.\" said by Chance\n\"Yeah. You never expect that it\u2019s gonna be the last time that you see someone. But thank you so much for your hard work. I know the family really appreciates it.\" said by Abby\n\"Just doing my job. Anyway. Nice to runing into you.\" said by Chance\n\"Wait, chance. Um\u2013 I don\u2019t want to intrude at a time like this, but I\u2019ve been looking for you. There\u2019s something that we need to discuss.\" said by Abby\n\"Everything changed for me last night. Just being in that room and seeing those pictures on the wall and hearing his favorite music all night long.\" said by Devon\n\"I know. I felt like he was there with us.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah. And I\u2019m sure he was. And then, hearing about the news of phyllis this morning, it reminded me about that day that we lost him all over again. And made me think about how we really don\u2019t have a lot of time here on this planet. And the most important thing is keeping the people that you love close to you.\" said by Devon\n\"I agree. I do. I mean, time is a really valuable resource, and I really don\u2019t want to waste any more of it.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah. Neither do I, at all. You know, you\u2019re my sister. I love you and there should never be anything that\u2019s bigger than that. Oh, I wanna give our partnership at chancellor-winters a second shot.\" said by Devon\n\"I gotta say, I\u2013 I thought you looked a little different at the gala. But, uh, I learned a long time ago to never assume a woman is pregnant.\" said by Nate\n\"Good call. Yeah, I\u2013 I haven\u2019t told a lot of people and I promise I\u2019m not in the habit of just flagging down doctors as they\u2019re casually walking by. So, I thank you, uh, for stopping and listening. Um. Sometimes after I eat, I get nauseous, and I get this, like, fluttering feeling in my stomach and I just am not really sure it\u2019s normal.\" said by Sally\n\"Okay. Well, I can\u2019t be 100% certain and this wouldn\u2019t be an official diagnosis. Okay? Uh. Who\u2019s your obstetrician?\" said by Nate\n\"Dr. Chandler.\" said by Sally\n\"Good, good. She\u2019s the best. You should probably schedule an appointment with her just to be sure. But from what you\u2019ve told me, I\u2019m confident I know what\u2019s going on.\" said by Nate\n\"Okay. Can you connect the dots for me?\" said by Sally\n\"Well, that weird fluttery feeling happens after you eat, right?\" said by Nate\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Sally\n\"And then you tend to get relief once you walk around a bit.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah. Yeah. That\u2019s right.\" said by Sally\n\"Is it possible you get this feeling after you\u2019ve eaten a little too much?\" said by Nate\n\"Uh. Well, an omelet, toast, and double hash browns. So, yes, it\u2019s possible.\" said by Sally\n\"And you\u2019re feeling mild nausea but nowhere near morning sickness.\" said by Nate\n\"Yes.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, I think what\u2019s happening is a cause for celebration.\" said by Nate\n\"What exactly am I celebrating?\" said by Sally\n\"The baby is starting to move.\" said by Nate\n\"So, when I eat, the baby eats as well and the food\u2019s not only providing me with energy, but the baby too.\" said by Sally\n\"Someone was napping in biology class.\" said by Nate\n\"Is it that obvious? I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m playing catch up now. It\u2019s just there\u2019s something new every day.\" said by Sally\n\"So, you\u2019re right. The nutrition gives the baby a little boost, which in turn contributes to your queasiness.\" said by Nate\n\"So, when I get up and I move around, it\u2019s like I\u2019m rocking my little guy or girl to sleep, which is\u2013 soothes them, so the fluttering eases up.\" said by Sally\n\"That\u2019s pretty much it.\" said by Nate\n\"Thank you, nate. You have excellent bedside manner for a media executive.\" said by Sally\n\"I would take that as a compliment. Well, it looks like my take-out order\u2019s here, if you\u2019re good.\" said by Nate\n\"Uh. Yeah, please go enjoy some nausea free carbs for me. And if you wouldn\u2019t mind keeping this to yourself.\" said by Sally\n\"It\u2019s not my news to share. But, um, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d like to leave you with some words of advice. Just three things. Try to eat frequent smaller meals, opposed to fewer large ones, okay? That should lessen the discomfort of sharing a full stomach with a growing baby. Two, chamomile tea helps with digestion.\" said by Nate\n\"Ah, good to know. What\u2019s the third?\" said by Sally\n\"Cherish these moments. They don\u2019t last forever.\" said by Nate\n\"Ah. Okay. Um, you wanna come back to chancellor-winters?\" said by Lily\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Devon\n\"Have you thought about this enough?\" said by Lily\n\"I don\u2019t need to give it a lot of time. I can feel like it\u2019s the right thing to do.\" said by Devon\n\"Well, is this because of what happened yesterday? Because I mean, that was a lot for everyone.\" said by Lily\n\"What do you think? This is just like an emotional decision I\u2019m making?\" said by Devon\n\"Well, I just wanna make sure that it\u2019s not, you know. Our\u2013 our company, our relationship has been through a lot of turmoil. So, I wanna make sure that we\u2019re being logical about this.\" said by Lily\n\"I\u2019m being very logical about it. The only thing that matters to me is protecting our relationship, as brother and sister and as colleagues, I just want to hit the reset button.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. I mean, I want that too, of course, I do, you know, but I\u2013 I\u2019m scared, right? Like, what if we end up in the same place? Like, what if it happens again?\" said by Lily\n\"It\u2019s not gonna happen again, we won\u2019t let it. And in order to do that, we have to have open communication between each other at all times. And have total honesty, even if it hurts each other\u2019s feelings.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. I mean, listen, I agree. I think last time we both had our own agenda, and we weren\u2019t honest with each other.\" said by Lily\n\"Exactly. So, can we do that moving forward? Have total honesty?\" said by Devon\n\"Okay. Well, in light of total honesty. I mean, are you just doing this to mend things with me or because you\u2019re afraid of losing hamilton winters?\" said by Lily\n\"Well, of course, I want to hang on to my company, but no, it\u2019s\u2013 the main part of all this is not losing my sister because we\u2019re all we have.\" said by Devon\n\"That\u2019s exactly what aunt mimi said.\" said by Lily\n\"She\u2019s a smart woman. Now, I wanna be partners with you again and I wanna make something out of chancellor-winters that we can both be proud of. And that catherine and neil would be proud of.\" said by Devon\n\"All right. Well, I gotta take yes for an answer.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah. Good. Cheers.\" said by Devon\n\"Cheers.\" said by Lily\n\"Dom is fine, right?\" said by Chance\n\"Yes. Yes, he\u2019s fine. I\u2019m sorry. I should have led with that.\" said by Abby\n\"Um. Okay. Well, I\u2019m not sure what else there is to talk about.\" said by Chance\n\"Chance, I want to be um, completely transparent with you and this isn\u2019t gonna be easy to hear. Devon asked me and dominic to move in with him.\" said by Abby\n\"Hmm.\" said by Chance\n\"I haven\u2019t made any final decisions. I\u2013 I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do yet, but I just\u2013 I wanted to talk to you first because I don\u2019t want to make visitations any more uncomfortable than they already are.\" said by Abby\n\"Uncomfortable? How are they uncomfortable?\" said by Chance\n\"They just are. You know that. And I don\u2019t want to do anything to add to it. And also, this is a pretty small town. People talk, so I know it\u2019ll be a point of gossip.\" said by Abby\n\"Well, I think everyone has other things on their mind at the moment.\" said by Chance\n\"I know. And I know how busy you are. I just, um\u2026 I wanted to talk to you before I make a final decision.\" said by Abby\n\"You\u2019re actually asking for my opinion on this?\" said by Chance\n\"Hey, son. I assume you heard about last night\u2019s events.\" said by Victor\n\"I just found out from sharon. Uh, I mean, it\u2019s\u2013 what a tragedy.\" said by Adam\n\"Yup.\" said by Victor\n\"Phyllis and I, we weren\u2019t exactly close, but\u2026 she was never boring. There was times I thought we had a lot in common but, uh, obviously, um, I don\u2019t feel the loss others do.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, I appreciate your candor.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, then let\u2019s, uh, let\u2019s get to the point. What\u2019s going on with tucker\u2019s company?\" said by Adam\n\"Well son, it seems we have hit the roadblock, you know.\" said by Victor\n\"Another one?\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah. Victoria is no longer interested in acquiring mccall unlimited.\" said by Victor\n\"If I\u2019m not mistaken, newman enterprises still belongs to you. So, override her.\" said by Adam\n\"Son, I put victoria in charge for a reason. And I\u2019m not gonna disrespect her decisions.\" said by Victor\n\"Right. Because whenever it\u2019s a choice between me and victoria, it\u2019s not really a choice, it\u2019s game over.\" said by Adam\n\"Son, please don\u2019t go there, all right? I have not given up on acquiring mccall unlimited. I just want us to rethink our approach.\" said by Victor\n\"I don\u2019t think I\u2019m up for that, okay? Nothing is gonna change in our family hierarchy. Oh, I was just\u2013 I was fooling myself thinking that anything was gonna change. I think it\u2019s best that we go our separate ways, okay? I\u2019m gonna figure out my future on my own.\" said by Adam\n\"How is, uh, daniel doing?\" said by Devon\n\"Well, I mean, he\u2019s distraught, obviously. He just kept talking over and over about how all of the ways that phyllis could have been saved.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s what you do. Your mind goes in 100 different directions.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. Absolutely. And he kept beating himself up because, you know, they were in a bad place in her last days. And then he kept thinking maybe he contributed to the stress that made her pass out.\" said by Lily\n\"He can\u2019t do that. He just has to take himself through it. I\u2019d like to think that I\u2019m more at peace with losing neil and hillary, but\u2026 you know that hole in your heart never goes away.\" said by Devon\n\"No. And unfortunately, daniel is just at the beginning of his journey.\" said by Lily\n\"This whole thing with phyllis just reminds you that you gotta embrace life. And that\u2019s exactly what I intend to do and not just when it comes to business either.\" said by Devon\n\"Well, what else is going on?\" said by Lily\n\"Well, I asked abby to move in with me.\" said by Devon\n\"I\u2019m not as much asking your opinion on this as I am\u2013\" said by Abby\n\"Just go for it. I\u2019m sure dominic would love it. I assume that you and devon would too. So, no reason not to, right?\" said by Chance\n\"I want to consider your feelings.\" said by Abby\n\"Let me worry about my feelings. And I\u2019m fine with it. Really.\" said by Chance\n\"Okay. Well, um, if I do move out, then you should move back into the chancellor estate. It\u2019s your birthright.\" said by Abby\n\"It\u2019s just a house, abby.\" said by Chance\n\"It\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s not just a house. It\u2013 it\u2019s more than that.

He\u2019s a chancellor, right?\" said by Chance\n\"Yes, he is and\u2026 and maybe one day, it\u2019ll all be his.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah, of course. It\u2019s his birthright.\" said by Chance\n\"You know, I just\u2013 I really don\u2019t feel comfortable living there without you and I get the feeling that nina doesn\u2019t want me there.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah, she may have mentioned something like that to me as well. I tell you though, it\u2019s jill you need to worry about.\" said by Chance\n\"Okay. Well, um\u2013 I\u2019ll leave. But um, maybe I can just keep dominic\u2019s things there and keep his room the same. He loves it there and then everything can just be exactly the way it is now, you know, when he visits you and I won\u2019t have to disrupt his life more than I already have.\" said by Abby\n\"That\u2019s fine with me. I\u2019m gonna do what\u2019s best for dom, whatever I think that is.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, thank you, chance.

{"content": "\"Thanks, all, for coming. I wanted to meet because I have some deep concerns about Tucker McCall. I know that we have all speculated about his real reason for returning to Genoa City ever since he landed on the Abbott lawn. His interactions around town were intended to make us believe that he wanted to reunite with Ashley and Devon and to exploit the Chancellor-Winters IPO.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, in all fairness, we wanted to do the same thing.\" said by Nick\n\"Yes, true, but since then, he has completely failed both at his personal and his professional goals.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, he lost any hope of a reunion with Ashley the minute she boarded that plane for Paris.\" said by Nikki\n\"Judging from what I\u2019ve heard from Abby, Devon found out what Tucker was up to and no longer wants anything to do with him. So, he struck out on all three fronts. You\u2019re probably wondering why is he still in town and what his next move is.\" said by Nick\n\"Yes. I had a conversation with him where he implied that he was looking for another target, which means that we all have to be vigilant about his movements, at least while he\u2019s here.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, now I\u2019ve acquired some information about that man which may throw some light on his motives.\" said by Victor\n\"Hey.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Hi. Um, I was just in the neighborhood, thought I\u2019d come by and say hi and, you know, maybe spitball some ideas about the podcast.\" said by Billy\n\"Not sure that\u2019s a good idea.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Okay. Um, if you\u2019re busy, I can \u2014 I can come back later.\" said by Billy\n\"Actually, I\u2019m thinking the entire podcast might not be a good idea.\" said by Chelsea\n\"What a waste of time. Okay, why was Phyllis pitching us if she didn\u2019t even have a right to approach us with her son\u2019s project?\" said by Audra\n\"You know, I actually admire her brazenness. And I\u2019m intrigued by Daniel\u2019s gaming platform. If it\u2019s on unsteady ground at Chancellor-Winters, there may be something to pursue.\" said by Nate\n\"I can\u2019t see how. Having been privy to Chancellor-Winters\u2019 legal contracts, I can tell you those things are ironclad. Yeah, I don\u2019t think Daniel can get out of his unless the company decides to release him. You know, and if Lily\u2019s reaction to Phyllis shopping around his idea was any indication, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s gonna happen, which means we\u2019d be wasting time, energy, resources by going after it.\" said by Audra\n\"Mm. Exactly how much access did you have to Chancellor-Winters\u2019 legal contracts, when it comes to projects like Daniel\u2019s?\" said by Nate\n\"Why would you take it upon yourself to go to Nate to pitch my project to him when I explicitly told you that I wasn\u2019t ready to give up on the deal with Lily and Chancellor-Winters?\" said by Daniel\n\"Okay, well, you said that that company was putting your project on hold.\" said by Phyllis\n\"When I told you that things were shaky over there, I thought I was confiding in my mother and not some opportunist who was gonna go and shop my idea behind my back.\" said by Daniel\n\"\u201cOpportunist\u201d? Seriously? That\u2019s how you see me? Listen, I just went to Newman Media \u2019cause, you know, I was doing it as an exploratory thing, you know, to sort of whet their appetite. And I think I did. We need to have alternatives if this thing crashes in. I mean, we need to have a backup plan.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Okay, you need to stop talking like this is ours. This is my platform, mine alone. And I\u2019m not gonna trust virtual strangers with my dream project. [ Sighs ]\" said by Daniel\n\"All right, listen, Daniel, the Newmans are hardly strangers. Nick was your stepfather.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Well, nonetheless, I\u2019m wary of getting involved with any Newman-run company. I mean, I got to tell you, the worst part about this is you shared privileged information. I mean, I poured my heart out to you and Dad. I told you how much this project means to me, why I need this so bad, and not just on a professional level. I mean, I can\u2019t just ignore the fact that you have compromised my intellectual property. Now any person or any company that you spoke with about it \u2014 they can take my ideas and they can run with them before I ever get Omege Sphere off the ground.\" said by Daniel\n\"Okay. Okay. I\u2019m sorry. I \u2014 I \u2014 listen, I only spoke to Nate and \u2014 and his COO because, uh, it seems like Chancellor-Winters is shelving this project indefinitely. And I know what that does to you. Listen, I want to see your vision come to fruition. And I didn\u2019t say anything risky to Nate. I didn\u2019t say anything risky. Really. I didn\u2019t even talk to the rest of the Newmans about it.\" said by Phyllis\n\"What about Tucker McCall?\" said by Daniel\n\"What about Tucker McCall? I mean, Tucker just overheard me leaving a message for Nate. Honestly, Tucker \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t give him a sip of water if he was in the middle of a desert.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Hmm. Okay. So, you only shared information with the man who sold out his cousins to give Newman the opportunity to acquire a majority holding of Chancellor-Winters. That\u2019s great. No, I just never thought that you would go and do this with Nate without asking me first. I \u2014 I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s my mistake for thinking the best of you.\" said by Daniel\n\"What? You don\u2019t mean that. Daniel. Okay, I\u2019m sorry. Oh, my gosh. I overreacted. Give me a break. I care about this project for you. I just want the best for you. That\u2019s all.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Fair enough. But if my platform ever needs a new home, which it doesn\u2019t yet, it\u2019s my call who we go with, okay? My call. And if I\u2019m being honest with you, right now, if I had to choose, Tucker looks like the better option instead of Newman Media.\" said by Daniel\n\"So, what made you think that the podcast might not be a good idea?\" said by Billy\n\"[ Sighs ] I had my therapy session with Dr. Malone. I told her my idea, and she thinks it\u2019s too soon to venture into something so personal and intimate.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Mm.\" said by Billy\n\"Reliving the trauma of my suicide attempt before I\u2019ve finished processing it could be a potential minefield for me.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, I\u2019m sure that was disappointing, but I \u2014 I understand what she\u2019s saying.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, I was disappointed\u2026until I talked it through with Dr. Malone. She said that it\u2019s actually a really good thing that I wanted to do the podcast. It means I\u2019m focused on my recovery and I am trying to pay it forward and I\u2019m focusing on the future, which is something I couldn\u2019t say a few months ago. So\u2026 all of this is about my recovery, right? So [Sighs] How can I be disappointed?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Hmm.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, now, I asked Michael Baldwin to look into Tucker McCall\u2019s claim that he was a reformed man when he landed in Genoa City.\" said by Victor\n\"What did he find out?\" said by Victoria\n\"Apparently, McCall\u2019s lavish lifestyle \u2014 spending money left and right \u2014 has put his company under a mountain of debt.\" said by Victor\n\"How is that possible? The last we knew, he was selling off parts of his company in order to secure capital to buy out Chancellor-Winters\u2019 stock. I mean, you would think he would have some liquid assets available.\" said by Nikki\n\"That\u2019s what we all assumed, but then he took out a number of short-term loans. That\u2019s how short he was of his agenda.\" said by Victor\n\"Could just be a desperation move to stabilize his empire.\" said by Nick\n\"But those debts are coming due. So I think what he\u2019s doing \u2014 he\u2019s looking for a lucrative company to keep him afloat.\" said by Victor\n\"I told you I didn\u2019t know the details of Daniel\u2019s deal. My insider info was limited to things pertaining directly to the IPO, nothing connected with development or creative planning.\" said by Audra\n\"You never heard anything around the office?\" said by Nate\n\"Uh, I knew Lily and Devon were discussing building an entire gaming division around the idea Daniel was developing. I was also aware that they were preparing a press release towards the end of my tenure with them. Since it never came out, I\u2019m assuming they hit a standstill.\" said by Audra\n\"Hmm. Interesting.\" said by Nate\n\"Why are you asking me all this? Are you thinking of poaching Daniel from Chancellor-Winters? Or stealing his idea?\" said by Audra\n\"No. No, I\u2019m just curious. I would definitely like to know what\u2019s going on at Chancellor-Winters that would make this project so precarious. I\u2019m sure it has something to do with Devon. His inability to collaborate or take chances is probably bringing the entire company to its knees.\" said by Nate\n\"Why do you still care so much about your family\u2019s company? If I remember correctly, you were quite adamant about putting your time there behind you.\" said by Audra\n\"You\u2019re right. Old habits die hard, I guess. You know, it\u2019s too bad you burned your bridge with them, too. It would have been nice to have some inside information.\" said by Nate\n\"We both burned our bridges at Chancellor-Winters. If I hadn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\" said by Audra\n\"You\u2019re right. So I\u2019m glad you did.\" said by Nate\n\"Even if I disagree with you about going after the gaming platform?\" said by Audra\n\"Look, let\u2019s get something straight. I appreciate your input. I\u2019m not afraid of being challenged. I like to hear different points of view so I can make an informed decision.\" said by Nate\n\"And I\u2019m willing to support you 100% if you feel strongly about something, even if our opinions differ. But let me ask you this. If you\u2019re not ready to let go of the idea and if we have no insider information to help us sign Daniel, how would you go about pursuing him?\" said by Audra\n\"I say we sit the guy down and sell him on Newman Media, show him why we\u2019re a better, much more stable, fit for his venture.\" said by Nate\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Audra\n\"Everything okay?\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah. Uh, can we finish this discussion in a little bit? I have to go take care of something.\" said by Audra\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Audra\n\"Well, that is a great attitude to have, positive and accepting of Dr. Malone\u2019s advice. I remember a time when if someone said no to your idea, you\u2019d fall down the rabbit hole.\" said by Billy\n\"Exactly. And that wasn\u2019t that long ago.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, look at how far you\u2019ve come. That\u2019s a good thing.\" said by Billy\n\"Thank you.\" said by Chelsea\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Billy\n\"I heard what she had to say, and it\u2019s just not the right time for a podcast.\" said by Chelsea\n\"You know, uh, I got to say, when you first told me the idea about the podcast, I did share some of Dr. Malone\u2019s concerns. But this is your recovery, this is your process, and I just want to be supportive.\" said by Billy\n\"And you have been. You\u2019re more in tune with what\u2019s good or bad for me than you realize. And I want you to know, I really appreciate hearing your honest, unfiltered thoughts. I know I have to run everything by Dr. Malone, but I \u2014 I feel like I\u2019m ready to start opening myself up again to feedback, even if it\u2019s negative. So, receiving it from somebody that I know cares about me \u2014 that could definitely cushion the blow.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, I appreciate your vote of confidence, although I\u2019m not sure you should be taking my advice. I have screwed up plenty of times, and I\u2019m still playing it by ear.\" said by Billy\n\"Aren\u2019t we all?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Daniel, Tucker McCall is not a good guy. He is a snake.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Well, at least he\u2019s true to form. And he\u2019s a smart and intuitive businessman. And he made a lot of salient points. He understood that there could be a crossover between our business and our personal lives. Look, I got to tell you, without me even saying anything, he already knew that Lucy and Heather leaving me was a big part of why I created this whole gaming experience and a way for me to heal.\" said by Daniel\n\"Oh, a way for you to heal. Really? Oh, my goodness. He\u2019s manipulating you. He\u2019s very good at reading people. He\u2019s very good at reading people and then manipulating them to do what he wants.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Or another way of looking at it is that he showed some insight. And McCall Unlimited \u2014 they have all the resources and infrastructure we need to hit the ground running.\" said by Daniel\n\"Okay, well, a lot of companies would.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yeah, a lot of companies do, but with McCall, I\u2019d be dealing directly with Tucker \u2014 one guy, less hoops to jump through, and more autonomy.\" said by Daniel\n\"Okay, well, he\u2019d be holding all the hoops. You know this. And if you start working with him and your agenda is different than his agenda, it\u2019s war.\" said by Phyllis\n\"I\u2019m not naive. I know his reputation. But I don\u2019t judge people for the worst thing they\u2019ve ever done. And he seemed genuine in his enthusiasm for my vision.\" said by Daniel\n\"Of course he is \u2014 because your vision is brilliant, because you\u2019re brilliant, Daniel. He wants to be a part of that. He is not real. He is not a genuine guy.\" said by Phyllis\n\"You know, Omege Sphere is supposed to be about changing people\u2019s lives, right? Giving the opportunity to grow and be better. I think that if Tucker is willing to do that in his own life, then he might be the better alternative than Newman Media. If \u2014 if we need one. I\u2019m not ready to jump ship yet. I trust Lily to come through.\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, Michael Baldwin is still trying to find out what Tucker McCall\u2019s true motives are. I mean, how is he gonna regain solid footing without selling his entire company? He has no backing, no bank supporting him at the moment. I think the walls are closing in on him.\" said by Victor\n\"There\u2019s something else we should be worried about. Newman Media recently hired Audra Charles. Now, Nate told Victoria that she was working with Tucker to leak information about the Chancellor-Winters IPO. So we need to be very wary of her allegiances. Despite what she\u2019s told us, I wouldn\u2019t put deception past her. We still don\u2019t know the status of her and Tucker\u2019s relationship. They could still be aligned.\" said by Nick\n\"We need to keep Audra at a distance until we know if we can trust her.\" said by Nikki\n\"Well, let\u2019s think about that for a moment. I think it might be to our advantage if she keeps working with Tucker McCall.\" said by Victor\n\"I think Dad\u2019s right. I think we need to stay on the offense, turn the tables, force him to be on his guard around us.\" said by Victoria\n\"Are you saying you think we should go after McCall Unlimited?\" said by Nikki\n\"I am. And we were looking for a way to expand by taking over Chancellor-Winters. That door has closed, so maybe another one is opening.\" said by Victoria\n\"I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right move at all. If Tucker\u2019s struggling, it could make him an even more dangerous adversary, and we all know what he\u2019s capable of. Tucker could be very close to crumbling on his own. If that\u2019s the case, then we just let him do it. And then Newman Enterprises swoops in, takes up all the pieces as his company falls apart. To blatantly go after him right now seems too risky.\" said by Nick\n\"Or it\u2019s a golden opportunity. His divisions fold nicely into our portfolio.\" said by Victor\n\"If we succeed in taking them over.\" said by Nick\n\"Son, have you ever known me to go into battle without believing I\u2019d win?\" said by Victor\n\"I\u2019m not dismissing the idea, Dad. I just think we need to carefully weigh the pros and cons before we make the move. Vick, we really got to go. We\u2019re late for that meeting with VPs.\" said by Nick\n\"But I would like to revisit this sooner rather than later. It\u2019s a good opportunity. I wouldn\u2019t want to see it slip away.\" said by Victoria\n\"I was surprised to hear from you. Last time we spoke, you wanted nothing to do with me.\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah. I let my temper get the best of me. I apologize. It\u2019s a part of myself that I really don\u2019t like and I\u2019m trying to evolve past. [ Sighs ] But, um\u2026I miss \u2014 I miss our conversations and \u2014 and your take on things. And I\u2019m in a bit of a crossroads now, and I could use some of that.\" said by Tucker\n\"So, you called me here to entertain you.\" said by Audra\n\"No. No.\" said by Tucker\n\"Then you want some kind of information out of me?\" said by Audra\n\"[ Chuckles ] When did you get so cynical?\" said by Tucker\n\"The day I met you. You know, I\u2019ve known you way too long to fall for this \u201cLet\u2019s have an innocent chat\u201d line, okay? Just get to the point.\" said by Audra\n\"Uh [Clears throat] I was actually wondering if you knew anything about Newman Media\u2019s pursuit of Daniel Romalotti\u2019s new gaming platform.\" said by Tucker\n\"Ah! There it is. You want me to use my connections and resources to collude with you again? I\u2019d think you would have more important things to do, like, um, fly to Paris and beg Ashley for forgiveness or mending the rift with your son. Wait. Now I\u2019m starting to think that everything you told me about coming to Genoa City to repair your relationships with them was absolute B.S.\" said by Audra\n\"No. No. My desire to make things right with them was and still is sincere.\" said by Tucker\n\"Ah.\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah, but dwelling and sulking are not in my nature, so I need to keep moving forward. And this \u2014 this gaming project seems intriguing to me.\" said by Tucker\n\"Keep your hands off that. If anyone is gonna snatch it away from Chancellor-Winters, it\u2019s gonna be Newman Media.\" said by Audra\n\"[ Laughs ] I got to say, the idea of competing with you on it makes it even more interesting. I miss you, Audra. I miss our partnership. And we were good friends, right?\" said by Tucker\n\"We were. But you blew it.\" said by Audra\n\"I know I did. I\u2019m sorry.\" said by Tucker\n\"Hey.\" said by Audra\n\"Can we hit reset?\" said by Tucker\n\"[ Chuckles ] Thanks for, uh \u2014 for joining me.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Felt like I needed to get some fresh air, you know, clear my head a little.\" said by Billy\n\"Mm. I did, too. I was getting a little antsy in the apartment. And it\u2019s nice to finally want to go out and want to go somewhere.\" said by Chelsea\n\"It\u2019s a crisp, beautiful day.\" said by Billy\n\"It is. So, why do you have to clear your head? Is something on your mind?\" said by Chelsea\n\"No, nothing in particular, really. I guess I\u2019m just, you know, thinking about you and your desire to find your purpose. That\u2019s not an easy thing to do.\" said by Billy\n\"Mm.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Trust me. I\u2019ve failed at it repeatedly.\" said by Billy\n\"Hey, don\u2019t talk about my friend like that.\" said by Chelsea\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Billy\n\"I don\u2019t know. I think the key to finding peace isn\u2019t just [Sighs] figuring out what your purpose is. It\u2019s figuring out what your purpose isn\u2019t. And you are doing that work. You\u2019re narrowing it down. You\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re giving yourself space to explore, you know? I believe that you shouldn\u2019t just choose between things that people offer you. You need to trust yourself and pave your own path.\" said by Chelsea\n\"That\u2019s a very generous perspective of my life.\" said by Billy\n\"[ Laughs ]\" said by Chelsea\n\"Lily has been one of the truest and most genuine people that I\u2019ve known for as long as I can remember. If anyone can be trusted, it\u2019s her.\" said by Daniel\n\"Listen, I really like Lily. I do. And I understand that you have loyalty toward her. I totally get where that comes from. But it just seems to me that her company is imploding. I really think you should get out while you can.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Huh. Well, this is just a little bit ironic, don\u2019t you think? I mean, it seems like you\u2019re sitting here telling me that I should cut all ties before they drag me down. You literally just let an old grudge ruin your career and your relationship with Summer.\" said by Daniel\n\"Okay. Okay. Daniel, everything that I said and I predicted about that situation proved that I was correct.\" said by Phyllis\n\"That\u2019s great. That\u2019s fantastic. What did being right get you? [ Sighs ]\" said by Daniel\n\"You know, I\u2019ve had a lot of time to think. I don\u2019t have a job. Living alone at the Grand Phoenix, you know, plenty of time to ponder my loneliness, my likes, my dislikes, my joys, despair. I\u2019ve had a lot of sobering moments. But, you know, it\u2019s like I said last time we were hanging out. When I see you, it\u2019s, uh \u2014 you know, it\u2019s like a highlight of my day. I guess I\u2019m realizing in all of this that we\u2019ve \u2014 we\u2019ve lived parallel lives for quite some time.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, that\u2019s kind of a stretch.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, maybe my issues haven\u2019t been quite as intensive as yours, but, you know, there are similarities there, both emotionally and mentally. You know, this \u2014 this journey that we\u2019re on \u2014 I don\u2019t know. I guess that\u2019s maybe why we connect. I guess what I\u2019m saying is I\u2019m very grateful for this friendship.\" said by Billy\n\"Everything okay?\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah, absolutely. Ready to jump back in.\" said by Audra\n\"Whatever you had to do seemed to put a pep in your step.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, I, uh, had to put some issues from my past to bed. And, um, yeah\u2026I feel good.\" said by Audra\n\"I hope this brush with the past doesn\u2019t involve anything that might take you away from Newman and back to London.\" said by Nate\n\"I\u2019m not looking for a new gig. I like it here. But it\u2019s good to know that I\u2019m valued. And I\u2019m coming around the idea of going after Omege Sphere.\" said by Audra\n\"Really? Great.\" said by Nate\n\"So let\u2019s put our heads together and figure out a way.\" said by Audra\n\"Baby, you have been awfully quiet since we broached the subject of potentially acquiring Tucker McCall\u2019s company.\" said by Victor\n\"I\u2019m hoping that Michael will find something that will make a takeover less hostile and risky.\" said by Nikki\n\"I\u2019m still in favor of making a move on his company.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, I can certainly see the upside for us, although Newman Enterprises really isn\u2019t lacking in anything right now. And for Victoria, I know for her it\u2019s more the love of the game, which she inherited from you. What I don\u2019t understand is why you seem to be so invested in this.\" said by Nikki\n\"Baby, you just said that Victoria inherited her love of the game from me. Doesn\u2019t that explain everything?\" said by Victor\n\"Not this time.\" said by Nikki\n\"Hmm.\" said by ", "answer": "Victor"}

I\u2019m also worried for her.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah, um\u2026 look, I know that you\u2019re really overwhelmed and I really don\u2019t want to add to any of it. So, I wanted to let you know that we\u2019re gonna suspend work on omega sphere.\" said by Lily\n\"Hi.\" said by Sally\n\"Hey.\" said by Nick\n\"Come in.\" said by Sally\n\"Thanks.\" said by Nick\n\"How are you this morning? Sorry, that was a really dumb question.\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2019m okay, for now. Thanks for asking.\" said by Nick\n\"Are you worried about summer?\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah. On top of all the pain she\u2019s in grieving for her mom, she\u2019s gotta be exhausted. I mean, she\u2019s been going nonstop, working on the details of this thing with zero help from anyone.\" said by Nick\n\"Not even her brother?\" said by Sally\n\"That\u2019s what she wanted. To be in charge of everything, to be able to create this perfect celebration of life for phyllis. As, like, a gift to her. Could also be to make up for the fact that they had been clashing lately as well.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, makes sense.\" said by Sally\n\"Not really feeling this location, though. I mean, we weren\u2019t there when phyllis blacked out, but other people were. It had to be terrifying. And now everyone\u2019s back in the same room. I just\u2013 I\u2019m worried that this celebration of life is not gonna turn out the way summer is hoping.\" said by Nick\n\"Talk to me. Wait, what? Say that again. What do you mean she was a no-show? She was supposed to be on that damn flight last night. Dry skin is sensitive skin, too.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Kyle, I didn\u2019t mean to second guess your wife.\" said by Diane\n\"No, it bothers me, too. Having the service there with all those traumatic memories. But I couldn\u2019t talk summer out of it. We\u2019ve barely talked about anything lately. She\u2019s so caught up in planning this service, we\u2019ve barely spoken in days.\" said by Kyle\n\"Hey, summer is a perfectionist, even in the best of circumstances. Staying busy, distracting herself from the pain she\u2019s feeling might be soothing.\" said by Jack\n\"It\u2019s more than that, dad. It\u2019s like she\u2019s on a mission to prove something. To be together where we last saw phyllis.\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, either way, it leaves me with a dilemma.\" said by Diane\n\"How do you mean?\" said by Jack\n\"Well, I\u2019m trying to give summer space to grieve in her own way, but to her, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m a reminder of the events that led up to phyllis\u2019s collapse. I don\u2019t want to cause her any more pain, so maybe I should just stay home.\" said by Diane\n\"That\u2019s the one answer I was able to get out of her. She wants all of us there. In fact, she insisted. Look, do I think having the service in this venue will be upsetting? Yes. But it\u2019s the only support summer\u2019s asked for. She wants all three of us there. So, we need to be there for her.\" said by Kyle\n\"Why don\u2019t you, uh, grab a table and I\u2019ll order?\" said by Nick\n\"Okay, yeah. Sounds good. Summer, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m really sorry about your mom. I mean, what a terrible shock. I can\u2019t even imagine what you must be feeling. If you need anything at all, please don\u2019t hesitate to ask, and feel free to give me a job at the memorial. I would really like to be useful in some way.\" said by Sally\n\"To be honest, sally, it never occurred to me that you would come to the memorial, when you so clearly don\u2019t belong. You know we\u2019re mourning my mother. Do you really think that she would want you there? Especially now that you\u2019ve glommed onto my father. I hate that he is still with you when you\u2019re pregnant with adam\u2019s baby. That is who you should be with. Adam. Because the two of you deserve each other. So, please just stay far, far away.\" said by Summer\n\"Hey, the, uh, barista had a question about your order.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah.\" said by Sally\n\"What are you doing?\" said by Nick\n\"Everybody\u2019s been telling me to stop being so stoic, so I was just sharing how I felt. You don\u2019t seem to like that either.\" said by Summer\n\"Look, if you need someone to take something out on, I am right here. I mean that. Whatever I can do to help. Is there any part of the service I can take off your hands?\" said by Nick\n\"No, I just came from the venue and it\u2019s all ready to go. I had one more errand to run and I wanted to grab a coffee, but you know what? I\u2019m just gonna get one at the club, so I\u2019ll see you there.\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m sorry about that.\" said by Nick\n\"Look, she just lost her mom, I get it. I really wanna be there with you. Summer is the priority right now, okay? And she\u2019s right. Phyllis would not want me there. But I will be thinking of you and I will be sending you support. Summer needs you. Go.\" said by Sally\n\"You\u2019re suspending my platform, why? Do you not think that I can deliver? I\u2013\" said by Daniel\n\"No, daniel, that is\u2013 that\u2019s not it at all.\" said by Lily\n\"Well, then why even suggest it?\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, because your mother just died. You\u2019re overwhelmed and I don\u2019t want you to worry about work while you\u2019re mourning.\" said by Lily\n\"Work is exactly what I need to worry about. I need structure. I need something positive to focus on. Lily, please. My mom, she loved the whole idea of this concept, even if she went behind my back and she tried to find other backers without consulting me first. You know, if you think about it, it was probably the most phyllis thing that she could do.\" said by Daniel\n\"Okay, daniel, okay. Look, if\u2013 if you wanna keep at it\u2013\" said by Lily\n\"I need\u2013 I need to keep at it. This kind of trauma is exactly the sort of thing that chelsea and I think that the game could help people with. So, no, I don\u2019t want to delay it.\" said by Daniel\n\"[ Sighs ] Okay. Okay. I mean, yeah, if you want to keep working on it, that\u2019s fine. Just not today, okay?\" said by Lily\n\"[ Laughs ] Thank you.\" said by Daniel\n\"Phyllis. Are you here? Dammit. Hi.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Anything I can help with?\" said by Kyle\n\"No, I got everything under control.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, it must be weird for you being in this room again.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019m fine. You know, it feels right to me, even if no one else understands.\" said by Summer\n\"What\u2019s he doing here?\" said by Kyle\n\"Uh, I asked him to be here, in case stark or any unwanted press shows up. I figured a detective could handle them discreetly.\" said by Summer\n\"Hmm. Sounds reasonable.\" said by Kyle\n\"I need to go touch base with him. Excuse me. Any updates?\" said by Summer\n\"No, not yet. Got your message about the venue. It\u2019s why I\u2019m here at your request.\" said by Chance\n\"I appreciate that.\" said by Summer\n\"It looks like you\u2019re going for maximum impact to unnerve diane by choosing this place. That is if there\u2019s any validity to your theory.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, I\u2019m grateful that you agreed to come so you can see for yourself. Wouldn\u2019t expect you to take my word for it.\" said by Summer\n\"Thanks for that.\" said by Chance\n\"[ Sighs ] Once diane sees what my mom\u2019s loss means for all the people that loved her, there\u2019s no way that she\u2019ll be able to hide her guilt.\" said by Summer\n\"I thought phyllis\u2019s memorial was now? Are you not with nick?\" said by Adam\n\"I was supposed to be, but summer made it very clear that she does not want my condolences, which is fine. You know, she\u2019s under a lot of stress right now, and plus, she found out about the baby, which has made her resent me even more.\" said by Sally\n\"Oh. Does she know that it\u2019s mine?\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, yeah.\" said by Sally\n\"Hmm.\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah. She was hoping it would break up nick and me, but no such luck.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, if I can get used to it, I imagine she will, too.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, I really appreciate your optimism. In fact, um, if you would care to join me, I could use a little more positive assurance right about now.\" said by Sally\n\"Darling.\" said by Nikki\n\"Hi, mom.\" said by Nick\n\"Summer seems to be holding up well.\" said by Victor\n\"Yeah, she\u2019s being strong.\" said by Nick\n\"Mm.\" said by Victor\n\"Too strong, if you ask me. When she breaks, and I don\u2019t know how she won\u2019t, it\u2019s gonna be very bad.\" said by Nick\n\"Ah. My heart goes out to her and daniel.\" said by Nikki\n\"Did she arrange all of this on her own?\" said by Victor\n\"She wouldn\u2019t accept any help, I tried.\" said by Nikki\n\"She insisted on doing it herself as a gift to phyllis.\" said by Nick\n\"Well\u2026\" said by Victor\n\"I think she was, uh, trying to make up for the fact that they\u2019d been estranged lately.\" said by Nick\n\"Uh-huh.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, all we can do is to be there for her when the grief sets in.\" said by Nikki\n\"You know, your mom always raved about your talent, and I can see why. Your portrait really took my breath away.\" said by Lauren\n\"It\u2019s lovely, daniel.\" said by Michael\n\"That\u2019s, um, very kind of both of you to say. I just wish she was still alive to appreciate it.\" said by Daniel\n\"Hey, I think there\u2019s, uh, somebody you\u2019re gonna want to say hello to.\" said by Michael\n\"Oh.\" said by Lauren\n\"Oh, my god, lucy. Oh, my god.\" said by Daniel\n\"Hi, dad.\" said by Lucy\n\"How is it that you\u2019re here right now?\" said by Daniel\n\"We couldn\u2019t let you go through this alone.\" said by Danny\n\"Grandpa talked to mom and took care of everything.\" said by Lucy\n\"Come here.\" said by Daniel\n\"He has a lot of nerve showing up here.\" said by Kyle\n\"He has no shame, none.\" said by Diane\n\"I was afraid that he was gonna try to pull something like this. I don\u2019t care about his claims that he married my mom. I don\u2019t want him here.\" said by Summer\n\"I will handle this.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, no. Please don\u2019t let this blow up.\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m on it.\" said by Chance\n\"Okay. What the hell do you think you\u2019re doing here? What is it gonna take to get you to back off this vicious plan to frame diane? Name your price.\" said by Jack\n\"She\u2019s guilty, jack. She killed phyllis. And for that, she\u2019s going to prison. And that\u2019s the only payoff I\u2019m after.\" said by Jeremy\n\"All right, we\u2019re done. You\u2019re out of here. I\u2019m sick of you harassing my\u2013\" said by Kyle\n\"Gentlemen. Gentlemen! This is a memorial service.\" said by Chance\n\"Yeah, for my wife. And I deserve to be here.\" said by Jeremy\n\"That is still up for debate.\" said by Chance\n\"Listen, I don\u2019t know what you\u2013\" said by Jeremy\n\"Shut your mouth\u2013\" said by Chance\n\"I deserve to be here, just like everybody else.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Shut your mouth. Nobody wants a replay of the other night, okay? Now, you\u2019ve had your moment. Today is a private affair hosted by phyllis\u2019 children, and you were not welcomed.\" said by Chance\n\"You think I\u2019m here to cause trouble? I\u2019m here to mourn my wife, that\u2019s all. But I think you should turn your attention to the real perpetrator, diane, and stop bullying me.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Stark, I\u2019m going to escort you out of here, or I will arrest you. Pick one.\" said by Chance\n\"Arrest me for what?\" said by Jeremy\n\"I\u2019m sure I can find a parole violation if I look hard enough. Now, it only takes one. You wanna risk it?\" said by Chance\n\"First, some ground rules.\" said by Sally\n\"Oh. Should I, uh, take some notes?\" said by Adam\n\"I don\u2019t want to talk about nick and me. Or you and me. And anything too serious is off limits. I really need less stress in my life right now.\" said by Sally\n\"What about babies? Parenthood? I mean, I could let you in on some of my trade secrets.\" said by Adam\n\"Please do. \u2018Cause I could use some. When I think about all that I don\u2019t know, it scares the crap out of me.\" said by Sally\n\"[ Chuckles] Well, you and everyone else who is new to this. I mean look, even if you\u2019ve read every book there is on this, when the kid arrives, it still throws you. Plus, every kid is different. So, whatever you\u2019ve read or you\u2019ve heard or you have planned to do, I mean, within the first few months it\u2019s\u2013 gets thrown completely out the window.\" said by Adam\n\"So, learn to roll with the punches?\" said by Sally\n\"Mm. Exactly.\" said by Adam\n\"Mm. Well, that\u2019s actually my forte.\" said by Sally\n\"Look, everyone\u2019s a beginner. They just learn on the job. And eventually, the kid is gonna get older, and then you will become an expert on potty training, nighttime routines, discipline, homework, carpooling. You will not realize how boring your conversations have become, but how fascinating you still think they are.\" said by Adam\n\"Hey, hey, you look white as a sheet.\" said by Jack\n\"That horrible man, he has no business being here, spreading his lies.\" said by Diane\n\"Stark is behind whatever set this in motion, I\u2019m sure of it. And for him to point the finger at you, I want him out of here and far away from us.\" said by Kyle\n\"Let\u2019s focus on summer right now, get her through these next few hours, okay? We\u2019ll deal with stark later.\" said by Jack\n\"It\u2019s not the time or the place for jeremy stark to make an appearance.\" said by Michael\n\"I doubt he\u2019s ever been accused of having manners or of being a decent human being.\" said by Lauren\n\"Um, excuse me a second, okay?\" said by Danny\n\"Yeah. Hey, lily. Uh\u2013\" said by Lauren\n\"Hi.\" said by Lily\n\"Hi. Do you mind, uh\u2013 just keep an eye on daniel, okay? For\u2013 for lucy\u2019s sake.\" said by Danny\n\"Yeah, of\u2013 of course.\" said by Lily\n\"Thank you.\" said by Danny\n\"Yeah.\" said by Lily\n\"If I could have everybody\u2019s attention, please. If you all could make your way to your seats, we\u2019re about ready to begin.\" said by Summer\n\"The young and the restless will continue. (Vo) is she tired? Sad? Bored?\" said by Announcer\n\"The pep talk I gave you on how to deal with victor and victoria, have you given any thought to my advice?\" said by Sally\n\"Um, uh\u2026\" said by Adam\n\"Okay, I get it. I take it your family is off limits, too.\" said by Sally\n\"If you would like to keep things light.\" said by Adam\n\"Fine. I just\u2013 I wanna help.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, that\u2019s very sweet of you, it is. But I don\u2019t know how you would, unless you had a couple 100 million lying around that you wanted to invest, if I decided to make a play for mccall unlimited on my own.\" said by Adam\n\"Wait, that\u2019s the company that they want to acquire?\" said by Sally\n\"Wanted to acquire, past tense. Victoria packed up her marbles, she went home.\" said by Adam\n\"[ Clears throat ] Okay. What I have to offer isn\u2019t money, but maybe it\u2019s better. It\u2019s a distraction. Something that\u2019ll give you some perspective on what\u2019s really important, other than business and proving yourself to your family.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, I doubt that there is one perspective that is strong enough to break me of that habit.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay, well, try this on for size. I have a doctor\u2019s appointment coming up. One that checks for any anomalies and the baby\u2019s gender. Would you want to be there?\" said by Sally\n\"I want to thank you all for coming this morning to honor the memory of my mom, phyllis summers. As you can see, I kept the guest list small and intimate, and that\u2019s because I wanted to be surrounded by the people who knew my mom the best. And who loved her and cared for her the most, and who are also grieving her sudden and sh\u2013 shocking death. I know that this, uh, choice of venue came as a surprise to many of you. But I felt like it was important to restore some peace to this elegant club. One that was so lovingly dedicated to the memory of neil winters, a great man with a beautiful soul who did so much for our community. I wanted this place to be remembered as where we honored my mom and\u2013 and celebrated her life. A place that we could all come again and again. So\u2026\" said by Summer\n\"I would love to come to your appointment. And I\u2019m glad that you trust me to support you in this way.\" said by Adam\n\"It won\u2019t just be the two of us. Nick\u2013 nick will be there, too.\" said by Sally\n\"Of course. Does he know that you\u2019re inviting me?\" said by Adam\n\"I haven\u2019t brought it up with him yet, but, I mean\u2026\" said by Sally\n\"A little boy, a little girl. Which one will it be?\" said by Adam\n\"Mm.\" said by Sally\n\"Wow, we\u2019re soon gonna have our answer.\" said by Adam\n\"Once everybody has a glass, let\u2019s all raise them in a toast.\" said by Summer\n\"Here, here.\" said by Man\n\"[ Sighs ] Now, I really do want this to be a celebration of my mom\u2019s life. So, if anybody feels moved to speak, I\u2013 I hope that you will stand up and say something, starting with my brother. Daniel?\" said by Summer\n\"Um\u2026 I didn\u2019t, uh\u2013 I\u2013 I\u2013 I didn\u2019t prepare anything, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2013\" said by Daniel\n\"It\u2019s okay, dad, just speak from my heart. You got this.\" said by Lucy\n\"I can\u2019t\u2013 I can\u2019t, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2026\" said by Daniel\n\"Phyllis and I were, uh, extremely competitive with each other, in everything. What started out as a cool friendship, deepened into something so much more. It was a love story. One that lasted a very long time. And it produced this amazing, beautiful woman standing next to me.\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2019m gonna say something. I think most of you here know that, uh, my history with phyllis is a\u2013 a long story of extremes. Love and heartache, happiness and despair, marriage and divorce. We tried more than once to make it all work, but I don\u2019t know, we seemed destined to hurt each other. Nick is right. She was one of a kind. A force of nature, strong and stubborn and willful and exasperating and fiercely loyal and\u2026 [ Chuckles ] And absolutely certain she was right. And god help you if you ever got in her way. I know this because I managed to get in her way for decades.\" said by ", "answer": "Jack"}
{"content": "\"Hey.\" said by Audra\n\"Hello. Um, I was looking for nate. I have some follow-up notes about something we discussed earlier. Do you happen to know where he went?\" said by Victoria\n\"Uh, he ran out not too long ago. He was, uh, running late for some couple\u2019s time he and elena had planned. You know, nate is such a sweet guy, right? He\u2019s always working hard to balance his career with romance.\" said by Audra\n\"Hey. Sorry I am late. My meeting with victoria ran long, but it was worth it. Totally exhilarating. I\u2019m talking, even when we\u2019re on opposite sides of an issue, somehow we still inspire each other. The synergy between us is unreal.\" said by Nate\n\"\u201cUnreal.\u201d That\u2019s how you describe your relationship with your boss?\" said by Elena\n\"Of course. We have much more than an employer/employee relationship.\" said by Nate\n\"How much more? Look, nate, I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re enjoying your work, but tell me, what\u2019s going on with you and victoria?\" said by Elena\n\"There you are. I was worried when you didn\u2019t come back to the office. Look at you. Even with the weight of the world on your shoulders, you still somehow manage to look as lovely as ever.\" said by Kyle\n\"Must be all the jabot products.\" said by Summer\n\"That smile didn\u2019t exactly reach your eyes. Are you worried about my parents fleeing town? Or jeremy stark? Or maybe it\u2019s your dad\u2019s strange relationship with sally? Or are you concerned about the safety and well-being of our son?\" said by Kyle\n\"How about all of the above?\" said by Summer\n\"I know there\u2019s a lot going on right now, but we\u2019ll work through it.\" said by Kyle\n\"How? How are we going to work through this, kyle? I mean, I\u2026 I\u2019m trying to stay positive, but there\u2019s so much going on, and I haven\u2019t even told you about the run-in that I had with my mom earlier today.\" said by Summer\n\"What happened with phyllis?\" said by Kyle\n\"I just have a bad feeling.\" said by Summer\n\"About what?\" said by Kyle\n\"I thought that she was letting go of her obsession with diane, she was going to focus on rebuilding her relationships with me and daniel. But now that that doesn\u2019t seem to be working out for her,\" said by Summer\n\"Mm-hmm, her focus is back on my mother.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah.\" said by Summer\n\"That must be a very good page.\" said by Jack\n\"What\u2019s that?\" said by Diane\n\"You\u2019ve been on that same page for 20 minutes.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Sighs ] I\u2019m sorry, jack. I\u2019m just\u2026 I\u2019m having a hard time focusing. I have this terrible feeling in the pit of my stomach that something\u2019s wrong. I mean, we\u2019re here, relaxing in the cabin, safe and sound, but back home, there\u2019s a storm coming.\" said by Diane\n\"[ Scoffs ] Amazing. Diane and jack went to all that trouble to convince us they went on some extravagant world tour, but they never left wisconsin?\" said by Jeremy\n\"They\u2019re in a little rustic cabin in the woods just up the highway.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Did they really think they could get away with this? Oh, that\u2019s so brazen. Well, if nothing else, they\u2019re quite clever.\" said by Jeremy\n\"They think they\u2019re clever.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yeah, they also think they\u2019re untouchable. It\u2019s time to prove them wrong. Sometimes, the lows of bipolar depression\" said by Jeremy\n\"Alright, we can\u2019t rush into this. We got to make sure all our angles are covered. There\u2019s no room for failure. You know that, right?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Okay, I\u2019ve thought through every detail. It\u2019s a point of pride for me.\" said by Jeremy\n\"I understand that, but I have a lot more to lose than you do.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Well, it sounds like you\u2019ve been thinking about this, so I\u2019m sure you have some suggestions.\" said by Jeremy\n\"I do. But I need you to know something. When I\u2019m in, I\u2019m in 100%. There\u2019s nobody in this town that is more resourceful than I am in getting what they want. Do you get that?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Oh, that\u2019s good to hear. So what do we do first?\" said by Jeremy\n\"Your plan is good. I think it\u2019s very solid. But this is the thing. This is the abbott cabin that they\u2019re staying at. They know everything about it. They know the whole lay of the land up there.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Okay, so you\u2019re saying we need to even the playing field?\" said by Jeremy\n\"I\u2019m saying we need to lure them back here.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Well, if you want them back, there are plenty of things I can do to get them back here.\" said by Jeremy\n\"I know that, but i want to be very clear on this. Very, very clear. My family can\u2019t get hurt. My daughter, kyle, harrison, they can\u2019t be used as pawns.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Okay, so how are we going to get them to come back to town?\" said by Jeremy\n\"We make them think that the dangerous element has disappeared. We basically do the same thing to them that they did to you, but we do it better. We do it much better.\" said by Phyllis\n\"What\u2019s going on between me and victoria? What are you talking about? Where is this coming from?\" said by Nate\n\"I ran into audra at crimson lights, and what started off as casual conversation turned into something rather enlightening.\" said by Elena\n\"Okay, enlighten me. What did she have to say?\" said by Nate\n\"Audra noticed an interesting dynamic developing between you and victoria, something that crosses the boundaries of a normal employee/employer relationship. You know, more personal than professional?\" said by Elena\n\"No, I don\u2019t know.\" said by Nate\n\"I haven\u2019t accused you of anything, nate, but I need you to be straight with me.\" said by Elena\n\"Always. Look, trust me, the only thing that\u2019s going on between me and victoria is business. She\u2019s my boss, and I admire her, the way her mind works, her business acumen. Look, I am learning a lot from her, and I won\u2019t deny that we work well together, okay? She encourages me to grow and expand. Nothing, and I mean nothing like the way I was stifled and dismissed at chancellor-winters. I don\u2019t understand why we have to go through this again. I thought you understood my relationship with victoria, and, honestly, I thought you appreciated it.\" said by Nate\n\"You know, I have to agree with you. Elena is very fortunate to have a man like nate in her life, but I feel like I\u2019m very lucky to have him as an employee. And you\u2019re lucky, too, aren\u2019t you?\" said by Victoria\n\"I am, yes.\" said by Audra\n\"You know, your instincts were correct about tucker. I paid a visit to devon, and he all but confirmed tucker offering mccall to him.\" said by Victoria\n\"I know the man quite well.\" said by Audra\n\"That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m counting on. I need you to let me know what you think his next move might be.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, if my instincts are on point, when tucker doesn\u2019t get his way, he either fights harder, gets angry, or moves on to something else. It all just depends on his mood at the time.\" said by Audra\n\"So it\u2019s possible that he could get fed up with devon if his offer isn\u2019t getting the kind of traction that he\u2019s looking for.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah, his attention span lasts as long as his desire for something and his certainty he can get it. So he could very well get tired of waiting for devon.\" said by Audra\n\"Alright. So then we push him in that direction. We find something to distract him, something with a big payoff. We draw his focus away from devon, so maybe he\u2019ll forget about that plan, and then newman will be right there to make the deal.\" said by Victoria\n\"Talk to me. What brought this on?\" said by Jack\n\"Thank you. I \u2014 I don\u2019t want to ruin our time here together.\" said by Diane\n\"You\u2019re not ruining anything. I could see something was on your mind. I wanted to give you the space to work through it on your own.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, I appreciate that. Jack, it\u2019s been lovely here with you, it\u2019s been peaceful, it\u2019s been really romantic, but something happened today.\" said by Diane\n\"What?\" said by Jack\n\"Well, while you were out, a strange call came in on the landline, and it has me rattled.\" said by Diane\n\"Who was it? What did they say?\" said by Jack\n\"Well, that\u2019s just it. By the time I answered it, no one was there. I can\u2019t stop thinking it was jeremy.\" said by Diane\n\"There\u2019s no way stark would know we are here.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, but what if he found us and he\u2019s heard my voice and he\u2019s on his way here? Or \u2014 or worse yet, what if he\u2019s using our family as some sort of leverage?\" said by Diane\n\"Okay, you are letting your fear and imagination run wild. Wrong numbers, bad connections, hang-ups \u2014 that happens all the time.\" said by Jack\n\"I realize that. But there\u2019s a possibility that jeremy got some information and pieced it together. The first thing he\u2019d do is to call to see if I\u2019d answer.\" said by Diane\n\"That\u2019s a pretty long shot, diane.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, maybe, maybe not. But if he knows we\u2019re here, then he knows that we\u2019re not home to protect our family. Jack, we have left our family just sitting in the cross hairs.\" said by Diane\n\"Did phyllis say something specific about going after my mom?\" said by Kyle\n\"Nothing specific, no, but she seemed really interested in diane and jack.\" said by Summer\n\"How so?\" said by Kyle\n\"[ Sighs ] Well, it started with her saying that she bought a present for harrison.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay. Nothing wrong with that. Unless she\u2019s trying to find her way in through an innocent child.\" said by Kyle\n\"Exactly. So she said she wanted to bring the gift by the house, but that jack and diane wouldn\u2019t want to see her there. And then she asked all of these questions like, \u201care they home? Where are they? How long are they going to be gone for?\u201d All these questions that had nothing to do with harrison and were none of her business.\" said by Summer\n\"Could that just be phyllis being nosy. That would be in character, wouldn\u2019t it?\" said by Kyle\n\"I guess.\" said by Summer\n\"Isn\u2019t it possible that she\u2019s just digging because she always likes to be in the loop?\" said by Kyle\n\"It\u2019s possible, but, kyle, we need to be vigilant. We\u2019re in a dangerous situation with stark, and my mom is acting suspicious. I don\u2019t know. Just something doesn\u2019t sit right with me.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, good. There you are.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Mom, it\u2019s really not a good time.\" said by Summer\n\"It\u2019s very, very important.\" said by Phyllis\n\"We\u2019re not going to tell you where jack and diane are, so please just stop trying.\" said by Summer\n\"Listen, listen, i know you don\u2019t want to talk to me. You don\u2019t want to be seen with me. I get it. I get it. But I wouldn\u2019t be trying to track you down if it wasn\u2019t completely necessary.\" said by Phyllis\n\"What\u2019s completely necessary that you need to talk to us about?\" said by Summer\n\"It\u2019s about jeremy stark. He\u2019s on his way right now to paris to find jack and diane, and this time \u2014 this time, he thinks he will absolutely find them.\" said by Phyllis\n\"What?\" said by Summer\n\"But how is it you know this? (Vo) red lobster\u2019s finer points of fun dining:\" said by Kyle\n\"Listen, um, I don\u2019t blame you for asking me that. I don\u2019t blame you at all. I\u2019m going to be 100% honest with you two. Okay? Really. Ever since jeremy stark got into town, he has been hounding me. I mean, almost obsessed with me, asking me to team up with him to exact revenge on diane.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Are you serious?\" said by Summer\n\"Yes. Yes. 100% serious. I flat out told him no, but it\u2019s the truth.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Why are we just finding out about this now?\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d believe me if I told you that. See? I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d believe me, or you\u2019d think that I was painting myself out to be a saint. I mean, it was lose/lose for me.\" said by Phyllis\n\"What about now? What\u2019s changed?\" said by Summer\n\"Well, this is a very, very real threat. Guys, jeremy stark isn\u2019t just talking about revenge on diane. He\u2019s not just talking about hurting them. He\u2019s actually flying to europe to find them. He is dangerous. If you don\u2019t know that for yourself, at least know it for jack and diane.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Excuse me. I need to go make a phone call. Damn it. I forgot my phone again.\" said by Kyle\n\"Looking for this?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Right. Thanks.\" said by Kyle\n\"I don\u2019t want to fight with you about this. I probably shouldn\u2019t have even agreed to meet with you for drinks tonight. I\u2019m sorry.\" said by Elena\n\"No, no. No need for apologies.\" said by Nate\n\"It\u2019s just, after we fought so hard to get back to a good place, the last thing I want to do is create tension between us again. We cannot go back to that horrible dark space we were in.\" said by Elena\n\"I promise you, we are not going back there.\" said by Nate\n\"I don\u2019t know. Maybe I\u2019m just looking for trouble where it doesn\u2019t exist.\" said by Elena\n\"I understand. Trust me.\" said by Nate\n\"[ Chuckles ] It\u2019s not like you and victoria are having an affair.\" said by Elena\n\"Exactly. Look, you have nothing to worry about when it comes to my professional relationships. I\u2019m all yours. I love you. And only you. And, look, if you ever feel too tired to go out again after work, all you have to do is just say so, okay? We can just go home, spend time together, just us.\" said by Nate\n\"That is exactly where I want to be, cuddled up in bed with you.\" said by Elena\n\"Come here.\" said by Nate\n\"Thank you. Okay, good night.\" said by Victoria\n\"You know, I really admire you. Your laser-like focus on achieving your goals is inspiring. You decide you want mccall unlimited, and nothing will stand in your way. And, you know, despite how much you obviously value your own family, you don\u2019t hesitate to get in the middle of other families. You know, like when you worked with nate to acquire chancellor-winters.\" said by Audra\n\"That was strictly a business proposition.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah, but you understand that people are responsible for their own choices. You focus on newman\u2019s bottom line and not on nate ruining his relationship with his cousins. And now you\u2019re not at all afraid of getting between a father and son.\" said by Audra\n\"You know, unlike the people that you just named, the newman family has always been united. Even when we\u2019re fighting and struggling to see eye-to-eye, our allegiances are very clearly defined and unquestionable.\" said by Victoria\n\"I suppose few families can claim that.\" said by Audra\n\"And if one family member can be swayed in a particular direction, they\u2019re the weak link, and the person doing the swaying, they\u2019re not the issue, right? Because everybody has to be pulling together in the same direction, working for the same goal on the same page, or else everything falls apart.\" said by Victoria\n\"So, just to be clear, we\u2019re talking about swaying tucker away from devon, right?\" said by Audra\n\"Diane, your family is fine. The security team is on full-time duty and maximum alert.\" said by Jack\n\"You say that, but is it enough?\" said by Diane\n\"Your family is safe. Okay, try to remember why we came here in the first place, to give ourselves some time to think clearly, not to avoid physical threat. We needed to remove ourselves from jeremy\u2019s psychological warfare. But it seems that being this far away from our family has created its own problems.\" said by Jack\n\"Yes, because I don\u2019t feel any safer, jack, or any less agitated.\" said by Diane\n\"I know that. I understand. We played right into jeremy stark\u2019s hands. We inflicted this on ourselves.\" said by Jack\n\"Maybe we should just go home. That way, we can lay eyes on the people that matter most to us instead of relying on some security agency.\" said by Diane\n\"You know if I felt for one moment anyone was not safe, I would be home in a flash.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, please.\" said by Diane\n\"But if it gives you peace of mind \u2014\" said by Jack\n\"Of course we\u2019re talking about devon and tucker. My plan is to get them each on separate paths. What exactly did you think I meant?\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, I wasn\u2019t sure.\" said by Audra\n\"We\u2019re discussing a specific business strategy, audra. So if you\u2019re reading something into this, then \u2014\" said by Victoria\n\"I-I don\u2019t know what i would read into. What you said was perfectly clear. If two people in any kind of relationship get split apart by a third person, it\u2019s not the third person\u2019s fault. It just wasn\u2019t meant to be.\" said by Audra\n\"That\u2019s exactly what I meant. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do to devon and tucker.\" said by Victoria\n\"I\u2019ll let nate know you stopped by.\" said by Audra\n\"I did not see that coming. Thanks, kyle. Yeah, I love you, too, son. Talk soon.\" said by Jack\n\"Is everything okay? Has \u2014 has jeremy made threats? Is harrison safe?\" said by Diane\n\"No, everything\u2019s fine. Kyle just called with some interesting information. Apparently, stark left town for europe in hot pursuit of us.\" said by Jack\n\"What? Why? I \u2014 I don\u2019t believe that.\" said by Diane\n\"Uh-huh, I didn\u2019t believe it, either, except kyle called his friend at the airport and verified stark did indeed charter a flight to paris. It left earlier today.\" said by Jack\n\"So he\u2019s gone?\" said by Diane\n\"Well, let\u2019s not throw caution to the wind. I mean, why would he think we were in paris? This could all be a trick, very much like the one we pulled on him earlier.\" said by Jack\n\"Exactly. And it\u2019s just like jeremy to pull something like that.\" said by Diane\n\"Listen, you were \u2014 you were talking about how you wanted to come out of hiding and go home. Maybe it\u2019s time we do that \u2014 cautiously.\" said by Jack\n\"Thank you. Oh. What do we do about this? Do we tell people about our engagement?\" said by Diane\n\"Absolutely.\" said by Jack\n\"Really? Who? Who do we tell?\" said by Diane\n\"The whole world, my love. The whole world.\" said by Jack\n\"Okay.\" said by Diane\n\"I really hope what you\u2019re saying about stark is true.\" said by Summer\n\"It is. I have no reason to lie. I mean, despite what you might think, I don\u2019t want to see diane and jack hurt, okay? I have my priorities straight.\" said by ", "answer": "Phyllis"}
{"content": "\"I\u2019m not crazy, dani\" said by Summer\n\"Mom\u2019s alive? You actually talked to her? For real?\" said by Daniel\n\"I\u2019m not crazy, daniel. I saw her. She told me all about the plan that she had with stark and how it all went wrong and he attacked her and he had to defend herself, so she ended up stabbing him with the scissors.\" said by Summer\n\"What scissors? What are you talking about?\" said by Daniel\n\"It\u2019s true. You can ask chance. Or no, don\u2019t ask chance. But the police must know about it. And how would I know, if I hadn\u2019t talked to our very alive mother?\" said by Summer\n\"So you\u2019re saying stark is dead because\u2026\" said by Daniel\n\"Mom killed him.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, my god.\" said by Daniel\n\"Look, I know. I know that you thought that I was crazy. You thought I was spinning out of control and I\u2013 I sounded crazy. I mean, I saw mom. For anybody else, that would be impossible. But for our mom, faking her own death to get revenge on diane? You could see it, can\u2019t you?\" said by Summer\n\"This wasn\u2019t just a what if scenario you were painting?\" said by Daniel\n\"No. She explained everything to me.\" said by Summer\n\"Here. I mean, she was actually here?\" said by Daniel\n\"She was. And you and me, we\u2013 we\u2019ve got to figure out a way to deal with it, but daniel, the good part in all of this, I mean, the joy, the relief\u2026 our mom is alive.\" said by Summer\n\"Where is she now?\" said by Daniel\n\"Good afternoon!\" said by Michael\n\"Well, you seem like you\u2019re in a good mood.\" said by Diane\n\"For good reason.\" said by Michael\n\"Well, I don\u2019t know why. The one person who could clear my name turned up dead.\" said by Diane\n\"And you heard that from jack?\" said by Michael\n\"Oh, yes. He keeps coming to visit. I keep asking him to stop. It\u2019s kind of our thing now.\" said by Diane\n\"Aw. Jack\u2019s doing everything he can to help you, diane.\" said by Michael\n\"I know. I know. And to be honest, I\u2019m kind of glad he\u2019s ignoring my wishes. His and kyle\u2019s caring concern is the only thing getting me through this nightmare. Although the stress is weighing on both of them.\" said by Diane\n\"Hm. Well, maybe I can relieve their burden a bit.\" said by Michael\n\"How?\" said by Diane\n\"I have some good news. By the end of the day, I hope to have you out of here.\" said by Michael\n\"That\u2019s right. I\u2019m going to have to liquidate some capital. I need a cashier\u2019s check today. I know it\u2019s a lot of money, frank. Good. Let me know when it\u2019s ready. Thanks.\" said by Jack\n\"Hey, what\u2019s that about?\" said by Ashley\n\"I am in no mood to discuss that with you. Frankly, I am not interested in sharing any of the details of my personal conversations with you.\" said by Jack\n\"If you want privacy, jack, go someplace else. This is a common room. You never know who\u2019s gonna hear what around here.\" said by Ashley\n\"Boy, and who do we have to thank for that? This latest stunt of yours is reprehensible. That you would choose this time for your dirty little trick. Throwing tucker in all of our faces. This is a new low, even for you.\" said by Jack\n\"Hey.\" said by Tucker\n\"Hey.\" said by Devon\n\"The man I was looking for. Can I buy you a cup of coffee?\" said by Tucker\n\"Buy me a cup of coffee? What\u2019s your agenda for wanting to do that?\" said by Devon\n\"No, no, it\u2019s just that the last time our paths crossed, things were kind of tense between us.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah, a little bit.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. Some things were said, I said some things. After you rejected my suggestion that you buy mccall and\u2026 well, let\u2019s just say it didn\u2019t end well, so I was hoping to buy a cup of coffee and maybe we could, uh, work through something.\" said by Tucker\n\"I\u2019m in the middle of my work day here.\" said by Devon\n\"Yes. No, I understand. Uh, my whole day\u2019s free, so if it\u2019s okay, I can just wait for you.\" said by Tucker\n\"No, no, no, no. I don\u2019t want you to wait around for me. I honestly\u2013 I don\u2019t feel like taking a break from work and getting coffee.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh. Okay. Well, then I\u2019ll just tell you what I was gonna tell you.\" said by Tucker\n\"Sure.\" said by Devon\n\"First, uh, I sold mccall to victor newman.\" said by Tucker\n\"That\u2019s great news. Everything worked out for the best. Does that mean you\u2019re gonna leave town now or?\" said by Devon\n\"No. No. On the contrary, I\u2019m staying.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh?\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. And you and dominic are the reasons why.\" said by Tucker\n\"It\u2019s a good thing that our dinner meeting got moved to breakfast tomorrow morning.\" said by Victoria\n\"It gives us more time to double check the numbers and refine the pitch.\" said by Nate\n\"By the way, this column demonstrating growth, is really what sells the whole concept. You really outdid yourself with this presentation, I have to say. You continue to impress. On every front.\" said by Victoria\n\"Uh, I have to admit, I\u2019m pleased with the analysis. I feel positive about the meeting. We do make a good team. But, uh, there\u2019s something I need to say.\" said by Nate\n\"Additional sponsorship provided by\u2026 -you got this buddy.\" said by Announcer\n\"Okay. I\u2019m listening.\" said by Victoria\n\"I want to confirm that we\u2019re putting aside the personal, for now, and focusing strictly on the business side. At least until I can figure out where my head is at.\" said by Nate\n\"Yes. Yeah, I think that\u2019s a good plan.\" said by Victoria\n\"Really?\" said by Nate\n\"I\u2019M\u2026 I\u2019m on board. We\u2019ll focus strictly on work for now. I can only imagine how conflicted you must be. And I just want you to take time before you figure out what comes next.\" said by Victoria\n\"So, this is what traveling on a business trip alone looks like.\" said by Elena\n\"I don\u2019t really know how I fit into your plans since you\u2019ve sold your company.\" said by Devon\n\"Admittedly, uh, my first impulse was to hop on a plane and leave town and never look back, but I just\u2026 I can\u2019t walk away without trying to repair our relationship. And I feel like, even if we can\u2019t share the bond of running mccall together, maybe we can\u2026 create some new one.\" said by Tucker\n\"You thought you\u2019d start with coffee?\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. Oh, I also have a proposal for you.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, do you?\" said by Devon\n\"I do.\" said by Tucker\n\"Here we go.\" said by Devon\n\"So, I understand that the anniversary of neil\u2019s death just passed and that abby\u2019s helping you and lily host an event in his honor tonight?\" said by Tucker\n\"That\u2019s right. Yeah.\" said by Devon\n\"Well\u2026 I owe neil so much for the love and support that he gave you. Because he raised you better than I ever could. So, what I would like to do is announce tonight, at the event, the coming of the neil winters international jazz festival, which I would produce. Can you think of a better tribute to him?\" said by Tucker\n\"You\u2019re getting me out of here? How? A jail break?\" said by Diane\n\"No, nothing so dramatic. I\u2019m just gonna see to it that you are granted release on bail.\" said by Michael\n\"How is that even possible?\" said by Diane\n\"I appealed the no bail order. I thought the judge had a pattern of unjust arraignment decisions and so did the court of appeals. We were just granted a second arraignment, today, and I\u2019m sure this judge, the new judge, judge betts, is gonna be far more understandable.\" said by Michael\n\"Judge betts? As in, all bets are off?\" said by Diane\n\"Ha ha. Ah. I brought you something to wear. Carefully curated from your closet by jack.\" said by Michael\n\"Jack knows about this?\" said by Diane\n\"Who do you think ordered me to find a way to get you out of here? Jack and kyle have been pressing me to do everything I can to help you. Not that I needed to be pressed, by the way.\" said by Michael\n\"I can\u2019t believe this.\" said by Diane\n\"Given your history, your bail, it\u2019s not gonna come cheap. But jack is out there arranging financing as we speak.\" said by Michael\n\"So, you\u2019re saying that I might be able to walk out of here today?\" said by Diane\n\"This is happening. Okay? Now, go get dressed. Guard! Oh, and try not to look like a flight risk.\" said by Michael\n\"I don\u2019t know where mom is. I\u2013 I don\u2019t know how to find her. Maybe\u2026 maybe she\u2019s still close, keeping an eye on us.\" said by Summer\n\"Do you think she\u2019d risk sticking around?\" said by Daniel\n\"It\u2019s not like anybody is looking for her. But you\u2019re right. She could be long gone by now.\" said by Summer\n\"I can\u2019t believe that she\u2019s just been letting us suffer like this. She\u2019s been here the whole time just watching us and you\u2019re okay with this?\" said by Daniel\n\"No! I\u2019m not okay with it. I\u2013 I feel every single thing that you\u2019re feeling right now. I don\u2019t know how to make sense of any of it, but I am just\u2013\" said by Summer\n\"That\u2019s good. That\u2019s good. See, you might be able just to gloss over this, but I think I\u2019m gonna need a minute with it.\" said by Daniel\n\"Daniel. She realized that it was a terrible and vicious idea, but\u2026 stark was the one that pushed her into it. He manipulated her emotions. He\u2013 he played up this idea that everyone had turned their backs on her. He\u2013 he forced her into going along with his plan for revenge against diane\u2026\" said by Summer\n\"He forced her? He forced her! He forced her, summer? She didn\u2019t have to go along with it.\" said by Daniel\n\"Look. She felt like everyone had abandoned her. She was hurt and she was frustrated and in a moment of weakness, she gave in. And then it all went wrong.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah, I would say that it definitely went wrong, summer. Are you kidding me?\" said by Daniel\n\"She regretted it. She regretted it immediately and she wanted to come back to us, but when stark got wind of that, he wouldn\u2019t have any of it and he attacked her and that\u2019s when she had to defend herself and\u2026 she killed him and now she\u2019s on the run.\" said by Summer\n\"You gotta be kidding me. This is a nightmare.\" said by Daniel\n\"Mom feels trapped. She feels like there\u2019s no way out of this.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, there might not be.\" said by Daniel\n\"Daniel. We need to face the fact that our mom is far from innocent. I mean, she wanted revenge on diane in a big way. Diane stole the life that she wanted to have with jack and\u2013 and she was fighting with us and\u2026\" said by Summer\n\"With us? Are you blaming us for what she did, now?\" said by Daniel\n\"We both said that we felt terrible about the way that we treated her, that shouldn\u2019t change now.\" said by Summer\n\"She can\u2019t just live her life on the run, summer. She\u2019s got no id, she\u2019s got no money. How would she survive?\" said by Daniel\n\"I\u2019m sure that stark took care of all of that. She probably has everything she needs to start a new life.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, good. Good. And you\u2019re okay with this? You\u2019re okay with her just disappearing, just like that. No consequences. You\u2019re fine with this? When you have chronic kidney disease.\" said by Daniel\n\"I am not happy about what mom did. She asked me to keep this secret, but I couldn\u2019t keep it from you. We were both suffering so much and that\u2019s why I tested the waters with that little \u201cwhat if\u201d scenario just to see how you might react.\" said by Summer\n\"But then I pointed out that there were no easy solutions to your little \u201cwhat if\u201d scenario.\" said by Daniel\n\"If mom is found alive, then everything that she did to diane is gonna come out and she could go to prison for that.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, if they can\u2019t prove that it was self-defense when she killed stark, then\u2026\" said by Daniel\n\"She could be locked up for the rest of her life. And we will lose her all over again. Daniel, we can\u2019t let that happen.\" said by Summer\n\"Here\u2019s the thing, jack. You didn\u2019t care at all how any of us felt when you moved diane in here. So get over yourself. You\u2019ll just have to learn to tolerate tucker the same way you demanded I learn to tolerate diane.\" said by Ashley\n\"I cannot believe you have fallen for that scoundrel again.\" said by Jack\n\"Scoundrel. What a great word. For your information, I\u2019m in complete control of my actions and my feelings, unlike you. And honestly, having tucker here, how does it really affect you?\" said by Ashley\n\"How does it\u2013\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah.\" said by Ashley\n\"He\u2019s under my roof!\" said by Jack\n\"I forgot this is your house and we\u2019re all just visiting. I wonder how our father would feel about that.\" said by Ashley\n\"Tensions are high enough without you adding to them.\" said by Jack\n\"Why do we have tension in this house? Could it be because of your fiance? Who\u2019s charged with murdering summer\u2019s mother? I don\u2019t know.\" said by Ashley\n\"Falsely charged. And diane has triple reason for being here. She is my fiance, she\u2019s kyle\u2019s mother, she\u2019s harrison\u2019s grandmother. She is family, ash, whether you like it or not. Whereas tucker is a veritable stranger. To summer and kyle and harrison. And by the way, how are you going to present tucker to harrison? What\u2013 what\u2013 what\u2019s he supposed to call him?\" said by Jack\n\"Aunt ashley\u2019s friend?\" said by Ashley\n\"And what\u2019s gonna happen when diane and tucker are under the same roof? Have you thought about that?\" said by Jack\n\"I have. But you know, diane\u2019s in jail. We don\u2019t know when or if she\u2019s even going to get out.\" said by Ashley\n\"Think again. If michael is correct and I suspect he is, diane could be home as soon as today.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, man. Picture it. We kick it off here in genoa city at the neil winters jazz lounge, with the top jazz acts in the world and then we launch a tour of the hottest venues in the world. Go from there.\" said by Tucker\n\"Okay. Well, it\u2019s a whole lot to consider within hours, you know. I\u2019m not gonna make a decision about something that big before the party. And the whole point of this evening was just to have close friends and family get together and share memories and listen to music. It\u2019s not meant to be about anything else. No announcements for festivals. And even if it were, it wouldn\u2019t be your announcement to make.\" said by Devon\n\"Elena, um, this is a surprise. Are you hungry? We haven\u2019t ordered yet. We\u2019re just running a little bit behind\u2013\" said by Victoria\n\"Victoria, shut up. I don\u2019t want to hear any more lies or excuses. This is between nate and me. Unless you\u2019re relying on victoria to fight your battles for you. Along with whatever else you\u2019re relying on her for.\" said by Elena\n\"Excuse us, victoria. Would you mind if I spoke to elena alone?\" said by Nate\n\"Of course, of course. I\u2019ll give you some space.\" said by Victoria\n\"What are you doing here? Did you just decide to\u2013\" said by Nate\n\"No. You do not get to question me as if I did something wrong. And please do not let the next words that come out of your mouth be something that makes me disrespect you even more than I disrespect you now. I want you to look me in the eyes and tell me the truth. What is going on between you two?\" said by Elena\n\"Victoria and I slept together.\" said by Nate\n\"I believed in you, I trusted you, I supported you and this is how you repay me?\" said by Elena\n\"Elena, listen.\" said by Nate\n\"No, you listen, nate. You\u2019re pathetic. Sneaking around, acting like you\u2019re on a business trip.\" said by Elena\n\"This is business. I didn\u2019t come here with the intention of sleeping with victoria\u2013\" said by Nate\n\"But you did sleep with victoria. And you did lie. You told me that you were coming here alone.\" said by Elena\n\"I didn\u2019t know how to\u2013\" said by Nate\n\"Do not insult my intelligence, nate. Don\u2019t act like this all just happened out of the blue. I have been suspecting this since the beginning. And when I confronted you about it, you lied to me.\" said by Elena\n\"You\u2019ve got this all wrong.\" said by Nate\n\"Do I really? You told me I was being paranoid. Do you really think so little of me? Honestly, maybe you should. Because up until the moment that I walked into this restaurant, I\u2019ve been a complete fool. I actually held on to hope\u2026 that there was some type of misunderstanding. That I was just mistaken somehow, but no, my instincts were right all along.\" said by Elena\n\"Elena, please. I never meant to hurt\u2013\" said by Nate\n\"No, it doesn\u2019t matter what you meant to do, nate. It matters what you actually did. And I cannot believe you\u2019re still trying to gaslight me into believing that I\u2019m wrong and that I\u2019m blowing this out of proportion.\" said by Elena\n\"That is not what I am saying.\" said by Nate\n\"You know, you spent a lot of time trying to rekindle our relationship. Impromptu dates. Afternoon lovemaking. Dream vacations. For the two of us. So tell me, was all of that just to overcompensate for your guilt? Come on, nate! Be honest. I want to know how long this has been going on because I finally want to know how much of a liar and a cheater you are.\" said by Elena\n\"I hear what you\u2019re saying. Back off, right? I was maybe a little over eager. Forgive me.\" said by Tucker\n\"No, you don\u2019t\u2013 you don\u2019t need to apologize. It was a fine idea. It\u2019s just bad timing.\" said by Devon\n\"Right. Well, it\u2019s just one idea. I\u2019ve got lots of time to come up with others. Starting to put down roots here actually.\" said by Tucker\n\"Really?\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah.\" said by Tucker\n\"How so?\" said by Devon\n\"Well, ashley\u2019s finally starting to forgive me. In fact, she\u2019s asked me to move in with her.\" said by Tucker\n\"I see. So, that\u2019s why you were arranging a cashier\u2019s check. Bail money. You\u2019re crazy if you think she\u2019s gonna be out any time soon. She\u2019s a flight risk and there\u2019s no court on the planet that\u2019s gonna let her loose.\" said by Ashley\n\"Michael feels he has just cause to have her bail reconsidered.\" said by Jack\n\"He really thinks he can pull this off?\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, he\u2019s the best at what he does and his client is innocent. So, yes, I think justice will prevail and diane will be brought home where she belongs.\" said by Jack\n\"This isn\u2019t her home and she doesn\u2019t belong here. Period.\" said by Ashley\n\"I know that this is hard to process. I mean, I think about it all night instead of sleeping and it still never makes any sense.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah, mom, she could have come to the both of us. Why\u2019d she put this all on you?\" said by Daniel\n\"Even if we knew her reasons, do you think that they\u2019d make any more sense than the rest of this? Daniel, I\u2019m begging you, don\u2019t say anything about this to anyone.\" said by Summer\n\"I tried to get information out of chance. Thought maybe he could give me something that would help me to see a way to get mom out of this.\" said by Summer\n\"And?\" said by Daniel\n\"Seemed like he was getting suspicious, so I backed off. We\u2019ve got to do everything that we can to protect her until we figure this out.\" said by Summer\n\"And what if we can\u2019t?\" said by Daniel\n\"Maybe it\u2019S\u2026 best that we just let her disappear. Start a new life without us.\" said by Summer\n\"And you\u2019re okay with that, hm?\" said by Daniel\n\"It would kill me. I would hate it. But if it meant that she was free instead of spending the rest of her life in prison, then yeah. I would do anything to keep her safe. Wouldn\u2019t you?\" said by Summer\n\"What about diane, summer? Hm? You willing to let her take the fall for a murder that doesn\u2019t exist? You willing to just sit back, watch her get tried, watch her get convicted. You can live with that? Do you struggle with occasional nerve aches\" said by Daniel\n\"The young and the restless will continue. (Buzz) morning!\" said by Announcer\n\"I had no intention of this happening. You know how much I care about you. Nothing I did was false or out of guilt. I love you. I wanted to be the man that you loved. I honestly tried to fight this.\" said by Nate\n\"But what? You just couldn\u2019t, could you? You were just too mesmerized by the charms of victoria newman to stop yourself?\" said by Elena\n\"It is not like that.\" said by Nate\n\"You know, when your and devon\u2019s relationship blew up, after you tried to sabotage your family, they all accused you of changing. They said that you were ruthless and selfish and I defended you. I tried to encourage you to take the higher path and to fix things with your family because deep down, I thought the man that I was in love with still existed.\" said by Elena\n\"I am still that man.\" said by Nate\n\"You can\u2019t possibly believe that. Look at yourself, nate. You have changed. And not for the good. Unless\u2026 this is who you\u2019ve always been. Selfish and ambitious. Either way, you can go straight to hell. Or you can go back upstairs to your hotel room with your boss. It\u2019s over.\" said by ", "answer": "Elena"}
{"content": "\"No, no. My mom is not dead. There\u2019s been a mistake \u2019cause it\u2019s not what they\u2019re saying.\" said by Summer\n\"The gcpd and fire are on scene. I\u2019ve gotten a full report. Phyllis is gone. The emt from the ambulance is here, and he gave an account of what happened. He said that the driver swerved to avoid a deer and lost control. There was an explosion in the fire. He was thrown from the vehicle, and the only survivor. I have confirmed all this with the officers on scene as well.\" said by Chance\n\"So she\u2019s really gone.\" said by Daniel\n\"Oh, come here. I\u2019m so sorry, my son. I\u2019m so sorry.\" said by Danny\n\"You ok?\" said by Chance\n\"It\u2019s a lot.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, well, I \u2014 I\u2019m sure this must be a reminder. I\u2019m sorry. I \u2014 I know it\u2019s not easy.\" said by Chance\n\"The night ray died? Yeah, it is a little bit familiar, but, um, don\u2019t worry about me. I can handle it. Right now, I\u2019m just worried about phyllis\u2019s family.\" said by Sharon\n\"Despite all the differences between me and phyllis over the years, I was praying that she would survive.\" said by Diane\n\"It\u2019s all just awful.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, stop pretending that you give a damn that phyllis is dead. This is exactly what you wanted to happen.\" said by Jeremy\n\"I mean, just think of it \u2014 no grind, no meetings, no quarterlies to worry about. If you were to sell mccall unlimited to newman, you would have the freedom to do whatever you want. You could go wherever you want for the rest of your life.\" said by Victoria\n\"Isn\u2019t freedom just a state of mind?\" said by Tucker\n\"There must be something that you want that the lack of time or money has prevented you from being able to do. Maybe you could take up race cars again.\" said by Victoria\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh. Yachts.\" said by Victoria\n\"[ Chuckles ] Yachts? No, I\u2019m a landlubber.\" said by Tucker\n\"Did you know that ashley is into estate jewelry? Emeralds, if I\u2019m correct. You could woo her with a couple of rare pieces.\" said by Victoria\n\"I admire your drive. You are relentless in the best way.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yes, you\u2019re right. I am relentless. I am. But I\u2019m also impatient. Look, this has been a lot of fun, but I think we should just put our cards on the table. What is it that you really want? What can I offer you that you won\u2019t turn down?\" said by Victoria\n\"I thought you said you were tired.\" said by Abby\n\"Well, you inspired me to stay up.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, really?\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah. Would you like a nightcap?\" said by Devon\n\"Sure.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah?\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah.\" said by Abby\n\"What are you thinking about, pretty lady?\" said by Devon\n\"I am just asking myself if I could call this place home.\" said by Abby\n\"If you knew anything about phyllis, you would know that everyone in this room is devastated by her death, with a probable exception of you.\" said by Jack\n\"You don\u2019t know how I feel.\" said by Jeremy\n\"How about showing some compassion for the people who do care about her and leaving?\" said by Jack\n\"I am \u2014 was her husband, and I have more right to be here than you or your fiance. And I\u2019m not leaving here until I find out more information about what happened to my wife.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Babe, let\u2019s get out of here. We can peek in on harrison, give him a kiss goodnight.\" said by Kyle\n\"I think that\u2019s a great idea. If you need anything, I mean anything, I\u2019m just a phone call away. I love you, supergirl.\" said by Nick\n\"I love you, too, dad.\" said by Summer\n\"[ Sighs ] Ok. I\u2019m gonna take her home.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll see you back there, summer. We want to do anything we can to help.\" said by Jack\n\"Summer, I am \u2014 I am so sorry. You\u2019ll be alright? Ok. My moderate to severe plaque psoriasis\u2026\" said by Diane\n\"Mm. I suppose I must have my price, like everyone else. And you are one of the few people in the world who could pay it.\" said by Tucker\n\"That\u2019s a start.\" said by Victoria\n\"But I got to ask you why. What about mccall unlimited is so attractive to you?\" said by Tucker\n\"Isn\u2019t it obvious?\" said by Victoria\n\"Not to me it isn\u2019T. The company\u2019s invaluable to me for emotional reasons, but objectively, it\u2019s a failing company weighed down by debt. It doesn\u2019t seem like a wise investment decision, so I just don\u2019t see what\u2019s so appealing about it for you. Unless this whole endeavor has nothing to do with my company and everything to do with you.\" said by Tucker\n\"I was pretty surprised when you asked me to move in. Thank you.\" said by Abby\n\"Well, I know that it would be a big step, and I know there\u2019d be probably a lot of people with a lot of opinions about it.\" said by Devon\n\"Like chance. I know that he\u2019s still really hurt by what happened between us. And us moving in together and raising dominic like a family, I\u2019m sure that would be really hard for him. And I do still feel guilty about how it all happened.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah. So do I. But at the same time, I mean, I know we\u2019ve both done as much as we can to apologize to the people that we hurt, so maybe it\u2019s ok that we don\u2019t beat ourselves up about this anymore.\" said by Devon\n\"I wish it were that easy. But one thing chance was right about is that my feelings for you have always been more complicated than friendship.\" said by Abby\n\"So all of the new information only confirms the old information?\" said by Jeremy\n\"Yes, I have nothing more for you at the moment. I have been in touch with each team on scene. The details have been verified. There was only one survivor. Those are the facts. I\u2019m sorry.\" said by Chance\n\"And I should just accept that? Huh? Coming from you, the person who wrongfully arrested me on some trumped-up burglary charges?\" said by Jeremy\n\"That order came down from chicago, and I had \u2014\" said by Chance\n\"Yeah, yeah, which a smart man like you knew it was garbage. But you, you arrested me anyway, like a good little soldier. You know, you have virtually no credibility with me, detective. And, oh, yeah, I\u2019m suspicious as hell about your investigation. These types protect their own, and you\u2019re one of them.\" said by Jeremy\n\"We\u2019re doing everything we can.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, you damn well better be! No, I think we should concentrate on what happened before the accident. My wife was assaulted, her life threatened, and she passed out in a room full of witnesses. But I guess we just forgot about all that, right?\" said by Jeremy\n\"What do you want from me, stark?\" said by Chance\n\"I want you and the gcpd to find me some answers. I\u2019m gonna get some air.\" said by Jeremy\n\"None of this adds up.\" said by Daniel\n\"Daniel, listen to me. I know it feels that way.\" said by Chance\n\"Don\u2019t tell me this is the grief talking. Something is not right here, chance, I can feel it in my gut. Ubrelvy helps u fight migraine attacks.\" said by Daniel\n\"How you doing?\" said by Chance\n\"I understand, it\u2019s been a long night. I just got a couple more questions for you.\" said by Chance\n\"You mentioned that you drew phyllis\u2019s blood. Where\u2019d you store it?\" said by Chance\n\"Could that container have survived the fire?\" said by Chance\n\"I saw summer and kyle leave.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, she\u2019s wrecked. She wanted to go home.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, home is probably the best place for her.\" said by Sharon\n\"Surprised you hung around.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to leave either. Nick, what if I\u2019m responsible for what happened to phyllis?\" said by Sharon\n\"Why would you say that?\" said by Nick\n\"Because after she collapsed, lauren said that it could be a side effect from the coma phyllis was in years ago.\" said by Sharon\n\"No, sharon. No. You can\u2019t think like that. There\u2019s no reason to believe she would develop complications from that accident. It was so long ago.\" said by Nick\n\"Something caused phyllis to collapse tonight.\" said by Sharon\n\"Or someone.\" said by Nick\n\"Diane?\" said by Sharon\n\"Her feud with phyllis picked right back up when she came back to genoa city.\" said by Nick\n\"You think there\u2019s some connection between that and what happened to phyllis?\" said by Sharon\n\"It\u2019s just a feeling. Did you know that stark stole a necklace from my parents\u2019 safe in chicago? He was arrested.\" said by Nick\n\"He is such a terrible person. I have a hard time believing that phyllis married him.\" said by Sharon\n\"There\u2019s a lot about this that doesn\u2019t make sense. But I\u2019m telling you right now, if it turns out phyllis\u2019s death wasn\u2019t an accident, I\u2019m looking right at stark.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, whether you\u2019re really, truly curious about that or you just feel like you maybe want me to stroke your ego, I would be very happy to enlighten you.\" said by Victoria\n\"[ Laughs ] Please.\" said by Tucker\n\"Mccall is in debt, but it\u2019s not devoid of value. Some of its divisions are successful. The entertainment division is alone a potential gold mine.\" said by Victoria\n\"Ok, but if it\u2019s strictly profit you\u2019re seeking, there are much better options out there.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, that\u2019s your opinion. I am\u2026 I\u2019m confident that this venture could be hugely successful.\" said by Victoria\n\"Ok.\" said by Tucker\n\"What?\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, I just \u2014 I\u2019m trying to figure out what your definition of success is in this particular instance.\" said by Tucker\n\"I really don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re implying.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, victor wants the companies who can hand it off to the prodigal son, which doesn\u2019t quite seem like a win for you. I mean, you put all the time and energy into making the deal, and he hands it off to the kid brother who you despise. Adam gets this high profile, high power position, courtesy of you and your hard work, and you get nothing. Why would you be on board with a plan like that?\" said by Tucker\n\"That\u2019s not my plan. I have my own ideas of how to fold mccall into newman. Adam\u2019s services will not be needed.\" said by Victoria\n\"Ah, fascinating.\" said by Tucker\n\"But?\" said by Victoria\n\"If it were just a battle between you and adam, my money\u2019s on you every time. But, victor, he\u2019s still the\u2026 alpha wolf of the newman clan. So how do you plan on defeating your father?\" said by Tucker\n\"Hey.\" said by Diane\n\"Hey.\" said by Jack\n\"Maybe you should have gone home with kyle and summer. It\u2019s good to be with family at a time like this.\" said by Diane\n\"Yeah, much as I might like to, I \u2014 I don\u2019t want to go anywhere until I know everything that happened to phyllis. I can\u2019t believe this has happened. She\u2019s gone.\" said by Jack\n\"I know you loved her very much in the past, and that\u2019s a lot of history that nothing can erase.\" said by Diane\n\"Thank you for saying that. You know what? My grief can wait. I\u2019m concerned about you. Stark has made a very strong argument to chance that you and phyllis were an ongoing war, that you threatened her life in front of witnesses, that she had your engagement ring in her hand when she collapsed.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, but those things can be explained. I was angry when I made that threat, I \u2014 jack, I didn\u2019t mean it. And \u2014 and the ring? I mean, jeremy pickpocketed you and gave it to phyllis. I don\u2019t know why, but that\u2019s clearly what happened.\" said by Diane\n\"It\u2019s his word against yours.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Diane\n\"And the only person that knows the truth\u2026 is phyllis.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack.\" said by Diane\n\"Look, whatever he\u2019s playing at, I\u2019m sorry to say, his end game is punishing you. That\u2019s why I have to stay here. I want to know every move that stark makes. I want to know every piece of information that chance gathers. If you want to be with summer and kyle, I understand that. You go ahead.\" said by Jack\n\"No, I \u2014 I don\u2019t think summer wants to see me right now. Just how \u2014 how horribly sad is it that phyllis\u2019s last conscious moments were spent attacking us, and summer witnessed it? The \u2014 the memory of tonight is going to haunt that poor girl for the rest of her life.\" said by Diane\n\"Jack?\" said by Ashley\n\"[Crying] My mom is dead.\" said by Summer\n\"I wasn\u2019t expecting the \u201cl\u201d word. [ Chuckles ]\" said by Abby\n\"You weren\u2019t? What are you talking about? You already know that I love you. How could I not love you after everything that we are to each other? Everything that you\u2019ve brought into my life. I have a son because of you, and that\u2019s made my world bigger than I ever could have imagined for myself.\" said by Devon\n\"And I see dom as a gift that you gave me.\" said by Abby\n\"He\u2019s a gift to both of us. And he brought us together. But that\u2019s not the only reason that I love you.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh. I know what it is. It\u2019s because I told the servers at society to give you an extra helping of those sweet potatoes that you likes so much. That\u2019s it, right?\" said by Abby\n\"That\u2019s up there, yeah. No. [ Laughs ] No. I love you because you always want what\u2019s best for me, no matter what. And you\u2019ve helped me every step of the way. When I went to war with lily and you reminded me always that family comes first. And then tonight, you surprised me with that incredible tribute to neil, and that just opened everything up for me and put things into perspective and made me finally hear what you\u2019ve been saying to me all along.\" said by Devon\n\"I\u2019m just happy that you and lily were able to move past the ugliness.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah. Because of you.\" said by Devon\n\"You would have found your way.\" said by Abby\n\"But we did find our way because of you. You can take the credit. You\u2019ve always, always been there for me, and you always listen to me. You never judge. You\u2019ve been doing that for long before dominic got here. Do you remember when I said to you that I would move heaven and earth for you and our son? Well, I meant that, and I want to prove it to you every single day, here in our home, the three of us.\" said by Devon\n\"Hey, jack.\" said by Danny\n\"Hey.\" said by Jack\n\"Any idea what chance is working on? I mean, daniel insists on sticking around, but, you know \u2014\" said by Danny\n\"I am afraid we\u2019re in the dark as much as you are.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, I understand why he has all these questions about what\u2019s happening. I\u2019m having a tough time accepting that phyllis is really gone.\" said by Danny\n\"Yeah, so am I. There were times when I loved her so completely, and times where, like recently, I wanted her to be 100 miles away. But in the end, for better or for worse, she\u2019s been a major factor in my life for decades now.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. For the longest time, I\u2026 I thought phyllis was the biggest mistake I\u2019d ever made. I kept daniel away from her when he was a kid because I thought she was too toxic. And\u2026 well, over the holidays, we, the three of us, had this amazing conversation, and I, uh \u2014 I don\u2019t know, we \u2014 we got it all out there, you know, made amends and\u2026 for a second, I\u2026 I thought maybe we\u2019d be friends.\" said by Danny\n\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be lost on phyllis \u2014 the three of us standing around talking about her.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, you\u2019re probably right.\" said by Jack\n\"Please. Please. How dare you cry crocodile tears for a woman who you all disrespected, discarded.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Get lost.\" said by Jack\n\"Phyllis told me everything. The rock \u2018n\u2019 roll guy who broke her heart for some do-gooder lawyer. The newman heir who could never manage to stay with one woman for too long. And of course, jack, who dumped phyllis and took up with a woman who betrayed you in the worst possible way. My wife is dead. We planned a future, a future that\u2019s never going to happen. So I am not going anywhere till I make sure we get justice.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Then how about letting the gcpd do their work?\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, yeah, the same gcpd that looked the other way when you and diane tried to frame me for theft?\" said by Jeremy\n\"This is not about you and your grievances and your demands. Shut up or get out of here.\" said by Jack\n\"Make no mistake, jack \u2014 no matter how the cops handle this investigation, I will not let you or diane get away with what you\u2019ve done. Martial arts is my passion.\" said by Jeremy\n\"You know, I\u2019ve had a lifetime of practice of dealing with my father. However, I am the ceo of newman enterprises, so I have the power to shape the company the way that I see fit.\" said by Victoria\n\"But wouldn\u2019t acquiring mccall and not allowing adam to run it just create a bunch of conflict for you?\" said by Tucker\n\"Sometimes the risk is worth the reward.\" said by Victoria\n\"Sometimes it isn\u2019T. And you don\u2019t strike me as a good loser.\" said by Tucker\n\"Maybe you\u2019re right. Maybe it doesn\u2019t make any sense trying to acquire mccall.\" said by Victoria\n\"There you go, sweetheart.\" said by Kyle\n\"This should warm you up. Honey. I\u2019m so sorry about your mom. I hope you know that I and \u2014 and everybody in our family will do whatever we can to support you. This is unbelievable. I mean, phyllis had more life in her than anybody I know.\" said by Ashley\n\"[ Sighs ] You don\u2019t have to pretend like my mom was your favorite person. It\u2019s fine.\" said by Summer\n\"I know. I mean, we were not best friends. Uh, we managed to\u2026 I mean, we did \u2014 we had some common ground the last few months. The one thing I know about your mom is that she was so fearless. I mean, when she wanted something, she just went for it. She didn\u2019t care what other people thought. I mean, except for her kids, of course. You know, everything she did, even though it might have looked like it was crazy to the outside world, she did to protect the people that she loved, and summer, you\u2019re at the top of that list. She\u2019s been fighting for you, I mean, ever since the day you were born in that elevator. And then when you fell into a coma, she willed you back to us. You meant everything to her.\" said by ", "answer": "Ashley"}

So congratulations, you\u2019re now the proud owner of mccall unlimited.\" said by Tucker\n\"Excellent. I have pre-approved the wire transfer, and I will put the money into your account as soon as we end this conversation. Anything else?\" said by Victor\n\"Uh, no. No, that should be it.\" said by Tucker\n\"Good. Well, tucker, on a personal level, you\u2019re probably relieved no longer having to deal with the vicissitudes of running a huge company. So you\u2019re free of any responsibility. No ties to anyone. Congratulations.\" said by Victor\n\"So I thought that maybe things would be better now with diane gone, but no such luck. Even though she\u2019s in jail, her presence is everywhere. Because jack is going on and on about how she\u2019s innocent. He\u2019s convinced. And he\u2019s gonna do anything he can to save her, of course. But I couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. I told him that this desire he has to marry diane is just gonna wreak havoc with our family and the company. And guess what his solution was. Again, he\u2019s telling me I should move out. I can\u2019t believe him.\" said by Ashley\n\"Uh\u2026 mom, maybe uncle jack\u2019s right? Maybe you should move out.\" said by Abby\n\"God, this is amazing.

In black and white. Its\u2013 its perfect little everything. And to hear the heartbeat again. Did you hear it?\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, I did. Nice and strong.\" said by Nick\n\"Man, I\u2026 I thought I was in love with this little one before, but it\u2019s\u2013\" said by Sally\n\"It\u2019s incredible.\" said by Adam\n\"So where are things at with jeremy stark? Any luck tracking down my key witness?\" said by Christine\n\"Uh, nothing so far. This guy knows how to disappear. But this has fired me up even more to find him.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, I think michael might be searching for him too, since he and jack are certain that he\u2019s the killer. I\u2026 wonder if he\u2019s had better luck.\" said by Christine\n\"Glad you could make it.\" said by Jack\n\"I have to say, I was very surprised to hear from you. I thought you\u2019d be too busy trying to clear your fiancee of murder charges. You\u2019ve certainly kept michael very busy.\" said by Lauren\n\"Go ahead, say it. You hate me for convincing michael to take diane\u2019s case. Hey! It\u2019s your dry skin.\" said by Jack\n\"Additional sponsorship provided by\u2026\" said by Announcer\n\"I could never hate you, jack.

So you know what? I think we should just handle things the way that we\u2019re handling things at home.\" said by Lauren\n\"How is that?\" said by Jack\n\"To not talk about it. We\u2019re not saying a word because anything leads to an argument. And I could\u2013 I\u2013 I could really use a friend right now. And I think you could too.\" said by Lauren\n\"Yeah.\" said by Jack\n\"You seem very, very stressed.\" said by Lauren\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s been a tough time. Especially at home. Summer is understandably devastated. Kyle is shaken by the whole thing. The two of them aren\u2019t talking. Ashley and I shouldn\u2019t be in the same room together. Allie moved in with noah to get away from all the tension, and, well, tracy was the smart one and took off for new york. Anyway, I\u2019m glad I have a purpose, a real goal, A\u2026 direction to occupy my days.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. I mean, michael is so occupied\u2013 broke my own rule there.\" said by Lauren\n\"How are you doing in all this? You just lost your best friend.\" said by Jack\n\"I miss phyllis\u2026 every day.\" said by Lauren\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s a big loss for a lot of us.\" said by Jack\n\"And I just don\u2019t see a resolution that\u2019s gonna give anyone any peace.\" said by Lauren\n\"Are you taking jack\u2019s side?\" said by Ashley\n\"I\u2019m not taking a side.

Well, since you\u2019re clearly gonna be stubborn about this, I\u2019m gonna go to the kitchen and check on a couple things. But when I come back, if you\u2019d like to look at some video of dominic at the zoo yesterday, it\u2019s so cute. He is all about the giraffes.\" said by Abby\n\"I would love to see that. That\u2019ll cheer me up.\" said by Ashley\n\"Okay.\" said by Abby\n\"Doesn\u2019t it look like she\u2019s sucking her thumb?\" said by Adam\n\"[ Laughs ] Totally.\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2019m glad the appointment was moved from yesterday to today. Built up the anticipation.\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2019m sorry, what?\" said by Sally\n\"I was saying, it really worked out that the sonogram was moved from yesterday to today.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, yeah. Not really exactly ready to face that fact.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, why don\u2019t you just let us enjoy this perfect moment before unleashing the threat of the newmans?\" said by Adam\n\"I\u2019m just saying. It\u2019s gonna be loved.\" said by Nick\n\"Agreed. Yeah, our\u2026 little girl is going to have a whole lot of love. Some might say more than her fair share.

I mean, you were already here for the big reveal at the doctor\u2019s office. If you need to go, go.\" said by Sally\n\"I probably should get it out of the way.\" said by Nick\n\"Okay, yeah. Don\u2019t worry about me.\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2019ll call you afterwards.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah. You walking out too?\" said by Sally\n\"No, you can go ahead.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, okay. I\u2019ll call you later.\" said by Nick\n\"Bye.\" said by Sally\n\"You don\u2019t think that there\u2019s miracles, and then you see something like this little girl. Our baby girl.\" said by Adam\n\"Here you go, dad.\" said by Abby\n\"Thank you, sweetheart. There we go. Now, wait a minute. Your mother ran out of here in a hurry. What was that all about?\" said by Victor\n\"[ Sighs ] Uncle jack and mom have turned their home into a war zone over diane, so I was trying to convince her to move out for a while.\" said by Abby\n\"I don\u2019t think your mother can be convinced to move out of her own home.\" said by Victor\n\"You know her so well.\" said by Abby\n\"I don\u2019t blame her being frustrated with people who are defending diane jenkins. My goodness. There you are, son.\" said by Victor\n\"Hey, dad. Hey, abby.\" said by Nick\n\"Hi. Can I get you a coffee or anything?\" said by Abby\n\"Uh, no, thanks. I\u2019m not gonna be here that long.\" said by Nick\n\"Okay. Don\u2019t break anything.\" said by Abby\n\"We won\u2019T.\" said by Victor\n\"What\u2019s up? I was in the middle of something important.\" said by Nick\n\"I just purchased mccall. The deal is finalized.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, there you go. You got what you wanted. That has nothing to do with me, though.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, it does, son, because adam will run it. And the company is in somewhat bad shape. Will take quite some effort to straighten it up.\" said by Victor\n\"Oh, I\u2019m sure. Why are you telling me this?\" said by Nick\n\"I want you to join adam at mccall. Hi, I\u2019m lauren, I lost 67 pounds on golo. Happy mother\u2019s day! Oh my gosh! My mom deserves the best, and the best gifts are from harry and david. Chocolate. Yummy! Cheese. Gouda. Wine. What\u2019s that? It\u2019s from harry and david. Aww. Thank you!\" said by Victor\n\"You cannot be serious. Why on earth would I join adam at mccall? I have a job, dad. A great job, at newman, in the family business. I have zero interest in some consolation prize that you bought for adam just so you can keep him out of trouble.\" said by Nick\n\"I understand your point of view, son. But hear me out. Victoria, your sister, has your mother to back her up. Adam is about to embark upon a very difficult job trying to straighten out that company. I want you to help him.\" said by Victor\n\"Ah, you\u2019ve outdone yourself this time. It\u2019s impressive. But that is never gonna happen.\" said by Nick\n\"You told me the other day that you and adam and sally actually get along for the sake of the child. Why can\u2019t you do the same thing for the sake of family unity?\" said by Victor\n\"Here we are back to me and sally, and this time you even brought up the kid. It\u2019s an all-time low. I don\u2019t have time for this.\" said by Nick\n\"Son, please sit down. I\u2019m not finished yet.\" said by Victor\n\"You know, I have to say, you have been pretty amazing navigating this whole thing.\" said by Sally\n\"Uh, I\u2019ll take that. It definitely hasn\u2019t been easy.\" said by Adam\n\"I know, right?\" said by Sally\n\"But I don\u2019t wanna say anything to upset you or\u2013 or nick. I just\u2026 I wanna stay in my lane.\" said by Adam\n\"The daddy lane.\" said by Sally\n\"[ Chuckles ] That kinda has a nice ring to it, doesn\u2019t it?\" said by Adam\n\"It does, yeah. So, question number one, asked and answered. Question number two\u2026 how do you feel about having a little girl?\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2013 I love it. I definitely love it, but\u2026 I\u2019m baffled.\" said by Adam\n\"Baffled how?\" said by Sally\n\"Oh, I have no idea about little girls.\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah, but you have nieces.\" said by Sally\n\"It\u2019s not the same. Uncles get all the fun stuff. Dad\u2026 I mean, how am I gonna be able to say no to our perfect little daughter when she\u2019s looking up at me with those big blue eyes?\" said by Adam\n\"They could be brown.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, no matter what color they are, I am not gonna be able to say no. I wanna be wrapped so tight around her little finger.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, you have absolutely nothing to worry about. At least you\u2019ve been a parent. I mean, I know nothing about kids, and my parents sucked.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah.\" said by Adam\n\"And so is christian.\" said by Sally\n\"Oh, that\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s thanks to nick and\u2013 and chelsea.\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah. I mean, they\u2019re part of the mix, but\u2026 I think that there is nurture and nature involved in how a kid turns out.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m afraid of.\" said by Adam\n\"What do you mean?\" said by Sally\n\"Maybe a reason that I\u2019m glad we\u2019re having a girl is because there\u2019s less of a chance that I\u2019ll screw the kid up, either from my genes or influence.\" said by Adam\n\"So if we had a boy, you would be worried that the kid would turn out like you?\" said by Sally\n\"You probably don\u2019t wanna deal with christine. Should we just go somewhere else?\" said by Lauren\n\"No, no, no. I\u2019m not running. I know diane is innocent. Christine will have to admit that too when the truth comes out. I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m sorry. The topic\u2019s kinda hard to avoid.\" said by Jack\n\"It\u2019s all hard. You know? This morning, I got up, I was so excited to meet with this new designer.\" said by Lauren\n\"But you didn\u2019T.\" said by Jack\n\"I wanted to. But then you called. And I could hear phyllis saying to me, \u201cstop with the waterworks and get your sorry self out of bed.\u201d\" said by Lauren\n\"Yeah, that is phyllis.\" said by Jack\n\"That was phyllis. How could she be gone? Her spirit, and\u2026 her never-ending energy.\" said by Lauren\n\"You came.\" said by Tucker\n\"Do you need any help packing?\" said by Ashley\n\"No, I\u2019m good.\" said by Tucker\n\"Where are you going?\" said by Ashley\n\"I hear sri lanka\u2019s nice this time of year. Maybe peru.\" said by Tucker\n\"Just like that, huh?\" said by Ashley\n\"Mm-hmm. There\u2019s nothing keeping me here. I sold mccall. So whatever that company was to me before, an ego trip, my life\u2019s work or a possible legacy for my son, it\u2019s victor\u2019s now.\" said by Tucker\n\"You\u2019re quitting.\" said by Ashley\n\"I\u2026 [ Laughs ] I\u2019m embracing my future outside of genoa city.\" said by Tucker\n\"Right.\" said by Ashley\n\"Right.\" said by Tucker\n\"So you said you had something for me.\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, yes. Yeah. Just wanted to make good on one thing before I left. I wanted to get one of those\u2013 those big ceremonial checks, you know?\" said by Tucker\n\"[ Laughs ] Right.\" said by Ashley\n\"But this will have to do. So, you see that?\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah.\" said by Ashley\n\"There you are. Mccall\u2019s debt repaid, with market-rate interest.\" said by Tucker\n\"Thank you.\" said by Ashley\n\"You\u2019re welcome. So\u2026 right? No debt between us anymore.\" said by Tucker\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Ashley\n\"No more you using it to keep me under your thumb, which has been a blast, but\u2026 game over now.\" said by Tucker\n\"So it\u2019s just like that. You\u2019re leaving.\" said by Ashley\n\"I am exploring other corners of the world.\" said by Tucker\n\"So in other words, you\u2019re a coward.\" said by Ashley\n\"Whatever you say, ashley.\" said by Tucker\n\"I mean, what about devon and dominic? You can\u2019t just leave. You can\u2019t just walk away.\" said by Ashley\n\"Devon wants nothing to do with me.\" said by Tucker\n\"So you\u2019re just gonna slink off like that? It\u2019s unattractive.\" said by Ashley\n\"[ Scoffs ] I look good on a private jet.\" said by Tucker\n\"Look, you know what? I\u2013 I had a\u2013 I had a plan. I thought it was a pretty good plan. I just wanted you to mend your relationship with devon, you know? \u2018Cause yours is a story of redemption, and it\u2013 it meant a lot to me that you were gonna be redeemed, so\u2013\" said by Ashley\n\"You know, I\u2013 I don\u2019t need to be redeemed by you.\" said by Tucker\n\"Heard. You\u2019re right.\" said by Ashley\n\"Okay. Wait a minute. I\u2019m sorry. Wait! You see, this is what you do to me.\" said by Tucker\n\"What? I make you say mean, stupid things?\" said by Ashley\n\"Yes. You know that I tried with devon and I\u2019ve tried with you. Obviously, it didn\u2019t work.\" said by Tucker\n\"There might be a place for you. Why don\u2019t you move in with me? We\u2019re done.\" said by Ashley\n\"Move in with you.\" said by Tucker\n\"I\u2013 I\u2013 I gave it some thought.\" said by Ashley\n\"What the hell are you talking about? I opened a vein to you the other day and you just shut me down. Now, you wanna be roomies? Wow. You know, you say I\u2019m the one who enjoys the game. You\u2019re the\u2013 you\u2019re the game master. So, no. No, thank you. I\u2019m not biting. I\u2019m not moving in with you. I wouldn\u2019t do it even if you were serious about it.\" said by Tucker\n\"We wouldn\u2019t share a room. Obviously, you\u2019d have your own guest room.\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, well, in that case, sign me up. Uh, if there\u2019s nothing else\u2013\" said by Tucker\n\"There is something else. Yeah. Your son. Your grandson. You know, you need to stick around so you can fix things with them, and I think it would be very intelligent if you did that. Yes, because then I could watch and make sure that it happened.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah, I\u2013 I can do that from this room if I wanted to stay. I don\u2019t wanna stay.\" said by Tucker\n\"There also is unfinished business with us. You were right. What you said the other day about me putting walls up where you\u2019re concerned. And by the way, rightfully so. However, when I see you packing and everything, I\u2019m just\u2013 you know, I\u2019m not ready for you to go.\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, lauren, hi. I\u2019m happy to see you. Could we talk for a minute?\" said by Christine\n\"Oh. Uh, yeah. Come on.\" said by Lauren\n\"Okay. I really just wanted to see how you were doing. I can\u2019t imagine everything you\u2019re going through, and I know you can\u2019t be happy with michael defending diane.\" said by Christine\n\"You know what? I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m not happy with any of it, actually.\" said by Lauren\n\"Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s not exactly the case I would\u2019ve chosen to prosecute, but as da, it goes with the territory. I have a job to do. [ Chuckles ] And I\u2019m doing it. Just like michael\u2019s doing his.\" said by Christine\n\"So what are you doing to find stark? He\u2019s the guilty party, you know.\" said by Jack\n\"Actually, I don\u2019t know that.\" said by Chance\n\"Oh, come on. He\u2019s had it out for me and diane. Framing her is payback.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, for when you two set him up on larceny charges for a necklace?\" said by Chance\n\"What are the police doing to find him? You tracking him? You\u2013 you got any leads?\" said by Jack\n\"You know, I don\u2019t have to have this conversation\u2013\" said by Chance\n\"An innocent woman is behind bars.\" said by Jack\n\"If you have a problem with how the case is being handled, the da\u2019s right through there.\" said by Chance\n\"Oh, yes. I know. She wants to put her away.\" said by Jack\n\"She will have a fair trial, jack. So let me do my job.\" said by Chance\n\"A fair trial. She had everything she could possibly have wanted. Why would she throw that away? She has been set up. Stark had every reason to wanna hurt phyllis. You find him, you find your murderer. Unless the gcpd isn\u2019t up to the task.\" said by Jack\n\"Excuse me. Excuse me, gentlemen. Can we tone this down?\" said by Sharon\n\"Jack, please step away.\" said by Christine\n\"Things aren\u2019t always as they seem.\" said by Jack\n\"I know it\u2019s not logical. But, yeah, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m afraid if we had a son that he would turn out to be a little mini-me, and\u2026 that\u2019s the last thing the world needs.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay, do I need to point out connor and christian again?\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, but maybe they turned out great in spite of me, not because of me. I mean, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m some stellar role model or have my act together. I mean, I don\u2019t even have a job right now.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay. All right. We\u2019re shutting this down right now because as our baby girl\u2019s co-parent, I need you to be confident.\" said by Sally\n\"But I\u2019m just, I\u2019ve screwed up a lot.\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah, you have. You\u2019ve made some terrible choices, but you have owned your mistakes. You\u2019ve learned and you\u2019ve grown, and you know how to love. I see it every time you\u2019re with connor. That kid means everything to you, and he adores you right back. He is smart, he\u2019s kind, he\u2019s funny. He\u2019s everything like his father, so I don\u2019t wanna hear any more about how you\u2019re gonna screw up our kid, because it\u2019s impossible. Okay? She\u2019s\u2013 she\u2019s gonna be perfect.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, thank you for believing in me. And I will do my best to put aside my fears and insecurities for you and for our baby girl.\" said by Adam\n\"Thank god. She\u2019s gonna need a heck of a strong dad.\" said by Sally\n\"I thought you just said that she was perfect.\" said by Adam\n\"[ Sighs ] Yeah. Except for the fact that she might inherit all of my worst traits.\" said by Sally\n\"Please sit down, son. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m getting older, okay? But you\u2019re my sons, and I want nothing more than to see the two of you get together. So if you work together at mccall\u2019s, that might happen. Instead of the two of you competing for a woman whose only skill seems to be to pit one brother against the other.\" said by Victor\n\"That is not what\u2019s happening.\" said by Nick\n\"Nicholas, listen to your father.

Having my executive moves scrutinized when I have so much else on my plate.\" said by Victoria\n\"And yet you said that if I didn\u2019t like your decision, I could let you go.\" said by Victor\n\"Daddy, I just said that in the heat of the moment. I don\u2019t sincerely want you to fire me from the company.\" said by Victoria\n\"So then I assume you have cooled off. So, let\u2019s talk.\" said by Victor\n\"Have you or mom considered that maybe this has hit me emotionally as well? Thinking about my sweet little niece being kidnapped and having explosives s\u2013 strapped to her body. I mean, I can only imagine how traumatizing this must have been for nicholas. That\u2019s why I am insisting that he take some time off to recover from this.\" said by Victoria\n\"But sweetheart, your brother can make that decision on his own. You don\u2019t have to make it for him.\" said by Victor\n\"Look, I\u2019m sorry if this decision that I\u2019ve made has upset you. I didn\u2019t mean for that to happen, but dad, he\u2019s been through hell. And as much as I don\u2019t want to even talk about it, you have to remember what happened with ashland.\" said by Victoria\n\"It\u2019s on the forefront of my mind.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, then you will remember that nick\u2019s emotional reaction to killing him crept up on him slowly. He made it seem like it didn\u2019t affect him at all, but it did. It affected him a lot. And I\u2019m just trying to give him a little time to deal with the fallout from all of that without having to feel like he has to hide what he\u2019s going through to protect his job. Look. [ Sighing ] Nick will come back when he is ready and strong and centered.\" said by Victoria\n\"How did he react to your decision?\" said by Victor\n\"I haven\u2019t heard from him since I\u2019ve told him, but I assume and hope that he\u2019s made the decision to use the time well.\" said by Victoria\n\"All right. Now, let\u2019s talk about nate hastings.\" said by Victor\n\"I had the announcement drafted and sent out by our pr team myself.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, that\u2019s one less cause of alarm that I could check off the list because for a second there, I thought maybe somebody hacked into our system for the sole purpose of causing corporate upheaval.\" said by Billy\n\"It\u2019s a little bit dramatic, don\u2019t you think?\" said by Jack\n\"Not as dramatic as the other possibility. That you just detonated a bomb that is going to cause a family war.\" said by Billy\n\"Billy, I can assure you, you don\u2019t need to feel threatened by that.\" said by Diane\n\"Is that right, diane? Look, there are lines being crossed right now. I hope you realize that we just had a family meeting about it. This is the exact thing traci just warned us against.\" said by Billy\n\"I am ceo of jabot. This is my decision to make.\" said by Jack\n\"Right, and I really wish that you would have talked to your co-ceo before making this decision, jack. But what I\u2019m really worried about is that you don\u2019t seem to have any ethical obligation to warning your family before you hire your fianc\u00e9 into a c-suite position.\" said by Billy\n\"Diane, why don\u2019t you head to the club and get us a table? And I don\u2019t need you to be subjected to billy\u2019s overreaction or anything else he might regret saying. It won\u2019t take long.\" said by Jack\n\"No problem.\" said by Diane\n\"I suggest you grab an appetizer, diane. This might take longer than jack thinks.\" said by Billy\n\"Thank you. I was enjoying our non-personal conversation. Why ruin a good thing?\" said by Kyle\n\"Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m not gonna grill you about whatever turmoil you\u2019re in right now.\" said by Audra\n\"Is it that obvious?\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, I mean, I just\u2013 you know, I assume that when someone so invested in keeping the conversation light, it\u2019s because they\u2019re avoiding some darker feelings. That, and our growing bar tab.\" said by Audra\n\"Hmm. Perceptive. So why not indulge me in a little more light chit chat?\" said by Kyle\n\"Hmm. Look, I want to be a friendly ear, but I can only talk about cheeseburgers for so long.\" said by Audra\n\"Whoo, whoo, whoo. Are you calling me uptight?\" said by Kyle\n\"No, I just, you know, noted that you\u2019re a man who continues to present a well-kept facade to the world while claiming his personal life is falling apart. You\u2019re the one who used the word uptight.\" said by Audra\n\"Well, I am the ceo of marchetti. Appearances matter.\" said by Kyle\n\"And you get an a+ in that category. You know, I wonder what your grade will be in \u201cfun-loving.\u201d\" said by Audra\n\"Well, with time and responsibility comes structure and discipline.\" said by Kyle\n\"Uh, that\u2019s a solid c-.\" said by Audra\n\"If you knew my past, you\u2019d give me a higher score.\" said by Kyle\n\"Are you asking me to grade you on a curve?\" said by Audra\n\"I\u2019m just saying I partied with the best of them.\" said by Kyle\n\"Oh, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to need some details. Are we talking broke into the family liquor cabinet for a few sips of scotch and stayed out a few minutes past curfew? Because if that\u2019s all you\u2019ve got, no.\" said by Audra\n\"Ooh, hey, now. I can do better than that.\" said by Kyle\n\"Okay.\" said by Audra\n\"Try raided the liquor cabinet of the richest guy in new york city.\" said by Kyle\n\"Uh-huh.\" said by Audra\n\"And had an affair with his wife.\u201d\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle abbott. I\u2019m shocked. Hm. There might be hope for you after all.\" said by Audra\n\"There you go. Moderate to severe eczema\" said by Kyle\n\"There is nothing to discuss about nate.\" said by Victoria\n\"I disagree. You never answered the question your mother and I had. About whether nate\u2019s influenced your decision to have nicholas take a leave for absence.\" said by Victor\n\"He absolutely did not. It was my call to insist that nick take a step away and my decision to have nate step in. As a matter of fact, he challenged me on it.\" said by Victoria\n\"[ Scoffing ] Really?\" said by Victor\n\"Why would you have an issue with nate picking up the slack? I don\u2019t see why you would oppose it. You have always showed an interest in his new career and you\u2019ve praised his work at newman media.\" said by Victoria\n\"We\u2019re talking about two different issues. Your brother doesn\u2019t trust him.\" said by Victor\n\"That\u2019s because he\u2019s wary of what happened at chancellor-winters and with elena. And I understand his concern. I do. But I\u2019m the one who\u2019s working with nate.\" said by Victoria\n\"Don\u2019t try to pull the wool over my eyes. I\u2019ve been around for too long. You don\u2019t just work with nate. You have a personal relationship with him. How the hell can that not influence your judgment in business?\" said by Victor\n\"Daddy, nate is an asset to this company and I trust him completely. Can\u2019t you trust me?\" said by Victoria\n\"I understand you feel left out of this decision to promote diane to the new position.\" said by Jack\n\"No, jack, let me be clear, this is not about me being left out of the loop. I don\u2019t think you realize how certain people are going to see this. It\u2019s not going to be good.\" said by Billy\n\"By certain people, I assume you mean ashley.\" said by Jack\n\"Yes, ashley, abby, anyone else on the board. Anyone else that works for jabot, jack. I mean, you handed your fianc\u00e9 an executive position without going through the proper protocol.\" said by Billy\n\"I am aware of that. I made a judgment call and I stand by it. I didn\u2019t want to hear endless counter arguments from ashley and you and everyone else. I\u2019ve heard enough badmouthing of diane to last me a lifetime.\" said by Jack\n\"So your solution to that is to circumvent us? To go behind our back.\" said by Billy\n\"You\u2019re making it sound a lot more devious than it was.\" said by Jack\n\"No, jack, you don\u2019t understand how incendiary this move is. You basically backed us into a corner. You realize that? We either go along with diane\u2019s promotion or we don\u2019t and we cause public outcry, which in turn weakens the company. We go along with your whim or we damage the boat.\" said by Billy\n\"Hold on. This is not a whim. I am ceo of jabot. This is well within my power as it was to bring you on board as my co-ceo, by the way. I don\u2019t remember posting that job or interviewing other candidates. Why is that okay for you and not for diane?\" said by Jack\n\"Because I\u2019m an abbott, jack.\" said by Billy\n\"And she\u2019s about to be one. Everybody ought to get used to that. Diane and I are getting married. Diane is being promoted. End of story.\" said by Jack\n\"No, it\u2019s not the end of story. What you just did guarantees that it does not end here.\" said by Billy\n\"It does if I say it does.\" said by Jack\n\"You know, this is exactly what ashley said was going to happen and I thought she was overreacting. I said, \u201cthere\u2019s no way that jack is going to do something so brash with diane.\u201d Jack, you have launched a missile directly at ashley and you were about to cause all-out war for jabot.\" said by Billy\n\"Oh, yeah, everything\u2019s in place. I\u2019m definitely pulling the trigger. Just a few details I want to discuss with you. Okay, I\u2019ll text you later. Bye.\" said by Ashley\n\"Hello, ashley.\" said by Diane\n\"Well, hi. Aren\u2019t you out past your bedtime?\" said by Ashley\n\"I\u2019m meeting jack here for dinner.\" said by Diane\n\"Special occasion? I mean, you just kind of look like you put in a little bit more effort. Oh, wait, I know. I read that announcement. You are jabot\u2019s new chief talent officer.\" said by Ashley\n\"So you heard the news.\" said by Diane\n\"Oh, yeah. Read it online, where I just love to get all the family company updates. You must be thrilled. Everything\u2019s coming together for you, huh, diane?\" said by Ashley\n\"An affair with a married woman.\" said by Audra\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019m assuming since you\u2019re telling me, the husband found out.\" said by Audra\n\"You know, it\u2019s common knowledge now since it resulted in my son, harrison, but something tells me you already knew that.\" said by Kyle\n\"Um, look, I admit I did a little internet deep dive on you since our last drink.\" said by Audra\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Kyle\n\"But I didn\u2019t know a whole lot about you other than the fact that you\u2019re married to my ex\u2019s sister. Um, whoops, I veered into the too personal, didn\u2019t I?\" said by Audra\n\"Whoa, whoa. I did not see that coming. That\u2019s impressive.\" said by Kyle\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Audra\n\"But engaging with the pilot seems a little dangerous.\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, kyle, I\u2019m not afraid of a little danger.\" said by Audra\n\"Mm-hmm. But you lived to tell the tale, so I\u2019m guessing it was with a passenger.\" said by Kyle\n\"Hm. Handsome and smart.\" said by Audra\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Kyle\n\"But my achievements are not confined to the boardroom. I got a few moves.\" said by Audra\n\"I bet you do. How about you show me some? Come on.\" said by Kyle\n\"All right.\" said by Audra\n\"I clearly need a little extra credit in the \u201cfun-loving\u201d category.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah. Anything to help.\" said by Audra\n\"When you made me ceo of newman enterprises, you put your trust in me to run the family company. I know that trust was challenged after what happened with ashland, but I had felt that we\u2019d gotten past that. I hope you still trust me, dad. Even if you don\u2019t agree with every decision that I make.\" said by Victoria\n\"Is it late enough for a sample of that new bourbon I brought you? Oh, victor. Sorry if I\u2019m interrupting. I didn\u2019t realize you were here.\" said by Nate\n\"That\u2019s all right, nate.\" said by Victor\n\"Victoria and i have been working late on a new project for the real estate division.\" said by Nate\n\"And nate must have something pressing to talk with me about. Daddy, I\u2019m sure you want to head back to the ranch, don\u2019t you?\" said by Victoria\n\"I\u2019m not going anywhere, sweetheart. So, why don\u2019t you give nate and me a moment alone, all right?\" said by Victor\n\"Um, I do need to check in with the technology team, but I\u2019ll be right back.\" said by Victoria\n\"Nate, would you kindly close the door? And now, why don\u2019t you pour yourself a glass of that bourbon?\" said by Victor\n\"Before I do, victor, I want to assure you that I am up for this challenge. Victoria\u2019s asked me to step in for nick while he\u2019s out and I am happy to do so. I intend to impress not just victoria, but you, nikki, and nick, too.\" said by Nate\n\"There will be no war at jabot.\" said by Jack\n\"That is wishful thinking, jack. Ashley is hell-bent on turning the rest of jabot against diane. She\u2019s not gonna stop trying to recruit board members. And what you just did was give her ammunition to prove that diane is infiltrating jabot at a very high level.\" said by Billy\n\"You let me handle ashley.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, you cannot defend this move. I mean, she\u2019s not qualified.\" said by Billy\n\"I am not going to defend diane\u2019s curriculum vitae to anyone.\" said by Jack\n\"You\u2019re gonna have to come up with a motive, okay? You\u2019re gonna have to figure this out because tucker is coming. He\u2019s got something going on with ashley, there\u2019s no doubt about that. And he has got a lot more experience than diane does.\" said by Billy\n\"I\u2019m not going to worry about tucker right now. He\u2019s on the outside, we\u2019re on the inside.\" said by Jack\n\"Until they get married and they do the exact same thing you just did!\" said by Billy\n\"This is a hypothetical, billy. How about now? Right now, as my co-ceo, do you have my back?\" said by Jack\n\"So, now you want my\u2013\" said by Billy\n\"And diane\u2019s?\" said by Jack\n\"It is very important for you to know that I do not approve of these methods.\" said by Billy\n\"Message received.\" said by Jack\n\"Because you are my brother and because I am co-ceo of this company, yeah. I have your back.\" said by Billy\n\"Thank you. And diane?\" said by Jack\n\"I will say yes until she gives me a reason to say no.\" said by Billy\n\"As a matter of fact, my life feels very much untracked these days. No complaints, although, I\u2019m sure that you will point out a few things that I should be concerned about.\" said by Diane\n\"No. None that I can tell. Boy, this must be a dream job for you. Working side by side with jack, planning a wedding. You are going to be one busy girl.\" said by Ashley\n\"Funny, I would have thought you\u2019d be more upset by the announcement.\" said by Diane\n\"Oh, well, let\u2019s be real. I\u2019m not thrilled. But don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to throw an embarrassing tantrum. Actually, my life is taking me in a different direction.\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, really? Really? What direction is that? East perhaps? Maybe paris with tucker?\" said by Diane\n\"[ Laughing ] No. No, that\u2019s funny. Nope. Nope. Nope. No travel plans.\" said by Ashley\n\"Then what?\" said by Diane\n\"You know, it\u2019s a surprise, you know? You\u2019ll find out soon enough.\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, so this is some new ploy of yours.\" said by Diane\n\"You\u2019re so paranoid. I think all I\u2019ve done is congratulate you.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yes, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so suspicious.\" said by Diane\n\"Well, I have to admit, I do get a kick out of being able to get under your skin. Is that bad?\" said by Ashley\n\"It\u2019s getting late. I need to head home.\" said by Kyle\n\"Uh\u2026 right, um, me\u2013 me too. I have a big day tomorrow.\" said by Audra\n\"Ah, yeah. I didn\u2019t even ask you about how things are in newman.\" said by ", "answer": "Kyle"}

I appreciate that.\" said by Sally\n\"I didn\u2019t realize you were coming with adam.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, it was kind of a last-minute invitation.\" said by Sharon\n\"Ah, which doesn\u2019t diminish how pleased I am to be your date for the evening.\" said by Adam\n\"Huh.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Laughs ]\" said by Adam\n\"Uh\u2026yeah, why not?\" said by Nick\n\"[ Clears throat ]\" said by Adam\n\"Okay, well, um, why don\u2019t we go inside?

Not having alcohol for a few more months is totally worth it.\" said by Sally\n\"Yes. Yes, it is.\" said by Adam\n\"Thank you.\" said by Nick\n\"There\u2019s so much press here tonight. Are we really doing this, announcing our engagement to the world?\" said by Diane\n\"You\u2019re talking to the wrong guy. I am madly in love and ready to shout it from the rooftops.\" said by Jack\n\"I left my press credentials at the hotel! You\u2019re not really gonna make me go back and get them, are you? You know who I am!\" said by Leanna\n\"Even with a mask on.\" said by Diane\n\"I would know that voice.\" said by Jack\n\"Mm. And the hair.\" said by Diane\n\"It\u2019s me \u2014 leanna love.\" said by Leanna\n\"Well, well. Jack abbott. And diane jenkins. Oh! I have to admit, I was stunned and fascinated to hear you were still alive! And now here you are, accompanying jack to this momentous occasion. How spectacular is that? Wait a minute. Are you two a thing?\" said by Leanna\n\"What brings you by tonight, leanna?\" said by Jack\n\"Well, how could i stay away? I have so many fond memories of genoa city. And who better to cover the celebration of the century \u2014 no, make that two centuries \u2014 than moi, G.C.\u2019S own celebrity journalista?\" said by Leanna\n\"Hey.\" said by Billy\n\"Hi.\" said by Chelsea\n\"You\u2019re not dressed.\" said by Billy\n\"I\u2019m running a little behind. Uh, I can\u2019t decide what to wear.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, you left the industry, but you\u2019re still a fashion icon. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty of things up in your closet that you\u2019re gonna look gorgeous in.\" said by Billy\n\"Thanks. Yeah. I just need to pick one and get on with it.\" said by Chelsea\n\"So, this isn\u2019t about the dress. What\u2019s up?\" said by Billy\n\"I just have a little anxiety about facing everybody all in one place, so I started to go down the rabbit hole.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Okay.\" said by Billy\n\"I thought I was ready for this, billy, but now\u2026 I\u2019m not sure if I can be your date.\" said by Chelsea\n\"As thrilled as you are to see everyone, I think you\u2019ll find that the top-tier guests are less than thrilled to see you.\" said by Diane\n\"Consider yourself warned.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, pish-posh. Any bad blood is so much bubbly under the bridge. We\u2019ve all moved on, haven\u2019t we? No, I\u2019m quite certain everyone will be tickled to see me.\" said by Leanna\n\"Well, think what you like.\" said by Diane\n\"But the real reason I\u2019m here tonight is because there are going to be so many juicy stories to write about. With a lot of power players on hand, who knows what could happen? I might even get another book out of it.\" said by Leanna\n\"I am a little concerned our news will get out sooner than we anticipated.\" said by Jack\n\"Listen, I don\u2019t want that blabbermouth leaking the news of our engagement before we make our official announcement. Jack, you should hang on to this so that no one sees it.\" said by Diane\n\"Until the time is right.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, michael, I am so excited. It\u2019s going to be amazing.\" said by Nikki\n\"It\u2019s beyond amazing. People are gonna love the surprise you cooked up for them. You, young lady, have outdone yourself.\" said by Michael\n\"Oh, that\u2019s only because I had such a stellar planning committee. I could trust all of you to put the finishing touches on this event so that I could focus on\u2026\" said by Nikki\n\"Ah, other things.\" said by Michael\n\"Exactly.\" said by Nikki\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Michael\n\"Oh, and before I get busy greeting guests, I just want to say the food and drink that you and lauren organized \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s out of this world.\" said by Nikki\n\"Why, thank you, lady.\" said by Michael\n\"And speaking of your lovely wife, is she on her way?\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh, my.\" said by Michael\n\"Because she is pushing the limits of fashionably late.\" said by Nikki\n\"I got a text.

I just hope she gets here before the presentation.\" said by Nikki\n\"I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t eat. Got quite a spread.\" said by Nick\n\"And that ice sculpture, you could hide a truck behind that thing.\" said by Sally\n\"You know, um, unfortunately, I can\u2019t really.\" said by Victoria\n\"Uh, I beg your pardon.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, I mean, you\u2019re doing your best to hide the fact that you\u2019re expecting. But you\u2019re kind of drawing more attention to it. You shouldn\u2019t worry about it. You don\u2019t have to be self-conscious. I mean, worst-case scenario, you can just wear your mask, right?\" said by Victoria\n\"Vick\u2019s right. You don\u2019t have to try and hide it. I doubt anyone figures it out. And if they do, who cares? You look beautiful. You got this.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, don\u2019t you all look breathtaking?\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh, look who\u2019s talking.\" said by Victoria\n\"Stunning, mother.

I love surprises.\" said by Sally\n\"Guess we should go join the family, talk about nikki\u2019s dress. Will you be okay with that?\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah, of course. Unless you\u2019re planning on causing trouble.\" said by Sharon\n\"Me?\" said by Adam\n\"Now, ashley, why in the world would you lower yourself to be seen with this man in public, let alone as his date, considering your history?\" said by Victor\n\"We\u2019re not really interested in your opinion.\" said by Tucker\n\"I\u2019m perfectly capable of deciding who I want to hang out with, but thank you so much.\" said by Ashley\n\"Tucker, old boy, you\u2019re being used. You know that, don\u2019t you? Ashley has a plan for you. I don\u2019t know what that is, but I\u2019m very curious to find out how it all plays out. Meanwhile, why don\u2019t you sell your company to me?\" said by Victor\n\"Oh, would you like to buy my company?\" said by Tucker\n\"Yes. When are you gonna make a decision?\" said by Victor\n\"I\u2019m currently working out a deal with devon.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, you are? Well, devon \u2014 well, I\u2019ll be damned.

I told jack that I was gonna go, so I\u2019m just gonna let him know, okay?\" said by Billy\n\"Wait, hold on, hold on. Maybe that\u2019s a mistake.\" said by Chelsea\n\"What do you mean?\" said by Billy\n\"Giving in to my anxieties. My therapist would probably say that it\u2019s good to face the situation, you know, to get out in a crowd, venture outside my comfort zone.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Okay. \u201cProbably\u201d isn\u2019t for sure, though, and I\u2019m not sure I see a reason why you would intentionally make yourself uncomfortable.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, I mean, this is kind of the ideal scenario, isn\u2019t it? I mean, the focus is gonna be on the event, right? Not on me. I mean, nobody cares about me. I can just blend in and be an observer and see some people I want to see, and hopefully, have some lovely conversations. Plus, if I am going to be working with daniel, I have to learn to get out into the world again, right? So I think I just need to put on a fancy dress and face my fears and stay strong. That\u2019s what dr. Malone would say, right?\" said by Chelsea\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Chelsea\n\"Look at those two.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, they\u2019re probably just making nice. Develop yeah. It seems like your dad is very interested in whatever it is jill has to say.\" said by Abby\n\"Do you think he knows about jill\u2019s change of heart?\" said by Abby\n\"Very good.\" said by Jill\n\"See you.\" said by Victor\n\"Yes, you will.\" said by Jill\n\"Jill foster.\" said by Mamie\n\"Mamie johnson? Well, how delightful to see you. That is a beautiful dress.\" said by Jill\n\"Well, thank you. You paid for it.\" said by Mamie\n\"[ Chuckles ] Yeah. You still traveling the world on my dollar, are you?\" said by Jill\n\"Oh, but I\u2019ve invested it very wisely. Your $1 million has turned into $10 million over time.\" said by Mamie\n\"Whoa. Good for you. But then, of course, you were always very, very shrewd.\" said by Jill\n\"And you were always \u2014\" said by Mamie\n\"An abbott.\" said by Jill\n\"What\u2019s that?\" said by Mamie\n\"I go by jill abbott. I have for decades. But you knew that, didn\u2019t you?\" said by Jill\n\"Can\u2019t say that i recall.\" said by Mamie\n\"Hmm. Look, mamie, uh, you and I both said some things over the years, you know, and maybe done some things that perhaps we regret now. But look at us. We\u2019ve aged gracefully and beautifully, so why don\u2019t we just let bygones be bygones, huh?\" said by Jill\n\"I don\u2019t think so.\" said by Mamie\n\"You are an absolute goddess.\" said by Michael\n\"Worth the wait?\" said by Lauren\n\"Every damn second.\" said by Michael\n\"[ Laughs ] Thanks, baby.\" said by Lauren\n\"Oh, here you are.\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh. Am I that late?\" said by Lauren\n\"You\u2019re just in time. Come on.\" said by Nikki\n\"Okay, great.\" said by Lauren\n\"Alright.\" said by Michael\n\"Ladies and gentlemen.\" said by Nikki\n\"Ladies and gentlemen!\" said by Michael\n\"Good evening, genoa city. I am nikki newman, co-chair of this event. You having fun?\" said by Nikki\n\"Yeah! Whoo!\" said by Guests\n\"Excellent. If you could start making your way towards the lounge in the next few minutes, we have a very special surprise for you.\" said by Nikki\n\"Ready to go? Okay?\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, wrong way.\" said by Abby\n\"Ah.\" said by Jeremy\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Woman\n\"Tonight, this all ends for good.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Hey.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Hi.\" said by Lily\n\"Hi. You both look great.\" said by Phyllis\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Lily\n\"So handsome.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yeah.\" said by Lily\n\"Thanks.\" said by Dylan\n\"You want to, um, maybe, you know put a hold on our tension just for\u2026\" said by Phyllis\n\"Oh, my god. I am so sorry.\" said by Dylan\n\"No, no, no, no, no. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 I don\u2019t know what that was.\" said by Lily\n\"She\u2019s been all over the place lately. I mean, really erratic. I would say that I\u2019m worried about her, but I don\u2019t know, I think that\u2019s what she wants.\" said by Dylan\n\"Well, shall we head to the lounge?\" said by Jack\n\"Hello?\" said by Traci\n\"Oh, aunt traci. We didn\u2019t see you.\" said by Jack\n\"Is this your boy, jack?\" said by Mamie\n\"This is my boy. Kyle, summer, I would love you to meet the woman that raised traci and ashley and me. This is mamie johnson. Kyle, if you don\u2019t remember her, believe me, she remembers you.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Kyle\n\"Oh, you\u2019re so handsome and so tall. And you have a lovely wife and a son now. Oh, what a lovely couple you are. Jackie, its the spitting image of you. I hope that he has your values, as well.\" said by Mamie\n\"Oh, he does. An occasional misstep, but, yeah, he\u2019s on the right track.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, I don\u2019t doubt that. You and his mother raised him well.\" said by Mamie\n\"We\u2019re about to go in for the big reveal, whatever that might be. Would you care to join us, mamie?\" said by Diane\n\"I\u2019d love to.\" said by Mamie\n\"You know what? I\u2019m gonna get us some champagne and meet you in there, okay? I\u2019m so glad we got here in time.\" said by Traci\n\"In time for what?\" said by Summer\n\"Is this your big announce\u2013\" said by Kyle\n\"Um, no.\" said by Jack\n\"What, then?\" said by Kyle\n\"I think I might have a little inkling of what\u2019s about to happen, being on the planning committee and all.\" said by Traci\n\"Hmm, well, I will get some champagne with traci. And you go get us a good spot in the lounge. I don\u2019t want to miss any of grandma and grandpa\u2019s speeches.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay.\" said by Kyle\n\"Shall we?\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah.\" said by Diane\n\"Ladies? Lucky me. Look at this.\" said by Jack\n\"Good to see you.\" said by Summer\n\"Thank you.\" said by Traci\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Summer\n\"Hey.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Well, hi, phyllis.\" said by Traci\n\"Traci. [ Chuckles ]\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yes, mom?\" said by Summer\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Phyllis\n\"What is it? Kyle\u2019s waiting for me.\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m sure you want to go in and listen to nikki and victor drone on and on, right?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Mom, why are you being like this, especially tonight?\" said by Summer\n\"Um\u2026 I know that we\u2019ve had conflicts summer, but, um\u2026 I want you to know that I\u2019m so proud of the woman you\u2019ve become, and impressed with the mother you\u2019ve become. No matter what happens, I want you to know I\u2019m proud of you. I\u2019m so proud of you. You know? Okay?\" said by Phyllis\n\"[ Chuckles ] My mom acting weirder than usual?\" said by Summer\n\"I-I-I don\u2019t \u2014 it was \u2014 I don\u2019t know. It was hard to say. She said some beautiful things, but it seemed very desperate and strange. I\u2019m kareem abdul-jabbar.\" said by Traci\n\"May I have your attention, please? Thank you all for coming. This is such a momentous occasion. The 200th birthday of this great city we call home.\" said by Nikki\n\"And contrary to rumors, I was not here at the founding of this town.\" said by Victor\n\"And many of us have had our differences over the years. We have all shared a lot of love and laughter. This event is the celebration of how our city has grown and continues to thrive. A city with a small-town feel, where business titans can create empires and a coffee shop can feel like a second home where people gather to commiserate, mourn, celebrate, and even fall in love.\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh, yes.\" said by Victor\n\"The success of our city is due to our values. We welcome the changes that keep it young and vibrant, and also celebrate and honor our heritage, while always remembering those we have lost. People like my dear friend katherine chancellor.\" said by Nikki\n\"Yes, and my dear friend neil winters, gone too soon.\" said by Victor\n\"We paid tribute to katherine in one of our favorite places, chancellor park\u2026\" said by Nikki\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Victor\n\"\u2026And thought it was only fitting that tonight we honor another citizen who was so instrumental in making this the dynamic city that it is and, more importantly, the city we love to call home.\" said by Nikki\n\"And I invite my daughter abby to a special presentation.\" said by Victor\n\"Yeah.\" said by Devon\n\"Neil winters was a huge part of the fabric of genoa city. He made a lasting impact with his work, his family, the abbott-winters foundation, and of course, hamilton-winters. So tonight we are here, we are able to celebrate in this beautiful room that was created in his memory to welcome both visitors and citizens alike to enjoy the music that he loved so much. So it is my honor and privilege to officially unveil the newly renovated athletic club lounge as the neil winters jazz lounge.\" said by Abby\n\"Yes.\" said by Victor\n\"So please enjoy this ongoing gift to our community.\" said by Abby\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, well, neil was such a dear, dear friend. Just seemed like the right time and place to launch a permanent tribute to him.\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh, it certainly is. And thank you so much. And how did you keep this a secret from me?\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, I was dying to tell you, but surprise.\" said by Abby\n\"How about I get a group photo of you all?\" said by Photographer\n\"Yes.\" said by Victor\n\"Sure. Please.\" said by Devon\n\"Here you are, darling. Here we go.\" said by Victor\n\"Great. Can I get a photo of you with the newmans?\" said by Photographer\n\"Yeah, sure.\" said by Lily\n\"Alright. Alright. Get on in.\" said by Photographer\n\"Thank you.\" said by Nikki\n\"Thanks. Wow.\" said by Devon\n\"I honestly can\u2019t even tell you how much it means to me that you would honor my father like this. Thank you.\" said by Lily\n\"You know, your dad was not only a business partner, but he was a close friend. One of the few friends I\u2019ve ever had.\" said by Victor\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Lily\n\"I know that he would move heaven and earth to make sure that the two of you bridge your differences and get rid of the conflict that exists between you. I know that he would wish that fervently. Okay everyone, our mission is complete balanced nutrition.\" said by Victor\n\"You know what, devon? Even in a photograph, he is the sexiest man in the room. No offense, okay?\" said by Jill\n\"No, not at all. None taken.\" said by Devon\n\"I really love this place, every inch of it. Wow. What a great homage to your father.\" said by Jill\n\"I know. Really, really is. Jill, I have a question to ask you.\" said by Devon\n\"Mm-hmm?\" said by Jill\n\"Did victor have anything to do with you changing your mind about the ipo?\" said by Devon\n\"Did you know that victor is one of your biggest supporters?\" said by Jill\n\"You know, you have your mother\u2019s spirit, don\u2019t you?\" said by Mamie\n\"Oh, god. I wish.\" said by Lily\n\"She was a beautiful woman, lily.\" said by Mamie\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Lily\n\"And strong. And you\u2019re just like that. Oh, it makes me feel happy to be here with you.\" said by Mamie\n\"Oh, me too. Thank you.\" said by Lily\n\"So, how are your young ones? It\u2019s charlie and maddie?\" said by ", "answer": "Mamie"}
{"content": "\"Hey, nick. It\u2019s jack. I\u2019m just checking in. I\u2019m still reeling from phyllis\u2019s death. I imagine you\u2019re feeling the same way. If\u2013 if you feel like talking, gimme\u2013 gimme a call.\" said by Jack\n\"Wow, how sweet. You\u2019re actually taking a break from fawning all over diane to show compassion for somebody else.\" said by Ashley\n\"I don\u2019t know why you\u2019d be surprised. My heart goes out to anyone who cared about phyllis. She was a big part of my life, a big part of this family\u2019s life.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. Seems to me though, you\u2019ve forgotten about all the people you say you care about ever since you got back involved with diane.\" said by Ashley\n\"That is not true, ash.\" said by Jack\n\"I think it is, jack. I almost expected to find you down here consoling her because your big engagement news got overshadowed by phyllis\u2019s dying.\" said by Ashley\n\"It is amazing to me even at a time like this, my own sister can\u2019t set aside her vitriol for the woman I love.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, god.\" said by Ashley\n\"This where the town pariahs gather to meet?\" said by Tucker\n\"I\u2019m not in the mood, tucker.\" said by Diane\n\"Yeah. I should think not. Things took quite a turn last night, eh? Got the whole town talking.\" said by Tucker\n\"Why don\u2019t you go harass someone else?\" said by Diane\n\"You\u2019re the\u2013 by far, the most fascinating person to talk to in town, at least about this topic. Most people have conflicted feelings about phyllis\u2019s death, not you.\" said by Tucker\n\"Hey.\" said by Billy\n\"Hey, billy.\" said by Sharon\n\"How you holding up?\" said by Billy\n\"Well, I\u2019m still working through what\u2019s happened.\" said by Sharon\n\"Do you have any therapists secrets on how to cope with grief?\" said by Billy\n\"I wish there were one. I\u2019m just processing my emotions like everyone else. Such a strange void knowing that phyllis is no longer in the world.\" said by Sharon\n\"She was larger than life and it\u2019s funny. Everything seems a little less colorful all of a sudden.\" said by Billy\n\"That\u2019s true. The question now is how do we fill that absence?\" said by Sharon\n\"I know that the flower choice isn\u2019t conventional, but neither was my mother. Quiet and sedate just wasn\u2019t her style. Okay, send me the invoice.\" said by Summer\n\"Let me take some of this off your hands. What can I do?\" said by Kyle\n\"Can you please stop asking so I can stop saying it? This is something that I need to do myself.\" said by Summer\n\"Phyllis\u2019s passing really makes you realize how important it is to spend every minute with the people you love.\" said by Sharon\n\"You thinking about rey?\" said by Billy\n\"This month will be a year since we lost him.\" said by Sharon\n\"Wow.\" said by Billy\n\"It\u2019s hard to believe that it\u2019s been that long. Some mornings, I still wake up and turn over and expect to see him lying there next to me. Sometimes, I listen to this message he left for me that I haven\u2019t been able to erase. For a few seconds, it feels like he\u2019s still here.\" said by Sharon\n\"I\u2019m sorry. He was a good guy.\" said by Billy\n\"He was a great man with a beautiful soul. And in many ways, I was lucky to find a love like that. My life was made better because I met rey rosales and I know that he would want me to be happy now, so I do my best to find things that make me happy.\" said by Sharon\n\"The simple pleasures.\" said by Billy\n\"Right now, it is mariah and tessa\u2019s new baby girl, aria. I have been video chatting with them from portland. It\u2019s impossible to be sad when you look at that adorable little face.\" said by Sharon\n\"Oh, no. Babies are like dopamine hit straight into the system.\" said by Billy\n\"It doesn\u2019t make up for the loss, but new life is definitely giving me something worth holding onto.\" said by Sharon\n\"That\u2019s good. I\u2019m happy for you. I\u2019m happy for\u2013 for everyone, and please tell mariah and tessa congratulations. And when I\u2019m having a bad day, I\u2019m gonna hit you up for a baby picture.\" said by Billy\n\"You were clear about your wishes. You want to plan the memorial alone.\" said by Kyle\n\"Okay, then why do we need to keep talking about it? Alone means that no one can help. Not you. Not my grandma. I haven\u2019t even talked to daniel about the arrangements.\" said by Summer\n\"You think that\u2019s a good idea? It might matter to him, too.\" said by Kyle\n\"Then I will tell him that I\u2019m sorry. This service is my apology to my mom for the pain that I cost her in her final days.\" said by Summer\n\"Phyllis knew how much you loved her.\" said by Kyle\n\"You don\u2019t know that.\" said by Summer\n\"I knew her and I knew how she felt about you. You fought and had differences over the years and made up. A lifetime of love does not get undone by a rocky last few months.\" said by Kyle\n\"It was her last memory of us, of our time together.\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, I am worried. You are running yourself ragged, handling all of this on top of dealing with your grief and mourning. It\u2019s too much. I am begging you to let me help you.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019m not gonna leave the details to anyone else, okay? It\u2019s too important. And if you\u2019re worried about me wearing myself out, then stop making me expend my energy fighting with you about it.\" said by Summer\n\"No, no. I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m not trying to argue with you. I am just saying that the way your mom\u2019s life ended is not your fault and it is not your burden to carry.\" said by Kyle\n\"She was not a burden. She was a gift and she was loved. And this service is gonna show anybody who doubts that just what a force was taken from us all. Hi, my name is tony cooper.

When is the damage that she\u2019s caused to all of us enough?\" said by Ashley\n\"I am not having this conversation.\" said by Jack\n\"Let\u2019s just be honest, jack. After all the stress and anxiety that diane caused phyllis all these months, is it really just a coincidence? You announce your engagement to diana and phyllis collapses and then dies?\" said by Ashley\n\"You have no evidence of that. That is speculation.\" said by Jack\n\"I don\u2019t have to speculate about all the misery that she\u2019s brought to us because I have personally lived it. And now, you\u2019re willing to turn your back on everyone and everything that you say you care about and you still wanna marry her.\" said by Ashley\n\"That is enough.\" said by Jack\n\"It\u2019s not enough because I can\u2019t get through to you and nobody can get through to you. I\u2019m worried for you. I\u2019m worried that you\u2019re gonna suffer the same consequences of being involved with diane that phyllis did.\" said by Ashley\n\"Who doubts that phyllis was loved?\" said by Kyle\n\"I can think of two people off the top of my head. My mom\u2019s supposed husband\u2019s, stark, and\u2026 his ex-lover.\" said by Summer\n\"Ex? You mean my mother?\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019m not gonna forget what she said to my mom the night that she died. That she would be doing the world a favor if she killed her.\" said by Summer\n\"That was in the heat of the moment. You yourself pointed that out to phyllis.\" said by Kyle\n\"I was wrong.\" said by Summer\n\"You are suffering a terrible pain. I know what it\u2019s like and I understand and am hoping you will come out on the other side realizing no one is happy phyllis is gone.\" said by Kyle\n\"That\u2019s not true. Oh, my god. I can\u2019t believe that you still have these blinders on when it comes to your mom. How can you not see it?\" said by Summer\n\"Okay. Please just stop. You\u2019re spinning out and it\u2019s killing me. I get that you are suffering, but you couldn\u2019t possibly have convinced yourself that my mom would wish something so tragic.\" said by Kyle\n\"Not just tragic. Malicious.\" said by Summer\n\"Were you even able to shed a single tear for phyllis? At least put on a concerned face for jack and kyle and the cops.\" said by Tucker\n\"Don\u2019t be perverse. I am not glad that she\u2019s dead and I am sad for those who loved her.\" said by Diane\n\"Yes, of course, of course. Still, having phyllis dead is gonna make your life a lot easier.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, there\u2019s more of where she came from.\" said by Diane\n\"Oh, you mean ashley?\" said by Tucker\n\"Yes. You two seem awfully cozy these days.\" said by Diane\n\"Mm. Not cozy enough for my liking, but I\u2019m working on it.\" said by Tucker\n\"Maybe you could convince her to show jack some courtesy while he\u2019s grieving.\" said by Diane\n\"Of course, I will. \u2018Cause he would show me the same courtesy. So, it\u2019s not even a little tinge that jack is mourning his once great love?\" said by Tucker\n\"You\u2019re awful. You know that?\" said by Diane\n\"Yeah. I\u2019ve heard. Well, I\u2019d wish you a nice day, but I don\u2019t think your day is going to get any better from here.\" said by Tucker\n\"I am not gonna play into your guilt trip. Phyllis wasted the last few months of her life fixated on diane, with your encouragement, she chose to spin her wheels spewing hate rather than living her life. Her daughter came back to town, as did her son. She had plenty to celebrate. Instead, she focused all of her energy on rage and spite and vengeance. Her death is a terrible loss! And if stress had anything to do with it, it is stress phyllis brought on herself.\" said by Jack\n\"Do you hear\u2013 you\u2019re gonna blame phyllis, the dead woman? You\u2019re blaming her? Of course, it couldn\u2019t be diane\u2019s fault, right? She\u2019s been an angel during this whole thing. She\u2019s not a victim.\" said by Ashley\n\"You think I need to learn a lesson about phyllis\u2019s death? I think you do. Instead of digesting what phyllis did, what happened to phyllis and choosing a different direction? No. You\u2019ve doubled down. You\u2019re gonna get back to the work that you and nikki and phyllis started together. Wasting your days working toward the same spiteful goal, doing exactly the same thing you now claim led to the death of your co-conspirator.\" said by Jack\n\"I am trying to protect the people I care\u2013\" said by Ashley\n\"I don\u2019t need your protect protection.\" said by Jack\n\"You do! You do!\" said by Ashley\n\"Get on with it. Is your life really that empty? Is your heart really that dark?\" said by Jack\n\"[ Voice breaks ] This is what love is\u2026 right here. I\u2019m gonna keep fighting for you, jack, because you\u2019re too blind to fight for yourself.\" said by Ashley\n\"You\u2019re saying you believe someone killed phyllis.\" said by Kyle\n\"It is the only thing that is making sense. Everything surrounding my mom\u2019s death is just too convenient. Like it could have been set up by someone who wanted her gone.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay. I\u2013 I\u2013 I think it\u2019s time for us to bring in someone for you to talk to about your grief.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019m not crazy.\" said by Summer\n\"No. No, no, no. I\u2019m not saying you are. I just think it might be helpful for you to talk to someone who\u2019s trained in this, maybe even sharon.\" said by Kyle\n\"Sharon? Kyle, you know my mom\u2019s history with her. Why would I talk to her about this?\" said by Summer\n\"All of that stopped mattering years ago. And sharon knows enough about all of us where she wouldn\u2019t have to familiarize herself with the personalities or situation. Hopefully, she can help us through this huge loss.\" said by Kyle\n\"What you\u2019re really saying is that you want her to brainwash me into thinking that my mom\u2019s death was just a series of coincidences.\" said by Summer\n\"That\u2019s what it was. I know the instinct is to find answers and blame someone, but none of this was planned.\" said by Kyle\n\"The more I think about it, the less I think that\u2019s true. And I don\u2019t need you or sharon or anyone else to try to convince me otherwise.\" said by Summer\n\"All right. All right. Let\u2019s talk about other options.\" said by Kyle\n\"I have things that I need to take care of, okay?\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019ll come with you.\" said by Kyle\n\"No. I\u2019m leaving alone.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, hey, summer. Summer? I don\u2019t mean to intrude, but I just saw summer. How is she dealing with everything?\" said by Sharon\n\"I hate seeing her like this. I don\u2019t know what to do. I suggested she see a professional.\" said by Kyle\n\"But she\u2019s not ready yet to do that?\" said by Sharon\n\"Bad call on my part.\" said by Kyle\n\"It\u2019s hard being the loved one of someone who\u2019s grieving. Just ask nick or faith or mariah. I know that I was pretty tough to deal with at times when we lost rey.\" said by Sharon\n\"I just feel like I can\u2019t win. Somehow, I\u2019m always saying and doing the wrong thing.\" said by Kyle\n\"I don\u2019t know that there is the right thing. Just don\u2019t be so hard on yourself.\" said by Sharon\n\"I just want and need to be there for summer, but I\u2019m dealing with my own feelings. And summer\u2019s personal attacks on my mother, I\u2013 what do I say to that?\" said by Kyle\n\"I know it doesn\u2019t seem like it now, but time will help. Heightened emotions will subside. Summer will always grieve her mother, much like you did yours before we knew that diane was alive, but in time, the pain will become bearable.\" said by Sharon\n\"I remember every step of that journey. It\u2019s not an easy road.\" said by Kyle\n\"Now you will go down that road with your wife. And you know what I see happening? You\u2019re going to give summer the best support possible, even when her pain won\u2019t allow her to accept it.\" said by Sharon\n\"What if I am doing everything wrong?\" said by Kyle\n\"Just being there is enough. When I had my family around me, it meant the world to me just to have their support, even if they were just giving me my space. You are summer\u2019s family and the two of you are gonna get through this together.\" said by Sharon\n\"How are you doing?\" said by Summer\n\"Everything hurts.\" said by Daniel\n\"I get it. Talking hurts. Not talking hurts.\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2013 I saw the announcement for mom\u2019s memorial service. You didn\u2019t think to talk to me about it first?\" said by Daniel\n\"I couldn\u2019t talk to anyone about it. I just had to make it happen.\" said by Summer\n\"Right. Right. But I mean, it\u2019s not how this works, you know? I deserve to be involved in those decisions. She was my mother, too.\" said by Daniel\n\"I can guess what that was about.\" said by Billy\n\"Our sister has a one-track mind. She\u2019s singularly focused on her loathing for diane above everything else. Her own brother, her nephew, the death of someone who was part of this family.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. I\u2019m not gonna defend ashley, jack. I wasn\u2019t here. I was just talking to sharon about the nature of grief in all its different forms.\" said by Billy\n\"You think a tragedy like this would bring us closer together. Seems to be tearing us further apart.\" said by Jack\n\"It\u2019s hard to wrap your mind around. Yeah, I for one, I\u2019m gonna miss her. She was chaotic, but electric, fiery and brilliant.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah, she was all that.\" said by Jack\n\"And now she\u2019s gone and uh, people are looking for explanations. Someone to blame. It\u2019s not just ashley.\" said by Billy\n\"What does that mean?\" said by Jack\n\"There\u2019s been some comments made, jack.\" said by Billy\n\"About what?\" said by Jack\n\"That maybe diane was involved.\" said by Billy\n\"Hi, come in.\" said by Tucker\n\"Why are you here now?\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, the grand phoenix is being renovated. Got a little noisy. Why are you here? How can I help?\" said by Tucker\n\"I don\u2019t know if you can help. I guess I turn to you like a bad habit.\" said by Ashley\n\"Okay. Well, let\u2019s be bad, then.\" said by Tucker\n\"Are you always like this? Just, nothing affects you ever? Just flip and unaffected?\" said by Ashley\n\"Well, don\u2019t you think one of us has to be, um, levelheaded and emotionally detached to solve whatever the problem is?\" said by Tucker\n\"I don\u2019t have to be unemotional to be effective.\" said by Ashley\n\"Okay. Why don\u2019t you just tell me what\u2019s going on and I\u2013 I promise to be as indignant as you.\" said by Tucker\n\"My brother is blind when it comes to diane. You know, I mean, unwaveringly loyal to her. Jeremy stark basically called her a murderer, but it doesn\u2019t matter to jack, you know, it just strengthens his, uh, devotion to her.\" said by Ashley\n\"[ Laughs ] Sorry.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, you should be sorry, because it affects you.\" said by Ashley\n\"Really? How so?\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah. There\u2019s no point in trying to steal diane and jack\u2019s thunder, their engagement announcement, by saying we\u2019re gonna get engaged. Everybody\u2019s concentrating on phyllis\u2019s death and rightfully so.\" said by Ashley\n\"Get to your point. You think diane caused phyllis\u2019s death?\" said by Jack\n\"No, I don\u2019T. I\u2019m just telling you that the implications are out there.\" said by Billy\n\"Name names. Where these rumors coming from? Jeremy stark, a known criminal with an axe to grind? I\u2019m surprised you of all people would fall for that. Jeremy is blaming diane after mysteriously marrying phyllis, a woman he doesn\u2019t even know! This is insanity.\" said by Jack\n\"I\u2019m sorry you feel that way. I had high hopes for our fake engagement.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah. I was kind of warming up to the idea myself.\" said by Ashley\n\"Hmm.\" said by Tucker\n\"If for no other reason than just to get jack to look in the mirror, realize the stupidity and the absurdity of actually forgiving somebody who\u2019s caused you nothing but pain. I mean, just wreaked havoc in your life and then you do something ridiculous like turning around and marrying that person.\" said by Ashley\n\"I think that person should be insulted at this point, but\u2026\" said by ", "answer": "Tucker"}

From my experience, you have everything you need to be successful at that company.\" said by Adam\n\"And what exactly would that be?\" said by Nate\n\"Well, you have two things going for you. One, you\u2019re not a newman, and two, you\u2019re not intimately intertwined with one. So, you\u2019re in good shape.\" said by Adam\n\"The operation budgets are still way too high.\" said by Victoria\n\"I will find a way to get them down ten percent.\" said by Nikki\n\"15. Oh, my goodness. Am I in the wrong office or did we step back in time on a time machine to when victor newman was ceo?\" said by Victoria\n\"I may be away from the office, but\u2026 I\u2019m still in the ring. Always a contender.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, hello darling. I didn\u2019t know you were going to be here today.\" said by Nikki\n\"I came here to tell you both some good news.\" said by Victor\n\"Oh?\" said by Nikki\n\"I don\u2019t really like the way he\u2019s smiling right now.\" said by Victoria\n\"You\u2019re looking at the new owner of mccall unlimited.\" said by Victor\n\"Oh. Is that all? You scared me for a minute, I thought it was something important.\" said by Victoria\n\"Now, victoria.\" said by Nikki\n\"He knows what I mean. Buying mccall is like buying a\u2013 a horse or, um, a car or like a trendy coffee machine. It\u2019s fun for a minute, but it doesn\u2019t really change the world.\" said by Victoria\n\"And now it begins. The competition, I mean.\" said by Victor\n\"Yes, of course.\" said by Nikki\n\"You know, if you\u2019re still planning on putting adam in charge, that\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s a relief. Because he\u2019s certainly doomed to fail. Thankfully, it\u2019s not gonna be on my watch. So, as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s a win-win situation.\" said by Victoria\n\"Love you, harrison. Hey. How are you feelin\u2019?\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle\u2013\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m sorry, I\u2013 I know I keep asking. It\u2019s only because this isn\u2019t who we are. I don\u2019t even recognize us anymore, and I miss us.\" said by Kyle\n\"I do too. Okay? I\u2019ve been shut down, and I\u2013 I\u2019ve shut you out, and I\u2013 I\u2013 I shouldn\u2019t do that.\" said by Summer\n\"No, but\u2013 but I understand why you would. You need time and space and I wanna give that to you. You know I would do anything for you.\" said by Kyle\n\"I know.\" said by Summer\n\"But you gotta let me in.\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, I\u2013 I know. But right this second, I\u2013 I have to go.\" said by Summer\n\"What? Go where?\" said by Kyle\n\"Wait, first phyllis, and now jeremy stark died? How is that possible? Wait\u2013 wait a minute. How\u2013 how did he die? Was he poisoned?\" said by Jack\n\"I don\u2019t have all the details right now. His body was found in a different jurisdiction.\" said by Chance\n\"So he was on the run. Was it an accident?\" said by Jack\n\"I don\u2019t know. All I know is a fisherman found him washed up on the shore of pheasant lake, that\u2019s it.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, this is some blow to the da\u2019s case against diane. I guess there was somebody out here who wanted stark dead and didn\u2019t mind taking phyllis with him.\" said by Jack\n\"Okay, don\u2019t get ahead of yourself.\" said by Chance\n\"Oh, now you wanna slow things down? You didn\u2019t waste a second arresting my fianc\u00e9. Now, you wanna take some time and look at the facts?\" said by Jack\n\"Nothing has changed. We go where the evidence leads us.\" said by Chance\n\"I knew you were on the wrong track. I told you as much. Take this as a lesson, detective. Things are not always as they seem.\" said by Jack\n\"Hi. You look like hell.\" said by Diane\n\"I\u2019m too much of a gentleman to return the compliment.\" said by Michael\n\"No, no, it\u2019s good. It means you\u2019ve been up all night working on my case.\" said by Diane\n\"That I have.\" said by Michael\n\"Well, that\u2019s what I wanna hear. Now, tell me how the hell we\u2019re getting me out of this mess. Sometimes, the lows of bipolar depression\" said by Diane\n\"Additional sponsorship provided by\u2026\" said by Announcer\n\"I like to think I\u2019m succeeding at newman media because of my own abilities.\" said by Nate\n\"Hm. You definitely are. I didn\u2019t mean to offend you. But you have to admit, some of the big moves that you\u2019ve been making are just an extension of what sally was implementing.\" said by Adam\n\"Hm. It\u2019s good advice.\" said by Adam\n\"Listen, sally was a good fit for newman media. She was doing a good job. And I made a point of telling victoria that.\" said by Nate\n\"Ooh. I\u2019m sure she loved that.\" said by Adam\n\"It was not well taken. But I want you to know that I didn\u2019t go campaigning for this job.\" said by Nate\n\"No, no, don\u2019t\u2013 don\u2019t worry. Sally is much better off out of that snake pit. The constant stress of being under the newman microscope, every decision being challenged, relentlessly questioned. She doesn\u2019t need that. Especially now that she\u2019s pregnant.\" said by Adam\n\"From what I\u2019ve seen, she doesn\u2019t have a thing to worry about. Nick would do all he can to shield her and his baby from too much family scrutiny.\" said by Nate\n\"His baby? Oh. You didn\u2019t know.\" said by Adam\n\"Know what?\" said by Nate\n\"Sally\u2019s beautiful, unborn bundle of joy, she\u2019s mine.\" said by Adam\n\"My darling, you will change your mind once you realize that mccall will give a number of newman divisions a run for their money.\" said by Victor\n\"Okay, well, who doesn\u2019t enjoy a little healthy competition? Bring it on.\" said by Victoria\n\"Mark my word, you\u2019ll be kicking yourself for not buying mccall when you had a chance to do so.\" said by Victor\n\"You\u2019re putting adam in charge, correct? So, if history truly has a way of repeating itself, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re gonna be the one with all of the regrets, daddy.\" said by Victoria\n\"Don\u2019t be so cocky. Adam has changed. As the new head of this big conglomerate, and a baby on the way, he\u2019d have a far greater sense of power. He\u2019d be someone to be reckoned with. I promise you. I love you both. Don\u2019t work too hard.\" said by Victor\n\"He\u2019s gone overboard. He has. Has he forgotten what adam is capable of? He has no idea how hideously this venture is going to fail.\" said by Victoria\n\"You\u2019re disappointed that you lost mccall, aren\u2019t you?\" said by Nikki\n\"No\u2013 [ Scoffing ] I walked away.\" said by Victoria\n\"Because you\u2019re afraid that when your competitor is your father, you\u2019ll never win.\" said by Nikki\n\"The timing of stark\u2019s death is definitely concerning.\" said by Chance\n\"Oh, I\u2019ll say.\" said by Jack\n\"It doesn\u2019t erase all the evidence that points directly to diane, though.\" said by Chance\n\"Oh, I think it puts a rather big question mark on every aspect of the case against diane. Thank you, detective. I\u2019ll be in touch.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Sighing ] Gee. Hey. I\u2019m, uh, I\u2019m sorry. I feel like I\u2019m runnin\u2019 off all your customers.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, if it\u2019s any consolation, I know exactly how you feel.\" said by Sharon\n\"What do you mean?\" said by Chance\n\"Well, you wouldn\u2019t believe how seriously people take their coffee. I mean, it\u2019s gotta be the exact right temperature and the right strength. I mean, demands go on and on.\" said by Sharon\n\"Oh, so now you\u2019re comparing caffeinating the masses to police work, yeah?\" said by Chance\n\"Well, they\u2019re both life and death situations.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, yeah, I guess you\u2019re right. I guess you\u2019re right. But you know what, coffee\u2019s not gonna do it for me right now.\" said by Chance\n\"Hm. Well, you\u2019ve come to the wrong place then.\" said by Sharon\n\"No, I just mean I\u2013 I need somethin\u2019 a little bit more substantial. You know, you did agree to let me take you to dinner sometime. And I know it\u2019s, uh, a bit early, but I think now is the perfect time.\" said by Chance\n\"Michael, I can\u2019t thank you enough for taking my case.\" said by Diane\n\"Thank me when the murder charges are dropped.\" said by Michael\n\"And I can\u2019t imagine what this is costing you.\" said by Diane\n\"I think you\u2019re misunderstanding our business relationship. This is actually costing jack quite a lot.\" said by Michael\n\"No, not financially. I mean it. At least 90 percent of the people in this town wanna see me fry, and I\u2019m sure that includes lauren.\" said by Diane\n\"So, tell me all the evidence they have against me.\" said by Diane\n\"All right, well, we\u2019ll discuss that later. First, you walk me through exactly what happened the night phyllis died. The bad, the ugly, the potentially embarrassing, all of it. Because if you withhold anything from me, even the slightest detail, you can find yourself another lawyer.\" said by Michael\n\"You\u2019re not gonna tell me where you\u2019re going?\" said by Kyle\n\"Do I need to check in with you before I go somewhere? I\u2013 I\u2019m running an errand.\" said by Summer\n\"Wait, let me come with you.\" said by Kyle\n\"That is very unnecessary. Just like it was unnecessary for you to track me down at neil\u2019s jazz lounge and yell at chance.\" said by Summer\n\"Hey, hold on. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s the healthiest thing in the world for you to be hanging out in the place where your mother died.\" said by Kyle\n\"You know what, kyle? My mom was unpredictable. And yeah, she drove me crazy, but we\u2019re a lot alike. So, if I need to mourn her in this crazy, unpredictable way, then you just need to understand that.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay, okay. I get it. Just be careful.\" said by Kyle\n\"Besides, this errand, it could bring us all some closure. I used to wait to run my dishwasher\" said by Summer\n\"There\u2019s a gap in your timeline.\" said by Michael\n\"I have to account for every second the night of the gala?\" said by Diane\n\"You were alone for a period of time between wishing that you could strangle phyllis to death and her collapse in the lounge.\" said by Michael\n\"So, christine wants to prove that I wasn\u2019t putting myself back together after phyllis attacked me. What does she think? That I ran out and grabbed some poison and somehow slipped it into phyllis\u2019s champagne?\" said by Diane\n\"Actually, no. The poison wasn\u2019t in phyllis\u2019s drink, it was found inside of her mask.\" said by Michael\n\"Her mask? I didn\u2019t even know that was possible.\" said by Diane\n\"I mean, why would you? You\u2019re not a murderer. Were you alone at any time in phyllis\u2019s hotel room?\" said by Michael\n\"Yes, then. After everyone left.\" said by Diane\n\"Ah, see, there. There\u2019s your opportunity.\" said by Michael\n\"To what?\" said by Diane\n\"The empty vial of poison was found in that suite.\" said by Michael\n\"Michael, that doesn\u2019t make any sense. How could I run out and get some poison in the amount of time that it took me to brush my hair and put on some lipstick? W\u2013 what\u2019s that?\" said by Diane\n\"It is an online receipt. According to this, you purchased the toxin online a few days before the gala.\" said by Michael\n\"What? Absolutely not.\" said by Diane\n\"You know, using your credit card.\" said by Michael\n\"Michael, I didn\u2019t do that.\" said by Diane\n\"A crime of passion is one thing, but christine\u2019s gonna try to say that this was premeditated. That you had a plan.\" said by Michael\n\"The only thing on my mind before the gala was jack announcing our engagement. I didn\u2019t buy any poison! Online or otherwise. Michael, look at me. I am telling you the truth. I had nothing to do with phyllis\u2019s death. Find jeremy stark. He\u2019s the one behind all of this.\" said by Diane\n\"All right, all right, I\u2019ll find everybody. But it won\u2019t be pretty, and it won\u2019t be easy.\" said by Michael\n\"Well, do whatever\u2019s necessary.\" said by Diane\n\"Christine\u2019s gonna have your family testify against you.\" said by Michael\n\"I know.\" said by Diane\n\"I saw you and phyllis fighting. They heard you threaten phyllis\u2019s life.\" said by Michael\n\"Jack and kyle will understand. They\u2019ll downplay it and explain the extenuating circumstances. They\u2019ll do everything they can to help.\" said by Diane\n\"And what about summer?\" said by Michael\n\"Summer will do everything she can to see that I spend the rest of my life behind bars.\" said by Diane\n\"Give me two minutes. Can you do that? Just talk to me. What\u2019s going to bring us closure?\" said by Kyle\n\"Answers. That\u2019s what I need. That\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s gonna bring me any peace or quiet\u2013\" said by Summer\n\"I want that too. I want morning espressos at our place in milan and harrison correcting our italian. We were so happy.\" said by Kyle\n\"Are you saying that we should just run off to italy to escape our problems? I\u2013\" said by Summer\n\"I meant what I said at the door last night, summer. And I know you heard me. I meant every word. No matter what happens, you and I will always belong together. I don\u2019t care how long it takes, I\u2019m not going anywhere.\" said by Kyle\n\"Answers, kyle. That\u2019s what I need, and then we can work on us.\" said by Summer\n\"Dad.\" said by Kyle\n\"Hi.\" said by Jack\n\"What\u2019s wrong, jack?\" said by Summer\n\"It\u2019s stark. He\u2019s dead.\" said by Jack\n\"Darling, whether you admit it or not, I know you\u2019re still smarting for losing mccall to your father.\" said by Nikki\n\"Yes, it would\u2019ve been nice to add mccall, but having adam tethered to it made the idea untenable.\" said by Victoria\n\"I totally agree with you. You made the right decision.\" said by Nikki\n\"Unfortunately, now I have to live with adam lording it over me until his predictable demise.\" said by Victoria\n\"Hm. Well, this acquisition is gonna be big news. Lots of fanfare. Press releases.\" said by Nikki\n\"Yeah, I know. I\u2019m sure dad\u2019s gonna wanna make a big splash to help adam.\" said by Victoria\n\"Might be a good time to get away.\" said by Nikki\n\"What do you mean? Like, as in a vacation?\" said by Victoria\n\"Well sure, why not? You know, take a few days for yourself. Just relax a little bit.\" said by Nikki\n\"Well, I do have that trip to los angeles coming up.\" said by Victoria\n\"No. That is for business.\" said by Nikki\n\"I know that, mom, but I could add a few days for vacation. I mean, you and I both know that I would probably turn it into back-to-back meetings, but for me that\u2019s fun. And I promise you, I would get a massage and I would see the ocean. I mean, it would probably be from a window, but I would see it.\" said by Victoria\n\"You are only happy when you\u2019re multitasking, just like your father.\" said by Nikki\n\"Mom, that\u2019s not true. I know how to squeeze in a little r and r from time to time. Just ask nate. He\u2019ll back me up on that. (Music throughout) Harry and david makes mother\u2019s day easy.

Share more.\" said by Victoria\n\"Sharon, this was your choice?\" said by Chance\n\"I know, I know. Don\u2019t say it.\" said by Sharon\n\"I mean, we could\u2019ve gone anywhere in town and this was your choice?\" said by Chance\n\"How was I supposed to know that the dining room was closed for a private event?\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, who knows? Maybe you\u2019ll have an epiphany while you\u2019re here.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, I understand congratulations are in order.\" said by Victor\n\"For what?\" said by Adam\n\"You\u2019re having a daughter.\" said by Victor\n\"That\u2019s right. How\u2019d you find out?\" said by Adam\n\"Your brother told me.\" said by Victor\n\"Hm.\" said by Adam\n\"How nice, man. Makes me very happy.\" said by Victor\n\"Sally and I, we are\u2013 we are very happy.\" said by Adam\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Victor\n\"But I also know that you don\u2019t care for her, so I\u2019m not really buying how pleased you are about the situation.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, I gotta tell you, another newman. She\u2019ll live to be in the next century, be a shaker and a mover, innovate things. Makes me very happy. It really does. Okay? I have some news of my own.\" said by Victor\n\"All right. Let\u2019s hear it.\" said by Adam\n\"I bought mccall unlimited. I\u2019m the new owner. And you will start working there tomorrow morning.\" said by Victor\n\"You bought mccall?\" said by Adam\n\"I bought mccall. For you, your sons, your daughter. It\u2019s a legacy that will go on forever.\" said by Victor\n\"Wow, that, um, that escalated quickly.\" said by Adam\n\"What do you mean by that?\" said by Victor\n\"My new baby with sally. It went from potential embarrassment to now being used as leverage to get me to take a job. Makes me wanna avoid mccall altogether.\" said by Adam\n\"The only thing that will bring summer some semblance of peace is clearing your name, and hopefully in the process, discovering the person responsible for her death.\" said by Michael\n\"Which seems close to impossible now that I see this evidence.\" said by Diane\n\"Including, but not limited to, trying to explain the fact that an unconscious phyllis was holding your engagement ring.\" said by Michael\n\"Oh, no, no, that was in jack\u2019s pocket. And then jeremy bumped into him on the dance floor and he must\u2019ve taken it.\" said by Diane\n\"You have no proof of that.\" said by Michael\n\"Well, no, because it was all happening so fast, and there were a lot of people.\" said by Diane\n\"Okay, okay, we can revisit that. Right now, we have to discuss what might be the most damaging piece of evidence against you, provided by me.\" said by Michael\n\"Yeah, stark\u2019s death definitely adds a whole new layer of mystery to all of this.\" said by Jack\n\"Summer? Hey, hey, are you all right?\" said by Kyle\n\"I guess I\u2019m just gonna have to live with all of these questions going unanswered. I\u2013 I\u2019ve gotta go.\" said by Summer\n\"Hey, can you stay for a little while? We can talk about this.\" said by Kyle\n\"I don\u2019t want to talk about jeremy stark. He\u2019s a disgusting, manipulative criminal who tricked my mom into marrying him and probably had something to do with her murder. I\u2019ve gotta go.\" said by Summer\n\"Hey, let me go with you.\" said by Kyle\n\"No. I am going by myself. I\u2019ll call you.\" said by Summer\n\"Uh, what\u2019s going on with her?\" said by Jack\n\"Wish I knew. If you\u2019ve had sensitivity, those zingers can really cause\" said by Kyle\n\"The young and the restless will continue.\" said by Announcer\n\"So, nate, tell me something. Do you think victoria has the ability to relax outside the work environment?\" said by Nikki\n\"I say she\u2019s the boss. And if she says she has that ability, then I say she does too.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh boy, it\u2019s disappointing to hear you kiss up to her like that.\" said by Nikki\n\"I mean it. I\u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say it if it wasn\u2019t true. Victoria is a great boss. And she wouldn\u2019t be where she is today if she didn\u2019t excel at prioritizing or having impeccable instincts.\" said by Nate\n\"Fine. There\u2019s no point in talking to you when you\u2019re going to team up against me.\" said by Nikki\n\"Nose to the grindstone.\" said by Victoria\n\"And on that note, I shall leave you. Buzz me if you need me.\" said by Nikki\n\"Thank you, mom. So, what brings you by?\" said by Victoria\n\"I was hoping we can go over some ideas I had for langston, but if you\u2019re busy, I can wait.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, one second. Hey. Would you, um, make sure that all of the contracts are uploaded for the whitsett meeting? Thanks. So, you were saying?\" said by Victoria\n\"What\u2019s goin\u2019 on? Whitsett?\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, yes. Um, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m headed to L.A. For a shopping spree.\" said by Victoria\n\"Ah, rodeo drive?\" said by Nate\n\"No, I\u2019m just in the mood for something a little bigger.

Look, on the other hand, if phyllis used my son as some kind of ploy to get me alone, I would flip, too, especially if i thought harrison was sick or in trouble.

I will continue my rounds as a good samaritan.\" said by Audra\n\"Actually, that is my nephew kyle\u2019s phone.\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, great. Yeah. Thanks. Um, I will get it to him. I\u2019ve actually been looking for a reason to make kyle abbott\u2019s acquaintance.\" said by Audra\n\"Huh. Bye.

I\u2019ve been here 30 seconds and she wants to put me to work already.\" said by Gina\n\"Of course.\" said by Lauren\n\"Okay, well, then that settles it. The next reunion is gonna be at my place out west.\" said by Gina\n\"Yes.\" said by Lauren\n\"Ooh!\" said by Michael\n\"Yes, yes!

Can I borrow my son for a second?\" said by Danny\n\"Uh, yes, of course. I will get some champagne.\" said by Lily\n\"Thank you.\" said by Daniel\n\"I put up with you because it\u2019s easier now that there are no lingering feelings and no expectations or disappointments. We\u2019re just free to enjoy our friendship with one another. Having a child with someone is, um, a lot different. It\u2019s very, very complicated. You end up having to rely on each other in a lot of different ways, and I know you ran into some difficulties in co-parenting with chelsea.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah. Especially recently. I mean, before her incident.\" said by Adam\n\"But you overcame those difficulties because of your mutual love for connor, and I think that that will extend to your respect and care for each other.\" said by Sharon\n\"It, uh \u2014 it did. It does for chelsea, but that doesn\u2019t mean the same thing\u2019s gonna happen with me and sally.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, once your baby\u2019s born, I think your connection will get stronger because you have your child\u2019s best interests at heart. You\u2019ll share that in common. At least, that\u2019s what\u2019s happened in my experience.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, I hope you are right. But I\u2019m not sure that anything\u2019s gonna change for sally.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay, so, I almost feel like a part of genoa city, but then I\u2019m here like this.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah. Gorgeous. I get it. It is quite a burden.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Chuckles ] No, the baby bump. I feel like everyone is staring, and I can\u2019t have a drink. And to be completely honest with you, I am absolutely starving.\" said by Sally\n\"Then let\u2019s get out of here, go grab a cheeseburger.\" said by Nick\n\"Okay, you\u2019ve never been hotter.\" said by Sally\n\"Excuse me? Uh, kyle abbott? I found this on the bar. Your aunt told me it was yours.\" said by Audra\n\"I just realized I had lost it. Thank you\u2026?\" said by Kyle\n\"Audra charles.\" said by Audra\n\"Nice to meet you.\" said by Kyle\n\"Likewise.\" said by Audra\n\"Hi. What\u2019s going on here?\" said by Summer\n\"Uh, this is audra. She found my phone.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah, I know who she is. You\u2019re the woman who emotionally destroyed my brother.\" said by Summer\n\"[ Stammers ] Noah and I, um\u2026 it was a complicated situation.\" said by Audra\n\"Thanks for the phone.\" said by Summer\n\"Uh\u2026 [ Sighs ] I did get your text.\" said by Kyle\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Jack\n\"I\u2019m sorry I doubted you.\" said by Kyle\n\"Tensions were high. I \u2014 I understand.\" said by Diane\n\"I owe you an apology, too. You walked right into phyllis\u2019s lion\u2019s den thinking you were protecting kyle. And I let my fear lead me to doubt your intentions. And I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m sorry. And it won\u2019t happen again.\" said by Jack\n\"It\u2019s okay.\" said by Daniel\n\"If you can find it in yourself to forgive me, I\u2019d like to announce our engagement tonight.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Chuckles ] No forgiveness necessary.\" said by Diane\n\"Excuse me, everyone. Could I have your attention, please? Could you all find your way to the lounge? I have some fun news I want to share with you.\" said by Jack\n\"I can\u2019t find the ring.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Chuckles ] Compliments on your little scuffle with diane.

Oh, what about rj being home? I mean, am I happy? Yeah, why?\" said by Taylor\n\"I mean, look he\u2019s\u2013 I know that you\u2013 you like him, he\u2019s a good kid. Got no issue with him.\" said by Thomas\n\"Of course not, honey. I mean, come on, he\u2019s\u2013 he\u2019s ridge\u2019s son, he\u2019s your brother.\" said by Taylor\n\"Half-brother.\" said by Thomas\n\"Whatever. He\u2019s family.\" said by Taylor\n\"Right.\" said by Thomas\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Taylor\n\"Dad and brooke created him together.\" said by Thomas\n\"You mean they\u2013\" said by Taylor\n\"Oh my god.\" said by Thomas\n\"Is that how conception works?\" said by Taylor\n\"Haha, mom, I\u2019m just saying that him being back, it could change all the dynamics.\" said by Thomas\n\"Maybe, I don\u2019t know. How do you feel?\" said by Taylor\n\"Hope, you\u2019ve been seriously killing it. The line is so hot right now, not to mention all the philanthropy it\u2019s generating.\" said by Rj\n\"Aw, thank you, rj. That\u2019s so sweet and thank you for letting me run ideas by you.\" said by Hope\n\"Ah-ha! So, you\u2019ve been paying attention to the family business after all.\" said by Ridge\n\"Oh, let me guess, your dad is already trying to recruit you to work here.\" said by Hope\n\"His father would like nothing more.\" said by Brooke\n\"No, all I\u2019m saying is that, you know, your sister and I, we run this joint, so we can probably find you a nice table next to donna and pam.\" said by Ridge\n\"Liam, I understand you wanting reassurance about thomas and trust me, it wasn\u2019t easy for me to forgive him too, I was upset.\" said by Steffy\n\"I was hesitant. But, I saw how important it was to taylor and the family, so I sucked it up and I\u2019m glad I did.\" said by Finn\n\"Yeah, me too, and it\u2019s nice having thomas back in our lives. Look, I wouldn\u2019t have forgiven him if I didn\u2019t truly believe he\u2019d changed.\" said by Steffy\n\"I know, I know, I know, I just\u2013 I wish it were that simple for me.\" said by Liam\n\"I\u2026\" said by Steffy\n\"Okay, I know it\u2019s more complicated for you, liam, but, uh, I gotta work.\" said by Finn\n\"Yeah, yeah I gotta get to the office too so, uh.\" said by Steffy\n\"Why don\u2019t you, uh, call me about this later?\" said by Finn\n\"Okay, I\u2019ll call you. I love you.\" said by Steffy\n\"All right. Have a good day.\" said by Finn\n\"I\u2013 I don\u2019t want to put you on the spot, I swear. The problem is that I trust you. You\u2019re telling me thomas is improving, he\u2019s really working on himself, he\u2019s making great strides, okay, cool. What\u2019s the degree, though? Like, uh, like how much of a change are we talking about? Is this a radical change? Is this enough of a change that I don\u2019t have to worry about him working with my wife all day and all night?\" said by Liam\n\"I feel like I kinda asked you first, but okay, fine. How do I feel about rj being back? I\u2019m happy, I am\u2013 I am\u2013 okay here, I am happy that brooke and ridge have their son back home.\" said by Taylor\n\"Are you though, really?\" said by Thomas\n\"Yes! Am I happy that they have their son back home? Of course, I am! I mean, I know what it was like, you know, when I was away from you, thousands of miles away. It\u2019s A\u2026 it\u2019s a terrible feeling, you know? And rj, rj left home when he was so young, you know. He was probably like, what, this big? And now, he\u2019s probably, like, this big?\" said by Taylor\n\"Kinda like this big. He\u2019s like\u2013 he\u2019s big. He\u2019s almost out of school!\" said by Thomas\n\"You know what, babies are always gonna be our babies and you\u2019re gonna feel the same way about douglas when he gets older. I mean, I\u2026 I look at you and I cannot believe how old you are.\" said by Taylor\n\"Thanks.\" said by Thomas\n\"Come on, if you\u2019re old, then I\u2019m ancient. Come on, it\u2019s gonna be nice to see your half-brother.\" said by Taylor\n\"Yeah, it is. It\u2019ll be great and I\u2019m\u2013 and I\u2019m looking forward to catching up with him.\" said by Thomas\n\"Good, I mean, I think there\u2019s going to be a lot to catch up on, I\u2013 I do. And hopefully you and steffy are going to be able to spend a lot of time with him, you know? It\u2019s important. Um, don\u2019t think I don\u2019t notice you are still dodging the question.\" said by Taylor\n\"Yeah, I\u2026 I do seem nervous. I\u2013 I\u2013 I know that there are some factors at play here and you\u2019re wondering how I feel about rj being back and if, um, if I think his presence is gonna get ridge and brooke back together and I would say\u2026 probably so.\" said by Taylor\n\"I\u2019m only kidding! You wanna come work here, you get your own office and we\u2019ll put \u201crj\u201d or \u201cridge jr.\u201d Or\u2013 or \u201cmr. Forrester\u201d on the door.\" said by Ridge\n\"Well, now that\u2019s a pretty sweet deal, rj.\" said by Brooke\n\"It is and I\u2019ll make it even sweeter. You know what? Own parking spot, next to mine.\" said by Ridge\n\"You\u2019re crackin\u2019 me up.\" said by Rj\n\"What?\" said by Ridge\n\"You\u2019ve\u2013 you\u2019ve gone from offering me an internship to just, like, handing me the keys to the company.\" said by Rj\n\"I\u2019m not a good negotiator, everybody knows that.\" said by Ridge\n\"No offence, dad, but come on, you know how I feel. This is a fashion house, forrester creations. It\u2019s a company that granddad and grandma built from the ground up. One that mom helped innovate, one that you and steffy have been running like pros and that\u2019s awesome and I\u2019m proud of this place and everything you guys have accomplished but\u2026 I really wanna try to do my own thing, you know? Establish my own identity.\" said by Rj\n\"By being an influencer?\" said by Ridge\n\"Yeah, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m building my brand. I\u2019ve got a lot of followers. I\u2019ve\u2013 mom, hope, can you please back me up on this?\" said by Rj\n\"He does have a ton of followers. He is doing quite well.\" said by Hope\n\"Yes, he is. Gosh, so much pressure, right? Sorry, honey. Will you stop, please? Don\u2019t drive our son away before he\u2019s even spent one night here. \u2013 They get it.\" said by Brooke\n\"Here.\" said by Steffy\n\"Thank you. Here\u2019s the thing, you\u2019re just\u2013 you\u2019re the only person I know who is both close to thomas and at least capable of being objective about him.\" said by Liam\n\"Liam, I wouldn\u2019t lie to you. If I had any misgivings about thomas, if I doubted him, then I wouldn\u2019t have accepted his apology. I wouldn\u2019t have rehired him at forrester. Remember, we were not in a good place.\" said by Steffy\n\"Oh, I do remember.\" said by Liam\n\"I blame thomas for taking away my parents\u2019 chance at a future together.\" said by Steffy\n\"As you should have.\" said by Liam\n\"And we hit a rough patch and I honestly didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be able to trust him again.\" said by Steffy\n\"So, what\u2013 what now? Is it\u2013 is it just that you, like, feel it in your bones? I mean, you sure you\u2019re not caving into pressure because it\u2019s the sisterly thing to do?\" said by Liam\n\"I truly believe thomas is a different person.\" said by Steffy\n\"Really? Like, what\u2013 so, what made the difference for you?\" said by Liam\n\"I know my brother. I know when he\u2019s struggling and I can sense when there\u2019s something to be concerned about. And right now, all I feel is\u2026 his calmness, his humility, his determination. Thomas is not hung up on hope anymore. He is focused on being a dedicated father and a designer and my father and my mother sees it too. I gotta tell you, it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s really a wonderful time for our family.\" said by Steffy\n\"Okay, so, you\u2013 you do think that rj being back in town could bring dad and brooke back together?\" said by Thomas\n\"There is no doubt in my mind.\" said by Taylor\n\"And you\u2019re\u2013 you\u2019re, what? You\u2019re just cool with that?\" said by Thomas\n\"I am\u2013 I am\u2013 I am\u2013 I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m indifferent? I don\u2019T\u2026 you know, they\u2013 they share a child together and\u2026\" said by Taylor\n\"Yeah, dad shares multiple children with you.\" said by Thomas\n\"Oh\u2013 oh, yes and\u2026 this isn\u2019t just about sharing a child, obviously. You know, there\u2026 brooke and ridge are gonna wanna spend time together with the family and\u2013 and, because that\u2019s what families do and\u2013 and you and steffy are gonna be a part of that. And you know what? I\u2019d even be able to have some big, crazy dinner with both families, which could be kinda fun.\" said by Taylor\n\"Okay.\" said by Thomas\n\"Come on. We can put the \u201cfun\u201d in dysfunctional.\" said by Taylor\n\"Mm.\" said by Thomas\n\"It\u2019ll be really good to see rj.\" said by Taylor\n\"Okay, yeah, well as much fun as we could have, um, this could still cause you a lot of pain.\" said by Thomas\n\"I trust my friendship with brooke and all I care about is honesty and transparency from her when it comes to ridge because that\u2019s what our pact is. Friends first.\" said by Taylor\n\"Ooh, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re back, I just don\u2019t wanna let you go.\" said by Brooke\n\"Mom, I don\u2019t think he can breathe.\" said by Hope\n\"Oh, I\u2019m not squeezing too tight, am I honey?\" said by Brooke\n\"No, no, you\u2019re fine, mom. I\u2019d be lying if I said I didn\u2019t miss your hugs.\" said by Rj\n\"Oh, my sweet boy.\" said by Brooke\n\"Also, we have a gym here at forrester, I don\u2019t know if you knew that.\" said by Ridge\n\"Yes, I know we have a gym, dad.\" said by Rj\n\"It\u2019s open 24 hours. You could take pictures of yourself in the mirror, doing whatever you guys do.\" said by Ridge\n\"That\u2019s very funny, dad, but, you know, that\u2019s not really my kinda thing. That\u2019s a nice pose though.\" said by Rj\n\"Thank you and we could work out, once a month or whatever, you know, you think is appropriate.\" said by Ridge\n\"Okay, you know what? He only just got home and I don\u2019t think we should be pushing so hard to get him to work here just yet. I don\u2019t want him feeling cornered, so\u2013\" said by Hope\n\"No, it\u2019s okay, I don\u2019t feel cornered. I know my dad\u2019s just lookin\u2019 out for me.\" said by Rj\n\"I am looking out for him, that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\" said by Ridge\n\"Okay.\" said by Hope\n\"Also looking out for the company a little bit because I know how talented you are and you could help us.\" said by Ridge\n\"Thank you, dad. That\u2019s high praise coming from you, actually. I really appreciate it, but\u2026 I mean, I don\u2019t know, I\u2013 I just, I really wanna try to do my own thing, you know?\" said by Rj\n\"Well, I hope that doing your thing will bring you back to this office, working with me. Martial arts is my passion.\" said by Ridge\n\"I don\u2019t wanna talk about me anymore, I wanna talk about you and how you feel about ridge jr. Being home.\" said by Taylor\n\"Okay, look, I don\u2019t exactly know what you mean. Like, how do I feel about what?\" said by Thomas\n\"How do you\u2013 thomas. How do you feel about your half-brother being home?\" said by Taylor\n\"I don\u2019t know. Good, I guess? Look, it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s not like we, uh, hang out all the time and like you adorably pointed out, um, I am much older than him, like really old apparently.\" said by Thomas\n\"Super old.\" said by Taylor\n\"But at least not ancient. Okay look, and especially after everything that\u2019s gone down recently\u2026 I don\u2019t know, look, I\u2019m sure that we\u2019ll get together and we will bury the hatchet.\" said by Thomas\n\"Hm, I think that\u2019s a good idea and there is no time like the present. Come on, let\u2019s go.\" said by Taylor\n\"Why do you have to be so pushy?\" said by Thomas\n\"Uh, have you met me? Come on, let\u2019s go, age before beauty.\" said by Taylor\n\"Ancient before old.\" said by Thomas\n\"Oh, my god, you did not.\" said by Taylor\n\"Yup.\" said by Thomas\n\"Come, thomas, let\u2019s go. Come on!\" said by Taylor\n\"Don\u2019t feel bad for having reservations.\" said by Steffy\n\"Huh, reservations. That\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s, uh, diplomatic, especially when hope\u2019s spending her entire work day with thomas, well into the night.\" said by Liam\n\"Well they\u2019re\u2013 they\u2019re creating a line, that\u2019s what designers do and there\u2019s a lot of pressure to perform.\" said by Steffy\n\"I know. You know what? You\u2019re\u2013 I\u2013 I know that, you\u2019re right. I\u2019m proud of hope\u2019s career, I want to be supportive, I want her to succeed. It\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s just that when it comes to thomas specifically, she\u2026 I don\u2019t wanna talk this to death and\u2013 and hope knows how I feel.\" said by Liam\n\"Your opinion has changed?\" said by Steffy\n\"I can\u2019t really put my finger on it, I just\u2026 I started thinking maybe it\u2019s not just thomas. Maybe there\u2019s something\u2026 with hope that keeps bringing her back to him.\" said by Liam\n\"Door is always open.\" said by Ridge\n\"I think he gets the picture, ridge.\" said by Brooke\n\"Yeah, loud and clear.\" said by Hoep\n\"What he doesn\u2019t get is that he was given a talent. Same talent that your grandfather has and thomas, zende, sometimes me. It\u2019s a gift, you can create things. But you have something else and that could make you the best out of all of us because you inherited your mom\u2019s brain.\" said by Ridge\n\"Okay, ridge is right there.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah.\" said by Ridge\n\"You got the best of both worlds and while I don\u2019t want to add to the arm-twisting by ridge sr. Over here, working here does have its perks.\" said by Hope\n\"Oh, no, there\u2019s no doubt about that. The work you guys do here is amazing and it\u2019s known worldwide, I mean\u2026 I\u2019m not gonna lie too, it has opened some doors for me but\u2026 I just, I wanna try to pave my own way, whatever that is.\" said by Rj\n\"Oh, my gosh, there he is.\" said by Taylor\n\"Taylor, hey!\" said by Rj\n\"Hey. Wow, look at you, it\u2019s wonderful to see you!\" said by Taylor\n\"It\u2019s great to see you too. Thomas.\" said by Rj\n\"Little brother. It\u2019s good to see you. I missed you.\" said by Thomas\n\"It\u2019s good to see you too. I, uh, I was just sayin\u2019 how I\u2019ve been keeping up with hope for the future. Dude, incredible work, truly. You\u2019ve\u2013 you\u2019ve really developed into a world-class designer.\" said by Rj\n\"Thanks, man. I appreciate that.\" said by Thomas\n\"But, uh, I do believe your success is because you take after dad.\" said by Rj\n\"Our weird, mischievous father.\" said by Thomas\n\"What\u2013 what is that? Where\u2019s that comin\u2019 from? There\u2019s nothin\u2019 weird about me. I created the two of you, right?\" said by Ridge\n\"That\u2019s a good point, yeah sure.\" said by Thomas\n\"It\u2019s not a question, it\u2019s a great point!\" said by Ridge\n\"Sure, yeah.\" said by ", "answer": "Thomas"}
{"content": "\"Well, we should head back to my place for the rest of our date while your mommies are out on their date.\" said by Sharon\n\"Cute, aw.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, hey. Have you seen aria since she first came home? You won\u2019t believe how big she\u2019s gotten. And I didn\u2019t think it was possible, but she\u2019s even gotten cuter too.\" said by Sharon\n\"Look at her. Hi, cutie. Oh, how am I going to do this?\" said by Adam\n\"Do what?\" said by Sharon\n\"Uh, you\u2019ve raised boys and girls. I\u2019ve only raised a son. I don\u2019t know how to be a girl dad.\" said by Adam\n\"Hey.\" said by Nick\n\"Son, join me.\" said by Victor\n\"Um, yeah, I was just coming by to pick up some food to, uh, have a little guys night with christian.\" said by Nick\n\"That age, they\u2019re quite a handful. That\u2019s not gonna stop soon. But I applaud your parenting skills, son.\" said by Victor\n\"Let\u2019s, uh, let\u2019s talk about your parenting skills.\" said by Nick\n\"What does that mean?\" said by Victor\n\"Referring to another one of your children.\" said by Nick\n\"If this deal goes through, it will be a game changer.\" said by Nate\n\"Yes. What\u2013 are you having doubts? I mean, we completely killed that pitch in L.A. I have no doubt in my mind that this is happening.\" said by Victoria\n\"We were persuasive. I just wanna make sure we\u2019re paying attention to the deal points. Not let any of the details get lost in our excitement over the acquisition.\" said by Nate\n\"I would never let that happen, nor would my legal team. I haven\u2019t gotten where I am right now because I lose sight of the end game, which is why I generally get what I want.\" said by Victoria\n\"It is your superpower.\" said by Nate\n\"That was a complete 180.\" said by Victoria\n\"That was elena, uh, letting me know what storage facility I should send her things to.\" said by Nate\n\"I like the vibe of this place.\" said by Tucker\n\"I do too. Everything from the decor to the music. The drinks are great. It\u2019s a perfect place to just forget about what\u2019s going on in the outside world and just relax.\" said by Ashley\n\"It really is. And we should cheers abby for that because she had a lot to do with it.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, well, I may have contributed a little bit.\" said by Abby\n\"If you\u2019re your mother\u2019s daughter, then you did more than contribute. You controlled every step.\" said by Tucker\n\"Busted.\" said by Abby\n\"We\u2019re having so much fun. Let\u2019s not talk about that minefield, please.\" said by Ashley\n\"Ooh.\" said by Abby\n\"You know.\" said by Ashley\n\"Ugh. Abby, may I have this dance?\" said by Tucker\n\"Hmm. Me?

I was looking for jack.\" said by Chance\n\"Uh, I just got here. I\u2013 I don\u2019t know where he is. Can I help you? Has there been news?\" said by Summer\n\"Well, I was hoping he could answer that for me. Yeah. I got a cryptic call from him. He said he found a new development in the search to find phyllis alive. You know anything about that? Oh\" said by Chance\n\"Additional sponsorship provided by. Eggland\u2019s best.\" said by Announcer\n\"Jack said he found evidence that my mom is alive? Did he say what it was?\" said by Summer\n\"He didn\u2019t say exactly what. Something about dna.\" said by Chance\n\"Wow. That would be definitive proof, right?\" said by Summer\n\"Well, christine thinks it\u2019s just a bluff. Some way to support michael\u2019s defense strategy. I mean, we\u2019re dubious at best.\" said by Chance\n\"Sounds like you still think that my brother is lying about seeing our mom.\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m trying to keep an open mind. But like I said, if this is a ploy, this is extremely unfair for you and I would hate for somebody to get your hopes up for no reason.\" said by Chance\n\"You don\u2019t have to worry about protecting my feelings about this anymore.\" said by Summer\n\"Why\u2019s that?\" said by Chance\n\"Because it\u2019s true.\" said by Summer\n\"And when exactly did you decide that?\" said by Chance\n\"Babies are babies. Boy or girl, really makes no difference. I mean, beyond the basics. Feeding them, rocking them to sleep and changing their diaper, they just want you to smile at them and talk to them and sing to them and love them. And you know how to do that. And the rest of it, you just figure out as they grow up.\" said by Sharon\n\"Oh, I hope that is true.\" said by Adam\n\"You sound doubtful.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, having a girl, I have been thinking a lot about my mom. And I want my daughter to inherit some of hope\u2019s intelligence and strength along with sally\u2019s incredible soul.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, what about you?\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, with any luck, nothing.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, come on. You must have some good qualities.\" said by Sharon\n\"Maybe my chin and my impeccable sense of timing.\" said by Adam\n\"All right. Where\u2019s this coming from? You are always a good dad to connor.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yep. It\u2019s easier. He\u2019s a boy. You know, I start with the obvious, just don\u2019t be like me or my father.\" said by Adam\n\"I think you\u2019re selling yourself short. You\u2019ll be just as good of a dad to a baby girl.\" said by Sharon\n\"I agree. Oh, I haven\u2019t seen this little nugget since mariah and tessa first brought her home.\" said by Sally\n\"That\u2019s right. You two were here that day. Well, I get the pleasure of babysitting her tonight while her moms are out on their first official date.\" said by Sharon\n\"Hm. Oh, well, as hard as it is to resist aria\u2019s siren call, I have some mccall business that I have to take care of.\" said by Adam\n\"He\u2019s not very good at fake texting.\" said by Sharon\n\"It\u2019s me. I\u2019m afraid I have made things awkward between us.\" said by Sally\n\"Oh, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not all you and\u2013 and you too will just figure out the co-parenting puzzle.\" said by Sharon\n\"Man, he\u2019s really right about her magnetism. I can\u2019t take my eyes off her. She\u2019s adorable.\" said by Sally\n\"Isn\u2019t she?\" said by Sharon\n\"I take it mom hasn\u2019t told you that vic and nate are now involved?\" said by Nick\n\"Okay.\" said by Victor\n\"That\u2019s it? You don\u2019t sound surprised or overly concerned.\" said by Nick\n\"Are you?\" said by Victor\n\"Yes, I am. It\u2019s wrong on many different levels. I mean, this guy went from chief of surgery to now running newman media in how much time? He tried and failed to take over his own family\u2019s company and now he\u2019s here. He\u2019s got this thing with vic. It\u2019s not right. It\u2019s not safe for her, dad, or newman enterprises.\" said by Nick\n\"So how do you feel about elena moving out and moving on?\" said by Victoria\n\"Like I said, it was inevitable. We had grown in different directions, had different priorities.\" said by Nate\n\"That doesn\u2019t make it easy.\" said by Victoria\n\"I\u2019m not gonna say I don\u2019t feel responsible for what happened because I do. Sometimes, the guilt is intense.\" said by Nate\n\"You know, we\u2019ve talked about this before. Sometimes when relationships fail, it\u2019s not usually just one person\u2019s fault.\" said by Victoria\n\"It\u2019s true. We drifted apart once I left my job at the hospital. Once we didn\u2019t have that in common, it was tough. That bond was a big part of our relationship.\" said by Nate\n\"Yes, exactly. People change, they grow in different directions. You can\u2019t blame yourself for that.\" said by Victoria\n\"But I gotta own that I cheated on her. And I feel awful for the pain that I caused her. And now that people are starting to find out about us breaking up, that wound is gonna keep getting reopened. There are gonna be questions about why.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, yes. And when people find out that I am the why, does that mean you\u2019re gonna change your mind about us?\" said by Victoria\n\"Absolutely not. My mind\u2019s made up. My a1c was up here; now, it\u2019s down with rybelsus.\" said by Nate\n\"So, anyone who questions why you and elena broke up, that\u2019s gonna be your response?\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, these lips can be persuasive.\" said by Nate\n\"Very.\" said by Victoria\n\"Look, I\u2019m not proud of how things went down with elena, but that\u2019s for me to work out. I don\u2019t want you to think I hold you responsible.\" said by Nate\n\"Mm. I\u2019m a little\u2013 little bit responsible.\" said by Victoria\n\"For being irresistible.\" said by Nate\n\"Do you wanna get outta here? Let\u2019s go get a drink.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah.\" said by Nate\n\"All right.\" said by Victoria\n\"Gosh, I never imagined in a million years I\u2019d see them on a dance floor together. I\u2019ll tell you this.\" said by Devon\n\"[ Laughs ] I know.\" said by Ashley\n\"I am surprised that you\u2019re out so late and dancing nonetheless.\" said by Abby\n\"Are you insinuating that I\u2019m old?\" said by Tucker\n\"No, I\u2019m just saying, I don\u2019t know. I mean, you were at dominic\u2019s music class. I thought maybe you\u2019d be exhausted.\" said by Abby\n\"Mm. It\u2019s true that spending time with my grandson is a new experience for me. But, uh, all that kid energy really invigorated me.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, spend a week with dominic banging on one of those little drums and we\u2019ll see how you feel about it.\" said by Abby\n\"Is that a challenge from you? I\u2019m game. I would not take a second of it for granted.\" said by Tucker\n\"We\u2019ll see.\" said by Abby\n\"Abby, I know you\u2019re not too keen on me spending any time with your boy or your mother for that matter.\" said by Tucker\n\"Can you blame me?\" said by Abby\n\"No. It\u2019s nice you\u2019re so protective. It\u2019s also nice that you\u2019re willing to tolerate me for the people you love. Even just having a dance with me.\" said by Tucker\n\"You\u2019re flattery is transparent.\" said by Abby\n\"I wish there was some way to convince you, like I\u2019m trying to do with your mother, but I have changed.\" said by Tucker\n\"Look, I am out here and I am dancing with you. That\u2019s a big step. So don\u2019t get greedy.\" said by Abby\n\"Well, I\u2019m a man who does not give up easily when he wants something.\" said by Tucker\n\"Something or in this case, someone, my mother.\" said by Abby\n\"Mm-hmm. Who I love.\" said by Tucker\n\"Okay. I think I\u2019m not ready to hear declarations like that, um.\" said by Abby\n\"I guess, uh, she didn\u2019t tell you that I proposed to her either then.\" said by Tucker\n\"Bellinis and caviar. How decadent.\" said by Tessa\n\"And also very filling.\" said by Mariah\n\"Mm-hmm. Yeah. Do you think that maybe that was enough?\" said by Tessa\n\"Uh, I was wondering if we even really needed an entree or dessert?\" said by Mariah\n\"Yeah. I mean, you know, we could just, um, head home early and relieve sharon.\" said by Tessa\n\"No, absolutely not. This is our date night. The whole point is to remind us that we are grownups with a life outside of bottles and diapers. Everybody has told us to remember to take care of ourselves.\" said by Mariah\n\"Right. It\u2019ll make us better moms to aria. Will you remind me how to do that?\" said by Tessa\n\"We\u2019re gonna start by slowing down, okay? We\u2019re gonna relax. Sip our drinks. Let the evening wash over us. And remember that the only reason that we have our beautiful daughter back at home is because we were two people who fell madly in love and wanted to build a family. And we prayed and we cried and we waited and then aria was in our arms and it all started because of love.\" said by Mariah\n\"I am gonna take care of a few things.\" said by Tessa\n\"I\u2019ll pay the check.\" said by Mariah\n\"Are we really doing this?\" said by Tessa\n\"No question. We are absolutely doing this.\" said by Mariah\n\"Do you think she knows? I\u2013 I mean\u2013 what I mean is do you think the baby senses the conflict around her?\" said by Sally\n\"Only if you let it get to you. The baby takes her cues from her mother. It\u2019s not like you have to be happy all the time. You know, sadness and confusion, that\u2019s a normal part of any pregnancy.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah. Well, I\u2019ve definitely had my fair share of stress given the strangeness of our situation.\" said by Sally\n\"You know, it\u2019s important to try to set aside some of those fears and concerns and enjoy this time. Pregnancy is the one time where it is just you and the baby. You\u2019re her everything. And that\u2019s as intense as that connection gets. Once she\u2019s out in the world, that is gone. You know, I just remembered I\u2013 I have to take care of something in the back room before we head out. Would you mind just looking after her for a minute?\" said by Sharon\n\"Um, nope. Of\u2013 of course. Hi.\" said by Sally\n\"I hate that you feel uncomfortable around me all over again.\" said by Adam\n\"Look, I\u2019m not uncomfortable around you, adam.\" said by Sally\n\"Sally, I know you. And sharon\u2019s right. You deserve to experience and enjoy this time with a life growing inside of you.\" said by Adam\n\"It\u2019s easier said than done.\" said by Sally\n\"I get it. And I hate that I\u2019m a part of what\u2019s making it hard. I know that you care about nick and you truly deserve to have that affection and support. Truly.\" said by Adam\n\"Thank you.\" said by Sally\n\"But you can\u2019t deny the fact that this baby bonds us. We\u2019re becoming that little girl\u2019s parents. We\u2019re the only people in the world who can understand what that\u2019s like, is us. We\u2019re in this. Together. And not just raising her after she\u2019s born. We should be able to enjoy moments like this. Seeing a super cute baby without feeling self-conscious or uncomfortable. I want that for you. But I\u2019m being honest, I want that for myself too.\" said by Adam\n\"You know, when I saw you earlier, you weren\u2019t nearly ready to accept the fact that your mother was alive and now you\u2019re just fully on board.\" said by Chance\n\"Yeah, now I am. Before I\u2013 I wasn\u2019t able to wrap my head around it. I mean, kyle had just told me, I was still in shock, but\u2026 I\u2019ve had some time to think. And I had another conversation with daniel.\" said by Summer\n\"And what did he say?\" said by Chance\n\"It\u2019s just I know my brother. You know, he wouldn\u2019t lie. Not about something like this.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah. That doesn\u2019t really make sense for him to put you through that.\" said by Chance\n\"And now jack is saying that he has proof and he\u2019s confident enough to share it with you?\" said by Summer\n\"A lot is happening very suddenly.\" said by Chance\n\"Chance, I don\u2019t think that you would\u2019ve come here to hear jack out if you didn\u2019t think that there was something to it. Admit it. You think my mom is alive too.\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, I will be honest with you, if you are honest with me.\" said by Chance\n\"I gotta tell you, ashley, I was very surprised when I heard that you and tucker were moving in together. Just \u2019cause I know that we both had our ups and downs with him over the years.\" said by Devon\n\"Yes, we have. Haven\u2019t we?\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah.\" said by Devon\n\"He continues to surprise me, but lately it\u2019s been in good ways, so.\" said by Ashley\n\"That\u2019s good.\" said by Devon\n\"Is it true? Did tucker propose? Please tell me you haven\u2019t said yes.\" said by Abby\n\"I didn\u2019t know it was supposed to be a secret.\" said by Tucker\n\"The young and the restless will continue.\" said by Announcer\n\"Nate nearly sabotaged chancellor-winters while he was there. I mean, if he could turn on devon and lily so easily, what makes you think he\u2019s not gonna turn on us? Vic has never had the best judgment when it comes to the men in her life who are gonna betray her.\" said by Nick\n\"First of all, nate is not ashland locke, not billy boy abbott and not jt. And victoria has eyes wide open. To be honest with you, I find it ironic that you would question your sister\u2019s relationships, whereas you lash out at anyone who looks and scans at your relationship with sally spectra. And by the way, for whatever it is worth, I think both dalliances will end soon.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, you are wrong.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, yeah?\" said by Victor\n\"Yes. Sally and I are solid. I\u2019m not walking away from her. As far as vic is concerned when it comes to nate, if this guy turns out to have no agenda and they\u2019re able to build a healthy relationship that\u2019s built on love and mutual respect, then so be it. But I know that\u2019s not gonna happen.\" said by Nick\n\"You think I don\u2019t wanna get to the truth of what happened to my mom?\" said by Summer\n\"Of course you do. But summer, none of this adds up. I think you\u2019re hiding something from me.\" said by Chance\n\"Chance, I\u2019m telling you, I\u2013 I listened to my gut and what my brother is saying, it\u2019s the only thing that makes any sense. My mom is alive. She\u2019s afraid of what\u2019s gonna happen to her when she comes back. The question is, what can we do to help her?\" said by Summer\n\"Did you say we?\" said by Chance\n\"Yes. I mean, jack and kyle, they wanna bring her back so that they can absolve diane. And I get that because they love diane, but I love my mom and I need somebody on my team that\u2019s gonna help me protect her. Please. There\u2019s gotta be a way that she can come back and we can convince everybody that what my brother said that she told him is true. That stark is the one that coerced her into making this move against diane.\" said by Summer\n\"I mean, if I can confirm all the facts, I will do what I can.\" said by Chance\n\"I can\u2019t lose her to prison.\" said by Summer\n\"Who knows? Maybe this new evidence jack found will change everything.\" said by Chance\n\"You\u2019re right. We both need to be here for our baby. And it\u2019s not fair for me to rob you of the joy of becoming a father again.\" said by Sally\n\"Last thing that I want is to be a source of anxiety.\" said by Adam\n\"Look, I\u2019m really sorry that I made things awkward by saying you needed to keep your distance.\" said by Sally\n\"I get it. What you said really hit home. I haven\u2019t been able to stop thinking about it because it\u2019s true. I haven\u2019t let go of loving you and I never will.\" said by Adam\n\"Just because I apologized does not mean that you can keep saying that.\" said by Sally\n\"Okay. Will\u2013 will you let me finish? Being around you is hard for me and that\u2019s not fair for you. It\u2019s just\u2013 you don\u2019t need the extra stress. And like sharon said, the baby can pick up on that.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay. So how\u2013 how do we work through this? Because before we know it, this baby is gonna be here.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, we have to find a way to get through this together for the baby\u2019s sake and for the future of our family, however non-traditional that may be.\" said by Adam\n\"But the question is, can we do that? I mean, do you really think that you can honor this baby and still respect my boundaries?\" said by Sally\n\"You don\u2019t think that I can do that, do you?\" said by Adam\n\"That was, uh\u2013\" said by Nate\n\"No, let\u2019s\u2013 let\u2019s not analyze it.\" said by Victoria\n\"Mm-hmm. Now, where were we?\" said by Nate\n\"Where were we?\" said by Victoria\n\"I didn\u2019t tell you about the proposal because it\u2019s not real. It\u2019s just something that tucker came up with. You know, he wanted to steal jack and diane\u2019s thunder. That\u2019s all.\" said by ", "answer": "Ashley"}

Mom?\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle.\" said by Diane\n\"I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re home.\" said by Kyle\n\"Oh, me too.\" said by Diane\n\"It\u2019s so wonderful to see you, son.\" said by Harmony\n\"It\u2019s amazing to see you.\" said by Devon\n\"Let me take a look at you. Just as handsome as ever.\" said by Harmony\n\"You look beautiful.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, well, thank you for saying so.\" said by Harmony\n\"How did this happen? I didn\u2019t know you were in town.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, it is the most incredible thing. I was in chicago working at a conference for the last few days and as I was leaving, tucker reaches out to me. Yeah, told me about this lounge and neil\u2019s name and how you and lily were gonna put together this event to celebrate his memory. Yeah, he even sent a fancy car to bring me here.\" said by Harmony\n\"Tucker did that?\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah.\" said by Harmony\n\"Thank you both for never giving up on me. Even when I thought it was hopeless. And how lucky am I that michael was my lawyer? He managed to pull off the impossible, getting me out of that jail, at least for now.\" said by Diane\n\"No, forever. We are in this with you for the long fight.\" said by Jack\n\"Mm-hmm. Dad and I are not going to give up until we prove your innocence.\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, I know the two of you believe that I had nothing to do with phyllis\u2019s murder, but there\u2019s a lot of people in this town who feel differently, including your wife. How is summer going to react when she sees me here in her home? I don\u2019t want to cause any tension in your marriage.\" said by Diane\n\"I am going to do everything I can to help summer accept that we are all back under this roof, together. Because you need to be here. This is your home too.\" said by Kyle\n\"That\u2019s exactly what I told your mother.\" said by Jack\n\"It\u2019s almost like the two of you rehearsed that.\" said by Diane\n\"Uh, does she know about, um\u2026\" said by Kyle\n\"Know about what?\" said by Diane\n\"I think he is referring to a new house guest we have who is complicating things a bit.\" said by Jack\n\"Someone else moved in? Who?\" said by Diane\n\"Brace yourself. Tucker.\" said by Jack\n\"Tucker mccall is living here?\" said by Diane\n\"So tucker, you invited my mom here.\" said by Devon\n\"I did. Yeah, I thought it would be nice for her to be here and to see you.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, that was an incredible gesture.\" said by Devon\n\"I\u2019m just glad it worked out.\" said by Tucker\n\"Why on earth would tucker\u2026 it was ashley, wasn\u2019t it?\" said by Diane\n\"My sister claims she has every right since I brought you into this house without her approval. She\u2019s just trying to prove a point. But worse, I think she actually has feelings for the guy.\" said by Jack\n\"He\u2019s taken over our guest room, for now. And smartly, stayed out of summer\u2019s and my way. Last thing we need is the aggravation.\" said by >>Kyle\n\"I will do everything I can to contain this for all our sakes.\" said by Jack\n\"Especially summer\u2019S.\" said by Kyle\n\"Diane. What are you doing here?\" said by Summer\n\"Additional sponsorship provided by\u2026\" said by Announcer\n\"I can\u2019t even believe I\u2019m looking at you.\" said by Devon\n\"I know. It\u2019s crazy.\" said by Harmony\n\"Yeah.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, too bad ana wasn\u2019t available, but she\u2019s touring with jett, so.\" said by Harmony\n\"Yeah, I would have loved to have seen her too.\" said by Devon\n\"Right?\" said by Harmony\n\"But I\u2019ll take what I can get. Phone calls and text messages don\u2019t compare to being with you.\" said by Devon\n\"No, you\u2019re so right. And I am long overdue for some one on one time with my little grandbaby. Cannot wait to wrap that little baby in my arms.\" said by Harmony\n\"Yes. We will make that happen as soon as possible.\" said by Devon\n\"Yes.\" said by Harmony\n\"\u2018Cause dom would love to meet his amazing grandma.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, well, I don\u2019t know how amazing I am but I sure am eager to meet him.\" said by Harmony\n\"I think you\u2019re amazing. Look at everything you\u2019ve accomplished in the last few years. You have a degree and you\u2019ve been clean and sober for almost two decades. There\u2019s nothing easy about any of that. I\u2019m very proud of you.\" said by Devon\n\"Mm. Well, to hear you say it like that, I\u2019m proud of me too.\" said by Harmony\n\"Good, you should be. How\u2019s your job?\" said by Devon\n\"So far so good.\" said by Harmony\n\"Yeah.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah, I love what I do. I do, I do. I just, uh, I get to contribute to the community. I get to help people in need. I remember what it was like to be in their shoes, you know. So, it\u2019s just so much more rewarding.\" said by Harmony\n\"Good. It\u2019s amazing.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. But look who\u2019s talking, you know. I\u2019m sorry, it makes my heart want to burst seeing how well you\u2019re doing, you know. Your son, abby, and\u2013 and\u2013 and, oh, I\u2019m so relieved that the two of you, you and lily resolved your issues. The two of you working side by side again.\" said by Harmony\n\"I know. It feels like everything in my life is moving in the right direction.\" said by Devon\n\"Yes. Well, even with tucker? Seems like he\u2019s trying to make up for lost time.\" said by Harmony\n\"He is. He really is. And I think that making this happen is a great start.\" said by Devon\n\"Hey, victor.\" said by Tucker\n\"Tucker.\" said by Victor\n\"Enjoying your expanded empire?\" said by Tucker\n\"I have big plans for your company, you know.\" said by Victor\n\"I should hope so.\" said by Tucker\n\"By the way, it\u2019s very touching what you did. Bringing harmony to see devon.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, anything for your son, right?\" said by Tucker\n\"Right.\" said by Victor\n\"Hi.\" said by Abby\n\"Hi, abby. What a great job you did of planning this. It\u2019s a wonderful evening.\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh, thank you. That means a lot coming from a party planning expert like yourself.\" said by Abby\n\"Oh, I don\u2019t know about that.\" said by Nikki\n\"Please, what you did with that bicentennial gala? It was an unforgettable night.\" said by Abby\n\"It was a lovely evening until\u2026\" said by Nikki\n\"Right. Yes, let\u2019s hope tonight has a much better ending.\" said by Abby\n\"This is a wonderful surprise. So, are you two the welcoming committee?\" said by Nate\n\"Hi, nate.\" said by Nikki\n\"Abby, nikki.\" said by Nate\n\"I didn\u2019t realize you and victoria were back from the west coast.\" said by Nikki\n\"Yes, we just got back and I came straight here.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, I didn\u2019t realize you were out of town until I texted you the invite.\" said by Abby\n\"It was kind of a last minute trip.\" said by Nate\n\"Where\u2019s elena?\" said by Abby\n\"Um, elena couldn\u2019t make it. Is that harmony?\" said by Nate\n\"Tucker\u2019s surprise for devon.\" said by Nikki\n\"May I have your attention, please? We\u2019re here to celebrate a man who was my friend. Not only on a personal level, but I trusted him implicitly in business. One of the few people I ever trusted, it was neil winters. Now, we can talk about a lot of his accomplishments, but one thing stands out to me as a father who\u2019s concerned about family, is how he dealt with raising devon and lily. Every parent hopes to pass on to his offspring a solid foundation with which the children who go out into the world and deal with all the slings and arrows. Often outrageous fortune. Neil did that. The fact that both devon and lily are here tonight, honoring the memory of the man who raised them, says everything about my friend. And says everything about family because after all has been said and done, it is family that holds us together. So cheers to neil and his memory.\" said by Victor\n\"To neil.\" said by All\n\"I\u2013 I\u2013 I don\u2019t understand. Did the\u2013 did the D.A.

She didn\u2019t kill phyllis and it\u2019s only a matter of time before we find evidence that proves that.

That was so beautiful.\" said by Lily\n\"My pleasure, I meant every word, you know that.\" said by Victor\n\"I do. Thank you.\" said by Lily\n\"Dad.\" said by Abby\n\"Hi, sweetheart.\" said by Victor\n\"That was a beautiful speech. It brought me to tears.\" said by Abby\n\"It was spoken from the heart. Uh, by the way, I\u2019m very glad that I have you two by yourselves for a moment.\" said by Victor\n\"Oh, yeah.\" said by Devon\n\"Devon, I want to tell you how proud I am that you\u2019re now becoming a part of my family.\" said by Victor\n\"Thank you.\" said by Devon\n\"I know that you make my daughter very happy.

Everything feels right and it\u2019s all because of this guy.\" said by Abby\n\"It was very brave of you to come tonight, to this room, the last place you saw your mother.\" said by Nikki\n\"I actually think I\u2019m handling it okay.\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, I see that you are, but still, it must be a terrible struggle for you and summer.\" said by Nikki\n\"A loss that big, it can take a while for life to feel normal again. In some respects, it never goes away.\" said by Sharon\n\"And I know I\u2019ve said this to you before, but I am deeply sorry for what happened. I just want you to know that you have my full support and victor\u2019S.\" said by Nikki\n\"And mine. Whatever you need, daniel. If you want someone to talk to or just listen. I\u2019ll pour your favorite coffee for you, on the house, any time.\" said by Sharon\n\"Thank you. It\u2019s very kind of you both. Um, I need to just excuse myself for a moment.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah, yeah.\" said by Nikki\n\"Thank you very much.\" said by Devon\n\"Four years. Hard to believe.\" said by Nate\n\"I know exactly what you mean. I am, uh, happy that you showed up though.\" said by Devon\n\"Glad I got the invite.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s what neil would\u2019ve wanted. Could, uh, elena not get off work?\" said by Devon\n\"I, uh, came here straight from the airport. Elena had a long, tough day. I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019s already crashed out at our place. You know, um, I think I\u2019m gonna grab another drink and say hi to lily. I haven\u2019t spoken to her yet.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah, man. Enjoy the party.\" said by Devon\n\"Thanks.\" said by Nate\n\"Are you having a good time?\" said by Sharon\n\"I am, a very nice time. Uh, but I was hoping that you could enlighten me.\" said by Mariah\n\"Well, you\u2019ve come to the right place.\" said by Sharon\n\"So, I obviously know about harmony from devon. Um, but this is the first time we\u2019ve met. What I don\u2019t understand is ashley. She seems to be staring daggers at harmony every time she thinks somebody isn\u2019t looking.\" said by Mariah\n\"Uh, good observation skills.\" said by Sharon\n\"It\u2019s a gift.\" said by Mariah\n\"Back when tucker and ashley were married, he and harmony had a moment.\" said by Sharon\n\"Got it, got it. So, harmony is not ashley\u2019s favorite person. Well, that certainly makes things interesting.\" said by Mariah\n\"You know, I can\u2019t thank you enough for contacting me.\" said by Harmony\n\"The smile on devon\u2019s face is all the thanks I need.\" said by Tucker\n\"I am so in awe of that young man, everything he\u2019s accomplished. But even more importantly, who he is. With little to no help from the two of us.\" said by Harmony\n\"Probably just as well.\" said by Tucker\n\"I\u2019m really glad that you two got back together. I hate the mistake we made that hurt her. But hopefully, you have learned your lesson and you don\u2019t screw things up again.\" said by Harmony\n\"You and me both.\" said by Tucker\n\"Hi.\" said by Abby\n\"Hi.\" said by Ashley\n\"So, when we spoke earlier, you knew about tucker\u2019s big surprise.\" said by Abby\n\"I did. He\u2019s making a real effort with his son.\" said by Ashley\n\"Well, I have to hand it to the guy. He found a way to make tonight even more special for devon. Although, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re wishing that he found another way to do it.\" said by Abby\n\"I think it\u2019s time I said hello.\" said by Ashley\n\"Summer, I know my being here comes as a shock to you. You, uh, you still believe I\u2019m responsible for phyllis\u2019s death and I\u2013 I can understand why you feel that way, but I also promise you it\u2019s not true.\" said by Diane\n\"Because your promises mean so much?\" said by Summer\n\"No, because I would never, ever have taken your mother away from you.\" said by Diane\n\"You are responsible, diane. Since the minute you lured jack to L.A., You set off this whole chain of events that has put us where we are now and after everything you\u2019ve done, after all the lies you told, it\u2019s not fair. It\u2019s not fair that you get to be here with the people that you love and my family has been ripped apart.

Uh, any word on Anna?\" said by Dante\n\"She\u2019s out of surgery. She made it.\" said by Laura\n\"Well, that\u2019s a relief.

Hey, are we going or what?\" said by Spencer\n\"What\u2019s happening?\" said by Anna\n\"I don\u2019t think we should talk about that.\" said by Valentin\n\"I want to talk about him.\" said by Anna\n\"You should be resting.\" said by Valentin\n\"I\u2019m\u2013- I\u2019m resting. I\u2019m in a bed. Tell me.\" said by Anna\n\"Okay. What\u2019s the last thing you remember?\" said by Valentin\n\"I don\u2019t know. [Inhales deeply] It\u2019s a bit of a blur. I know you gave necklace\u2013 a necklace to Victor, didn\u2019t you?\" said by Anna\n\"He was going to hurt you. I was out of options.\" said by Valentin\n\"It\u2019s okay. I\u2013 shh. I would have done the same thing. Did Lucy get out okay? Is she\u2013-\" said by Anna\n\"Yeah.\" said by Valentin\n\"Good.\" said by Anna\n\"In fact, I think she made a\u2026 a grand entrance at the Nurses\u2019 Ball.\" said by Valentin\n\"[Laughs] Of course she did. Your father\u2026 where is he? Do we know?\" said by Anna\n\"Yeah. And, no. He escaped on the \u201cHaunted Star.\u201d So far, the location of the boat is a mystery.\" said by Valentin\n\"How is that possible?\" said by Anna\n\"I don\u2019t know. But it is. And you should know that the necklace is not the only thing he escaped with.\" said by Valentin\n\"I had hoped we could play nice, but here you are, greeting me with threats. And if you are thinking about causing any trouble, you should know I have guards all over this ship ready to descend at a moment\u2019s notice. Welcome, my boy.\" said by Victor\n\"And then there were three.\" said by Liesl\n\"What is this?\" said by Spencer\n\"No, you mean who is this. I think you\u2019ve already met Dr. Liesl Obrecht.\" said by Valentin\n\"Where\u2019s my brother? You said he\u2019d be here.\" said by Spencer\n\"Make that four.\" said by Liesl\n\"You have my word. You\u2019ll see him after breakfast. Now, please, both of you, come, sit. [Sighs contentedly] There, isn\u2019t this nice? Well, before we begin, let\u2019s raise a glass to new beginnings.\" said by Victor\n\"Exactly how long do you think that you can string us along for?\" said by Spencer\n\"I beg your pardon?\" said by Victor\n\"You promised me answers, Uncle Victor, and I intend to collect.\" said by Spencer\n\"So Trina is also one of Victor\u2019s hostages?\" said by Sonny\n\"It\u2019s looking like that, yeah.\" said by Dante\n\"How much damage can one man do in one night?\" said by Laura\n\"Look, I-I know you guys are probably just as tired of hearing it as I am of saying it, but we are doing everything we can to find them.\" said by Dante\n\"And I know that. [Sighs] And I appreciate it. I really do. It\u2019s just that this is exactly what I was afraid of when Victor came back to Port Charles. You know? I mean\u2026 I tried to warn Spencer more than once. I tried to protect him.\" said by Laura\n\"You still protect him. We\u2019re going to find him and bring him home.\" said by Sonny\n\"That is the plan.\" said by Dante\n\"Oh, dear. I-I have to take this. Excuse me. Mayor Collins?\" said by Laura\n\"How\u2019s Michael and Willow?\" said by Sonny\n\"I don\u2019t know. I haven\u2019t talked to him. I haven\u2019t sat down since this whole thing started.\" said by Dante\n\"I bet.\" said by Sonny\n\"Have you talked to them?\" said by Dante\n\"No.\" said by Sonny\n\"Willow really needs that, uh, bone marrow transplant.\" said by Dante\n\"There\u2019s got to be a way we find Victor and bring Liesl home.\" said by Sonny\n\"Well, we still have the guy who tried to kill Lucy in custody, but he\u2019s not talking to anyone.\" said by Dante\n\"Not to the cops. But maybe he\u2019ll talk to me.\" said by Sonny\n\"We can totally do today, but if you guys are willing to wait until tomorrow, things might be a little less frantic.\" said by Brook Lynn\n\"We\u2019re good with tomorrow.\" said by Willow\n\"Okay. Awesome. Everything is going to come together\u2013I just know it.\" said by Brook Lynn\n\"It\u2019ll be the best wedding this town has ever seen.\" said by Sasha\n\"Uh, duh. We\u2019re the Quartermaines.\" said by Brook Lynn\n\"Do you, uh\u2013 do you think you can put Amelia down for a nap, please?\" said by Michael\n\"Yes. Of course.\" said by Brook Lynn\n\"Thank you.\" said by Michael\n\"Come here, Miss Amelia. It is snooze time. Oh, come here, sweetheart.\" said by Brook Lynn\n\"Okay. Be honest.\" said by Willow\n\"I am, always.\" said by Michael\n\"Is this really what you want?\" said by Willow\n\"[Chuckles] Willow, I\u2013 I want to be your husband. Of course this is what I want. What, did you think I was going to fight you on this?\" said by Michael\n\"I don\u2019t know. I guess\u2026 I was just afraid you\u2019d think I was giving up.\" said by Willow\n\"Are you?\" said by Michael\n\"With Liesl MIA right now, I know- I know things are scary. So\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you felt, you know\u2026 frustrated or\u2013or\u2013or hopeless.\" said by Michael\n\"Frustrated, yes, and angry and\u2026 afraid. But I have not given up hope. I am praying with every fiber of my being that Liesl is found, and soon.\" said by Willow\n\"Yeah. And there\u2019s every reason to believe that she will be, right? I mean, she hasn\u2019t even missing for a full day.\" said by Michael\n\"Just feels like the days count more than they used to.\" said by Willow\n\"Yeah. Yeah, they do.\" said by Michael\n\"And so\u2026 we need to be realistic. Dr. Randolph told us I don\u2019t have much time left. And I don\u2019t want to gamble with what could be my final days. I know. I hate the words as much as you do. But ignoring them doesn\u2019t do us any good. If this is the end, I want it to be filled with as much joy and love as possible. [Chuckles] And so\u2026 just like I insisted on pushing back the wedding until after the transplant, now I want to get married right away. [Sighs] Am I driving you crazy?\" said by Willow\n\"The good kind of crazy. Let\u2019s do it.\" said by Michael\n\"Yeah?\" said by Willow\n\"Yeah.\" said by Michael\n\"But we, um\u2026 we don\u2019t know what the future holds. And our time together may\u2026 be limited. But\u2026 our wedding\u2026 is an act of faith\u2026 that we are going to have many, many, many more years together with a family that our love created, okay?\" said by Michael\n\"I like the sound of that.\" said by Willow\n\"Yeah, so do I.\" said by Michael\n\"Dad.\" said by Dante\n\"What?\" said by Sonny\n\"What do you mean what? I can\u2019t let you talk to the perp. Besides, you already took a crack at him.\" said by Dante\n\"I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re implying.\" said by Sonny\n\"Really?\" said by Dante\n\"Yeah.\" said by Sonny\n\"You don\u2019t think that I know that you\u2019re the reason that he\u2019s got Diane as his attorney? I mean, it\u2019s the only person he\u2019s spoken to. I mean, the\u2013the only lead we have is because of you.\" said by Dante\n\"The \u201cHaunted Star\u201d is untraceable. We got to find a different angle.\" said by Sonny\n\"I know, and we will. I got people working on it. You got feelers out there, too. We will find them.\" said by Dante\n\"What if it\u2019s not in time?\" said by Sonny\n\"She\u2019s not going to quit. I don\u2019t think you should either.\" said by Dante\n\"I don\u2019t want to be in this position again.\" said by Sonny\n\"And what position is that?\" said by Dante\n\"Where someone that I love\u2026 is dying and I can\u2019t do a damn thing about it.\" said by Sonny\n\"No. No, no, no. This\u2026 [Grunts awkwardly] This can\u2019t be happening. No, no, no, this can\u2019t be happening.\" said by Portia\n\"When was the last time you saw or spoke to Trina?\" said by Jordan\n\"[Sobs]\" said by Portia\n\"Portia.\" said by Curtis\n\"It\u2013it was at the Nurses\u2019 Ball. And I went to her dorm afterwards\u2026 but she never showed up.\" said by Portia\n\"What about you?\" said by Jordan\n\"Same. Jordan, will you tell us what\u2019s going on?\" said by Curtis\n\"We have evidence that Victor Cassadine abducted Liesl Obrecht along with Esme Prince\u2019s baby.\" said by Jordan\n\"We also believe Spencer Cassadine is with them as well. Now, given Trina was last seen with Spencer, who we believe was taken by his great-uncle\u2013\" said by Jordan\n\"Your theory is that somehow Trina got caught up in it.\" said by Curtis\n\"Yes.\" said by Jordan\n\"Okay, so what\u2019s your department doing about it?\" said by Curtis\n\"Well, we have a lead, but, unfortunately, following it won\u2019t be easy.\" said by Jordan\n\"Your father has hostages? Who?\" said by Anna\n\"Nothing is certain, but the police suspect he has Spencer and baby Ace.\" said by Valentin\n\"Oh, god, no.\" said by Anna\n\"As well as Liesl Obrecht.\" said by Valentin\n\"Liesl? What does he want with them?\" said by Anna\n\"I don\u2019t know. Maybe they have value as hostages. Maybe it\u2019s part of his master plan. Or maybe it\u2019s both.\" said by Valentin\n\"You keep talking about new beginnings, but you still haven\u2019t told us where we\u2019re going or why. And from the way that she\u2019s glaring at you, I\u2019m betting that Dr. Obrecht isn\u2019t exactly here because she wants to be.\" said by Spencer\n\"I know, this whole situation must seem very disconcerting to both of you. But, Spencer, you\u2019ve always shown willingness to protect our family at any cost. I\u2019m counting on you and your brother to ensure the future prosperity of the Cassadines.\" said by Victor\n\"As disturbing as that explanation was, I suppose I can understand you kidnapping your own kin. But what is my purpose? I certainly do not care about the Cassadine legacy.\" said by Liesl\n\"Oh-ho-ho. Oh, this goes much further than a family legacy. When my plan comes to fruition, we\u2019ll be ushering in a new era for humanity.\" said by Victor\n\"When my father was diagnosed with Alzheimer\u2019s, there was not a damn thing I could do about it, no lead I could take. This awful\u2026 [Sighs] disease was just happening to us.\" said by Sonny\n\"Yeah, same thing with Stone.\" said by Dante\n\"All I could do is just stand by there and just\u2026 watch him slip away. And no matter how\u2013how ugly it is with me and Michael, I don\u2019t wish that on anyone.\" said by Sonny\n\"You\u2019re wrong. The way I heard it, you didn\u2019t just stand there and do nothing. You cared for Mike. You loved him. You made sure his last months, weeks, and days on this earth were good ones.\" said by Dante\n\"You did the same thing with Stone.\u00a0 Could you save them? No. No one could. But you did them both a\u2026 a world of good.\" said by Dante\n\"Thanks for saying that.\" said by Sonny\n\"It\u2019s just the truth. You could do the same thing for Michael and Willow.\" said by Dante\n\"I would love to, but Michael won\u2019t let me.\" said by Sonny\n\"I wouldn\u2019t be so sure about that.\" said by Dante\n\"Is everything good with Amelia?\" said by Michael\n\"She went down without so much as a whimper.\" said by Sasha\n\"Clearly, we have the magic touch. So what do we have to do to get this wedding off the ground?\" said by Brook Lynn\n\"Put us to work.\" said by Sasha\n\"Most everything is planned already, but we do need to contact the vendors and tell them we\u2019re moving up the date.\" said by Willow\n\"On it. Send me the list.\" said by Sasha\n\"Okay, I will. [Chuckles] Love you.\" said by Willow\n\"And I\u2019ll talk to you soon, okay?\" said by Sasha\n\"Bye.\" said by Sasha\n\"Bye, Sasha.\" said by Brook Lynn\n\"I\u2019ll, uh\u2013I\u2019ll walk you out. [Sighs] Here\u2026\" said by Michael\n\"Okay. So notifying the vendors, done. What else?\" said by Brook Lynn\n\"Would you mind?\" said by Willow\n\"Checking on Michael?\" said by Brook Lynn\n\"I know this is hard on him. Help him if you can.\" said by Willow\n\"Yeah.\" said by Brook Lynn\n\"We believe Victor left Port Charles on the \u201cHaunted Star.\u201d\" said by Jordan\n\"Doesn\u2019t that ship have a GPS tracker?\" said by Curtis\n\"It did, but we found it tied to a buoy in the harbor.\" said by Jordan\n\"[Sighs] So they could be anywhere.\" said by Portia\n\"The coast guard is working to locate them via satellite, but so far, no luck.\" said by Jordan\n\"This is a living nightmare.\" said by Portia\n\"We are utilizing all resources, Portia. I promise. The goal is to bring Trina, Spencer, and whomever else is on that boat home safely.\" said by Jordan\n\"Jordan, thank you.\" said by Curtis\n\"I\u2019ll obviously be in touch.\" said by Jordan\n\"My baby girl. She must be so scared right now. [Cries]\" said by Portia\n\"It\u2019s okay. Okay? I got you. It\u2019ll be okay.\" said by Curtis\n\"Okay.\" said by Portia\n\"It will be okay.\" said by Curtis\n\"[Cries]\" said by Portia\n\"Oh. [Winces] Ow. Okay, look\u2026 I don\u2019t think your father is motivated by money, right? So it\u2019s not a ransom. No?\" said by Anna\n\"No. He could be using Liesl, Spencer, and the baby as human shields.\" said by Valentin\n\"Um, yeah, I mean\u2026 I imagine that he sees Spencer as practically the only family he has left. But Liesl, I\u2026 does he need something from her? Because, remember, we don\u2019t know what the\u2013 what the code on the Ice Princess necklace means. We don\u2019t know if it leads somewhere.\" said by Anna\n\"Well, regardless, Victor has everything he needs to put his plan in motion, and he can strike at any minute.\" said by Valentin\n\"Oh, god. How do we or\u2013or anybody\u2013 how do we stop him?\" said by Anna\n\"Once again, you fall prey to your bloated sense of self-importance.\" said by Liesl\n\"I\u2019m merely stating a fact. Someone has to do what needs to be done.\" said by Victor\n\"And that is?\" said by Liesl\n\"Yeah, when you say \u201cnew era,\u201d what does that mean?\" said by Spencer\n\"When I was younger, I was horrified by the damage we were doing to our planet.\" said by Victor\n\"Oh, we?\" said by Spencer\n\"Yes, we, us, people, humanity, our greed and short-sightedness, carelessly consuming the very resources we needed to survive. I mean, left unchecked, there will be nothing left for future generations. Now, once upon a time, my brother, Mikkos, shared these views. So, together, we developed a technology to reverse mankind\u2019s mistakes.\" said by Victor\n\"The device you use to control the climate. Do remind us how that turned out.\" said by Liesl\n\"Yes, all right, I admit, uh\u2026 allying with Mikkos was a mistake. He soon showed himself to be a mere opportunist using our innovation for extortion. His greed was not only disgusting. It was our undoing.\" said by Victor\n\"His greed, along with Luke and Laura.\" said by Liesl\n\"Yes, well, I won\u2019t make the same mistake twice. There are other ways of accomplishing what I set out to do all those years ago.\" said by Victor\n\"How?\" said by Spencer\n\"Mikkos and I developed another set of tools to save the world, tools that we could fall back on if our first plan was a failure.\" said by Victor\n\"Now, there\u2019s an understatement.\" said by Liesl\n\"For security reasons, we placed these tools in bunkers, the locations of which only Mikkos knew. He engraved a code on the Ice Princess, which, when deciphered, would give the coordinates of those locations.\" said by Victor\n\"The Ice Princess, as in the diamond?\" said by Spencer\n\"That\u2019s correct.\" said by Victor\n\"And I assume that we\u2019re headed to one of those bunkers.\" said by Spencer\n\"Is that why you killed Luke Spencer? So you could get your hands on that diamond?\" said by Liesl\n\"Sometimes sacrifices have to be made for the greater good. And there\u2019s plenty of people out there who agree with me. While I was working on my plan, I gathered a great number of\u2013 of true believers, willing to give their life for the cause.\" said by Victor\n\"Before this is over, how many unwilling people are going to perish?\" said by Liesl\n\"Humanity has all but ensured its own annihilation. The only way to reverse the damage is to take extreme measures and take them now.\" said by Victor\n\"Define \u201cextreme.\u201d\" said by Spencer\n\"40 years after Mikkos\u2019 folly, do you realize the population of the planet has almost doubled? Eight billion people. Think of the strain on our resources and space. There\u2019s no way it can be sustained. But it can be fixed.\" said by Victor\n\"\u201cFixed\u201d? How?\" said by Liesl\n\"A pathogen stored in one of my brother\u2019s bunkers. Once released, it will reduce the population to manageable levels.\" said by Victor\n\"Your plan is to release an unknown pathogen into the world?\" said by Liesl\n\"\u201cUnknown\u201d? No, no, Mikkos and I cultivated it to very specific specifications.\" said by Victor\n\"Four decades ago. Who knows how that pathogen has morphed in that time?\" said by Liesl\n\"The survivors will usher in a new age of man.\" said by Victor\n\"So to hell with all the innocent people who will die, so long as your family remains intact. Who appointed you judge, jury, and executioner?\" said by Spencer\n\"I know, I know. It seems heartless. But to bring about true change involves sacrifice.\" said by Victor\n\"Sacrifice from everybody else!\" said by Spencer\n\"Someone has to have the courage to make the hard choices!\" said by Victor\n\"There\u2019s no way. I\u2019m not going to let you get away with this.\" said by Spencer\n\"Oh, I\u2019ve been working towards this all my life. No one is going to stop me now. Not even you.\" said by Victor\n\"Victor has Trina on some ship for god knows what reason, and we have no idea where they are. What if Trina is hurt, or she\u2013\" said by Portia\n\"We will find her.\" said by Curtis\n\"Yeah, but how? My daughter needs protecting, and I\u2019m not there to protect her. What am I supposed to do?\" said by Portia\n\"I have seen how Trina handles herself in threatening situations, okay? She\u2019s tough. She\u2019s levelheaded. If she\u2019s with Victor and Spencer, she\u2019s finding a way out of it.\" said by Curtis\n\"[Shudders] You really think so?\" said by Portia\n\"I know so.\" said by ", "answer": "Curtis"}

No, it\u2019s too dangerous.\" said by Nick\n\"I know him better than either of you. I know how his mind works. I know how deranged he is. I know what he\u2019s capable of.

Following in your dad and granddad\u2019s footsteps.\" said by Taylor\n\"You know, I hear it runs in the blood.\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah, it does. But you know what? You have your very own way of doing things. You know? Not just\u2013 not just here at work but in life as well. You\u2019re gonna make it happen. And shock \u2019em all.\" said by Taylor\n\"I mean, it\u2019s a good\u2013 it\u2019s a good idea. I just don\u2019t know how you implement something like that.\" said by Liam\n\"Well, that\u2019s the thing. I have a top coder worker on it right now. We\u2019re building up the platform and we\u2019ll take a look at it.\" said by Wyatt\n\"So basically, it\u2019s like a\u2013 it\u2019s like a daily roundup of just what\u2013 like, whatever the top influencers are posting about.\" said by Liam\n\"Right. Correct. Yes. But we\u2019re just arranging it in a way to make it appealing, you know, one-stop shop.\" said by Wyatt\n\"That\u2019s interesting.\" said by Liam\n\"Yeah?\" said by Wyatt\n\"I mean, it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s more convenient for the user because it kind of like streamlines the whole retail experience.\" said by Liam\n\"Exactly. And you know what else I was thinking, we should maybe reach out to hope and see if the fashion houses might be able to utilize something like this. You know what I mean? Oh! Or better yet. I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t even think of this. Like, you should maybe reach out to her top designer, because I know you can\u2019t wait to talk to him.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Wow!\" said by Liam\n\"You don\u2019t\u2013 no?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Yeah, too soon. Too soon.\" said by Liam\n\"I\u2019m sorry, I just\u2013 I couldn\u2019t help myself.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Oh, you couldn\u2019t? Thomas forrester spends 12 hours a day with my wife and he lives rent-free in my head. But\u2013 but wyatt couldn\u2019t help himself, so\u2013 so\u2013 so there\u2019s that.\" said by Liam\n\"I\u2019m sorry! Okay? But it\u2019s a damn good idea, isn\u2019t it?\" said by Wyatt\n\"I hope to god you\u2019re talking about the app.\" said by Liam\n\"Of course, I\u2019m talking about the app! But it\u2019s not just an app, it\u2019s the app of all apps. I\u2019m telling you. If we build this right, and we market it correctly, this could be eight figures, easy.\" said by Wyatt\n\"It does have potential.\" said by Liam\n\"See? And then think about the monthly subscriptions.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Ooh.\" said by Liam\n\"Mm. Maybe I should talk to thomas\u2019s people about this. And just ask.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Oh, my god! You\u2019re the worst person. Ever. Do you understand I\u2019m trying to get thomas out of my head and you just keep shoving him back in again? Stop it, stop, stop it.\" said by Liam\n\"I just\u2013 I am\u2013 I am just so impressed with everything that you\u2019re doing.\" said by Taylor\n\"I never get tired of hearing you say that.

That\u2019s true.\" said by Thomas\n\"You know, it\u2019s just, I\u2013 I see so much of your dad in you, when it comes to finding the inspiration in your designs. You just get so laser-focused.\" said by Taylor\n\"Yeah. So long as I\u2019m laser-focused on hope for the future and not hope, right, mom?\" said by Thomas\n\"This is about thomas again?\" said by Hope\n\"Hope, you were clutching his hands. You were gazing into his eyes\u2013\" said by Steffy\n\"Steffy, you\u2019re making a bigger deal out of that moment than it has to be. I mean, we were excited about the numbers. What more do you want me to say?\" said by Hope\n\"I just need to know. I need to be 100% certain that you have no inappropriate feelings towards my brother.

I\u2019m trying a different tact here. I\u2019m supposed to give you a hard time, aren\u2019t I?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Okay. Actually, you know what\u2013 you know what the hardest thing about the whole thomas situation is? It\u2019s just\u2013 it\u2019s just me trying to predict when he\u2019s gonna cross the line again. Like, precisely when is that gonna happen?\" said by Liam\n\"Because you know he will.\" said by Wyatt\n\"No, of course he will. I mean, this\u2013 nobody goes through a sweeping life change like that in a matter of months. And especially not thomas.\" said by Liam\n\"Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s definitely not real, that\u2019s for sure.\" said by Wyatt\n\"No, it\u2019s definitely not real. Or at least it\u2019s not\u2013 it\u2019s not as real as everybody seems to think it is. Which is why I\u2013 I\u2019m still keeping my eye on him.\" said by Liam\n\"Well, and hope\u2019s doing the same thing though, right?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Yeah. Well, she\u2013 I mean, she says she\u2019s, you know, always on the lookout for red flags. And, uh, you know, my job is to believe that, so\u2013\" said by Liam\n\"Okay, good. \u2018Cause hope\u2019s not one to lie. So, you\u2019ve got no reason to doubt her.\" said by Wyatt\n\"No, I\u2013 that\u2019s right. I\u2013 I completely trust hope. She\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s just frustrating that she works so much with thomas and that\u2019s why I\u2019m keeping my guard up because I just\u2013 it\u2013 work is one thing. I don\u2019t want him to interfere in my marriage.\" said by Liam\n\"So, do you remember\u2013 do you remember the, uh\u2013 your dad\u2019s office at the old house? You used to sit on top of his big desk, eating a\u2013 a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. And then\u2013 and then you\u2019d tuck your little hands underneath you and you\u2019d watch him draw for hours.\" said by Taylor\n\"Yeah, I remember now. That\u2019s what started my love affair with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.\" said by Thomas\n\"I know they did. And now look at you.\" said by Taylor\n\"No place I\u2019d rather be.\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah, I know. I know. And I\u2013 I just\u2013 I wish that you had a\u2013 a healthier balance between work and\u2026\" said by Taylor\n\"I go on dates, mom.\" said by Thomas\n\"Right. But nothing significant.\" said by Taylor\n\"[ Laughs ] Oh, man. Look at you. I could just\u2013 oh, you\u2019re transparent.\" said by Thomas\n\"What are you\u2013\" said by Taylor\n\"I see right through you. Come on, I can tell, obviously, you still are concerned about me and my feelings or potential feelings for hope.\" said by Thomas\n\"Oh, do you know what? Just because I come by and check on you every now and again, doesn\u2019t\u2013\" said by Taylor\n\"You mean every hour or two?\" said by Thomas\n\"That is my \u201csmotherly\u201d love. Deal with it.\" said by Taylor\n\"Okay. You\u2019re right. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2013 smother away. Because you love your kids. And I couldn\u2019t be more grateful that I have someone who cares about me so much. Bring it in.\" said by Thomas\n\"I thought we had already put this issue to rest.\" said by Hope\n\"I need to be absolutely sure. There is so much riding on your partnership being successful. And not just for your line, but for thomas\u2019s well-being.\" said by Steffy\n\"Look, I get it. You\u2019re being a protective sister, which I would do the same thing if I were in your shoes. But can I ask you an honest question, steffy? I mean, you and your family, you\u2013 you truly do believe that thomas has changed, right?\" said by Hope\n\"Yes, absolutely.\" said by Steffy\n\"Okay. So, then, am I not allowed to trust that? To appreciate the man that he\u2019s become? Someone who is kind. Who doesn\u2019t just think about himself. Who actually worked hard on the road to self-improvement.\" said by Hope\n\"That\u2019s why I don\u2019t want you unraveling all the progress thomas has made.\" said by Steffy\n\"Steffy, I would never do that. I am rooting for him just as much as you are. And what you walked in on\u2013\" said by Hope\n\"Holding his hands?\" said by Steffy\n\"We were caught up in the moment.\" said by Hope\n\"What kind of moment?\" said by Steffy\n\"One of excitement. I mean, steffy, you know, better than anyone, that my line was on the brink of collapse and your brother helped save it. And not only that, we work together, we\u2019re co-parents and yes, thomas is\u2013 is now a good friend of mine.\" said by Hope\n\"That\u2019s why I need reassurance that you don\u2019t have any feelings for him.\" said by Steffy\n\"Am I happy for thomas? Yes. Am I proud of him? Absolutely. But are there any romantic feelings, steffy? No, none at all. \u201cLook at this skin, baby.\" said by Hope\n\"Okay. So, you know I don\u2019t just come here to\u2013 to check on you, right?\" said by Taylor\n\"I do. Yeah, I do.\" said by Thomas\n\"No, I\u2013 I\u2013 I come here because I\u2013 I also want to catch up and see your handsome face. Not just the serious stuff.\" said by Taylor\n\"No, you don\u2019t want to just talk about the serious stuff. Like therapy and all my past trauma. What you want to know is, you know, if I\u2019m getting enough vitamins or sleep.\" said by Thomas\n\"Are you?\" said by Taylor\n\"Yes.\" said by Thomas\n\"[ Giggles ] Okay, good. Now, honey, I am\u2013 I am, uh\u2013 I am here really for\u2013 for something very important and I\u2013 I just\u2013 I need you to be honest with me.\" said by Taylor\n\"Okay.\" said by Thomas\n\"Have you seen the season finale of\u2013\" said by Taylor\n\"No, no. Why would I do that? That would\u2013 you\u2013 you watched it without me? Why would you\u2013\" said by Thomas\n\"I might\u2019ve\u2013\" said by Taylor\n\"That\u2019s\u2013 why? That\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s really painful. Talk about trauma. You\u2019re bringing more into my life. Why would you do that? Wow! Mom!\" said by Thomas\n\"You\u2019ve been so busy! And it\u2019s so good.\" said by Taylor\n\"Oh, yeah. I\u2019m so glad to hear that. So good. Can\u2019t wait to watch it on my own. You\u2019re\u2013 yeah. Okay. Look, you\u2013 you\u2019re very sweet. And, um, honestly, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m glad that you do check on me. Because\u2026 therapy and\u2013 and working through all this stuff, this is the reason that I\u2019m actually making significant changes this time.\" said by Thomas\n\"I know. You\u2019re doing so good. You are\u2013 you are truly committed to making a real shift happen.\" said by Taylor\n\"These look good. And I\u2019ll just take these back once they\u2019re executed. All right. Thanks, margie. So\u2026 things with hope are good, then?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Things with hope are good. Yeah. They\u2019d be great, if it weren\u2019t for thomas, but they\u2019re good.\" said by Liam\n\"Right. Look. I know that it\u2019s hard, but you just, you gotta stay positive.\" said by Wyatt\n\"No, positive\u2013 look. You know me. I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m an optimist. It\u2019s just been a challenge lately. We\u2019ve had, you know, some disagreements and\u2013\" said by Liam\n\"About thomas? Let\u2019s see, we talked about this, once before? Twice?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Oh god. Yeah, I know. I know. I know. I know. I vent to you. I use you as a\u2013 as a vent. That\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s our thing. You know what? It would be easier if I just didn\u2019t have to, like, conform to the whole thomas-is-a-changed-man narrative thing. Right?\" said by Liam\n\"Right.\" said by Wyatt\n\"I mean, that\u2013 that\u2019s been a challenge. That\u2019s what\u2019s created conflict between hope and me. In certain areas. In other areas, we\u2019re actually, uh, pretty good.\" said by Liam\n\"Right. Other areas.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Yeah, other areas that I won\u2019t go into too much detail about. Suffice it to say, there is this boutique shop on melrose that we\u2019ve gone to a couple of times.\" said by Liam\n\"I\u2019m gonna call thomas, how about that?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Okay, foul ball.\" said by Liam\n\"Okay, time out.\" said by Wyatt\n\"All right.\" said by Liam\n\"Time out.\" said by Wyatt\n\"It\u2019s\u2013 everything\u2019s fine. I have nothing to complain about. I have everything to be grateful for. As a matter of fact, hope has, really, I don\u2019t think ever been as loving or affectionate, so\u2026\" said by Liam\n\"Well, that\u2019s good. Yeah, I\u2019m glad. I\u2019m happy for you both.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Thank you.\" said by Liam\n\"Look, it\u2019s hard enough trying to keep up the romance when you got kids and jobs and family and all that. Not to mention when you have A\u2026\" said by Wyatt\n\"I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m, uh\u2013 I\u2019m trying not to obsess too much over that stupid face lurking around. And in the meantime, one thing is clear, I\u2019m just incredibly lucky to have hope in my life. Because there is no one more loyal or committed than her.\" said by Liam\n\"I don\u2019t have any feelings for thomas. Nothing beyond friendship, collaboration and sharing a son together.\" said by Hope\n\"Okay. I just want to make sure you\u2019re not following some of brooke\u2019s patterns.\" said by Steffy\n\"Okay, steffy. I\u2013 we\u2019re not talking about my mom right now. We\u2019re talking about me, right? And I am my own person. I know myself. I know my boundaries, and while I may be brooke logan\u2019s daughter, I am nothing like her when it comes to men. I would never do anything to undermine the life that I have built for myself and for my family. And I would certainly never do anything inappropriate with any man, let alone thomas. Scout is protected by simparica trio,\" said by Hope\n\"I wish I had time, I could take you to lunch.\" said by Thomas\n\"Oh, gosh, I would love that. I really would. But I\u2013 I know that you\u2019re creating masterpieces and I have an entire day filled with patients.\" said by Taylor\n\"Well, I appreciate you coming by, seeing how I\u2019m doing.\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah. Always. Always. I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m not too smothering. Am I?\" said by Taylor\n\"No. Honestly, it\u2019s been\u2013 it\u2019s been pretty amazing having you and your support. I don\u2019t know what I would have done without your faith in me. It\u2019s really helped motivate me.\" said by Thomas\n\"You know, I am\u2013 I am just here to remind you that\u2013 that you\u2019re not alone. And I see you. You know, what you\u2019re doing today is just getting you that much closer to where you\u2019ll be tomorrow. And I am just so proud that I get to ride shotgun on this journey with you.\" said by Taylor\n\"Well, I\u2013 I \u201clerve\u201d you, mom.\" said by Thomas\n\"I \u201clerve\u201d you back.\" said by Taylor\n\"Well, I\u2019d say life is treating you pretty well. And you know what, I\u2019m glad. Because I think you deserve all the happiness in the world.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Thanks, man. And that\u2019s true. You know what, hope is\u2026 an immeasurable part of that. Just knowing that she\u2019s\u2013 she\u2019s there for me. She\u2019s got my back. I can always count on her. The kids can always count on her. There\u2019s nothing better than that.\" said by Liam\n\"Yeah. I mean, look, you\u2013 you lucked out when you married that one.\" said by Wyatt\n\"That\u2019s true. There is no one more kind or compassionate, or with more integrity than hope logan.\" said by Liam\n\"Yep. Apple kind of fell far from the tree on that one, huh?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Hmm?\" said by Liam\n\"With brooke? I mean, I don\u2019t mean any disrespect to brooke. Or anything\u2013\" said by Wyatt\n\"No, no, no.\" said by Liam\n\"She\u2019s a phenomenal woman, you know what I mean? But, I mean, come on, we heard the stories about her when she was younger, when she was hope\u2019s age, you know? And\u2013\" said by Wyatt\n\"Yeah.\" said by Liam\n\"And that whole thing.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Yeah, they\u2019re\u2013 they\u2019re different, you know. Different personalities, different, uh, value systems.\" said by Liam\n\"Yeah. It was just\u2013 sometimes, I\u2013 I\u2013 you know, it\u2019s hard to believe that she\u2019s hope\u2019s mom.\" said by Wyatt\n\"No, me too. Hope is definitely her own person. I mean, she\u2019s so\u2013 she\u2019s got, like, such a specific\u2026 moral code.\" said by Liam\n\"Right.\" said by Wyatt\n\"You know, and she sticks with it. She, like, never strays from it. But that\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s great for me. That\u2019s why I love her so much, right? Like, I never have to worry about that. I never have to question her fidelity. Or her commitment.\" said by Liam\n\"I mean, you know how much I love liam, how\u2013 how hard I fought for him and for our relationship. I mean, hell, steffy, I even fought you\u2013\" said by Hope\n\"I\u2013 I\u2019m not\u2013 I\u2019m not disputing your feelings for your husband. I know you love him. It\u2019s just thomas has come a long way. He\u2019s moved on from his dysfunctional ways. He\u2019s not pining for you anymore. And I\u2019d hate to see him get caught up in all of this again.\" said by Steffy\n\"Thomas understands that there was never anything between us, there never will be. He\u2019s finally accepted that. And that is why the line is in such a good place. It\u2019s because he and I are finally on the same page. And thomas knows how much I love liam. And between you and me, I mean, liam and I, we\u2019ve never been more connected. So, yes, while I may spend my days at work here with your brother, our relationship is purely platonic and professional. And I\u2013\" said by Hope\n\"Look, um, I\u2019m happy that you and liam are in a good place. And hey, okay, maybe, maybe my imagination was running wild when I walked in on you and thomas.\" said by Steffy\n\"I mean, I get it. I just\u2013 I think you were reading a little too far into things. I have a healthy working relationship with thomas. And I am happily married to liam.\" said by Hope\n\"Okay. Just, things are going so well for our families and I\u2013 I don\u2019t want anything to mess it up is all.\" said by Steffy\n\"Well, you don\u2019t have to worry about thomas and me. Okay?

Aren\u2019t you just the most precious thing in the world?\" said by Harmony\n\"Say, \u201cthank you, grandma.\u201d\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, you are all mine today. You are. Yes, you are. Will you look at this face?\" said by Harmony\n\"I know.\" said by Devon\n\"This face. Ah, it reminds you how the world is just a wondrous place. Full of miracles. Yes, it is. Want luxury hair repair that doesn\u2019t cost $50?\" said by Harmony\n\"Sorry we kept you guys waiting.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Oh, that\u2019s all right. It\u2019s all right. Is everything good?\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s good.\" said by Chelsea\n\"So, what are we trading?\" said by Connor\n\"Well, I was just telling johnny that you are expecting a new baby sister.\" said by Billy\n\"Welcome to the big brothers club.\" said by Johnny\n\"Right. Whoop-de-doo.\" said by Connor\n\"Oh, here\u2019s the good news. She\u2019s not living under your roof and she\u2019ll be too little to talk, so\u2026\" said by Johnny\n\"I\u2019m not hungry. I just wanna go home.\" said by Connor\n\"Really? This is the first time this kid\u2019s ever turned down a snack.\" said by Chelsea\n\"You know, there are benefits to having a sister. There are. Why don\u2019t you fill him in? Tell\u2013 tell the young man all the great things.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, first time she burps the way you taught her to, that\u2019s cool. Also, you can take your broccoli from your plate and just put it on her plate\u2013\" said by Johnny\n\"Okay. You\u2019re done. Cut off.\" said by Billy\n\"Hey, I speak the truth.\" said by Johnny\n\"Don\u2019t listen to anything he says.\" said by Billy\n\"What can we get you, sweetheart? Do you want a pizza?\" said by Chelsea\n\"I\u2019m in.\" said by Johnny\n\"What do you want, buddy?\" said by Billy\n\"Nothing.\" said by Connor\n\"Nothing like nothing on your pizza or just like nothing at all?\" said by Billy\n\"Nothing! At all.\" said by Connor\n\"You know, you\u2019re definitely gonna have to visit a lot more often \u2019cause dominic clearly is in love with you. You wore him out.\" said by Devon\n\"[ Laughs ] That\u2019s the joy of being a grandmother, you know? It\u2019s a different kind of love.\" said by Harmony\n\"Yeah, I guess so.\" said by Devon\n\"You know it makes me think of my own mother? God, she used to love you up.\" said by Harmony\n\"Oh, I remember. I was very lucky. I\u2019ve had a lot of incredible people in my life.\" said by Devon\n\"Yes. And you\u2019re making every single one of them incredibly proud.\" said by Harmony\n\"Yeah.\" said by Devon\n\"Especially as a dad.\" said by Harmony\n\"Well, that means everything to me. So, thank you.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. And now you\u2019ve got tucker on your side.\" said by Harmony\n\"Mm.\" said by Devon\n\"I mean, it\u2019s good of him to be making the effort, I suppose.\" said by Harmony\n\"Yeah. It\u2019s better late than never.\" said by Devon\n\"You gotta give the guy some credit, right?\" said by Harmony\n\"Do I?\" said by Devon\n\"[ Sighs ] Listen, okay? The sad and awful truth is, is not everybody\u2019s cut out to be a parent. Okay? And\u2013 or takes to it as naturally as neil did. And by the time most people figure that out about themselves, it\u2019s too late. You\u2019re lucky to have had him.\" said by Harmony\n\"Yeah. I\u2026 having neil as a role model has changed my whole world. I wanna ask you a question, though.\" said by Devon\n\"Ask away.\" said by Harmony\n\"I know I kinda put you on the spot the other night when I asked your opinion about me changing my last name.\" said by Devon\n\"You mean like all those people standing around? What would I have said if it was just the two of us?\" said by Harmony\n\"Yeah, something like that.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay. Well, here\u2019s your chance.\" said by Harmony\n\"Okay. Are you really okay with me doing that? And going by devon winters?\" said by Devon\n\"I feel like I\u2019ve been called into the principal\u2019s office. What\u2019s my offense? Was that your half a grapefruit I ate this morning?\" said by Tucker\n\"What is your excuse for what you did to diane?\" said by Jack\n\"You\u2019re gonna have to be more specific.\" said by Tucker\n\"Trying to convince her to leave town right after I managed to get a judge to allow us to post bail. Why would you put her freedom in jeopardy?\" said by Jack\n\"Is that how she framed it? That\u2019s not wholly accurate. I just helped her face facts.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, and what are the facts according to tucker mccall?\" said by Jack\n\"Well, the evidence is starting to pile up against her, jack. And she\u2019s got her checkered past to contend with also. So, I merely illustrated her choices, which are, according to tucker mccall, uh, to re-traumatize you and her son by putting you both through a very public trial, which will most likely lead to her conviction, or she can leave.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, so, did you give her this little pep talk at ashley\u2019s behest?\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. No. No, not at all. You know, diane and I have a history of our own, and I care about her.\" said by Tucker\n\"She does not need you to tell her what she is up against.\" said by Jack\n\"I don\u2019t think you\u2019re quite getting what I\u2019m talking about here. She has to convince not only a judge, but half the people in this town, and her daughter-in-law, that she is blameless in this. And if you think that coming back to genoa city has earned diane anything but sneers and whispers, think again. And now she\u2019s charged with murder. And you think I\u2019m a bad guy for telling her to get out while she can? I used to wait to run my dishwasher\" said by Tucker\n\"As if that matters. Well, it matters to you, of course. But, jack, you know as well as I do, the people in this town never let go of anything. And this stain on diane is just gonna trickle down all the way to harrison.\" said by Tucker\n\"What are you talking about?\" said by Jack\n\"Well, do you think that walnut grove is going to sell diane\u2019s brownies at their bake sale? And are you sure your companies are gonna survive her presence in your life? Listen, even if she is found innocent, she\u2019s always going to be labeled genoa city\u2019s murderer. Period. I mean, do you really want to help her?\" said by Tucker\n\"Of course, I do.\" said by Jack\n\"Okay. Then do whatever you can, legally or otherwise, to get her the hell out of this place. Anyway, I\u2019m gonna take my leave of you now, gonna find a nice quiet place to relax and enjoy my life. Everyone\u2019s so tense around here, bro.\" said by Tucker\n\"I wanna make sure that you know that by me doing this, it doesn\u2019t change what you mean to me or I don\u2019t\u2013\" said by Devon\n\"Well\u2013\" said by Harmony\n\"I\u2019m not gonna forget where I come from.\" said by Devon\n\"That\u2019s good to know.\" said by Harmony\n\"It\u2019s the truth. It just feels right to go by winters.\" said by Devon\n\"A rose by any other name would smell as sweet, right?\" said by Harmony\n\"I\u2019m getting shakespeare.\" said by Devon\n\"You know, I have gone by a few names myself. Doesn\u2019t change what\u2019s on the inside. You can call yourself the crown prince of genoa city. Okay? You will always be my son. Can you imagine living in a world where you weren\u2019t free to be who you wanna be? My grandson, he is the luckiest kid in the world. He\u2019s gonna be able to grow up to be a\u2013 a what? A\u2013 a musician or a business tycoon or even a statesman.\" said by Harmony\n\"Yeah.\" said by Devon\n\"All of the above or anything in between.\" said by Harmony\n\"He can do it all. He can be a carpenter.\" said by Devon\n\"Right?\" said by Harmony\n\"Be a pilot.\" said by Devon\n\"A world without limits and you ought make it fun for him, you know? That way, he won\u2019t know that he\u2019s learning. He\u2019ll just learn to love it, whatever it is.\" said by Harmony\n\"That\u2019s true.\" said by Devon\n\"Wasn\u2019t he?\" said by Harmony\n\"Yeah.\" said by Devon\n\"You know, I used to play with you like that.\" said by Harmony\n\"I remember.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, no, you don\u2019T. You\u2013\" said by Harmony\n\"I do.\" said by Devon\n\"That\u2019s impossible.\" said by Harmony\n\"No, it\u2019s not. I definitely remember. We used to build forts all the time. We used to build forts with all those blankets that we had and you would make snacks.\" said by Devon\n\"Yes. Cheese and crackers.\" said by Harmony\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Devon\n\"Yep. I did the best with what I had.\" said by Harmony\n\"Yeah. And you always had music playing, too.\" said by Devon\n\"Mm. Now, what is life without music?\" said by Harmony\n\"Those are good memories.\" said by Devon\n\"Mm. They weren\u2019t anything special.\" said by Harmony\n\"They were very special to me. It was the times that were good that you never forget.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah.\" said by Harmony\n\"I didn\u2019t mean to say that to make you feel bad or\u2026\" said by Devon\n\"It\u2019s all good. I know what you meant. I know there was a lot of not so good times. I\u2019m sorry about that.\" said by Harmony\n\"It\u2019s okay, mom. You\u2019re here. You\u2019re here today.\" said by Devon\n\"Mm.\" said by Harmony\n\"You\u2019re here today. And dominic gets to grow up and have you in his life. And he gets to have the best of you. He gets to have a grandmother that\u2019ll get on the floor with him and play with toys and make sound effects like you used to do with me.\" said by > Devon\n\"Yeah, those were some fun memories, weren\u2019t they?\" said by Harmony\n\"They were really fun times. And no matter what I\u2019m ever going through in my life, remembering those fun times with you, it always put a smile on my face.\" said by Devon\n\"Let me tell you a little something about a ham and pineapple pizza. Okay? Don\u2019t make that face. I know. I get it. It sounds like total chaos on a pizza crust, but it\u2019s perfect. The sweetness of the pineapple coming together with the saltiness of the ham, I mean, it\u2019s divine.\" said by Billy\n\"Ooh. I\u2019m down. New is good.\" said by Chelsea\n\"New is good.\" said by Billy\n\"Ooh, okay. Um, how about we get two pizzas? One for the people with the dead taste buds and one for the bros.\" said by Johnny\n\"Mm.\" said by Billy\n\"Is this the part where we do the pretending?\" said by Connor\n\"Sweetheart, what are you talking about?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Everything. That\u2019s not the point.\" said by Connor\n\"Okay. I could use a little bit of fresh air. What do you say? You wanna join me, connor? Yeah. Of course, you do. You don\u2019t mind, do you?\" said by Billy\n\"Not at all.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Okay. Come on. After you.\" said by Billy\n\"Hey. Where\u2019s mom?\" said by Kyle\n\"She is upstairs resting.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, she\u2019s sleeping in an actual bed in a quiet room after getting outta jail. She must feel like royalty.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah. We finally get her out of that den of thieves and she comes home to a full dose of our resident bottom feeder.\" said by Jack\n\"Mm. Tucker? What happened?\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2013 I don\u2019t want you worrying about tucker. How are things going with summer?\" said by Jack\n\"Every time I try to get her to sit and talk to me, she jumps up and finds an excuse to take off.\" said by Kyle\n\"To where?\" said by Jack\n\"She packed up harrison and they took off to parts unknown, which is actually fine because the less she knows about me trying to dig up info on stark, the better.\" said by Kyle\n\"I hate that you\u2019re involved in any of that. I know I can\u2019t stop you. Promise me you will be careful.\" said by Jack\n\"I got it. Daniel.\" said by Kyle\n\"Hey, kyle. Is your dad home?\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah, he\u2019s in there.\" said by Kyle\n\"Uh, whoa, whoa. We got one more coming.\" said by Daniel\n\"Who?\" said by Kyle\n\"Hey.\" said by Michael\n\"Hey.\" said by Kyle\n\"That would be me.\" said by Michael\n\"What\u2019s going on? Dad?\" said by Kyle\n\"I am not sure I know myself.\" said by Jack\n\"That makes three of us.\" said by Michael\n\"Where\u2019s summer?\" said by Daniel\n\"She\u2019s out.\" said by Kyle\n\"Good. Good. I don\u2019t\u2013 I don\u2019t think she\u2019s ready for what I\u2019m about to say.\" said by Daniel\n\"What\u2019s going on, daniel? What\u2019s wrong?\" said by Jack\n\"Phyllis is alive. \u2013 This is our premium platinum coverage map\" said by Daniel\n\"So, look, buddy, it\u2019s a lot, right? You know, it\u2019s kind of a big deal to find out that you\u2019re gonna have a new baby sister. I get that. But that doesn\u2019t mean your parents are gonna love you any less.\" said by Billy\n\"I know that. I\u2019m not five.\" said by Connor\n\"No, you\u2019re not. And that\u2019s a good thing. So, why don\u2019t you tell me what the problem is?\" said by Billy\n\"Because my life is picture perfect?\" said by Connor\n\"Well, you know, now that I think about it, you do have a lot going on. But everybody does. So, why don\u2019t you be specific. Why don\u2019t you tell me what you\u2019re upset about?\" said by Billy\n\"Does it even matter?\" said by Connor\n\"Should we start with ice cream?\" said by Johnny\n\"Mm. Words to live by.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Sorry, I\u2019m not really good at being a helpful big brother.\" said by Johnny\n\"But you\u2019re katie\u2019s big brother.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Yeah. And she\u2019s not really the worst as far as siblings go. Please do not tell her I said that.\" said by Johnny\n\"Cross my heart. You may not know this, but katie is crazy about you. I never had a brother or sister, so katie\u2019s lucky to have you. And connor is, too, even though he doesn\u2019t act like it all the time.\" said by Chelsea\n\"I\u2019ll be right back.\" said by Johnny\n\"You know, I have a lot of good memories of our time together.\" said by Harmony\n\"Do you?\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. One in particular.\" said by Harmony\n\"What is it?\" said by Devon\n\"Um, you were about four or five, I don\u2019t remember, but it doesn\u2019t matter. Um, there was this park near our place.\" said by Harmony\n\"Yeah, yeah.\" said by Devon\n\"It\u2019s this little sliver of land with, like, these bushes and swings and, um, there were these two toy cars sitting out there, almost like they were sitting there waiting for their owner to come back.\" said by Harmony\n\"Mm.\" said by Devon\n\"And so we stopped and we looked around and there was nobody around. So, the next morning when we came back, you\u2019d sneak a look to see, because you were afraid somebody might have come and claimed them, right? And so you go, \u201cone more day. One more day, mama. And then I can take \u2019em home.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cwell, that sounds fair to me.\u201d\" said by Harmony\n\"And then what happened?\" said by Devon\n\"Said you waited three whole days because you didn\u2019t want some kid to come back and not be able to find his toys.\" said by Harmony\n\"Oh.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. You just couldn\u2019t handle that. But when we came back to the park\u2013\" said by Harmony\n\"They were still there?\" said by Devon\n\"Yep. And you brought them home and you put them up on the shelf and you took such good care of them, like they were gold. Yeah. And that\u2019s when I knew who you were.\" said by Harmony\n\"And who\u2019s that?\" said by Devon\n\"A man that was willing to wait for his blessings. Who is generous. Who thinks about other people and wants to give other people a chance. And a man who really likes cars.\" said by Harmony\n\"[ Laughs ] You got the car part right for sure.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. You know, it\u2019s like those cars were meant for you. Like, this whole life that you\u2019ve created for yourself, it\u2019s meant for you. That\u2019s why I know that dominic will get all the blessings that were meant for him. And I\u2019m not talking about toys and money. I\u2019m talking about the things that money can\u2019t buy. You know, never-ending supply of people who will love and support and guide him. He\u2019s a very lucky little man indeed.\" said by Harmony\n\"Look, you don\u2019t understand. I have seen my mother.\" said by Daniel\n\"I\u2019ve seen your mother, too.\" said by Michael\n\"You have?\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah. In my thoughts.\" said by Michael\n\"No, no, no, no. Michael, I\u2019m talking about in real life. Living, breathing, speaking. Look, I got a phone call the other night, I don\u2019t know from who. They asked me to meet them in the park at the lookout. So, I went. It was mom. I mean, I thought I was hallucinating, but she was real. Her death was a lie.\" said by Daniel\n\"Wait, wait. Why didn\u2019t she call summer?\" said by Kyle\n\"I don\u2019t know, kyle. I don\u2019t know. Maybe she thought that summer was too loyal to you and jack and she couldn\u2019t trust her to be unbiased.\" said by Daniel\n\"Did she tell you what happened the night of the gala?\" said by Michael\n\"She did. She told me the whole story. She told me that stark had concocted this whole scheme to try and take down diane, just as we all suspected. And stark coerced her to\u2013 to help him. But he lied to her. He manipulated her. He threatened her. And eventually, she gave in and she did whatever he demanded.\" said by Daniel\n\"What about the fight? We\u2013 and we all saw her collapse.\" said by Jack\n\"We did. It was all staged, jack. And then after she was dead, she decided, you know, she was having second thoughts. She wanted to come back and tell everyone the truth. But\u2013 but stark, he\u2013 that\u2019s when he attacked her. You know, he had set up the revenge, the money, the disappearance. He had set that all up so perfectly that he wasn\u2019t about to let her ruin his plan.\" said by Daniel\n\"Oh, my god.\" said by Jack\n\"Everybody already thought she was dead. Nobody was gonna be looking for her. Nobody was gonna be missing her. She would\u2019ve been just another body to dispose of. So, she did what she had to do. She didn\u2019t have any other choice. She grabbed a pair of scissors\u2013\" said by Daniel\n\"Wait, phyllis? Phyllis killed stark?\" said by Michael\n\"A convicted criminal\u2013\" said by Daniel\n\"Murdered\u2013\" said by ", "answer": "Kyle"}
{"content": "\"Good, you\u2019re here already. My mom texted me. She said that she saw you.\" said by Summer\n\"Yes, um, you want some breakfast? My treat.\" said by Michael\n\"No, thank you. I just want to hear about my mom, I mean, what happened? Where is she? What is she going to do?\" said by Summer\n\"Uh, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to take those one at a time. Um, as to what happened, I was expecting lauren for a romantic rendezvous and, uh, phyllis knocked on the door instead.\" said by Michael\n\"How did she look? Is she okay?\" said by Summer\n\"She\u2019s stressed. She\u2019s tired from being on the run. She\u2019s very concerned about you.\" said by Michael\n\"Okay, but what\u2013 what happened? What did\u2013 what did she say?\" said by Summer\n\"We had a very productive talk about her options. She ate all the chocolate covered strawberries and then she left.\" said by Michael\n\"That\u2019s it? She didn\u2019t say where she\u2019s been hiding or where we could find her?\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m sorry, she did not.\" said by Michael\n\"But in her text, she said that she might have found a way out of this mess. I mean, is that true? Could she come home soon?\" said by Summer\n\"Who\u2019s there?\" said by Sharon\n\"It\u2019s nick. Morning.\" said by Nick\n\"New job, delivery man?\" said by Sharon\n\"Oh, yeah, nick\u2019s courier service. On time or we keep it.\" said by Nick\n\"Like it. How\u2019s your first day on leave?\" said by Sharon\n\"Not great, not loving it, but what choice do I have?\" said by Nick\n\"Well, you want some coffee? Although, you seem a little amped up already.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, I\u2019m just trying to figure out what I\u2019m gonna do with the rest of my day. You know, I can deliver you this, which was left for you at the gate.\" said by Nick\n\"Um, I\u2019m sure that\u2019s just my shampoo, you should set it right there. Actually, I do need some help this morning with this. I just don\u2019t have the skills, and you were always so good at this.\" said by Sharon\n\"Happy to be of service.\" said by Nick\n\"You\u2019re thinking what I am? That what happened yesterday should never have happened? Ultomiris is for adults with generalized myasthenia gravis\" said by Jack\n\"Additional sponsorship provided by\u2026 with a smooth clean shave,\" said by Announcer\n\"Thank you.\" said by Nick\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Sharon\n\"You know, I always did love that necklace.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, you gave it to me a million years ago.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, I have excellent taste.\" said by Nick\n\"You do. You know, you didn\u2019t have to come here and check on me. Which I know is the reason why you\u2019re here. I\u2019m fine. Just like I was last night when we spoke on the phone.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, you did that thing where you politely blow me off because you don\u2019t want me to worry about you, so I figured the best thing I can do is just crash your place and eyeball you and see how you\u2019re doing. So, how are you?\" said by Nick\n\"Um, it\u2019s a little intense sometimes. Little noises or flashes of light just send me right back into the nightmare.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, she was my first phone call this morning. Uh, she sounds good, you know? She\u2019s happy to be back with her friends. She sounds strong. Wish my other daughter was just as great. I\u2013\" said by Nick\n\"What\u2019s going on with summer?\" said by Sharon\n\"Have you heard that phyllis is alive and on the run?\" said by Nick\n\"Yes, I have heard that.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, not surprisingly, she has dragged summer into her drama and now it\u2019s blowing up her marriage.\" said by Nick\n\"Phyllis is a firestorm. Anybody who tries to stop her or tries to help her ends up getting burned, and far too often it is someone she loves. But I\u2019m glad that summer has you.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, I have lots of time to worry about her and sally and you and faith now.\" said by Nick\n\"So, this leave of absence?\" said by Sharon\n\"All victoria. I told her it wasn\u2019t necessary, but she insisted.\" said by Nick\n\"For how long?\" said by Sharon\n\"Seems indefinite.\" said by Nick\n\"Okay, well, being that it\u2019s your sister, I have to assume that she\u2019s just concerned about you and everything that you\u2019ve been dealing with.\" said by Sharon\n\"I have a feeling her concern isn\u2019t very sisterly.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, you can always come back to work at the coffee house.\" said by Sharon\n\"Oh, that is a tempting offer.\" said by Nick\n\"And I\u2019ll throw in all the free coffee you can drink.\" said by Sharon\n\"Okay.\" said by Nick\n\"You know what? I have to get to work.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah.\" said by Nick\n\"Hey. This isn\u2019t my shampoo. This is from an out-of-state law firm. That doesn\u2019t sound good.\" said by Sharon\n\"Which part shouldn\u2019t have happened?\" said by Kyle\n\"The division of this family. Traci had to stage an intervention to stop immediate warfare. I don\u2019t know how successful she was. I think at best we have a temporary detente.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, d\u00e9tentes are overrated.\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, I understand your pain. That phyllis would use her daughter to help her out of this mess of her own making. That she would force summer to choose between her husband and her mother. It\u2019s just more damage to this family courtesy of that woman and her hatred.\" said by Jack\n\"Summer was no victim. She was right in step with her mother. She chose phyllis over and over. Saw my mother get charged with murder, saw us in pain, still, she did nothing.\" said by Kyle\n\"Summer made a mistake.\" said by Jack\n\"It wasn\u2019t that long ago that she was furious at me because I lied to her about working with victor to get adam out of jabot.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah, that I remember quite well.\" said by Jack\n\"She was furious. I lied. She could barely get past the fact that I have violated our trust, and I own that mistake, but now she has done exactly the same thing, lying on top of lying. See, this time, it wasn\u2019t about a job at a company. It was about my mother\u2019s life. Her entire future.\" said by Kyle\n\"And she wants to make amends now.\" said by Jack\n\"How? She let me believe she was grieving her mother. Let my mom face the possibility of life in prison. Let me tie myself in knots trying to support my mother. I was desperate to help summer. Desperate. And she shut me out. Disregarded my love, disregarded my feelings for her and my mother.\" said by Kyle\n\"There\u2019s no doubt about it, she was wrong, but are you so hurt that you won\u2019t get past what has happened?\" said by Jack\n\"It is not about hurt. I don\u2019t know who she is anymore. Or maybe I\u2019m just finally seeing she really is her mother\u2019s daughter. Summer did whatever she needed to get what she wanted. Knowing she\u2019s capable of that and so easily, I don\u2019t see how I can trust her again.\" said by Kyle\n\"But don\u2019t you think that\u2019s a little harsh?\" said by Jack\n\"Summer and i are separating dad. I told her to move out.\" said by Kyle\n\"Your mother\u2019s future is still pretty much up in the air. And more than a lot of it depends on phyllis.\" said by Michael\n\"You\u2019re gonna help her, right?\" said by Summer\n\"Of course I will. I\u2019m committed to bringing phyllis back. She has that special type of mayhem we all need in our life. But your mother is a stubborn woman. Even with the odds against her, she insists that things play out on her terms. And that is just something I can\u2019t promise.\" said by Michael\n\"And that\u2019s why she didn\u2019t stick around?\" said by Summer\n\"It\u2019s not like I didn\u2019t try. I begged her to turn herself in. I ran up and down the list of reasons why it\u2019d be the least stupid thing she could do. I told her we love her, we miss her. We\u2019re ready to fight for her.\" said by Michael\n\"And she still refused.\" said by Summer\n\"She\u2019s afraid. Christine is at the end of all this. Phyllis is convinced that christine will hit her with every charge in the book and even a few extra just for kicks. The only commitment I could get from your mom is that she would think about it and examine her options.\" said by Michael\n\"Even if there are legal consequences, I mean, it\u2019s got to be better than all of this craziness. The uncertainty.\" said by Summer\n\"I would like this all to be over so I could see you smile again.\" said by Michael\n\"As much as I love my mom and I want her to come home\u2026 I\u2013 I\u2013 I still can\u2019t believe that she did this to us. To me, I mean, even if we figure out all of her problems, there\u2019s still going to be collateral damage.\" said by Summer\n\"What, uh, specific collateral damage are we talking about?\" said by Michael\n\"I might need a lawyer myself. (Wheezing)\" said by Summer\n\"\u201cDear miss newman, this letter is to inform you that I represent the estate of cameron kirsten. Per his instructions, I\u2019ve been authorized to forward you the items included in this box in the event of his death.\u201d\" said by Sharon\n\"You and summer are separating? I am so sorry it has come to that.\" said by Jack\n\"I don\u2019t see any other way.\" said by Kyle\n\"When we saw you last night, you said you realized that staying away wasn\u2019t going to fix anything. I assumed, I hoped, that that was leading toward healing.\" said by Jack\n\"There was no hope in that decision. It was resignation. Why put off the inevitable?\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, is this really what you want? You\u2019re ready to give up on your marriage?\" said by Jack\n\"Summer chose to do that when she decided to betray everything I thought we had and\u2013 and so damn easily. Who knows? Maybe if she hadn\u2019t gotten caught, she would still be lying to me.\" said by Kyle\n\"Oh, you\u2019re in pain. And it\u2019s deep and there are no easy remedies, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019re also aware there has been a lot of forgiveness in this house recently for crimes far more serious than summer\u2019S.\" said by Jack\n\"I guess I\u2019m not as forgiving as you are.\" said by Kyle\n\"I don\u2019t believe that. I believe you are forgiving. You forgave your mother. I did too.\" said by Jack\n\"Not the same. When I see summer, I see someone who didn\u2019t love me enough to be honest. She took me and everything we had for granted. She blew all of our trust to hell. How do you love without that? How is there ever any coming back from what she\u2019s done?\" said by Kyle\n\"I would never turn you away if you needed help, summer, but I\u2019m not sure why you would need legal representation.\" said by Michael\n\"Uh, I haven\u2019t been completely upfront with you.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh.\" said by Michael\n\"Mom reached out to me first, not daniel.\" said by Summer\n\"What?\" said by Michael\n\"And he covered for me. And I was keeping her\u2013 her secret, unlike him. And when I found out that he was telling everyone, I was furious. So, when she revealed where she was hiding\u2026\" said by Summer\n\"You said nothing.\" said by Michael\n\"Yeah. I brought her food and clothes. I tried to help her figure everything out and I don\u2019t know how many laws I broke. I mean, aiding and abetting a fugitive, obstruction of justice. Uh, how much time can you get for them?\" said by Summer\n\"All right, all right you\u2019re getting ahead of yourself.\" said by Michael\n\"Am I? Because chance told me that christine was just waiting to find my mom before she brought charges against me, so it kind of seems like it\u2019s going to happen.\" said by Summer\n\"You spoke to chance about possible charges against you?\" said by Michael\n\"As a friend.\" said by Summer\n\"Uh, when your mother is on the run for serious crimes and you\u2019ve aided and abetted her. Never, ever, ever talk to policemen as a friend. Can\u2013 can we agree on that before moving forward?\" said by Michael\n\"Yeah.\" said by Summer\n\"Is there any more of that collateral damage you mentioned?\" said by Michael\n\"Uh, my husband hates me.\" said by Summer\n\"Kyle could never hate you. He loves you.\" said by Michael\n\"I was protecting my mom while his mom sat in prison. I mean, I\u2013 I lied to him for weeks. And I hated it so much. Even when I wasn\u2019t lying, I was pushing him away and now, he can\u2019t even look at me so\u2026 I might also need a divorce attorney.\" said by Summer\n\"No. It\u2019s too soon. You\u2019re young, you\u2019re in love, you have a child. Kyle will come around.\" said by Michael\n\"Michael, he already said that he wants a separation. He asked me to move out. Does it sound like he\u2019s getting ready to forgive me?\" said by Summer\n\"Look, you just have to give kyle some time. You know, this has been rough for everybody.\" said by Michael\n\"If you\u2019re thinking about making, you know, a smooth escape, look, I get it. No pressure from my end.\" said by Audra\n\"I don\u2019t wanna go home.\" said by Kyle\n\"Excuse me?\" said by Audra\n\"I\u2019m sorry about the intrusion. I\u2019m\u2013\" said by Audra\n\"Audra charles. Yes, she was the one that broke noah\u2019s heart a while ago.\" said by Summer\n\"But luckily, we both moved on. I hope he and allie are very happy back in london. And you are michael baldwin. Quite a phenom in this town. Attorney extraordinaire.\" said by Audra\n\"It depends on who you talk to. But I also know of you from my dealings with newman enterprises. Victor\u2019s acquisition of mccall unlimited.\" said by Michael\n\"That\u2019s right. Small world.\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah.\" said by Michael\n\"I haven\u2019t seen you since, um, the gala.\" said by Summer\n\"That\u2019s right. It was such a terrible night. You know, I was there when your mother collapsed. To later learn that she died. Look, I can\u2019t imagine the grief that you were going through, but how wonderful that she\u2019s actually alive. Apparently somewhere. You must feel like you\u2019re on a roller coaster. You know, but thank god you have your husband and his family to support you.\" said by Audra\n\"Is there something that you want?\" said by Summer\n\"Kyle, I know you\u2019re angry and you have every right to be, but I honestly believe that your love for summer is much stronger than what you\u2019re feeling right now. Listen, kyle, I know this from experience. Anger is a very potent emotion. It can blind you. It can fuel you to make decisions you\u2019ll come to regret. All I\u2019m suggesting is that you not act this second. Just give it some time for the anger to dissipate, and you can reevaluate.\" said by Jack\n\"I have thought this through, dad. This decision is not based off of emotion. It is based off of fact.\" said by Kyle\n\"The reality is this is a\u2013\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, no, no, no. The reality is my wife has proven she will always, always side with her mother against mine and me. That is a fact. And phyllis will be back in our lives soon. Whispering into summer\u2019s ear, also a fact. So tell me, dad. How does my already broken marriage survive that chaos?\" said by Kyle\n\"This cannot be happening. This is just like before. Random packages being delivered here, at the coffee house just to freak me out.\" said by Sharon\n\"We\u2019re not playing cameron\u2019s games anymore. Sharon, he\u2019s dead. Let\u2019s get rid of it. I\u2019ll throw it out right now. We can burn it if you want.\" said by Nick\n\"Wait, no. We should go through it first.\" said by Sharon\n\"Why? It\u2019s just gonna drag up memories that we\u2019re trying to forget.\" said by Nick\n\"Believe me, no one is more creeped out by this than me. But, no matter what is in that box, cameron can\u2019t hurt us anymore.\" said by Sharon\n\"The young and the restless will continue.\" said by Announcer\n\"Seems like cameron was into journaling all his teenage angst. Uh, here\u2019s a good one. \u201cI\u2019m going to be somebody, not like these losers. I\u2019m going to be rich. Super rich. So rich no one can stop me and I\u2019m going to marry the most beautiful woman in the world. Leave all these suckers behind.\u201d I mean, the kid had goals.\" said by Nick\n\"Let\u2019s see what\u2019s in here. Hmm. Frankie.\" said by Sharon\n\"Okay.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, and this must be\u2026\" said by Sharon\n\"The dog\u2019s ashes.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah. Me neither. Wow. So much for the family photo with his parents.\" said by Sharon\n\"With faces ripped out. Guessing they were pretty close.\" said by Nick\n\"And there\u2019s frankie, I think.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah. Something else in here what\u2019s this? What do you think this is doing in here?\" said by Nick\n\"It\u2019s clearly paperwork for cameron\u2019s company, kirsten incorporated. Oh, my gosh. Cameron\u2019s entire business has been signed over to me.\" said by Sharon\n\"What?\" said by Nick\n\"Kyle, there are no easy answers.\" said by Jack\n\"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me spell it out for you. Phyllis will swoop back into town. Michael will do his thing. She will face minimal charges and go back to upending everyone\u2019s life because that\u2019s who she is. She will not be repentant. She will still hate my mother and she has a tidal pull on summer. I refuse to be a part of that circus, and I will not let my son be a part of it as well.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah, I\u2019ve been concerned about how this all affects harrison, too. There\u2019s been too much anger and upset in this house for too long.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, and too much has been generated by my wife. Dad, I\u2013 I remember. I remember, right there, when I approached summer about telling harrison that phyllis had died and she refused. She came up with all kinds of excuses and I felt sorry for her. What an idiot I was. Of course she knew phyllis was alive. Dad, and she was willing to put harrison right in the middle of her damn drama.\" said by Kyle\n\"For what it\u2019s worth, kyle, I honestly think summer is remorseful\" said by Jack\n\"Please, the tears. The desperation to talk, to apologize, and she\u2019s suddenly all about our great love. As if she didn\u2019t treat me like the enemy for weeks! Blame me for not giving her the space she needed! All so she could keep phyllis\u2019s dirty little secret. Oh, the entire time, the entire time I was trying to help her. Be there for her. Comfort her. She was sacrificing my mother to protect hers.\" said by Kyle\n\"And diane has forgiven summer.\" said by Jack\n\"How forgiving do you think mom will be towards phyllis? No matter how resigned she seems about doing nothing and letting phyllis\u2019s karma come back and bite her? When those two come face to face again, all bets are off. Yeah, dad, look at what she just pulled with me. Lying about harrison? If she\u2019s willing to play me like that, how far is she willing to go to make phyllis pay for trying to destroy her life? You cannot tell me you\u2019re not a little worried about that.\" said by Kyle\n\"I will allow that that could become an issue.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, it is already a giant issue, dad. As much as traci wants peace in this house, I see nothing but trouble ahead, especially for me and summer. I will do everything I can to protect my son. That is why my mind is made up. That is why summer and i are separating.\" said by Kyle\n\"I apologize again for the interruption. I just wanted to offer my condolences if your mother really is gone.\" said by Audra\n\"Thanks.\" said by Summer\n\"Same here.\" said by Michael\n\"You wouldn\u2019t be wrong. Is it just me, or when it comes to my mom, does everyone in this town want information or have an opinion?\" said by Summer\n\"Well, the phyllis trauma has sparked morbid curiosity from more than a few corners.\" said by Michael\n\"The worst part about it is whether she decides to come home or stay away, it\u2019s just gonna get worse. When migraine strikes, you\u2019re faced with a choice.\" said by Summer\n\"Cameron left you his company? This cannot be legit. It\u2019s got to be another one of his crazy games.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, nothing he does surprises me. Check the date, it\u2019s from last year.\" said by Sharon\n\"Which means he put all this in motion just in case his plan failed or he died. It\u2019s an amazing way to keep toying with you from beyond the grave.\" said by ", "answer": "Nick"}
{"content": "\"Thank you. Hey, stranger.\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, hey. How are you?\" said by Chelsea\n\"I\u2019m good. God, I feel like I haven\u2019t seen you in ages.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah, I \u2014 I didn\u2019t get out much for a while, crimson lights being the exception.\" said by Chelsea\n\"And the last time i did see you, I think I was, um, offering you a job at marchetti, and you turned me down flat.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, not \u2014 not you. It just wasn\u2019t a right job for me.\" said by Chelsea\n\"I heard that you were taking some time off for some personal stuff. How \u2014 how\u2019s that going?\" said by Summer\n\"Um, yeah, it\u2019s been a challenge. Um, I went through a really rough patch in the fall. But the worst is behind me, and I\u2019ve come out the other side stronger than ever.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Oh, that\u2019s really good to hear. But, uh, you still don\u2019t want to come work for me at marchetti?\" said by Summer\n\"No.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Hey, ash.\" said by Billy\n\"Hi.\" said by Ashley\n\"Are you alone?\" said by Billy\n\"I am.\" said by Ashley\n\"Okay. Well, I was gonna sit at the bar to work through my 10,000 thoughts going through my head, but I could use the company. Do you mind?\" said by Billy\n\"Sit down. No, not at all.\" said by Ashley\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Billy\n\"What\u2019s going on with you?\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, uh\u2026 that\u2019s a good question, actually. We haven\u2019t been able to catch up since you got back from paris.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah.\" said by Ashley\n\"Why did you come back so quickly? I figured you\u2019d be there for a few months, you know, with the opportunity to work out of the paris office.\" said by Billy\n\"Right. I know. Good question. But abby\u2019s here, and she\u2019s going through a lot. I got my grandson \u2014 dom. So, there\u2019s that.\" said by Ashley\n\"Ah. I see.\" said by Billy\n\"You see what? What do you see?\" said by Ashley\n\"[ Sighs ] I mean, I heard rumors that since you\u2019ve been back, you\u2019ve been in contact with tucker.\" said by Billy\n\"So?\" said by Ashley\n\"I mean, what\u2019s going on there? Are you playing an angle?\" said by Billy\n\"Why would I have to be playing an angle?\" said by Ashley\n\"Because he\u2019s tucker mccall and there\u2019s no other reason to interact with him.\" said by Billy\n\"Hi.\" said by Devon\n\"Hi.\" said by Tucker\n\"Thanks for getting here so quickly.\" said by Devon\n\"Sure. I was anxious to hear what you had to say. And I know that it\u2019s not easy for you to reach out to me.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, just so we\u2019re clear, this is strictly a business discussion.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. Fine. No father/son emotional crap.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah, something like that.\" said by Devon\n\"So, does this mean you\u2019re starting to see the value in taking over mccall?\" said by Tucker\n\"I\u2019ve definitely been giving it a look over.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay. That\u2019s a good start.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, actually, i found out that you took the idea of selling your company to newman enterprises first. So the notion that this is all about me and carrying on your legacy is clearly a lie, right?\" said by Devon\n\"Thank you.\" said by Ashley\n\"Look, tucker mccall is bad news, okay? You know that. Everyone knows that. And I really don\u2019t like the idea of you being sucked back into his orbit. He\u2019s caused you a lot of pain.\" said by Billy\n\"And you don\u2019t think that I am capable of protecting myself or being smart enough to make the right decision?\" said by Ashley\n\"No, on the contrary, i think you are the smartest person I know. But when it comes to matters of the heart, all the intelligence gets thrown out the window.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, that\u2019s true. I mean, case in point \u2014 jack reuniting with diane.\" said by Ashley\n\"Exactly.\" said by Billy\n\"Exactly, but didn\u2019t you advocate for everybody to give her a second chance when diane came back to town?\" said by Ashley\n\"I did. I did say something of the sort.\" said by Billy\n\"But you don\u2019t think tucker deserves the same thing.\" said by Ashley\n\"You know why.\" said by Billy\n\"No, I don\u2019t know why.\" said by Ashley\n\"He\u2019s one of those guys that\u2019s not ever going to change.\" said by Billy\n\"Billy, you\u2019re one of those guys that\u2019s not ever going to change, and yet you constantly ask for support every time you think it\u2019s time for you now to start, you know, cleaning up your act.\" said by Ashley\n\"Okay, yes, I have done that many, many times. And I appreciate it every single time. But the difference is, when I am going to redeem myself or trying to change, I actually mean it. It\u2019s not part of some elaborate scam.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, I actually think that people who try to change are sincere. Whether or not they accomplish it is, of course, a different deal.\" said by Ashley\n\"So, you think that it\u2019s possible for tucker to change? Because \u2014 let me just be clear \u2014 I don\u2019T. I really don\u2019T. I think that he is perfectly fine being an agent of chaos.\" said by Billy\n\"I don\u2019t think you\u2019re in a position to judge him, let alone be his jury and executioner.\" said by Ashley\n\"Wow, you really are defending the guy, aren\u2019t you?\" said by Billy\n\"Actually, I\u2019m just not cynical like you.\" said by Ashley\n\"You have feelings for him again, don\u2019t you? Have you not learned anything?\" said by Billy\n\"So, are you designing again? If so, I would love to see your sketches. You know how much I respect your work.\" said by Summer\n\"Thank you. But, no, actually, I\u2019m trying something new.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Ooh. Exciting. What are you doing? Can you give me a little hint?\" said by Summer\n\"I \u2014 it\u2019s kind of hard to explain. I can\u2019t really tell you right now, but, um, it doesn\u2019t have to do with fashion. It\u2019s something that\u2019s very personal to me.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Hmm. Okay. Well, I look forward to hearing more about it when you\u2019re ready.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah. Well, I want to share it with you when it\u2019s worthy. Uh, but for now, I\u2019m just hoping that this caffeine kicks in so i can get past this creative stumbling block I\u2019m going through.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Does that usually work for you?\" said by Summer\n\"Mm\u2026 ahh! Sometimes.\" said by Chelsea\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Summer\n\"But really, I think it\u2019s just that my \u2014 my personal life is impinging on my work.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Oh, I know a little something about that. I don\u2019t think that a day goes by that there\u2019s not some sort of family drama at jabot.\" said by Summer\n\"Mm. Well, that makes sense. I mean, your mom works with you.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Actually, um, she doesn\u2019t anymore. I had to fire her.\" said by Summer\n\"You fired phyllis?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, believe me, I had cause. And honestly, the work environment has improved greatly, but my family life has definitely taken a toll and\u2026 I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s been \u2014 it\u2019s been really hard. I sort of had to learn how to compartmentalize.\" said by Summer\n\"Trust me, I\u2019ve done a lot of that. But I have realized that pushing things aside doesn\u2019t always lead to healthy results, so just be careful.\" said by Chelsea\n\"I will. Thank you. And, um, good luck to you on your new path. I\u2019m really excited for you.\" said by Summer\n\"I appreciate that. I\u2019ll see you around.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Bye.\" said by Summer\n\"Bye.\" said by Chelsea\n\"This is summer. Wait, is there a reason why communications hasn\u2019t handled that already? Right. Diane\u2019s away. No, no, no, yeah. I\u2019m just gonna get a refill, and I will be back to the office very soon.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, I\u2019d taken on a lot of debt, and so newman was prepared to buy that debt to force me to sell it to them. It\u2019s really that simple.\" said by Tucker\n\"Mm.\" said by Devon\n\"But I would never ask you to take on a debt-ridden, uh, failing organization.\" said by Tucker\n\"Okay. So, what\u2019s changed?\" said by Devon\n\"Um\u2026 [ Chuckles ] A benefactor came in and consolidated the debt before victoria had a chance to make her play. So now the company is in a much better spot. And you can buy it for pennies on the dollar.\" said by Tucker\n\"Is that \u2019cause that\u2019s all it\u2019s worth? \u2018Cause I honestly am getting the feeling that this is just your way of trying to dump a failing company onto the nearest sucker, who just happens to be me.\" said by Devon\n\"[ Sighs ] Devon\u2026 this company is all I have had in my life for a very long time. Every thought I had, every ounce of effort I put forth was an attempt to make it something special. And even now, as it\u2019s faltering, it\u2019s not something I would ever just dump on someone. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m really \u2014 I\u2019m sorry to hear you say that \u2019cause that is not my intention, honestly. So, I\u2019m gonna go.\" said by Tucker\n\"You don\u2019t have to go. You don\u2019t have to go. \u2018Cause if you\u2019re telling the truth, I\u2019m still interested in buying it. Taking over your company is an enticing offer. That\u2019s it, I\u2019m going on a dunkin\u2019 run.\" said by Devon\n\"Ha! You\u2019re right. Well, I\u2019m glad you got back to me so soon. I really appreciate that. Right. Definitely. Let\u2019s talk next week. You too. Ah, just crazy running into you here.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Is it crazy? \u2018Cause I usually come here a couple of times a day.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh. Oh. Well, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re doing that. Good for you. You\u2019re very hard-working. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re finding that life/work balance.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yeah, I have a pretty good handle on that.\" said by Summer\n\"Mm. Good for you. Good for you. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s hard to find time with your busy schedule for harrison and kyle.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Not really. They\u2019re the most important parts of my life.\" said by Summer\n\"You know, I am just not interested in discussing my romantic entanglements with you.\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, my g\u2013 even hearing you say \u201cromantic entanglements\u201d makes me\u2026\" said by Billy\n\"Get over it.\" said by Ashley\n\"Okay, fine. If you\u2019re not gonna take any brotherly concern from me, what about jack?\" said by Billy\n\"[ Laughs ] That\u2019s funny.\" said by Ashley\n\"I mean, he\u2019s got to really not love this entanglement that you \u2014\" said by Billy\n\"Jack doesn\u2019t have any credibility.\" said by Ashley\n\"Why?\" said by Billy\n\"Well, obviously because of his relationship with diane. I mean, he moved her in. And I never thought of a house as big as ours could feel crowded, but indeed it does.\" said by Ashley\n\"Well, I mean, you could always move out.\" said by Billy\n\"It\u2019s the family home, which means it\u2019s my home, and I\u2019m not going anywhere. Thank you very much. Have you given jack any kind of grief at all for going back with diane, somebody who faked her own death?\" said by Ashley\n\"I have decided to let jack make his own decisions. Who am I to judge?\" said by Billy\n\"You are such an ass. You know that? You\u2019re an ass.\" said by Ashley\n\"I know. I know.\" said by Billy\n\"So, you give jack a pass, but you have no problem judging me.\" said by Ashley\n\"Ashley, you\u2019re my sister, okay? It\u2019s a different situation.\" said by Billy\n\"Whoa! Spoken like a true chauvinist, billy. Are you aware that diane has specifically and repeatedly caused me harm? Now, granted, tucker is an egotist and he takes himself way too seriously, but your double standard is disgusting and egregious.\" said by Ashley\n\"Okay. Maybe you have a point.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah, maybe I do.\" said by Ashley\n\"Look, I know, okay? It\u2019s not fair for me to judge anyone else\u2019s messy affairs.\" said by Billy\n\"What are you saying? You\u2019re having an affair already?\" said by Ashley\n\"No, I\u2019m not.\" said by Billy\n\"What?\" said by Ashley\n\"But, you know, I mean, there is someone that, um\u2026 look, I\u2019m trying to be thoughtful and I\u2019m trying to take my time and be conscientious. This, you know\u2026\" said by Billy\n\"Very novel for you. Gosh, I can\u2019t wait till you go public with your relationship so I can just judge the hell out of it.\" said by Ashley\n\"Okay, and \u2014 and \u2014 and because of that right there, I just want to straight up apologize. I am very sorry if you are offended by this line of questioning.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah, you should be sorry.\" said by Ashley\n\"Whatever you have going on with that manipulative, scheming megalomaniac\u2026 it\u2019s none of my business.\" said by Billy\n\"I mean, the company is a mess.\" said by Devon\n\"Thank you.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah. Look, I know you put your heart and soul into it, but it just seems like it\u2019s a big collection of a bunch of unrelated divisions that were either acquired or developed on a whim, without any real forethought.\" said by Devon\n\"[ Chuckles ] Thanks.\" said by Tucker\n\"It\u2019s true.\" said by Devon\n\"Actually, several times in the last few years, I\u2019ve considered restoring the core divisions and concentrating on them and their strengths, namely music and entertainment.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, that sounds like a great idea. Why don\u2019t you do that?\" said by Devon\n\"Well, \u2019cause I\u2019m a \u2014 I\u2019m a collector. It\u2019s part of my dna. I just got to have more, more more. I see a shiny object, I just have to have it.\" said by Tucker\n\"Mm.\" said by Devon\n\"It\u2019s one of my many weaknesses.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, I think that you\u2019re right about music and entertainment because that\u2019s where your assets are the strongest and that\u2019s where your staff is the most knowledgeable. And they\u2019ve already made a good reputation in the industry, so it\u2019s good infrastructure.\" said by Devon\n\"The infrastructure\u2019s good.\" said by Tucker\n\"The only thing that\u2019s a little outdated is your distribution. It\u2019s a little 20th-century.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah, except there\u2019s a big demand for old stuff right now \u2014 vinyl, cds, even cassettes.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s true. I was thinking that you could possibly capitalize on a niche market.\" said by Devon\n\"Mm-hmm. So, what would you do with the less successful divisions? Just scrap them?\" said by Tucker\n\"No, I wouldn\u2019t do that at first. I would \u2014 I would want to take a look at what you have and see how the divisions could actually work with each other. Like, you have this random trucking company out of san antonio.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. Did I tell you how I bought that one?\" said by Tucker\n\"No.\" said by Devon\n\"So, one of their drivers cut me off on the interstate, and the truck had one of those bumper stickers, you know, \u201chow is my driving? Call 1-800\u2026\u201d\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah.\" said by Devon\n\"So I called [Laughs] Bought the company, and fired the driver.\" said by Tucker\n\"Okay. Well, we\u2019re not gonna be doing anything like that moving forward.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay, good. Yeah.\" said by Tucker\n\"So, my thought was we can use the trucking company for artists when they go on tours, to haul everything.\" said by Devon\n\"That\u2019s brilliant.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah?\" said by Devon\n\"Seriously. Yeah. That\u2019s brilliant. And you could use the media division to stream those concerts. There you go. There\u2019s more revenue.\" said by Tucker\n\"That\u2019s not a bad idea at all. Yeah, I can see how this could work.\" said by Devon\n\"Absolutely. See? Well, look, we\u2019re working well together already.\" said by Tucker\n\"Hmm. Unless you treat dandruff regularly,\" said by Devon\n\"Honestly, devon, i have faith that you and I can finally find some common ground, and maybe mccall unlimited is the way.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, I don\u2019t know how you figure me buying your company is gonna help with us.\" said by Devon\n\"Well, you buy the company and hire me to work for you.\" said by Tucker\n\"I\u2019m not gonna do that.\" said by Devon\n\"Why not?\" said by Tucker\n\"What do you mean?\" said by Devon\n\"Well, who knows this company better than me? I mean, look, we\u2019re already on the same page, obviously. So, with your vision and my, um, uh, institutional knowledge, so to speak, we can\u2019t lose.\" said by Tucker\n\"No, we can lose.\" said by Devon\n\"Well, but we\u2019re not gonna lose. Trust me. Hell, I could just be the advisor to the ceo.\" said by Tucker\n\"[ Chuckling ] Advisor. Alright, so, let me make sure I\u2019m clear on all this. You are willing to sell me the company that you created and then take a smaller role to try and fix our relationship?\" said by Devon\n\"Absolutely.\" said by Tucker\n\"Hmm.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay, well, um, I\u2019ll let you be on your way, so\u2026\" said by Phyllis\n\"Thanks.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh! Hey, summer, I got a gift for harrison.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Oh. That\u2019s nice of you.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah. When I saw it in the window, it just screamed harrison. It was so cute. So \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 maybe i can bring it by or \u2014 you know, scratch that. I want to avoid jack and diane, so I\u2019m not gonna bring it by. Maybe I\u2019ll have it delivered or s\u2013 wait. They went on a trip, right?\" said by Summer\n\"Um\u2026yeah. I-I don\u2019t think that they\u2019ll be back for a while.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh! Oh, it\u2019s an extended vacation.\" said by Phyllis\n\"No, but you can drop harrison\u2019s gift off anytime, mom.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay. Well, that seems fun. Where\u2019d they go? Dubai? Someplace exotic?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Are you seriously fishing for information right now?\" said by Summer\n\"Why would I care about them?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s the big question. Why do you care about them?\" said by Summer\n\"Ugh.\" said by Phyllis\n\"I mean, but you seem awfully curious about their whereabouts.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay, summer. I couldn\u2019t care less about jack and diane.\" said by Phyllis\n\"I don\u2019t buy it, mom. And honestly I just wish that you would stop using harrison in your plots for revenge against diane. It\u2019s insulting.\" said by Summer\n\"I got a gift for harrison.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Did you? Really?\" said by Summer\n\"Summer \u2014\" said by Phyllis\n\"No, mom. I\u2019m serious. I don\u2019t want any part of any of your schemes against diane. Just leave her alone already.\" said by Summer\n\"Summer.\" said by Phyllis\n\"So, it somewhat appears that your love life is on track, I guess. What about your work life? Do you have a job?\" said by Ashley\n\"Funny you should ask that, actually. Jack offered me a job. He asked me to come back to jabot.\" said by Billy\n\"No. Wait, he asked you to come back and you\u2019re considering it? You can\u2019t do that. It\u2019s always been a disaster, billy. I mean, think about this.\" said by Ashley\n\"Ashley, look at me. I\u2019m a changed man.\" said by Billy\n\"[ Laughing ] Oh! So, you think that people are capable of adjusting their behavior and becoming functioning members of society.\" said by Ashley\n\"I do believe some people are capable of that.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, then you must believe that there\u2019s hope for tucker.\" said by Ashley\n\"[ Sighs ] Look, maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 tucker could prove me wrong. And then again, maybe I\u2019ll prove jack and you and everyone else who cares about me wrong, too, that I am capable of change. And I have to say, this relationship is unique. It\u2019s really, you know, helped me see things in a different light, put my priorities straight. I don\u2019t want to take things for granted, like family. So, yeah, I want to work with my family at the company that our father built.\" said by Billy\n\"Sounds like you\u2019re taking the job.\" said by Ashley\n\"Jack, it\u2019s me. Give me a call when you get a chance. I want to talk about this proposal.\" said by ", "answer": "Billy"}

He told us the news that, um, he found proof that our mom is alive.\" said by Summer\n\"No more doubts. No more questions. It\u2019s undeniable. Chance is absolutely sure.\" said by Daniel\n\"That means that the charges against diane are gonna be dropped. You believed that your mom was innocent this whole time. You were right. I\u2019m sorry that I blamed her for a murder that didn\u2019t even happen.\" said by Summer\n\"You were racked with grief. I know how hard it is to face a pain like that.\" said by Kyle\n\"And you know exactly what it feels like to find out that it was all lie.\" said by Summer\n\"Of course, I do.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019m so sorry. I hope that you can forgive me.\" said by Summer\n\"Of course, I can. You were in pain and needed answers. All the clues pointed to my mom because that\u2019s what stark wanted. I\u2019m just glad he can never hurt anyone ever again.\" said by Kyle\n\"So hasst that happened yet? Has she been formally released?\" said by Summer\n\"It\u2019s true. My mom is free.\" said by Kyle\n\"Thanks for letting me hang out at your offices today.\" said by Lucy\n\"Of course.\" said by Lily\n\"Those coders were so cool. I mean, it\u2019s a totally different crore than my mom\u2019s office friends.\" said by Lucy\n\"Yeah. I know. Well, of course. And they have amazing fashion sense.

Lucy, whatever it is, I promise you can ask me.\" said by Lily\n\"Is it true that you and my dad were married when you guys were basically kids?\" said by Lucy\n\"What is going on? Oh, did you feel that too?\" said by Sally\n\"Mariah, you don\u2019t have to stay to help clean up. I\u2019ve got this.\" said by Faith\n\"Oh, no, you\u2013 you just got home. You can go unpack or hang out with dorm cat.\" said by Mariah\n\"His name is borgnine, as you know. And he\u2019s probably still sleeping. So, I\u2019m on cleanup duty. And you know just how much I love washing dirty dishes.\" said by Faith\n\"I know that. So, I\u2019m gonna let you wash and I will dry.\" said by Mariah\n\"Thanks. How kind of you.\" said by Faith\n\"Well, I gave you a chance to escape, but you sort of blew it, so.\" said by Mariah\n\"I mean, will you look at these pictures? The greatest collection of women who\u2019ve ever been assembled. The photographer\u2019s obviously very talented. He crushed it.\" said by Nick\n\"Poor dad. You can\u2019t actually take credit for all of our fabulousness. All you did was take the picture.\" said by Faith\n\"That\u2019s a skill, faith. I mean, you can\u2019t just aim and shoot, all right? The framing, the lighting, it\u2019s all perfect. I mean, ask your mom. She\u2019s impressed.\" said by Nick\n\"Mom?\" said by Faith\n\"Huh? Yeah. Uh, you\u2019re all wonderful and\u2013 and talented.\" said by Sharon\n\"Uh, sort of out of nowhere, but I will take it.\" said by Mariah\n\"What\u2019s going on? What\u2019s got you so distracted?

Bye, guys.\" said by Mariah\n\"Bye.\" said by Nick\n\"Bye.\" said by Sharon\n\"You did a great job covering. What was in the box that was delivered?\" said by Nick\n\"Okay.\" said by Sharon\n\"This is the motel where cameron attacked you. The son of a bitch has a twisted sense of humor.\" said by Nick\n\"Makes me sick to my stomach to think about it. But, he\u2019s in prison, right?\" said by Sharon\n\"I mean, he certainly should be. There\u2019s no way this lunatic should be out in the streets ever again.\" said by Nick\n\"Cameron is up to something. Sending me all of these little packages and gifts. What can he possibly want? What message is he trying to send?\" said by Sharon\n\"Hey.\" said by Chance\n\"Hey.\" said by Nick\n\"I got news about kirsten. It\u2019s not great.\" said by Chance\n\"Miss? Hey, I\u2013 I don\u2019t mean to bother you, but, um, are you okay?\" said by Cameron\n\"Yeah, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m fine. I just\u2013 I had a little double vision. It\u2019s just making me dizzy.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah. Well, look in\u2013 in your condition that\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s nothing to mess around with, uh. Can I\u2013 can I call somebody for you?\" said by Cameron\n\"Well, you must be relieved, kyle. Your mom\u2019s been vindicated. What our mother put you and the rest of your family through was brutal. Still can\u2019t believe she would do such a thing.\" said by Daniel\n\"But it wasn\u2019t mom\u2019s fault. You know, it was stark. He was the one that lured her in, manipulated her, threatened to kill her when she didn\u2019t do what he wanted.

And, you know, I\u2019m sure stark didn\u2019t expect to wind up dead.\" said by Daniel\n\"If stark had it his way, then mom would be the one that was dead right now. Both mom and diane are stark\u2019s victim.\" said by Summer\n\"Exactly. Just let your mom know how happy I am that this part of the nightmare is over for her and I\u2019m sorry that I couldn\u2019t do something to clear her sooner.\" said by Daniel\n\"I\u2019ll certainly pass along your message. And we\u2019ll always owe you a debt of gratitude for coming forward after hearing about phyllis.\" said by Kyle\n\"It was the only right thing to do.\" said by Daniel\n\"Even so, you could have kept phyllis\u2019s secret. I know you wanted to protect her at all costs, but you didn\u2019T. You came forward and set my mom free.\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, I can never stay quiet when someone\u2019s entire future is at stake. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to live with myself otherwise.\" said by Daniel\n\"I\u2013 I realize the emotions are complicated for both of you, but the good news is your mother is alive. It\u2019s like a miracle you secretly hope for, but never out loud. I get it. And when phyllis comes forward and explains why she did what she did, christine, the police, they\u2019ll listen. They\u2019ll try to be fair. I know you\u2019re worried about the repercussions, but phyllis is tough as hell. She\u2019ll get through it.\" said by Kyle\n\"There shouldn\u2019t be any repercussions. Anything criminal my mom did was in self-defense. She\u2019s not a murderer. She\u2019s just not. The D.A. Is gonna see that. She has to.

That\u2019s a yes.\" said by Lucy\n\"Okay. Have you talked to your dad about this?\" said by Lily\n\"No, not\u2013 not yet. But\u2013 but I can if you\u2019re not comfortable talking about it. I mean, dad will tell me the truth no matter what, even if it\u2019s that awful.\" said by Lucy\n\"Well, no, no, no, no. It\u2013 it wasn\u2019t awful. I mean, that\u2019s definitely an overstatement.\" said by Lily\n\"How old were you guys?\" said by Lucy\n\"Uh, we were not old enough to be married, that\u2019s for sure.\" said by Lily\n\"This is crazy. I mean, you\u2019re literally my dad\u2019s ex-wife and you guys just act like your old friends.\" said by Lucy\n\"Okay, listen. I do not condone what we did at such a young age. I do not.\" said by Lily\n\"Okay. Okay. I get it. I won\u2019t run off and marry some kid from homeroom. Tell me everything.\" said by Lucy\n\"Oh, gosh. Um\u2026\" said by Lily\n\"I mean, you guys said vows and there\u2013 there must have been a marriage license and then a divorce? I mean, just think about all the teasing I can get off of my dad. And wait, doesn\u2019t that make you guys each other\u2019s first loves? Wow. How romantic is that? Now you guys are together again. I mean, that\u2019s a book I\u2019d totally read.\" said by Lucy\n\"Okay, hold on.\" said by Lily\n\"Wait. And if my dad ever tells me that I\u2019m too young to know what love is, I can just point at you guys. I mean, star crossed lovers destined to finally be together.\" said by Lucy\n\"Okay, listen.\" said by Lily\n\"Weren\u2019t you guys in love?\" said by Lucy\n\"Of course. Yeah, we were very much in love and\u2013\" said by Lily\n\"Good. Then, you can\u2013\" said by Lucy\n\"Hello?\" said by Lily\n\"Hi.\" said by Daniel\n\"Hi.\" said by Lily\n\"These two little rays of sunshine. What did I miss?\" said by Daniel\n\"Nothing.\" said by Lucy and lily\n\"I\u2019m sick to my stomach already.\" said by Sharon\n\"What\u2019d you find out?\" said by Nick\n\"So, cameron kirsten was released after serving his original sentence.\" said by Chance\n\"Oh, no.\" said by Sharon\n\"And then he relocated to los angeles.\" said by Chance\n\"Is he still in L.A.?\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, he was arrested there for assaulting his girlfriend.\" said by Chance\n\"That\u2019s his thing. This coward, he goes after women.\" said by Nick\n\"Same thing he did to me.\" said by Sharon\n\"Look at this.\" said by Chance\n\"That\u2019s his girlfriend?\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah. She looks just like you. I doubt that\u2019s a coincidence.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, do you know where he is now?\" said by Nick\n\"No. He was released six months ago and his whereabouts are unknown.\" said by Chance\n\"Doesn\u2019t he have like a parole officer keeping tabs on him or something?\" said by Nick\n\"I read the report and I\u2019ll admit, it\u2019s kinda sketchy. So, what\u2019s the deal with this guy? I mean, clearly he\u2019s dangerous and outta control.

I trusted him and he became violent.\" said by Sharon\n\"He assaulted you.\" said by Chance\n\"I didn\u2019t want nick to find out what cameron had done to me. I was just going through so much at the time. So, I kept quiet and I never went to the police. I just hid out in denver and waited for my wounds to heal. It was a really hard time in my life. I just wanted to forget that it had ever happened, but I didn\u2019t have a choice when cameron showed up in genoa city. You have to realize that when you saw me in denver, I was a different person.\" said by Sharon\n\"Oh, oh yeah? When\u2013 when exactly was that? When you were sitting on that bar stool pretty as a picture slamming tequila shots?\" said by Cameron\n\"I was in a very down, a very down time.

Will you please, please just leave me alone.\" said by Sharon\n\"You were married and you had children when I met you in denver, and you still slept with me.\" said by Cameron\n\"No, no.

Do you honestly think that if I had known what I was doing, if I had known what kind of man you are, I would let you take me back to that hotel room?\" said by Sharon\n\"You think I\u2019m a monster? Am I a monster? Look, I don\u2019t know why it happened that way in denver, but I know this. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way this time.\" said by Cameron\n\"Oh, meaning this time you won\u2019t beat me up.

I can be anything you want me to be. I can be anything you want me to be. I can be gentle. I can be tender. I can be a little rough if that\u2019s what you want. You tell me.\" said by Cameron\n\"You just don\u2019t get it. I want you out of my life.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah? Guess what honey? We don\u2019t always get what we want. Where are you going?

You could have cleared my mother\u2019s name and set her free. You could have gotten her out of that god awful place, but instead, you decided to sit back and do nothing!\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, you gotta believe me.

You were only thinking about you and your mother.\" said by Kyle\n\"No, I was\u2013 I was trying to do what was right for everyone.\" said by Summer\n\"No, stop, stop, stop. You have to own up to your actions here. You weren\u2019t just sitting back and watching my mother suffer. You watched me suffer.\" said by Kyle\n\"I was suffering lying to you, kyle. It was torture for me.\" said by Summer\n\"No, and you were so damn good at it. You lied repeatedly to my face!\" said by Kyle\n\"Is that seat taken?

Thanks again.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah, I wasn\u2019t sure if you\u2019d remember, considering everything.\" said by Audra\n\"Seems like a lifetime ago.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah, I can imagine your memories of that night are pretty difficult given what happened to your wife\u2019s mother, or should I say, didn\u2019t happen. Rumors of her demise were greatly exaggerated. I guess it depends on what rumors you want to believe.\" said by Audra\n\"Mm. Well, I would normally advise you not to believe any rumors, but\u2026 in this case, they might all be true.\" said by Kyle\n\"So, phyllis summers faked the whole thing and is actually alive?\" said by Audra\n\"I\u2019m sorry, audra. You seem very nice, but I\u2019m not in the business of discussing my personal life with total strangers.\" said by Kyle\n\"Oh. I get it. Though, in my experience, sometimes it\u2019s a total stranger you most need to talk to. Their perspective is so much clearer. It\u2019s not prejudiced with preconceived notions about a person or a situation. It\u2019s no judgement. It\u2019s kind of like with bartenders, you know? People will tell them everything because they\u2019re just there to innocently listen.\" said by Audra\n\"Well, that\u2019s very kind of you, but I think I\u2019m just gonna\u2013\" said by Kyle\n\"I promise I\u2019m a very good listener.\" said by Audra\n\"Uh, maybe you haven\u2019t heard the whole story.\" said by Summer\n\"Are you trying to talk me out of forgiving you?\" said by Diane\n\"No. I just think that once you know everything, you might regret your decision.\" said by Summer\n\"Why don\u2019t you tell me the whole story? What is it that you think I don\u2019t know about yet?\" said by Diane\n\"Look, I know that keeping this secret has really hurt kyle and you, of course. I could have gotten the charges against you dropped way sooner, but I didn\u2019T. Instead, I ch\u2013 chose to protect my mom at your expense.\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m well aware of that.\" said by Diane\n\"And what? You\u2019re\u2013 you\u2019re okay with what I did?\" said by Summer\n\"No. No, no, no. No. You let me sit in jail with my life hanging in the balance over utterly false charges. I am not okay with that. But, I do understand why you did it.\" said by Diane\n\"You do.\" said by Summer\n\"Yes. I realize that you were put into an impossible situation with no easy solution. Trust me, summer. I\u2019m not playing games here. This is how I feel and I\u2019ll even take it a step further. I\u2019m going to do everything in my power to convince kyle to forgive you too.\" said by Diane\n\"You would do that? After everything that has happened? Wow. Thanks, diane.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, no thanks necessary. I really\u2013 I really can\u2019t stand to see you and kyle torn apart over this, and god knows you shouldn\u2019t be blamed for something that was clearly not your fault.\" said by Diane\n\"It\u2019s all my fault. I\u2019m responsible.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, yes, but we all know that phyllis manipulated you into keeping you quiet. I mean, it was her psychotic plan that caused all this trouble in the first place, so if anyone is to blame\u2013\" said by Diane\n\"Okay, hold on, diane. Please, please, do not turn this into an attack against my mom.\" said by Summer\n\"There\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting you face this bastard on your own.\" said by Nick\n\"Sharon, think about it for a moment. This is too dangerous. He may be setting a trap for you.\" said by Victor\n\"I don\u2019t doubt that it is a trap.\" said by Sharon\n\"Wait, you realize that, but you\u2019re still willing to walk right into his web?\" said by Nick\n\"He has faith and we have no idea where. It terrifies me to think what he might do to her. He might have somebody else watching her, just waiting for a word to do her harm and I know that he\u2019s thought this through. Every angle. He\u2019ll have taken precaution.\" said by Sharon\n\"Then we do the same.\" said by Nick\n\"He\u2019s methodical in his madness and we cannot take that risk with faith\u2019s life.\" said by Sharon\n\"Still, I just\u2013 I cannot fathom the idea of you being alone with him.\" said by Nick\n\"I agree with nicholas, but if you do\u2013 I think it\u2019s an insane idea, but if you do, you\u2019ve got to arm yourself.\" said by Victor\n\"That could be the trigger that sets him off. We have to got to be careful not to push him to go to a more dangerous place. He\u2019s already delusional enough to think that I might fall in love with him. Nick, isn\u2019t that what he said to you?\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, and I actually think that he believed it.\" said by Nick\n\"All right. If that\u2019s the case, and he is that delusional to think that we could be together and we have some future together, cameron is not planning on hurting me, but that wouldn\u2019t be true of anybody else who goes after him\u2026 which means that I am the only one who has the power to control the situation.\" said by Sharon\n\"Right?\" said by Daniel\n\"Thank you.\" said by Lily\n\"Honestly, I don\u2019t know what to do. Summer\u2019s desperate to keep mom out of prison and she\u2019s willing to go to any lengths necessary.\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, it sounds like summer. And your mom.\" said by Lily\n\"Right? The problem is, summer wants me to help her do it.\" said by Daniel\n\"Do what? Try and keep your mom out of prison? I mean, you can\u2019t turn back time. What\u2019s done is done.\" said by Lily\n\"Exactly. Meanwhile, mom wants me to do whatever it takes to keep summer out of it.\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, how are you supposed to do that?\" said by Lily\n\"I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Maybe she\u2019ll finally do the right thing.\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, why would she start now?\" said by Lily\n\"It\u2019s a good point. Especially if it means turning herself in. I can\u2019t see that happening. In fact, it\u2019s the opposite.\" said by Daniel\n\"What do you mean?\" said by Lily\n\"Mom is on the run again. So, even if I wanted to turn her in, I can\u2019t now.\" said by Daniel\n\"Daniel, I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re stuck in the middle of this.\" said by Lily\n\"Hm.\" said by Daniel\n\"But to be honest with you, as someone who\u2019s actually been to prison, it might not hurt for phyllis to do some time.\" said by Lily\n\"Summer, I\u2019m not attacking phyllis. I just think it\u2019s clear who\u2019s to blame for the nightmare we\u2019ve all been going through.\" said by Diane\n\"I agree. It is clear. This was all a part of stark\u2019s master plan. He\u2019s the one who started all of this trouble to begin with.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, I guess, technically, that\u2019s true.\" said by Diane\n\"You know what? If you wanna go all the way back to try to place blame, how did we even hear stark\u2019s name in the first place? I think it was you that brought him into our lives, diane.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, wait a minute. I\u2019m not the one who invited him to town.\" said by Diane\n\"But you\u2019re the one who had history with him. You\u2019re the one that burned him. Everything is unintended consequences.\" said by Summer\n\"Unintended consequences? Summer. Summer, we\u2019re getting way off track here. Yes, this plan was the work of jeremy stark, but he could not have faked phyllis\u2019 death without her full participation and it is naive to think that your mother is somehow innocent in all of this.\" said by Diane\n\"No, my mom didn\u2019t do any of this on her own. She was coerced and threatened and maybe even blackmailed into doing what she did.\" said by Summer\n\"Is that what phyllis is telling you? That she was blackmailed into that performance at the gala?\" said by Diane\n\"Diane, you were the one who brought stark to town and maybe you didn\u2019t commit murder, but you\u2019re not innocent and I\u2019m not ever gonna let myself forget that.\" said by Summer\n\"All right, sharon. All right. If you insist with on meeting with cameron alone, you\u2019re gonna take some precautions.\" said by Nick\n\"Like what?\" said by Sharon\n\"First, you\u2019re gonna go in there with some backup and that includes me.\" said by Nick\n\"He said to come alone, nick. Cameron said.\" said by Sharon\n\"No. We will keep our distance so we don\u2019t alert cameron. Your team can manage that, right, dad?\" said by Nick\n\"One second. I just found the number of a special ops guy whose specialty is rescue missions.\" said by Victor\n\"All right. Set it up. Let\u2019s go.\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2019ll call him right now.\" said by Victor\n\"Thanks, dad.\" said by Nick\n\"Sharon\u2026 thank you. You\u2019re risking your life to save my granddaughter. I\u2019ll never forget it.\" said by Victor\n\"Takes a lot of courage to do what you\u2019re doing. I still hate this plan, but cameron is crazy. He\u2019s already in your head, he\u2019s got our daughter\u2019s life in his hands. He knows where you\u2019re most vulnerable.\" said by Nick\n\"Of course I\u2019m vulnerable where my child is concerned. I\u2019m so afraid for her right now, I could scream. I know first hand what cameron is capable of. It\u2019s taken everything inside of me not to fall apart. And the thought of facing him again? Makes me sick to my stomach, but I don\u2019t have time for that, nick.\" said by Sharon\n\"Something like tha\" said by Audra\n\"Thank you.\" said by Audra\n\"So\u2026 you wanna be my bartender, audra?\" said by Kyle\n\"Something like that.\" said by Audra\n\"Well, I have simone over there, who is an actual bartender and she makes the perfect old fashioned and I have to say, she\u2019s probably a much more innocent listener than you are.\" said by Kyle\n\"Oh. What are you getting at, hm?\" said by Audra\n\"I\u2019m just a little weary. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re really after.\" said by Kyle\n\"You don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible that I\u2019m just a sounding board? Someone you can talk to who won\u2019t judge?\" said by Audra\n\"Hm. I get the feeling I should keep my guard up around you. From what I\u2019ve heard, you have ambitions.\" said by Kyle\n\"Oh, wow, kyle. Some people say that my ambitions are my best quality.\" said by Audra\n\"Well, that may be, but I don\u2019t know if I can confide in an ultra achiever like yourself. I\u2019ve heard you\u2019ll do whatever it takes to get the job done.\" said by Kyle\n\"Hm. You heard things about me? I\u2019m flattered. But you\u2019re right. I do consider myself an achiever. I\u2019ve successfully made a mark for myself wherever I\u2019ve gone.\" said by Audra\n\"Including with my brother-in-law, noah newman.\" said by Kyle\n\"Brother-in-law.\" said by Audra\n\"Hm.\" said by Kyle\n\"Right. Uh\u2026 that\u2019s all in the past now. You know, he\u2019s moved on and found happiness and I moved on as well.\" said by Audra\n\"But have you found happiness?\" said by Kyle\n\"Have you? Hm. You look like you are carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders.\" said by Audra\n\"How about this? I finish my drink and you talk while I listen?\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019m game. What do you want me to talk about? Look, I am well versed in a variety of topics. Some important and weighty, and some just downright ridiculous.\" said by Audra\n\"Well, how about you tell me more about yourself?\" said by Kyle\n\"Okay.\" said by Audra\n\"How did you end up here in genoa city?\" said by Kyle\n\"Since you asked, um, I came here working for tucker mccall until I zigged to a brief stint with chancellor-winters. And then, I zagged to newman media where I found my true self working with nate hastings. I think I found my home there.\" said by Audra\n\"So, ultra achiever, where do you go from newman media?\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, I\u2019m happy where I\u2019m at, but I\u2019ll see what opportunities present themselves. Ambition is not a dirty word to me, kyle.\" said by Audra\n\"Are you sure we\u2019re still talking about jobs?\" said by Kyle\n\"Mm. You tell me.\" said by Audra\n\"Thank you so much. Hi, summer. You know, I was actually hoping to run into you. I was wondering if you got the bouquet that tessa and I sent? The flowers for phyllis\u2019 memorial?\" said by Mariah\n\"Yeah.

No, I can\u2019t see that happening, but you can take this with your chamomile. What in the hell were you thinking?\" said by Mariah\n\"I\u2019m not in the mood for this right now.\" said by Summer\n\"You know, I\u2019ve never had an especially high opinion of you, but even I was surprised that you could keep phyllis\u2019 secret, knowing how deeply it would affect diane and kyle.\" said by Mariah\n\"You know what? What would you have done if sharon was the one that needed protecting? Especially after you went the trauma of thinking that you lost her forever? Yeah, it\u2019s really easy to judge when you haven\u2019t been through it yourself.\" said by Summer\n\"I suppose if sharon had been the one that I thought I lost forever, then yes, I would do anything to keep her safe and close.\" said by Mariah\n\"Okay. Exactly. That\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s exactly what I did.

Is there a chance that tucker could be a good, honest man?\" said by Abby\n\"So, here\u2019s what i know. Tucker wants to sell mccall unlimited and divest himself of everything. He just wants to walk away. But it seems that some person of interest has come in and bought up all of his debt. I suspect that person is ashley.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay.\" said by Devon\n\"So, my question to you is, did tucker approach you about buying the company and taking control?\" said by Victoria\n\"That\u2019s what you came here to ask me? Why do you care?\" said by Devon\n\"I wonder \u2014 are you aware that your father approached me first about buying his company? Y-you didn\u2019t know that, did you?\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, why would i believe a word that comes out of your mouth anyway?\" said by Devon\n\"I have nothing to gain from lying to you, but clearly tucker thought that he did.\" said by Victoria\n\"Do you plan on telling me what\u2019s behind that self-satisfied smile?\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, yeah, you want to know? It\u2019s these demands you\u2019re making.\" said by Victor\n\"To keep mccall its own entity?\" said by Adam\n\"That was my idea for you to run the company, as well.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, then we are on the same page. Good.\" said by Adam\n\"I just had to close certain doors to make sure that you realized where the hell you belong.\" said by Victor\n\"You know, jack stuck his neck out to give me that job.\" said by Adam\n\"Jack abbott. Good god, man, how did you ever become involved with that guy? Anyway, what was \u2014 what was the final straw?\" said by Victor\n\"[ Chuckles ] Are you really gonna make me do this?\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah. Take your time. Sit down.\" said by Victor\n\"[ Sighs ] I was half-assing it at jabot. My heart wasn\u2019t in it, and i realized that I didn\u2019t belong there. So as much as it pains me to admit this, you were right about the job \u2014 and about me. Do you struggle with occasional nerve aches\" said by Adam\n\"Look, this is one of the most difficult things I\u2019ve ever been through, causing this all-out war between my cousins. Look, I shook the faith they had in the merger and the future of the company. Hell, in me. Watching the devastation that i created, bearing witness to all that pain. Don\u2019t ask me how I sleep at night because I don\u2019T.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, you bury yourself in your work. And you think maybe if some kind of good can come out of this, then maybe you\u2019ll be worthy of their love and forgiveness.\" said by Daniel\n\"Maybe that\u2019s crossed my mind a time or two.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah. I had a feeling.\" said by Daniel\n\"Look, I don\u2019t expect lily to forgive me overnight \u2014 if she ever does \u2014 and it\u2019s probably gonna take an act of god before devon and I could ever get back to where we were before I started this whole damn thing.\" said by Nate\n\"That still doesn\u2019t answer my question. What do you want me to do about it?\" said by Daniel\n\"Help me put an end to this battle.\" said by Nate\n\"Nate [Laughs] I don\u2019t think \u2014\" said by Daniel\n\"Look, I can only get so close, and neither one of them will listen to me. In fact, the only thing they have in common right now is how much they hate me. So I need y\u2013 if we work together \u2014\" said by Nate\n\"Hey, hey. Wait. Wait. Let me just finish painting that picture for you. Um\u2026you convince me to help you, devon and lily, they settle their lawsuit without any bloodshed on either side, they turn to me, they say, \u201coh, daniel, you\u2019re our hero,\u201d undying gratitude, et cetera, et cetera. And then I say, \u201cwait, no, actually, the person that you should really be thanking is your cousin.\u201d And there\u2019s shock and there\u2019s tears, forgiveness all the way around. Everybody kisses and makes up. And then they throw us this big family-style dinner party. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just spit-balling here. Is that what you have in mind?\" said by Daniel\n\"I know what I\u2019m up against. If it looks like I\u2019m motivated by a sense of self-preservation, then I own it. It\u2019s a natural human instinct to want to be accepted into one\u2019s pack.\" said by Nate\n\"Alright, well, let me \u2014 let me present you with a more plausible outcome. Um, you do all the right things. Instead of restoring the peace, you actually make things worse. You dig up a bunch of old feelings of anger and betrayal and distrust and you just make the wounds deeper. And then I wind up getting partial blame for helping the most hated guy in the family.\" said by Daniel\n\"Okay. So, I was wrong, and you don\u2019t care if lily gets her family back.\" said by Nate\n\"Nate, you can\u2019t put this back together again. Let devon and lily work it out between themselves.\" said by Daniel\n\"I know how complicated this is for devon, okay? And by the way \u2014 let\u2019s be very clear about this \u2014 tucker never does anything unless he really wants to do it.\" said by Ashley\n\"So, now he wants to step up and be a parent? I don\u2019t buy it.\" said by Abby\n\"Well, honey, it\u2019s not really about you. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s about devon.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yes, it is about devon. And he\u2019s about to lose the company that he built with his father. He\u2019s estranged from his cousin. He\u2019s about to go scorched-earth with lily in court.\" said by Abby\n\"I can\u2019t tell you how much I hate to hear about that.\" said by Ashley\n\"Imagine how I feel. I have to just sit back and watch it happen. There\u2019s nothing I can do to stop it.\" said by Abby\n\"Okay. Maybe we just have to have a little faith, okay? Everything\u2019s gonna work out the way it\u2019s supposed to. It\u2019s gonna be okay.\" said by Ashley\n\"Devon is a good man. And you know what that means. Things don\u2019t always work out for the good guy, do they?\" said by Abby\n\"He\u2019s already lost so much. He\u2019s lost members of his family. He\u2019s lost faith in his family. Mom, I just \u2014 I wish that \u2014\" said by Abby\n\"I understand you want to fix things.\" said by Ashley\n\"I wish I had answers. Do you think that tucker is acting in the best interests of devon?\" said by Abby\n\"I take it that tucker didn\u2019t let you know that you weren\u2019t the first one he offered his company to?\" said by Victoria\n\"No, he made it seem like I was the only person he was gonna approach.\" said by Devon\n\"Well, of course. You know, please don\u2019t take my word for it. You should ask him yourself.\" said by Victoria\n\"Right. You said he took the offer off the table, though, right?\" said by Devon\n\"Yes, that\u2019s right. After some mysterious entity bought up all of the debt, all of a sudden, mccall was no longer in the market.\" said by Victoria\n\"Hmm.\" said by Devon\n\"Look, the way that he\u2019s been going back and forth and being less than transparent, I don\u2019t blame you for not trusting him.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, I\u2019m just trying to figure out why you care so much that you\u2019d come all the way here to talk about it with me.\" said by Devon\n\"I have a question for you.\" said by Victoria\n\"What\u2019s that?\" said by Devon\n\"Newman is still very much interested in buying mccall unlimited, and I\u2019d like to know where you stand, just in case I am forced to play hardball.\" said by Victoria\n\"[ Sighs ] All I ever wanted is for you to be at a place where you can be happy, where you could grow.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, that\u2019s why I feel like this is \u2014 this is the right move for me.\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah.\" said by Victor\n\"I just had an enlightening conversation with sharon. She, uh, helped me find some clarity on a few things.\" said by Adam\n\"What wisdom could sharon possibly impart?\" said by Victor\n\"She told me I need to find something that I\u2019m passionate about, something that I can commit myself to, you know, give me a sense of purpose. And then I realized that is exactly what you were offering me.\" said by Adam\n\"You know, there were some people who warned me that you would never believe that I\u2019m on your side.\" said by Victor\n\"[ Chuckles ] Well, there\u2019s nothing I enjoy more than proving people wrong.\" said by Adam\n\"[ Laughs ] Especially when they\u2019re the newmans, right? Son, I\u2019m your father. I know you.\" said by Victor\n\"Dad, thank you for, um, not giving up on me. But, uh, back to the business at hand.\" said by Adam\n\"You mean mccall.\" said by Victor\n\"Mm. Are you certain that victoria is on board with this? She knows about your plan and me?\" said by Adam\n\"Don\u2019t you worry about victoria, alright? Leave her to me. Known as a loving parent.\" said by Victor\n\"Hey.\" said by Lily\n\"Hey.\" said by Daniel\n\"I got your message while I was on a call with amanda.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah. She\u2019s doing well?\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah. Yeah, she\u2019s good. She\u2019s excited to sink her teeth into hamilton-winters. Which I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s because she\u2019s motivated or because she wants to make devon pay, but I don\u2019t really care. I just want to win.\" said by Lily\n\"You know, maybe if you could come to an understanding with your brother, there could be a quick resolution.\" said by Daniel\n\"Quick? No. I mean, it\u2019s corporate law. It could take years. But anyway, it doesn\u2019t matter. Let\u2019s, um \u2014 let\u2019s sit. What, uh \u2014 what\u2019s going on? Is there a problem with the project?\" said by Lily\n\"No, no, nothing like that.\" said by Daniel\n\"Okay. Well, you made it sound important.\" said by Lily\n\"Well, it is. Uh, it\u2019s about you. Nate, actually. Um, I just thought I should give you a heads-up.\" said by Daniel\n\"What is it?\" said by Lily\n\"He overheard us at society earlier.\" said by Daniel\n\"Right. Of course he did. What did he \u2014 what did he hear? What were we saying?\" said by Lily\n\"Hamilton versus winters, uh, you and devon. He was just trying to recruit me to help put an end to the lawsuit.\" said by Daniel\n\"He said that?\" said by Lily\n\"He feels responsible for the original rift between the two of you. Maybe he\u2019s thinking \u2014\" said by Daniel\n\"Right, thinking that we will forgive him if he just tries to solve everything? I mean [Scoffs] Of course he would. Of course, once again, he thinks it\u2019s all about the great nate hastings.\" said by Lily\n\"You know, victoria, i have enough problems in my life right now. I don\u2019t need to add tucker to the list.\" said by Devon\n\"Well, that\u2019s very interesting, but for my own clarification, does that mean that you are not considering the purchase of mccall unlimited?\" said by Victoria\n\"Uh, I don\u2019t have anything to say to you about that \u2019cause we\u2019re not buddies. You literally tried to go after my company not that long ago. Remember?\" said by Devon\n\"I think we\u2019ve been through that.\" said by Victoria\n\"We have, and you\u2019re still denying it, so\u2026 you think you can come over here today and try to talk to me about my business dealings? Come on. Tucker isn\u2019t that the only person I don\u2019t trust in this town.\" said by Devon\n\"I\u2019ve been very transparent with you about this. I want that company.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay. I can\u2019t help you get it.\" said by Devon\n\"Look, you know tucker\u2019s just trying to use this to score points with you. He just wants to manipulate his way back into your life. You think you don\u2019t trust him now? Well, just wait. If you buy mccall [Chuckles] That\u2019s gonna be very complicated because that company is not a gift. It\u2019s a curse. It\u2019s the complete opposite of what you built at hamilton-winters. So, you just say the word, and I\u2019ll take care of everything. You don\u2019t have to do a thing. I\u2019m pretty sure that that\u2019s what\u2019s best for everyone.\" said by Victoria\n\"Hey, how are you, abby?\" said by Tucker\n\"I\u2019ll talk to you soon.\" said by Abby\n\"I love you.\" said by Ashley\n\"I love you. Goodbye.\" said by Abby\n\"I hope you have good news.\" said by Ashley\n\"I have not heard from devon about my offer.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, that\u2019s unfortunate.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah, but, uh, I feel like I got my second wind. I dug deep, and I think I\u2019ve found some viable options.\" said by Tucker\n\"I want to hear all about it.\" said by Ashley\n\"Okay. So, what if we made the sale of the company contingent upon large-scale charitable donations to causes that are near and dear to your heart? For instance, um, the future is female, right? So we would \u2014 yeah, it is. So we would advocate for girls and young women pursuing careers in the sciences, um, environmental groups. You know, we\u2019d clean up the oceans and that kind of thing. So, whoever bought the company would need to be prepared to educate and beautify the planet because it would be baked into any contract I signed. Only sustainable practices and all that.\" said by Tucker\n\"You would do all that?\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah, sure. And more.\" said by Tucker\n\"Just for me?\" said by Ashley\n\"For us, for \u2014 for the world, for the \u2014 for the universe. I\u2019m trying to think globally, you know.\" said by Tucker\n\"Right. Well, could you maybe just work locally? Please don\u2019t give up on devon.\" said by Ashley\n\"[ Sighs ] He\u2019s inflexible.\" said by Tucker\n\"No, he\u2019s being cautious.\" said by Ashley\n\"Well, what am i supposed to do?\" said by Tucker\n\"You just found a million ways to change the world. You can\u2019t think of one or two to change devon\u2019s mind?\" said by Ashley\n\"There\u2019s only so much one man can do.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah, but you\u2019re not any man, are you? You are tucker mccall, right? You go where other men don\u2019t tread. They don\u2019T. Things might get difficult, they might take more time, but you get them done.\" said by Ashley\n\"You\u2019re not exaggerating, are you?\" said by Tucker\n\"I\u2019m not. But then again, I can\u2019t help but think if this was one of your silly business deals motivated by your ego and your greed, it would have been done by sunset. So, maybe you just don\u2019t want it enough. We do it every night.\" said by Ashley\n\"[ Scoffs ] I mean, the fact that nate is spying on my conversation \u2014 it\u2019s like, should I be worried about him again?\" said by Lily\n\"I don\u2019t think it was intentional, and I doubt he wants to try and use that information against you.\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, I mean, he\u2019s done things in the past that i thought he was never capable of.\" said by Lily\n\"Exactly why I told him it was a bad idea. And I told him he wasn\u2019t involved and he should stay out of it.\" said by Daniel\n\"Good. Thank you.\" said by Lily\n\"But I got to say \u2014 and I know it\u2019s none of my business \u2014 the guy is hurting over what he almost did to chancellor-winters.\" said by Daniel\n\"Uh-huh. He should be.\" said by Lily\n\"Do you think the crime deserves a life sentence?\" said by Daniel\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Lily\n\"Okay. Yeah. No, no, no, I \u2014 I will shut my mouth. You\u2019re right. It\u2019s none of my business. None of my business. After \u2014 after I say just this one last thing. He sincerely wants to help you and devon find a peaceful resolution.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s great. I would like that, too. Everybody wants peace in their family. I mean, all I wanted was for us to work together and build something that we could be proud of. But then, you know, billy walks away. Nate tries to destroy it all. Devon\u2019s now suing me. It\u2019s like, why is this happening?\" said by Lily\n\"Studying for a test?\" said by Abby\n\"Hey.\" said by Devon\n\"Hi.\" said by Abby\n\"Didn\u2019t hear you come in.\" said by Devon\n\"Mwah! I had a few minutes before my staff meeting. I wanted to see how you\u2019re doing.\" said by Abby\n\"Oh, yeah?\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah.\" said by Abby\n\"Good. I\u2019m just going over some financials here.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh. For hamilton-winters?\" said by Abby\n\"No. For mccall unlimited, actually.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah. You got here at the perfect time.\" said by Devon\n\"I love hearing that.\" said by Abby\n\"I could use some fresh eyes on this, if you don\u2019t mind.\" said by ", "answer": "Devon"}

If the police take this seriously, then they\u2019re gonna look for her and if they find her, they\u2019re gonna throw her in prison before she has a chance to clear herself.\" said by Summer\n\"But on the flip side, diane will be out from underneath a murder wrap and she\u2019ll be free to live her life again.\" said by Daniel\n\"It\u2019s not a fair trade.\" said by Summer\n\"Is it fair for us to keep sitting on this secret? Is it fair to keep lying to kyle?\" said by Daniel\n\"I don\u2019t know. I wish that I had all the answers, but I don\u2019T. I have been trying to get in touch with mom on the number that she used to set up that meeting with me. I\u2019ve left her messages, I get no response. I\u2019m worried that she already knows that you\u2019ve told half of genoa city and you\u2019ve scared her away.\" said by Summer\n\"I have told the people that need to know in order to get her the help she needs to come home.\" said by Daniel\n\"You keep telling yourself that.

Dad must\u2019ve missed you.\" said by Lucy\n\"Uh, it was nice of the nanny to be able to stay late so we can have some time together.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah, I agree.\" said by Abby\n\"Uh-oh. I recognize that look and that tone of yours. What\u2019s wrong with you?\" said by Devon\n\"I\u2019m looking forward to a relaxing evening, but something is bothering me, a lot.\" said by Abby\n\"What\u2019s bothering you a lot?\" said by Devon\n\"It\u2019s about my mom and your dad.\" said by Abby\n\"Okay. I know you\u2019ve been worried about them for a while now.\" said by Devon\n\"But now, I\u2019m worried that she\u2019s thinking about marrying him.\" said by Abby\n\"Sorry to put you on the spot like that.\" said by Tucker\n\"You\u2019re not. I mean, you kind of are, but that\u2019s okay.\" said by Ashley\n\"Well, you did proclaim your love for me in front of jack and diane, rather loudly in fact. And then you informed them of our engagement without warning me first. So, I thought I played along rather brilliantly.\" said by Tucker\n\"You were good.\" said by Ashley\n\"If I must say so myself.\" said by Tucker\n\"You were terrific.\" said by Ashley\n\"And I\u2013 I know for you it\u2019s just an act, but are any of the emotions behind it real? Because I\u2013 I think I deserve to know where things stand.\" said by Tucker\n\"You\u2019re right, you do. You deserve to know how I feel.\" said by Ashley\n\"Hey, I just wrapped up in court when I got your text. Do you have good news for me?\" said by Christine\n\"These days, I don\u2019t really know the difference between good news and bad news.\" said by Chance\n\"Okay. Well, let me rephrase the question. Do you have anything to bolster my case against diane?\" said by Christine\n\"The evidence I\u2019ve seen actually points in the opposite direction.\" said by Chance\n\"Evidence? From jack? Well, I guess his phone call really got to you the other day.\" said by Christine\n\"I heard him out.\" said by Chance\n\"And?\" said by Christine\n\"Well, what he found isn\u2019t enough to close the case, but it did confirm my hunch that there could be more to this.\" said by Chance\n\"As in phyllis is still alive, watching diane twist in the wind?\" said by Christine\n\"Look, christine, if there is something going on, I want to find it. Either way, we should put our doubts to rest, don\u2019t you think? Or are you gonna convince me not to investigate?\" said by Chance\n\"Hi there.\" said by Summer\n\"Hi, you. It\u2019s good to see you. I\u2019ve been thinking about you. How\u2019s everything going?\" said by Sharon\n\"Oh, you know, some good days, some bad days.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, that\u2019s to be expected. As long as you know that you have a very large and caring support group. There\u2019s a lot of people who love you, summer.\" said by Sharon\n\"I do know that, it\u2019s the only way that I\u2019m gonna get through any of this.\" said by Summer\n\"Good. It\u2019s important to remember. What can I get you?\" said by Sharon\n\"Um, two large coffees and like a bag full of carbs, please.\" said by Summer\n\"Just the way you said a bag of carbs just now reminded me of phyllis. And that\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s a good thing. You know, it may not seem like it yet, but eventually you\u2019ll get to the place where you\u2019re very grateful for all the ways that you\u2019ve learned how to keep her memory alive.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, I know my mom isn\u2019t fading away any time soon.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay, supergirl, your mom needs you.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Additional sponsorship provided by\u2026\" said by Announcer\n\"I\u2019m really sorry you had to see that.\" said by Lily\n\"Not that I didn\u2019t miss you.\" said by Daniel\n\"Oh, good one. Right answer, dad.\" said by Lucy\n\"So your dad told me that you were back in town. Can I take you guys to dinner tonight, maybe?\" said by Lily\n\"Uh, no, actually the kid here and I, we already have plans.\" said by Daniel\n\"Wait, you should totally come with us.\" said by Lucy\n\"Okay. Where am I going?\" said by Lily\n\"I promise you, you\u2019re gonna remember that you already have plans when I tell you what it is.\" said by Daniel\n\"Oh, is it that bad?\" said by Lily\n\"It\u2019s dinner at society with johnny, connor, chelsea, and billy.\" said by Daniel\n\"Um, that\u2019s random. How did that happen?\" said by Lily\n\"That is a very good question.\" said by Daniel\n\"Wait, what am I missing here?\" said by Lucy\n\"I promise the three of us will all go to dinner real soon.\" said by Daniel\n\"Oh, dad, come on.\" said by Lucy\n\"I would be honored to come.\" said by Lily\n\"Well, that doesn\u2019t sound like sarcasm.\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, no, it\u2019s not. I\u2013 I\u2019ll go, I mean, we can all be adults, right? It\u2019s fine.\" said by Lily\n\"Wait, be adults about what? Someone tell the kid what\u2019s going on.\" said by Lucy\n\"It\u2019s fine. I will fill you in when we are on our way there. Let\u2019s go.\" said by Lily\n\"So this strand of long red hair that jack found, how are we supposed to know it came from stark\u2019s motel room? Is there security footage to back him up?\" said by Christine\n\"No.\" said by Chance\n\"Cell phone video? Anything? Are we just supposed to take jack\u2019s word for it?\" said by Christine\n\"I poked the same holes in jack\u2019s story, but something\u2019s not sitting right with me. I want to follow up on it. I want to check out the motel room myself.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, look, chance I can\u2019t tell you to walk away from this because you\u2019re not my direct report. And, I\u2019m not gonna try and talk you out of it because I know how you are.\" said by Christine\n\"What\u2019s that? Pigheaded?\" said by Chance\n\"Uh, tenacious. But I do trust your instincts. Look, the new chief won\u2019t be too pleased if he thinks you\u2019re taking time away from other cases.\" said by Christine\n\"It\u2019s not gonna happen. I\u2019m not even on duty right now.\" said by Chance\n\"Okay. Yeah, I don\u2019t need to know how you\u2019re gonna go about it, just tell me whatever I need to know, if anything comes up.\" said by Christine\n\"You\u2019ll be the first.\" said by Chance\n\"Must have been very strange and very confusing to hear me speaking so passionately and loudly about our love and our bond. I\u2019m sorry about that. And I\u2019m sorry that I can\u2019t tell you what you want to hear.\" said by Ashley\n\"I see.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, obviously we\u2019re more than friends.\" said by Ashley\n\"How much more?\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, I\u2019m attracted to you. What? Well\u2026 I like spending time with you.\" said by Ashley\n\"That\u2019s sweet. Is there anything else?\" said by Tucker\n\"Every day, I trust you a little bit more. Every day, I feel like my heart is opening up a little bit wider. But as far as telling you, I love you the way a wife should tell her husband that she loves him, I\u2013 I\u2013 you\u2019re asking too much of me.\" said by Ashley\n\"My uncle jack was already in a sour mood when I got there, and then I asked to see my mom and he told me that she was out with tucker and that they have some big news to share.\" said by Abby\n\"What kind of big news?\" said by Devon\n\"I don\u2019t know. Maybe it has something to do with this fake engagement. That would explain my uncle jack\u2019s irritation.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah, I still don\u2019t know what to make of that. It\u2019s weird.\" said by Devon\n\"I do, it\u2019s insane. She\u2019s clearly lost her mind.\" said by Abby\n\"I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d go that far. Your mom\u2019s one of the sharpest people I know. But if she\u2019s starting to trust tucker, maybe he\u2019s giving her a reason to.\" said by Devon\n\"Or maybe he has her fooled. Look, I want to think that he is a changed man, that he\u2019s evolved. Not only for our sake, but especially for our son\u2019S.\" said by Abby\n\"But you\u2019re worried if we let him in our life\u2013\" said by Devon\n\"That he\u2019s gonna disappoint us again. And when he skips town, like he always does, dominic is gonna lose his grandfather.\" said by Abby\n\"Right. No, I thought about that a lot too. And honestly, I don\u2019t know if I believe his retirement story.\" said by Devon\n\"What do you mean?\" said by Abby\n\"I don\u2019t think he can do it.\" said by Devon\n\"Well, I mean, he doesn\u2019t have to work. He has enough money after selling mccall.\" said by Abby\n\"It\u2019s not about the money. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s able to actually live life without having action in it. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s capable of that. Like hell, he could have some corporate scheme going on right now that we don\u2019t see coming. And your mom\u2019s the key to it. With moderate to severe plaque psoriasis,\" said by Devon\n\"Thank you.\" said by Summer\n\"Any time. Summer, wait, you have change.\" said by Sharon\n\"For the tip jar.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, whoa, whoa, easy.\" said by Chance\n\"Oh, my god. I\u2019m so sorry.\" said by Summer\n\"That\u2019s, uh, not all for you, is it?\" said by Chance\n\"No, it\u2019s uh, it\u2019s for my team at marchetti. I want to show them that I haven\u2019t forgotten about them. Some things need to go back to normal. Um, has there been any news?\" said by Summer\n\"The investigation into your mother\u2019s death has officially been closed.\" said by Chance\n\"Okay, but unofficially, things are happening?\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m trying to make some progress today. If anything solid develops, we\u2019ll talk.\" said by Chance\n\"What do you mean, by progress?\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m turning over every stone. So, trust me.\" said by Chance\n\"Okay. So, I\u2019ll just wait to hear from you.\" said by Summer\n\"My heart really goes out to her. She and phyllis were so close. But what can I get for you?\" said by Sharon\n\"I\u2019ll just do the usual. Make it a large though.\" said by Chance\n\"Sure. Um, but first, do I by any chance owe you a thank you?\" said by Sharon\n\"This is perfect. I\u2019ll sit over here by chels and then you two\u2013 you can put that away, huh. Thank you very much.\" said by Billy\n\"Hey, hey, look who I found wandering the streets,\" said by Daniel\n\"Lily, hi.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Hi, how are you?\" said by Lily\n\"I\u2019m doing well. How are you?\" said by Chelsea\n\"I\u2019m good. Got back from new york, but happy to be home. So, you don\u2019t mind that I\u2019m crashing your party, do you?\" said by Lily\n\"No, no, not at all. Happy for you to join.\" said by Billy\n\"Okay, good, \u2019cause I\u2019m starving.\" said by Lily\n\"We\u2019ll just get you another place setting.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Okay.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah, that\u2019ll be a lot of bodies around this table, but uh\u2026\" said by Billy\n\"Do you want to just push two of them together?\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah, let\u2019s do that.\" said by Billy\n\"Or we can have two separate tables, adults here, kids there.\" said by Johnny\n\"I love it.\" said by Lucy\n\"Okay by me.\" said by Connor\n\"Okay then.\" said by Billy\n\"Okay, well, this is fun, right?\" said by Lily\n\"So this so-called engagement, you think it\u2019s part of tucker\u2019s plan?\" said by Abby\n\"I think that we should wait and see if they\u2019re actually engaged because we\u2019re just speculating at this point.\" said by Devon\n\"They live together. He\u2019s already proposed. It doesn\u2019t sound speculative to me.\" said by Abby\n\"I guess not.\" said by Devon\n\"So what if my mom accepts? Whether it\u2019s to mess with diane or if it\u2019s actually real. And then what? They get remarried and he\u2019s in the perfect position to hurt her again?\" said by Abby\n\"I just\u2013 I\u2013 I don\u2019t think she\u2019s gonna let that happen, abby. And I thought that you were warming up to tucker after you guys danced together the other night.\" said by Devon\n\"I probably was. But hell, maybe that\u2019s a part of this whole scheme. He\u2019s charming. He gets you to let your guard down and that, that is when he strikes.\" said by Abby\n\"Right. Well, the only thing we\u2019re gonna be able to do is wait and see what happens.\" said by Devon\n\"And wait, back to this whole retirement thing.\" said by Abby\n\"What?\" said by Devon\n\"I mean, you\u2019re right, a guy like tucker, he doesn\u2019t just sell his company and then walk away. What if he is gonna go after jabot again?\" said by Abby\n\"I mean, that sounds like something the old tucker would\u2019ve done.\" said by Devon\n\"Exactly, yes. He has gone after jabot before and if that is what he is going after again, I am not gonna let that happen. I will crush him first.\" said by Abby\n\"You really are my better angel, you know that?\" said by Tucker\n\"Please don\u2019t go that far.\" said by Ashley\n\"No, I am going that far.\" said by Tucker\n\"Stop it.\" said by Ashley\n\"Don\u2019T. I\u2019m never gonna give up on you, on us, ever. I just wish that\u2026 I wish you could love me for who I am instead of what I could be.\" said by Tucker\n\"Hey.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Oh, my goodness!\" said by Summer\n\"Baby girl, there you are.\" said by Phyllis\n\"And they\u2019re paying.\" said by Johnny\n\"Ooh, they have that parmesan crusted halibut that I like, I\u2019m gonna get that.\" said by Lily\n\"I am trying to decide between the steak frites and the paella.\" said by Daniel\n\"Um, do the steak frites and then you can have your fries.\" said by Lily\n\"Done. What about an appetizer? Should we, um, should we get an artichoke dip? Split it for the table?\" said by Daniel\n\"I don\u2019t know. What looks good?\" said by Billy\n\"Everything.\" said by Chelsea\n\"I know the feeling.\" said by Billy\n\"Oh, come on. You\u2019re gonna get your favorite, the crab enchiladas.\" said by Lily\n\"That\u2019s your favorite?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Yeah, it used to be.\" said by Billy\n\"Okay. Three burgers, tots, onion rings, bucket.\" said by Johnny\n\"Love it.\" said by Connor\n\"Love it.\" said by Lucy\n\"Oh, sorry. It took me so long to decide.\" said by Chelsea\n\"That\u2019s okay.\" said by Lily\n\"It\u2019s fine.\" said by Daniel\n\"So, how\u2019s charlie in new york?\" said by Billy\n\"Um, he\u2019s good. He\u2019s really good.\" said by Lily\n\"That\u2019s terrific.\" said by Billy\n\"Did you do any shopping while you were there?\" said by Chelsea\n\"I didn\u2019T. I had meetings and, you know, hung out with charlie, so that\u2019s it.\" said by Lily\n\"You see any shows?\" said by Billy\n\"No, it was a pretty quick, in-and-out trip.\" said by Lily\n\"Well, that\u2019s a shame. I heard they\u2019re reviving sweeney todd. It\u2019s always fun.\" said by Daniel\n\"Oh, sounds fun.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah. Maybe not for lily. She doesn\u2019t like musicals much.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, I don\u2019t know. I could make an exception for sondheim.\" said by Lily\n\"Lady has taste.\" said by Daniel\n\"So lily gave me the lowdown on the way here, but I feel like I only got half the story.\" said by Lucy\n\"Okay. Well, um, so connor and I are brothers but our mom\u2019s only raising him.\" said by Johnny\n\"And that\u2019s chelsea?\" said by Lucy\n\"And I have a different mom who was married to billy, my dad, but then they got divorced. And now I live with her and my sister, katie.\" said by Johnny\n\"His dad and lily were a couple, but now he\u2019s dating my mom. Plus, I\u2019m getting a new baby sister. My dad, adam, and his ex-girlfriend, sally, who\u2019s now a couple with my uncle nick, which is messed up, but after a while, it\u2019s like whatever.\" said by Connor\n\"Most families I know are like this, all blended and mixed up. It\u2019s kind of the way things are now.\" said by Lucy\n\"Facts.\" said by Johnny\n\"My bio mom was pretty messed up, so dad didn\u2019t stay with her for too long, thank god. So, dad and heather raised me, but then they broke up and she and I live in portugal. So, I don\u2019t get to see my dad all too often. See, we\u2019re all kind of in this weird messed-up club.\" said by Lucy\n\"That\u2019s cool. So can you speak portuguese?\" said by Connor\n\"I\u2019m not sure I understand. Uh, thank you for what?\" said by Chance\n\"Well, I received this bottle of champagne. Um, kind of a cryptic note. No signature.\" said by Sharon\n\"Oh, okay. That\u2019s odd.\" said by Chance\n\"Nick advised me to just get rid of it, but first I wanted to see if you had sent it, but it sounds like you did not.\" said by Sharon\n\"No, I\u2019m so sorry. I wish I could take credit for that. I\u2019ll tell you though, once things cool down at work, I\u2019ll send you five champagne bottles. We can toast with that, okay?\" said by Chance\n\"I like that.\" said by Sharon\n\"It is kind of creepy though, getting a gift anonymously like that. You want me to look into it? I am a detective.\" said by Chance\n\"No, no, no, no, it\u2019s, um, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s fine.\" said by Sharon\n\"Okay. Well, I\u2019ll tell you what, if anything else comes up that troubles you, you let me know and I\u2019ll handle it. Right now though, I got to take off. I gotta follow up on this investigation.\" said by Chance\n\"Understood. Um, don\u2019t let me keep you. I\u2019ll see you later?\" said by Sharon\n\"Count on it.\" said by Chance\n\"Did anybody see you come up here?\" said by ", "answer": "Phyllis"}
{"content": "\"Did you get any sleep last night?\" said by Michael\n\"Ugh. Barely. I\u2019m just still reeling by what you\u2019ve said to me. Phyllis is still alive? How is that even possible? I mean, do you believe it?\" said by Lauren\n\"Daniel was very convincing.\" said by Michael\n\"You said that he knew something that only phyllis or the police would know?\" said by Lauren\n\"True.\" said by Michael\n\"What was it? Can you tell me?\" said by Lauren\n\"He knew that stark had been murdered with a pair of scissors. That isn\u2019t public knowledge.\" said by Michael\n\"God.\" said by Lauren\n\"And daniel has no reason to lie to me. None that I know of.\" said by Michael\n\"So, who else knows besides jack and kyle?\" said by Lauren\n\"And you. I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s it. Jack and kyle need to keep this from diane and and summer, for now. I need to search for more evidence. And I wanted to be able to talk this out with you since I knew you are discreet. And since this whole scenario is frankly insane.\" said by Michael\n\"Or it\u2019s more treacherous than you\u2019re even thinking about. Because for phyllis to go to these lengths, she could not have done it willingly, could she?\" said by Lauren\n\"Hey, you\u2019re dressed for work?\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah, I figured I had to get back to normal at some point, right?\" said by Summer\n\"Guess so.\" said by Kyle\n\"Thank you for giving me space again last night. My head was exploding from what you told me. And I\u2013 I just needed some time to think.\" said by Summer\n\"I understand. I hope it was just for the one night though \u2019cause I want to be here for you summer.\" said by Kyle\n\"I know.\" said by Summer\n\"I know you got hit with some shocking news. All I ask is that you talk to me and tell me how you feel about it because if we\u2019re gonna get through this together, you can\u2019t keep shutting me out. I feel like I don\u2019t even know you right now and I don\u2019t know what to do about it.\" said by Kyle\n\"You\u2019re in quite the mood this morning.\" said by Nikki\n\"Two creams, one sugar.\" said by Audra\n\"Audra, let\u2019s get one thing straight.\" said by Nate\n\"What\u2019s that?\" said by Audra\n\"What the hell were you thinking? Setting up elena that way?\" said by Nate\n\"Uh, excuse me?\" said by Audra\n\"Don\u2019t play coy with me. You sent her to L.A. Knowing she could get her heart broken. What is wrong with you? Lactaid is 100% real milk,\" said by Nate\n\"Additional sponsorship provided by\u2026\" said by Announcer\n\"You might want to rethink that nasty attitude since we\u2019re about to become family.\" said by Diane\n\"You don\u2019t know the meaning of the word, diane. So, I understand why you\u2019re confused, but we will never be family.\" said by Ashley\n\"Uh, jack was ready to marry me in jail. This marriage is definitely going to happen.\" said by Diane\n\"There\u2019s no explaining stupidity, diane. You\u2019re going back to jail, so don\u2019t think that we\u2019re gonna be having any family time together, okay?\" said by Ashley\n\"It won\u2019t ever come to that.\" said by Diane\n\"Well, you\u2019re delusional as usual.\" said by Ashley\n\"We\u2019ll see.\" said by Diane\n\"What are you talking about? There\u2019s so much evidence against you.\" said by Ashley\n\"Then I guess we have to agree to disagree.\" said by Diane\n\"Why are you so certain?\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, do I seem confident that I\u2019m not going to prison?\" said by Diane\n\"You do? So, what are you up to?\" said by Ashley\n\"I\u2019m not up to anything. I have innocence on my side along with michael, kyle, and jack.\" said by Diane\n\"Kyle, I love you so much. It\u2019s never been my intention to shut you out. It\u2019s just\u2013 I don\u2019t know. My mind has been so jumbled. So, if you could just give me a little bit more time.\" said by Summer\n\"This is hard for me too, summer. Watching you and my mom suffer, feeling powerless to help. I mean, until today I thought you were punishing me for what my mom did, but now we know it was all a set up, so she didn\u2019t actually do anything to phyllis.\" said by Kyle\n\"Sorry, do we actually know that? Look I know that my mom is supposedly alive, but there hasn\u2019t been some joyful, miraculous reunion. I don\u2019t\u2013 I don\u2019t get to see her or touch her or talk to her. Look, if this is true, then things are gonna get better, right? They have to, but it\u2019s not gonna happen overnight, and right now, I\u2019m sorry, I have to go.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, let me grab my stuff, we can drive in together.\" said by Kyle\n\"No, I have to do something before I go to work. Um, I\u2019ll meet you there.\" said by Summer\n\"I am well aware of your thoughts on nate. So, why don\u2019t we just fast forward through that? Oh, I have an idea, new topic. How about how dad\u2019s just handed adam an entire kingdom?\" said by Victoria\n\"[ Sighing ] Why do you even care about that?\" said by Nikki\n\"Because it\u2019s going to end in a disaster.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, so what if it does? It\u2019s no skin off your nose?\" said by Nikki\n\"Mm, I see. So, now you\u2019re rooting for adam.\" said by Victoria\n\"Not at all, but this is important to your father, so why don\u2019t you just let him have it without all the bitter comments?\" said by Nikki\n\"Mccall unlimited would have dovetailed nicely into all of our divisions. I\u2013 I just gave up on it too easily. Just let it fall right into adam\u2019s clutches.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, my god. You sound more like your father every day. Like it\u2019s not enough to want the world, but you want to conquer everything. And your opponent must lose, as if their losing makes your victory even sweeter.\" said by Nikki\n\"Are we still talking about mccall unlimited? Because if this is about nate, I think maybe I should be offended.\" said by Victoria\n\"It was elena\u2019s idea to fly out and confront you. I didn\u2019t send her to los angeles.\" said by Audra\n\"But you made damn sure she knew I wasn\u2019t out there alone. That I was with victoria, even though it was a business trip.\" said by Nate\n\"How was I supposed to know you kept that detail from her? And why did you? Once elena made the decision, who was I to talk her out of it? She was hell bent on finding you.\" said by Audra\n\"Stop trying to justify your actions, audra. You lit the match knowing it would upset her.\" said by Nate\n\"Elena was already suspicious. You\u2019d fallen out of love with her. Oh, don\u2019t deny it. I could read the signs and so could elena. Look, as devastating as this breakup is for her, isn\u2019t it really what\u2019s best for everyone?\" said by Audra\n\"It shouldn\u2019t have gone down like that. She didn\u2019t deserve to be treated this way.\" said by Nate\n\"I suggest you let it go, let her go. Like trust me, elena is gonna be fine without you. You two just weren\u2019t a\u2013 a match, that\u2019s all. And even if this thing didn\u2019t happen with victoria, you know, I doubt your girlfriend would have been able to get behind your new vision for the future.\" said by Audra\n\"Which is what exactly?\" said by Nate\n\"You don\u2019t think I figured it out? I know what you\u2019re up to. Newman media isn\u2019t enough, you want his and her thrones running the kingdom alongside victoria.\" said by Audra\n\"You\u2019ve done an impressive job so far, making the transition from medicine to business. Still, you know, who would have thought you\u2019d rise this far this fast? And yet, you have. And now, you\u2019re completely in with victoria, personally, as well as professionally, while making it seem like it was the boss lady driving it all along. Hm. Well done, you.\" said by Audra\n\"Are you finished?\" said by Nate\n\"Uh, is there more to the story?\" said by Audra\n\"From my vantage point, yes. You seem to have some facts wrong.\" said by Nate\n\"Enlighten me.\" said by Audra\n\"The way things evolved with victoria was not calculated. We had a connection that just exploded. It took us both by surprise, but it\u2019s strong, audra, and it\u2019s real.\" said by Nate\n\"That sounds lovely.\" said by Audra\n\"Last night, I told her she was the most amazing woman I have ever met and that is the truth.\" said by Nate\n\"Uh, I believe you. Yeah, I\u2019ve seen it, felt it in the room when you were both there. I won\u2019t lie, um, I was a little disappointed at first because I felt an attraction to you from the beginning.\" said by Audra\n\"Some people say I don\u2019t have a conscience.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, I know that that\u2019s not true, even though that is the image you like to project. In reality, you are much more considerate than you want people to realize.\" said by Nikki\n\"Just have take your word for that, mom.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay, I know you don\u2019t want to hear this, but I\u2019m going to say it anyway.\" said by Nikki\n\"I\u2019m sure you are. Go ahead.\" said by Victoria\n\"Have you given any thought at all to elena?\" said by Nikki\n\"You know, I have to get to the office. There\u2019s some things that I need to take care of, but please stay. No rush. Finish your coffee.\" said by Victoria\n\"Victoria\u2013\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh, honey, come on.\" said by Nikki\n\"I just keep going back and forth and back and forth with how I feel about all this.\" said by Lauren\n\"Which part?\" said by Michael\n\"Everything. I mean, I\u2019m so thrilled that my best friend could possibly be alive, but how could she do this to us? Why would she do this to us? The way we\u2019ve been grieving, I\u2013 I mean, phyllis would never.\" said by Lauren\n\"Mm\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t be too sure about that. You saw how she was spinning out. She was mad at the world and fighting with everybody and where diane was concerned, please.\" said by Michael\n\"She was unhinged. And I\u2019m no fan of diane\u2019s, but phyllis could have taken it down a notch or two.\" said by Lauren\n\"Ergo, perhaps it\u2019s plausible that phyllis went all out to turn the tables, subject diane to the exact same type of hell she went through.\" said by Michael\n\"The perfect revenge.\" said by > Lauren\n\"It is brilliant, if horrible.\" said by Michael\n\"I really hope that phyllis is still alive\u2026 but to knowingly break our hearts? I mean, how do we come back from this? How does she?\" said by Lauren\n\"Hey. Thank you for meeting me here. I\u2013 I had to see you.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah, it sounded urgent. What\u2019s going on?\" said by Chance\n\"First of all, I\u2013 I know that this sounds crazy. I\u2013 I don\u2019t even know what to think about it, but I\u2019m just, I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve heard the same rumor that I have? Do I need to be more specific?\" said by Summer\n\"No, christine told me. Daniel saw phyllis alive.\" said by Chance\n\"I mean\u2026\" said by Summer\n\"Look summer, given that this came from jack, someone who has a vested interest and someone who I no longer trust, my initial reaction was that this was just some ploy to get diane off the hook, which pisses me off on your behalf.\" said by Chance\n\"Why for me?\" said by Summer\n\"It\u2019s cruel to give you false hope like that.\" said by Chance\n\"So, you don\u2019t think it\u2019s true?\" said by Summer\n\"You want to know what I think? I think diane didn\u2019t mean to kill your mom. I think something went sideways. A\u2013 a mistake was made and here we are. I also think there\u2019s more to this story than what I know and I think it involves jeremy stark somehow.\" said by Chance\n\"It\u2019s definitely complicated.\" said by Summer\n\"Right. But look, this notion about your mother faking her death and trying to frame diane, I think it\u2019s a stretch. I think it\u2019s a scheme cooked up by michael baldwin and your father-in-law and it\u2019s gonna backfire on him. Also, christine is not having any of this and her instincts are usually right.\" said by Chance\n\"I\u2013 I can\u2019t even wrap my head around it and trust me, I\u2019m not immediately accepting it as fact. I mean, we were all here. We saw my mom unconscious on the floor, the ambulance crash, the fire, all of that was very real, but I just can\u2019t help but wonder\u2026 if it is true and my mom came back, I mean, what would happen to her going forward?\" said by Summer\n\"I won\u2019t deny, I\u2013 I would have liked to see where things might have gone with us, but I\u2019m not gonna try to compete with the pull between you and victoria. That could get messy and it\u2019s okay. You know, you can\u2019t always get what you want in this life. At least not all of it.\" said by Audra\n\"I suppose not.\" said by Nate\n\"My ultimate goal is for you to see me as an ally, not an enemy. I want you to have everything your heart desires and I\u2019ll help however I can.\" said by Audra\n\"And you want something in return? I know you\u2019re not being altruistic here. So, we\u2019re helping each other, right? We have to trust each other to get exactly what we want and I know exactly what you want.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh. Success is about give and take. As you move up the ladder and get closer to victoria, there\u2019s gonna be an empty spot at the top of the organization chart at newman media.\" said by Audra\n\"And you\u2019d like to fill it.\" said by Nate\n\"So you want to know what kind of trouble your mom would be in if she was alive?\" said by Chance\n\"Legally, yeah.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, I mean, anything I say would be speculation. You know, I don\u2019t want to mess with your emotions that way.\" said by Chance\n\"I appreciate that chance, but I can handle it. Really, I can. What kind of charges would she be facing? Is there any way that she could come back and not serve time in prison?\" said by Summer\n\"It depends on what evidence she presents.\" said by Chance\n\"Is there anything that you could do to protect her? I mean, if she is out there agonizing over what to do next. She could be on the run or in hiding. She would be afraid to come back, afraid of what would happen to her. And I just, I hate to think about her like that.\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, I understand your urge to play out every possible outcome, I do, but I wish you wouldn\u2019T. I mean, don\u2019t do that to yourself.\" said by Chance\n\"I don\u2019t care if jack and kyle and the president of the united states are on your side, a jury\u2019s gonna see right through you.\" said by Ashley\n\"No jury, no courtroom, no judge.\" said by Diane\n\"Oh, there will be a trial.\" said by Ashley\n\"Mm, don\u2019t think so.\" said by Diane\n\"What are you basing this on? Your hallucinations?\" said by Ashley\n\"No, I\u2019m basing it on\u2026 oh, good morning, tucker.\" said by Diane\n\"Good morning.\" said by Tucker\n\"Thank god, you\u2019re up. Hey, I got an idea, let\u2019s go somewhere.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s a nice day, you want to take a walk?\" said by Tucker\n\"I\u2019d love to.\" said by Ashley\n\"Would you care to join us, diane? Oh, that\u2019s right, your little ankle accessory there. That\u2019s a shame.\" said by Tucker\n\"Ah, ha ha ha ha ha. Hey, are you a stand-up comedian now? I mean, don\u2019t tell me that you sold off your life\u2019s work to victor newman just for that new career.\" said by Diane\n\"What\u2019s with her?\" said by Tucker\n\"I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s very optimistic about her circumstances. Practically dancing on poor phyllis\u2019s grave.\" said by Ashley\n\"Poor phyllis. Oh, you have no idea what\u2026\" said by Diane\n\"No, please finish your thought. I\u2019m fascinated.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah. I\u2019m fascinated too.\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, never mind, I\u2019ll keep it to myself. And in the meantime, I\u2019ll look forward to watching you eat some delicious humble pie. Enjoy your walk.\" said by Diane\n\"Summer.\" said by Daniel\n\"Now, I know why you didn\u2019t return any of my phone calls. You were too busy stabbing mom in the back.\" said by Summer\n\"I should have known kyle couldn\u2019t keep his mouth shut.\" said by Daniel\n\"Thankfully, he has a little bit more respect for me than you do.\" said by Summer\n\"I respect you too, summer, and I didn\u2019t stab anyone in the back. I took the necessary steps to end this and to protect us all. You\u2019ll notice I found a way to out mom without letting anyone know that you lied. I kept your name out of it, so you\u2019re welcome.\" said by Daniel\n\"Daniel, do you have any idea how I\u2019ve had to scramble to make sure that my story matched yours? I told you that we needed to wait until we had a plan that wouldn\u2019t ruin our mom\u2019s life. What did you do? You went straight to jack, the last person that should have known any of this. What the hell were you thinking?\" said by Summer\n\"That I don\u2019t take orders from you. I get that you\u2019re upset about mom and I know this is making you a wreck because I\u2019m a wreck too, but secrecy isn\u2019t the way to handle this. We need to find her, we need to sort this out and we need to get her legal help or our mother is screwed.\" said by Daniel\n\"Oh, hey.\" said by Victoria\n\"Hey, I hope you don\u2019t mind me waiting in here.\" said by Nate\n\"No, not at all. How are you doing? I know that, um, you\u2019re feeling conflicted about certain things. Is there anything I can do to help?\" said by Victoria\n\"You\u2019ve asked me where I\u2019d like things to go between us.\" said by Nate\n\"Yes, that\u2019s right. Have you had any thoughts about it? (Vo) no matter what type of severe asthma you have\u2026\" said by Victoria\n\"The young and the restless will continue.\" said by Announcer\n\"I really wasn\u2019t expecting that.\" said by Victoria\n\"I don\u2019t want to be so forward here in your office, but I felt that was necessary.\" said by Nate\n\"Necessary, how so?\" said by Victoria\n\"Last time we saw each other, I kind of hit the brakes, but I\u2019ve been doing a lot of thinking since then.\" said by Nate\n\"About?\" said by Victoria\n\"You. Us.\" said by Nate\n\"Any conclusions?\" said by Victoria\n\"I broke elena\u2019s heart and I wish I hadn\u2019T. She\u2019s a wonderful woman who didn\u2019t deserve that. But what you and I have, it can\u2019t be denied. It isn\u2019t going anywhere. I\u2019m trying to ignore it. It\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s just impossible.\" said by Nate\n\"It\u2019s not even remotely possible.\" said by Victoria\n\"Vic, it\u2019s me.\" said by Nick\n\"I understand you want answers, but first, we have to find phyllis and then bring her home. And given what she\u2019s done and what she\u2019d be facing if she turned herself in, I\u2019m guessing she doesn\u2019t want to be found. Easier just to stay dead.\" said by Michael\n\"But she hasn\u2019T. If daniel has seen her, she has blown her cover.\" said by Lauren\n\"And what if there\u2019s never another sighting or any hard evidence that she\u2019s still amongst the living?\" said by Michael\n\"Well, then daniel looks unstable and becomes the man who sees his dead mother, which my gosh. As if he hasn\u2019t suffered enough.\" said by Lauren\n\"No, no, no, it\u2019s also possible that phyllis is laying low, keeping her options open, trying to think her way out of this. That\u2019s what I\u2019d do.\" said by Michael\n\"You would never be in this mess.\" said by Lauren\n\"Oh, there was a time.\" said by Michael\n\"That was a long time ago. And you, unlike our dear un-departed friend, you\u2019ve learned from your mistakes.\" said by Lauren\n\"Still a work in progress, but I appreciate your faith in me.\" said by Michael\n\"You know, phyllis has really pulled a lot of outrageous stunts in her life, but this? If and when she ever resurfaces, people are gonna want her head on a platter.\" said by Lauren\n\"They\u2019ll get past this. And so will you\u2026 eventually.\" said by Michael\n\"Of course, I will. I want her home. I want her safe and I want her sound. Okay, um, what\u2019s your next move?\" said by Lauren\n\"I am mulling over a few options.\" said by Michael\n\"Well, it better be ingenious because it\u2019s gonna be very hard to find someone as cagey as phyllis.\" said by Lauren\n\"Hi.\" said by Victoria\n\"Hi. Is this a bad time?\" said by Nick\n\"No, come in.\" said by Victoria\n\"Thanks for those figures. I will touch base later. Nick.\" said by Nate\n\"Nate. I mean, come on. What is it? Is this office like an aphrodisiac?\" said by Nick\n\"Come on. The last thing that I need is another lecture from you.\" said by Victoria\n\"You just can\u2019t see it, can you?\" said by Nick\n\"See what?\" said by Victoria\n\"He\u2019s playing you, vic. He has taken advantage of your interest in him.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, please.\" said by Victoria\n\"He uses people and then has no scruples. He\u2019s hurt elena and lily, his entire family. I can smell his ambition from a mile away.\" said by ", "answer": "Nick"}
{"content": "\"Hi!\" said by Sharon\n\"Hi.\" said by Mariah\n\"Oh, my gosh. You\u2019re home.\" said by Sharon\n\"Oh, it\u2019s good to see you, too.\" said by Mariah\n\"Oh, you\u2019re here at last and you brought your own baby girl home.\" said by Sharon\n\"I can\u2019t wait for you to meet her. I mean, all the video chats in the world don\u2019t compare to holding that little nugget in your arms. You\u2019re gonna love her.\" said by Mariah\n\"[ Sighs ] From the moment she came into this world and became a part of our family, I have loved her with my whole heart.\" said by Sharon\n\"Oh.\" said by Mariah\n\"Summer, can I get you anything? You want something to eat?\" said by Nick\n\"No, thanks. Just\u2026 having you here is nice.\" said by Summer\n\"Of course. I\u2019ll be here as long as you need me.\" said by Nick\n\"I appreciate that. Especially since I don\u2019t know when I\u2019m gonna hear from kyle.\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m sure he will get in touch soon.\" said by Nick\n\"Maybe. He\u2019s probably still at the police station with diane. I guess she\u2019s his top priority now.\" said by Summer\n\"It\u2019s not true. You have to know that.\" said by Kyle\n\"Hey, christine. Thank you for agreeing to see me so soon.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, of course. And I understand the urgency. You must be reeling after everything that\u2019s happened. The memorial for phyllis, diane being arrested for her murder. How are you holding up?\" said by Christine\n\"How I\u2019m doing is the least of my worries. Right now, I am trying to do everything I can to help diane. Arresting her was a gross miscarriage of justice. There is no way she is guilty of trying to harm phyllis.\" said by Jack\n\"\u2018Kay, look, I\u2019m sorry, as district attorney, I can\u2019t discuss an open investigation.\" said by Christine\n\"Look, I\u2019m glad to hear that it\u2019s open, because I think the person you need to stay laser focused on investigating is jeremy stark.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, I assure you we\u2019re following up on every lead, but right now they all lead back to your fianc\u00e9.\" said by Christine\n\"What about stark? He has more motive than anyone else.\" said by Jack\n\"Where\u2019s the evidence?\" said by Christine\n\"Where\u2019s the evidence against diane? You can\u2019t just jump to the conclusion that she\u2019s some kind of murderer. You know diane. You honestly think she\u2019s capable of killing someone?\" said by Jack\n\"Oh\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. Oh, my god, what have I done? For bathroom odors that linger.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Thank you. I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s not as simple as that. There are some irrefutable facts.\" said by Christine\n\"I don\u2019t see how that is possible. I know she is not guilty regardless of what chance or anybody at gcpd claim they have on her.\" said by Jack\n\"The judge never would\u2019ve signed off on an arrest warrant if the evidence wasn\u2019t solid.\" said by Christine\n\"You don\u2019t know what they got their hands on, but they\u2019re soon gonna realize it won\u2019t hold up. Yes, diane and phyllis were in a constant state of conflict, right up to the night that they fought and phyllis died. But diane didn\u2019t murder her. That\u2019s outrageous. Do you know what they brought to the judge?\" said by Jack\n\"Look, jack. I take my professional and ethical boundaries very seriously. If you expect me to reveal some information about this case because of our friendship, I can\u2019T. It would be totally inappropriate.\" said by Christine\n\"I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not trying to take advantage. I\u2019m not. I am scared, and I am outraged. She does not belong behind bars. All I\u2019m asking is that you try to slow this thing down and not rush to judgment.\" said by Jack\n\"I assure you, it wasn\u2019t rushed or without very strong evidence. This arrest was made on strong investigative work.\" said by Christine\n\"[ Sighs ] Then you have to focus on stark again. You have to. And somehow get diane out of that cell.\" said by Jack\n\"Okay. Jack, I\u2013 I understand how hard this is for you and your family, especially at a time like this. But I\u2019m telling you honestly, there\u2019s really nothing I can do except follow protocol.\" said by Christine\n\"Protocol? There is a murderer running scot-free out there, while my fianc\u00e9 is sitting in a jail cell on trumped up charges. Did it ever occur to you, maybe he set her up? Whatever this so-called evidence your people have is\u2013\" said by Jack\n\"It is very real evidence. So much so that it incriminated, diane to be arrested, okay?\" said by Christine\n\"Kyle, I\u2013 I didn\u2019t expect you to be home so soon. But I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re here.\" said by Summer\n\"I need to be with you and harrison. I thought you might need me to.\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, it\u2019s been a long, exhausting day. You both need to get some rest.\" said by Nick\n\"How\u2013 how did things go at the police station?\" said by Summer\n\"Dad and I were there while my mom was being processed, but they wouldn\u2019t allow us to talk to her. Chance did allow her to tell us in passing and she was okay. Not that I believed her. She looks shell-shocked and traumatized. I mean, they have to know she didn\u2019t do this.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019m sure the police will get to the bottom of what happened. And I know jack will do everything he can to help your mother.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, he\u2019s meeting with christine as we speak. Hopefully, he can convince her to release her as soon as possible. In any case, thank you for bringing summer home.\" said by Kyle\n\"Of course. All right, I\u2019mma leave you two alone. I\u2019m a phone call away. You need anything, I don\u2019t care what it is, call me and I\u2019ll be here.\" said by Nick\n\"Thanks, dad.\" said by Summer\n\"Where are tessa and the baby? You know I\u2019m dying to see her.\" said by Sharon\n\"Oh. You thought you were gonna see the baby tonight? At this hour? No, no, no. I sent tessa and the baby to the tack house. That\u2019s okay, right?\" said by Mariah\n\"You are teasing me, right? Stop, where are they? Are they waiting outside? \u2018Cause I\u2019ll go out there and get them myself.\" said by Sharon\n\"No, no, no, no, no. Hold your horses. I will text her to come in. I just wanted to come in first to make sure the place was warm enough and, you know, there wasn\u2019t anybody with any strong perfume, or nobody was, like, hacking up a lung. I know, I sound ridiculous. It\u2019s a little embarrassing.\" said by Mariah\n\"No, no, it\u2019s perfectly normal. You sound like a first-time parent. But now that you see none of those horrors are going on in here, bring her in here. Hurry up! I can\u2019t wait to meet her.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, there\u2019s, uh\u2013 there\u2019s no need. Ta-da.\" said by Mariah\n\"Hey, sharon.\" said by Tessa\n\"Hi, tessa. Finally. Oh, my gosh. Aw.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, here she is. Meet aria porter copeland.\" said by Mariah\n\"She is perfect. She\u2019s absolutely perfect.\" said by Sharon\n\"Isn\u2019t it crazy how pink her lips are? They\u2019re so perfect.\" said by Tessa\n\"It\u2019s the cheeks that get me.\" said by Mariah\n\"The cheeks, I know.\" said by Tessa\n\"The cheeks, they\u2019re just so round. There are times, I wonder\u2026\" said by Mariah\n\"Oh, yes. Oh.\" said by Victoria\n\"Hey, audra.\" said by Nick\n\"Nick. Um, I heard about your loss. Please accept my condolences.\" said by Audra\n\"Thanks.\" said by Nick\n\"You know, I\u2019m surprised to see you here. Wasn\u2019t the service today?\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah, it was. But, uh, there\u2019s always work to be done, and honestly, I could use the distraction.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, if you\u2019re looking for your sister, she\u2019s in her office.\" said by Audra\n\"Oh, yeah? Great. I wasn\u2019t sure she\u2019d be here this late. I do need to speak with her, but I gotta run by my office and I\u2019ll come back and see her. Thanks.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah. My pleasure, nick.\" said by Audra\n\"Come here, baby. Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness. Look at you. Oh, my sweetie-jo. Look at you.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, she definitely did.\" said by Tessa\n\"Ugh. Well, does she\u2013 does she cry much? Because she just seems so peaceful here. Like, she didn\u2019t even make a fuss when she came into my arms.\" said by Sharon\n\"Aw.\" said by Tessa\n\"[ Laughs softly] It\u2019s pretty cool, isn\u2019t it?\" said by Adam\n\"[ Sighs ] Yeah. I mean, they look like their world just got a million times more wonderful.\" said by Sally\n\"Hmm. There\u2019s nothing better than a baby. There\u2019s just something about their presence that fills your heart in a way that you can\u2019t even imagine. Just this little life with endless potential. Your world is suddenly brand new because now they\u2019re in it.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, look at you getting all poetic on me.\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2019ve been there. Trust me. It\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s magical. And it won\u2019t be long until you get to experience that for yourself.\" said by Adam\n\"[ Sighs ] Well, why don\u2019t we go in and meet the new baby?\" said by Sally\n\"Hello to the happy new parents.\" said by Adam\n\"Congrats, mamas.\" said by Sally\n\"Thank you so much.\" said by Mariah\n\"As you can see, we\u2019re over the moon.\" said by Tessa\n\"Her name is aria. Isn\u2019t that a beautiful name?\" said by Sharon\n\"That is absolutely fitting. This kid is gonna get the best lullabies ever.\" said by Adam\n\"[ Laughs ] True.\" said by Mariah\n\"Can I take a peek?\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, of course. Go ahead.\" said by Mariah\n\"Oh, yeah, we\u2019re all about sharing the joy. I mean, what else is a baby for?\" said by Tessa\n\"Oh, my gosh. Hi. Oh, my god. Look at those little fingers and her precious cheeks.\" said by Sally\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Mariah\n\"Aw. How does it feel?\" said by Sally\n\"What?\" said by Mariah\n\"Just, you know, being mothers now and knowing that aria is all yours?\" said by Sally\n\"It\u2019s like this wonderful miracle just happened.\" said by Tessa\n\"It\u2019s like our\u2013 our greatest dream came true.\" said by Mariah\n\"We have a lot to talk about. But first, I wanna know how you\u2019re doing? You poured so much of yourself into planning this memorial and now that it\u2019s over\u2013\" said by Kyle\n\"To be honest, I\u2019m just\u2026 exhausted. You know, I feel like I could sleep for a week, but\u2026 it was worth it, you know? The service was lovely. Don\u2019t you think?\" said by Summer\n\"It was just right. You did a great job. I can\u2019t believe you did all that work on your own. Everyone was grateful for the chance to say goodbye to phyllis.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah. And I got to say all the things that I needed to say to her. Things that I should have said to her while she was still here.\" said by Summer\n\"And phyllis would\u2019ve loved it. I hope that\u2019ll bring you comfort in the days ahead.\" said by Kyle\n\"Maybe, but I\u2019m still gonna wake up every morning wishing that she were still her. But maybe\u2013 maybe I\u2019ll be able to rest a little easier knowing that we honored my mom in a way that she deserved. And I think she was smiling down at us today. And thank you, my wonderful husband.\" said by Summer\n\"For what?\" said by Kyle\n\"Just for standing by me, for being the loving, supportive partner that I\u2019ve needed throughout this whole ordeal. And I\u2013 I can\u2019t even imagine what you\u2019re feeling right now. You must have been blindsided by diane\u2019s arrest.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah. I\u2013 I really didn\u2019t see that coming. I hate to think that she\u2019s all alone and locked up for something she didn\u2019t do. I mean, how can they even think that? She\u2019s not a murderer.\" said by Kyle\n\"You really still think that? Even now?\" said by Summer\n\"What happened to you leaving town last night like we planned? It\u2019s so dangerous for you to be within 50 miles of this place. Why are you still here? Dry skin is sensitive skin, too.\" said by Jeremy\n\"I understand your point of view. I\u2013 I respect it. But promise me you\u2019ll hear this much. From the moment diane came back to town, she has wanted nothing more than to reestablish her relationship with her son and get to know her grandson. That is all. Now she has a future with them, and with me. She has a new and burgeoning career. And why would she jeopardize all of that to get back at an old foe? Why would she go to all that work to rebuild her life here in town, only to throw it all away?\" said by Jack\n\"And I see your point. But the evidence indicates she did exactly that.\" said by Christine\n\"Then the evidence is wrong. This leads us back to jeremy stark. He\u2019s a criminal. He set her up.\" said by Jack\n\"Tomorrow is her arraignment. I think you need to be prepared for what could happen. And given diane\u2019s history of disappearing into the wind, there\u2019s a very good chance that she won\u2019t get bail. And there is nothing I can do about that. And if stark is responsible for phyllis\u2019s death, he has done an excellent job of implicating diane and covering his tracks.\" said by Christine\n\"He may be good, he\u2019s not that good. Eventually what he did wrong will come to light. He will be proven guilty.\" said by Jack\n\"I changed my mind. I\u2019m allowed to change my mind. People do it all the time.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yeah. Look, I knew it. You took an insane risk by going to the memorial service.\" said by Jeremy\n\"I had to go.\" said by Phyllis\n\"No, you didn\u2019T.\" said by Jeremy\n\"I did.\" said by Phyllis\n\"No, the only thing you have to do is get the hell outta town.\" said by Jeremy\n\"I had to see how my children feel about me. I had to see.\" said by Phyllis\n\"There you go with the kids again. Okay. Why do you care? They are adults now. They have their own lives and they\u2019re gonna mourn and get right back to their busy lives.\" said by Jeremy\n\"No, they\u2019re not.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yes, they will.\" said by Jeremy\n\"No, they\u2019re not.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yes, they will and you know it.\" said by Jeremy\n\"They\u2019re not.\" said by Phyllis\n\"You know it.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Shh. Shh. You didn\u2019t hear the pain and regret that was in their voice. You weren\u2019t there. I can take that away for them.\" said by Phyllis\n\"By showing up and letting them see that you\u2019re alive.\" said by Jeremy\n\"They\u2019ll forgive me.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Of course, I believe my mother is innocent. What\u2013 are\u2013 are\u2013 are you saying you don\u2019t?\" said by Kyle\n\"Look, kyle. I know how hard it is to accept a reality that you don\u2019t want to believe is real.\" said by Summer\n\"Because it\u2019s not. I will never stop believing my mother is innocent. The cops got this one wrong. It is tragic and it is disgusting. But jeremy stark is the only one to blame for what happened to phyllis.\" said by Kyle\n\"Look, I don\u2019t doubt that jeremy stark played a role in this and hopefully it won\u2019t be long before he\u2019s arrested, too, but I\u2019m not buying that he acted alone. Chance didn\u2019t arrest diane for no reason. Okay? They have a strong case against her.\" said by Summer\n\"What? You can\u2019t believe that. Whatever dubious evidence they have comes courtesy of stark framing my mother.\" said by Kyle\n\"[ Scoffs ] You\u2019re way too close to this. You just can\u2019t see your mother for who she is. But I can. And now the police do, too. Look, I\u2019m sorry, kyle. But I have to believe that diane is the reason my mom is dead.\" said by Summer\n\"Vic, you in there?\" said by Nick\n\"Uh, hey, nick. I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t realize I had the door locked. Uh, nate and I were just having a drink. I imagine you could use one after the day you had.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yes, thanks.\" said by Nate\n\"Sure.\" said by Victoria\n\"Uh, nick, my, uh, sincere condolences. Losing phyllis is a huge loss to you and her family. She\u2019ll be missed, uh, by the whole city, really. Um, I\u2019m sure you two need some time to talk. Uh, I\u2019ll check in with you later, victoria.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, yeah. There you go. So, how was the memorial service? I imagine it was especially hard for daniel and summer.\" said by Victoria\n\"I don\u2019t wanna talk about that right now.\" said by Nick\n\"Okay. What do you want to talk about?\" said by Victoria\n\"What are you thinking?\" said by Nick\n\"[ Scoffs ] What? I don\u2019t understand what you mean.\" said by Victoria\n\"Stop. Just stop it. You know what I\u2019m talking about. You and nate. Whatever was happening in this office. (Lucky) uh-oh the magic\u2019s disappearing!\" said by Nick\n\"The young and the restless will continue. (Vo) get them to open up.\" said by Announcer\n\"Is that who I think it is?\" said by Elena\n\"Elena, meet our daughter, aria.\" said by Tessa\n\"Isn\u2019t she darling?\" said by Sharon\n\"You know, we didn\u2019t plan a welcome home party for her, but it looks like we don\u2019t have to. She\u2019s getting to meet everyone.\" said by Mariah\n\"Oh, yes. Welcome home is right. We have all been dying to meet you, baby aria. Look how perfect you are. And look at your mommies. You guys are all glowing.\" said by Elena\n\"Aw.\" said by Mariah\n\"Oh, my gosh. I know how much you both wanted to be a family and now look at you.\" said by Elena\n\"Thanks, elena. I don\u2019t think I could have done it without you. I mean, all your help and advice before the baby was born. I was just so worried about being unprepared.\" said by Tessa\n\"That\u2019s because the three of you were meant to be together.\" said by Elena\n\"Oh, hug it out.\" said by Elena\n\"Yeah, we did.\" said by Tessa\n\"I know I\u2019m not the most observant guy in the world, but even I could see the smudge of lipstick on nate\u2019s neck. What about the button you missed there? And what in the hell is going on with your hair? Is that the way you normally wear it?\" said by Nick\n\"Fine. You got me.\" said by Victoria\n\"You think?\" said by Nick\n\"Look, why are you freaking out about this? When you have other things that you should be concerned about. Why are you not focusing on your family right now?\" said by Victoria\n\"You are my family. I care about you. You\u2019re making a terrible mistake.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, there you go again, making another leap without any evidence to back it up.\" said by Victoria\n\"He is in a relationship, vic, with my friend.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, yeah, I know. And you\u2013 you have a saintly past, free of guilt. Right, nick?\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, he\u2019s an executive here. He could have some ulterior motive. Maybe, uh, looking for some personal gain.\" said by Nick\n\"What gain? That\u2019s not nate. That\u2019s not who he is. Look, if he was up to something, I would know it anyway.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, like you saw everything that was going down with ashley?\" said by Nick\n\"That was a completely different situation, and don\u2019t you ever mention his name to me again. Do you understand?\" said by Victoria\n\"[ Sighs ] Yes. Sorry. But this could be more of the same, you know?\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2019m not interested in your opinions or your judgment. I\u2019m just not. I\u2013 I\u2026 you yourself had a relationship with the ceo of newman media, remember? And you\u2013 you firmly told me to stay out of it. And I have been nothing\u2013 nothing but respectful of your relationship with sally.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yes. And I appreciate it.\" said by Nick\n\"So, would you please show me the same courtesy? You told me to keep quiet about her pregnancy and that adam is the father and I have done that. So, please, do the same for me. Keep my private life private. Do you understand, nicholas? Now, if that\u2019s everything, I\u2013 I have some things that I need to finish.\" said by Victoria\n\"Start by brushing your hair.\" said by Nick\n\"I get how this must look to you. I understand how desperate you must be for answers. But I know my mother. She isn\u2019t capable of poisoning someone just to get them out of the way.\" said by Kyle\n\"My mom is not just \u201csomeone.\u201d Their hatred for each other goes back decades. As does their competition over jack.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, I know. I remember the story about the pool house. Dad had to have it rebuilt after my mom burned it down.\" said by Kyle\n\"And she did it so that it looked like my mom tried to kill her. She wasn\u2019t arrested or convicted back then, but everybody knew what happened.\" said by Summer\n\"That really doesn\u2019t matter. She\u2019s not that person anymore. She has worked very hard to try to prove that to us, ever since she returned.\" said by Kyle\n\"Our moms bring out the worst in each other. It\u2019s obvious that some things never change. Or you know what? Maybe\u2013 maybe they actually do because this time it was way worse. Your mom was pushed past her limit, and she snapped.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, wait a minute. She didn\u2019t\u2013\" said by Kyle\n\"No, kyle. Just listen to me. Okay? Hear me out. I\u2019m not trying to make excuses for my mom\u2019s behavior. God knows that I wish that she had gotten a grip on herself and stopped her obsession. Maybe then she would still be alive today. But she didn\u2019T. She was gonna keep on pushing diane and undermining her at every turn, including in her relationship with jack, and diane knew it. She was done with my mom.\" said by Summer\n\"But not to the point of trying to poison her.\" said by Kyle\n\"No, it all came to a head the night of the gala, when they had that crazy fight. Diane said that she wanted to strangle my mom to death.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, that was a figure of speech. She didn\u2019t mean it literally.\" said by Kyle\n\"She could\u2019ve easily poisoned her right after that. The last words that my mom said to me was that she needed to protect and defend herself against diane. She knew that diane would do anything to make her suffer. And even though she knew the threat that your mom posed to her, she wouldn\u2019t stop. She kept on pushing and aggravating her. It\u2019s just\u2013 it is so clear to me what happened. And kyle, I know that it is painful, but you need to open your eyes. There are times, I wonder\u2026\" said by Summer\n\"Don\u2019t you think for a second that you can go back. Oh, yeah, they\u2019re shedding tears now. But what do you think will happen when they figure out that you faked the whole thing?\" said by Jeremy\n\"They\u2019ll forgive me. Diane did it. They forgave her. She let her kid think that she was dead for years and years. Trust me, it\u2019ll be fine. It\u2019s only been a couple days.\" said by Phyllis\n\"You seem to be forgetting the point in all this. We put this in motion so we could see diane rot in prison.

Make sure you keep your guard up.\" said by Victoria\n\"I will. I would tell you to do the same, but I know your guard is always up when it comes to adam.

Dad wants to bring adam closer to the family, and you know how he is. He\u2019s not gonna quit until he gets what he wants.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, then I guess he\u2019s just gonna have to find another way to get what he wants.\" said by Victoria\n\"By letting adam run mccall, it keeps him out of our business and lets him focus on something else.\" said by Nick\n\"But then adam wins.\" said by Victoria\n\"Who cares, vick? Let him, if it keeps him out of our hair.\" said by Nick\n\"My plan is to fold mccall into newman, and I\u2019m not gonna let dad and adam derail that.\" said by Victoria\n\"Newman doesn\u2019t need mccall. We\u2019ve made a bunch of great acquisitions. The company is doing great. Let\u2019s just focus on what we have. Let adam and dad go off and do whatever they want away from us.\" said by Nick\n\"Look, nicholas, i understand where you\u2019re caution is coming from, but I am not gonna pass on this phenomenal opportunity so that dad can use mccall to lure adam back into the family, which is only gonna make him more beholden to dad, like some emotional hostage. It\u2019s bad business. It\u2019s miserable parenting. You and I \u2014 we\u2019ve seen this movie before. We know that it ends in disaster for both of them.\" said by Victoria\n\"So, now you\u2019re worried about adam\u2019s emotional well-being?\" said by Nick\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Victoria\n\"Ohh. Taking a more casual approach to the night\u2019s festivities?\" said by Adam\n\"Well, don\u2019t you look dapper.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, well, thank you so much. Should be quite a party.\" said by Adam\n\"I hope so. We could use the night out to blow off some steam. We\u2019ve been very, very busy at newman. I assume that you\u2019ve been busy, too\u2026\" said by Victoria\n\"Mm.\" said by Adam\n\"\u2026Whatever it is you\u2019re doing these days.\" said by Victoria\n\"[ Laughs ] Um\u2026biding my time.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, right. That\u2019s a pretty phrase for \u201cunemployed,\u201d isn\u2019t it?\" said by Victoria\n\"Eh, it might be, but I\u2019m waiting on something very interesting.\" said by Adam\n\"Really? I wonder what that could be. I really hope that you don\u2019t have your heart set on mccall unlimited.\" said by Victoria\n\"Why? You think that devon\u2019s gonna buy it?\" said by Adam\n\"No. No, we have our sights set on the company. It\u2019s gonna be newman property soon.\" said by Victoria\n\"Good. I am glad to hear it.\" said by Adam\n\"I don\u2019t know why. Because even if newman does acquire it, you definitely will not be the one in charge.\" said by Victoria\n\"[ Chuckles ] I was just about to say the exact same thing to you.\" said by Adam\n\"Are you, like, an expert mediator now? \u2018Cause it seems to be all you\u2019re trying to do these days.\" said by Devon\n\"Come on, devon. I never claimed to be an expert. But I do have something I\u2019d like to say, and I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019d listen.\" said by Nate\n\"Okay. Let\u2019s hear what you have to say.\" said by Devon\n\"I\u2019d like to tell you that the highlight of my brief, tumultuous time at chancellor winters was watching you and lily work together. Man, your bond was so strong and full of love. You don\u2019t see that between brothers and sisters these days. Look, I am sorry for my role in your conflict. I betrayed you and lily. And I know you don\u2019t want me to say neil\u2019s name around you.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah, I meant that.\" said by Devon\n\"Fine. Think of him. Think of how he would feel about this rift. Would he want to help rebuild your relationship with lily? Well, he\u2019s not here. So, if there\u2019s anything I can do to help, I would love to know. That is the least I owe you and lily.\" said by Nate\n\"Okay, well, there\u2019s absolutely nothing you can do. So, thanks.\" said by Devon\n\"This is a long time coming, and I am so sorry for the pain that I caused you. Look, I understand that a betrayal is a betrayal and it doesn\u2019t matter that it wasn\u2019t intentional and we never meant for this to happen. It was just \u2014 it came out of emotion, and I \u2014 we don\u2019t even know where it came from.\" said by Abby\n\"Okay, you can stop. I don\u2019t need to hear this. I really don\u2019t care.\" said by Amanda\n\"I doubt that.\" said by Abby\n\"Well, it\u2019s true. But you\u2019re right. \u201cNot caring\u201d \u2014 it didn\u2019t happen overnight. It took time. I replayed that day over and over, you scrambling to find your shirt, devon stammering to explain. I was hurt, I was angry, but i could not \u2014 i did not let it dictate my life. I have too much to focus on. My job, my family. My mom needs my love and support back home. So, I have so much going on that I don\u2019t have time to worry about you and devon.\" said by Amanda\n\"I\u2019m sure that\u2019s true. But why did you come back here then? You had to have known that you were gonna go head-to-head with devon. I mean, are you trying to punish him?\" said by Abby\n\"No, no, it is not like that at all.\" said by Amanda\n\"Amanda, please listen to me. Devon is struggling to keep his connection with neil, and it is vital that he keeps that connection \u2014 and his company. Please don\u2019t punish him for a mistake that he and I both made.\" said by Abby\n\"Please tell me you are not thinking of bringing tucker to this party tonight.\" said by Jack\n\"It\u2019s really none of your business, jack.\" said by Ashley\n\"It is genoa city\u2019s bicentennial celebration. For a good number of those years, the abbotts have been a respected and admired family in this community. This is an important night for us, ash. And you\u2019re bringing him?\" said by Jack\n\"Uh, I understand your concerns, jack, but I have had all my shots and I\u2019m housebroken, mostly.\" said by Tucker\n\"This is outrageous.\" said by Jack\n\"Ugh, so predictable, jack, that you would have a problem with me going to this gala with tucker. Not that I\u2019ve agreed to go to this gala with you.\" said by Ashley\n\"It is a slap in the face for all the abbotts who have come before us.\" said by Jack\n\"Would you just give it a rest? I sincerely doubt that our ancestors have an issue with me going to the gala with this miscreant.\" said by Ashley\n\"When are you gonna get it through your head you don\u2019t have to give this man another moment of your attention?\" said by Jack\n\"It\u2019s a date.\" said by Ashley\n\"Fantastic.\" said by Tucker\n\"You should know something. Mamie is here. She\u2019s going to be at the gala. When you see her, don\u2019t have him with you. I\u2019d like it to be a pleasant homecoming for her.\" said by Jack\n\"I can\u2019t wait.\" said by Ashley\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Jack\n\"Hey, kyle. And summer. Wow. You look lovely.\" said by Tucker\n\"Uh, thank you?\" said by Summer\n\"See ya.\" said by Tucker\n\"[ Sighs ] Uh, what did we miss?\" said by Kyle\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Jack\n\"You know how much devon loved neil and how much hamilton-winters means to him. And fighting with lily and jill \u2014 it\u2019s just tragic.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah, it most definitely is.\" said by Amanda\n\"And part of me feels like, deep down, you know how wrong this is and that maybe there\u2019s a way that you can help resolve this, a way that could work out for everyone.\" said by Abby\n\"It never works out for everyone, abby. Lily reached out to me and hired me to win this case. That is what I am obligated to do. It\u2019s nothing personal, abby. I\u2019m not seeking revenge. I wouldn\u2019t do that. I\u2019m a lawyer \u2014 and a damn good one. I don\u2019t waste my time on cases I can\u2019t win.\" said by Amanda\n\"Amanda \u2014\" said by Abby\n\"I\u2019m through here. Your little plea on devon\u2019s behalf, it\u2019s touching, but why don\u2019t you just let the grown-ups figure this out? I have no interest in speaking to you about this or anything else ever again.\" said by Amanda\n\"[ Sighs heavily ]\" said by Abby\n\"I mean, jill, I \u2014\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah, but, lily, you need to leave room for yourself to maneuver. You can\u2019t lock yourself into a position. A strong leader has to be able to change her mind.\" said by Jill\n\"Yeah. I mean, usually when a legal battle starts, you know, but we were winning the case and you still just want to reverse the course?\" said by Lily\n\"Well, that is very true. Okay. But the arbitration brought to light just how contentious things were between you and devon. And, ohh, I hated that.\" said by Jill\n\"And that\u2019s what changed your perspective.\" said by Lily\n\"[ Sighs ] Ah, I got to get going to get ready for the gala.\" said by Jill\n\"[ Scoffs ]\" said by Lily\n\"I will see you at the club, sweetie.\" said by Jill\n\"Okay, wait. Jill, I\u2019m sorry. I need to understand. What made you change your mind today?\" said by Lily\n\"There are a lot of old friends in town for the celebration, and I spoke to one of them. And he reminded me what katherine would want and how she would feel about devon\u2019s role in the company. So, I got some very sage advice\" said by Jill\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Lily\n\"Good evening, newmans! How are we tonight?\" said by Michael\n\"Hey, michael.\" said by Nikki\n\"Working hard, I see.\" said by Michael\n\"Well, I\u2019ll be damned. Mr. Michael baldwin. Well, my beautiful wife is working.

Lauren was not satisfied with looking merely spectacular. She is striving for perfection on this big occasion.\" said by Michael\n\"Ah, well, I am certain she will succeed. So, is everything good to go?\" said by Nikki\n\"So far. I\u2019ve checked with the catering. Things are moving ahead as planned. It is gonna be a marvelous night. I am so excited about revealing the lounge and our little surprise.\" said by Michael\n\"Yes.\" said by Nikki\n\"It will be spectacular. I promise you.\" said by Victor\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Michael\n\"Hey, I don\u2019t know what you heard about the mccall acquisition, but, uh, regardless, it\u2019s not gonna end well for you. You\u2019re not gonna control tucker\u2019s company.\" said by Adam\n\"[ Breathes deeply ] Okay, let me just try to follow your logic for a minute. Newman enterprises is going to acquire mccall unlimited. Oh, that\u2019s right. I\u2019m in charge of newman. Therefore, I\u2019m not in charge of mccall. I\u2019m sorry, but there seem to be some flaws in your argument.\" said by Victoria\n\"No, I think the flaw\u2019s in your premise \u2014 that you actually control newman.\" said by Adam\n\"You know, I\u2019m aware of dad\u2019s offer to you to be in control of mccall, but you do realize that it was just a gesture, right? It\u2019s like when a girl can\u2019t get a date to the prom and her cousin has to step in and help her out of pity.\" said by Victoria\n\"Wait. I\u2019m the teenage girl who can\u2019t get a date in that scenario? Is that what you\u2019re saying?\" said by Adam\n\"There is no way in hell I\u2019m gonna stand by and watch while dad gives away a $1-billion company so his poor little baby boy can get a pat on the back.\" said by Victoria\n\"Has it ever occurred to you that I am qualified to run that company?\" said by Adam\n\"No, it hasn\u2019t occurred to me.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, I am. And you are deluded if you think victor isn\u2019t going to see his plan through.\" said by Adam\n\"And you are deluded if you think that dad is gonna help you this time.\" said by Victoria\n\"Do you know what your problem is, victoria?\" said by Adam\n\"Please tell me.\" said by Victoria\n\"You overestimate your own abilities so badly that you are oblivious to other people\u2019s strengths. It\u2019s probably one of the reasons dad\u2019s gonna put me in charge of mccall \u2014 \u2019cause you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.\" said by Adam\n\"Hey. Hey. You are way out of line, adam. (Vo) nature valley has helped restore access to national park trails\" said by Nate\n\"I don\u2019t understand. Why was ashley with tucker mccall?\" said by Kyle\n\"You really want to know?\" said by Jack\n\"Actually, no. I think I\u2019m going to stay out of it.\" said by Kyle\n\"I think that that is a great choice. Let\u2019s just focus on this party and the things that matter.\" said by Summer\n\"Like the fact that you two look amazing.\" said by Diane\n\"Thank you, diane.\" said by Summer\n\"You look pretty amazing yourself.\" said by Jack\n\"Mm!

God, of all the defenses I thought he would try, the last thing I ever expected him to claim was that the deceased is still alive.\" said by Christine\n\"Yeah.\" said by Chance\n\"Look at that one. Banging away at them bongos. He\u2019s got perfect time.\" said by Tucker\n\"He\u2019s so adorable. I\u2019m so impressed that you were able to stay that whole time. Especially considering it was maracas day.\" said by Ashley\n\"Well, it gave it a latin flair.\" said by Tucker\n\"Did it give you a headache? Did you tell everybody, all the grown-ups that you were a big fancy music producer?\" said by Ashley\n\"No, I didn\u2019t have to, the teacher recognized me.\" said by Tucker\n\"Really?\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah. Even played one of my old tunes for the kids to rattle along to. Next time, I\u2019m gonna bring a playlist. Tucker mccall\u2019s greatest hits.\" said by Tucker\n\"Next time?\" said by Ashley\n\"Hmm. I loved it. I\u2019m thinking of becoming a regular.\" said by Tucker\n\"Okay, seriously. Who are you? Because the tucker mccall that I used to know would never have the patience to sit through a toddler\u2019s music class with maracas. So, what\u2019s come over you?\" said by Ashley\n\"You, wonderful you.\" said by Tucker\n\"Can you believe how quickly dominic crashed? That music play group just wore him out.\" said by Abby\n\"Oh, I know. Exercising all that talent is bound to tire him out.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, yeah. Well, I\u2019m sure his grandpa is probably exhausted too.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah. I was very surprised that tucker wanted to come and hang out in class today.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah, louise said that he was already there when they got there. That he stayed the whole entire class. He was riveted the whole time and that he was, like, taking pictures and recording video.\" said by Abby\n\"He\u2019s like a proud grandpa.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay. Can you believe this? I mean, tucker playing the role of doting grandpa? I don\u2019t know. I mean, at first, I thought that maybe this was all just part of a plan to get you to forgive him or some sort of scheme to win my mom back, but maybe he actually wants to be a real part of dominic\u2019s life and yours.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah, I think he does. He\u2019s definitely been putting forth the effort and he seems more sincere about it these days than he has before, so. I don\u2019t know, maybe your mom\u2019s having a positive effect on him.\" said by Devon\n\"But do you think it\u2019s actually possible that tucker is a changed man?\" said by Abby\n\"Hey, anything is possible, right?\" said by Devon\n\"I want nothing more to be true. But I just\u2013 I can\u2019t trust it. I\u2019m afraid that all of this is part of some con to win my mom back. And screw her over even worse this time.\" said by Abby\n\"Okay, we\u2019re in. Now what?\" said by Kyle\n\"I don\u2019t even know what we\u2019re looking for, but I guarantee you, we will know it when we see it. When migraine strikes, you\u2019re faced with a choice.\" said by Jack\n\"Additional sponsorship provided by\u2026\" said by Announcer\n\"Yeah, this new defense strategy is definitely surprising. You can\u2019t charge her with murder if there\u2019s no murder. I didn\u2019t see that one coming.\" said by Chance\n\"Which is why we need to be doubly sure where our evidence stands and where we need to shore up. It\u2019s all highly incriminating, but it\u2019s mostly circumstantial.\" said by Christine\n\"Well, we have the physical fight. We have an outraged diane who was threatening a woman who ends up dead a few hours later. We have the letter that phyllis wrote and the voicemail that she left michael.\" said by Chance\n\"In what was probably her last call? And phyllis was clearly leaving a cry for help.\" said by Christine\n\"Her cell phone wasn\u2019t recovered in the fire, but we are reaching out to the phone company to see if she reached out to anybody else. I think it\u2019s ironic that she voiced her fear of diane to michael, who ends up being her defense attorney.\" said by Chance\n\"Yeah, which makes me wonder how he could believe in her innocence so passionately.\" said by Christine\n\"Maybe it\u2019s because all of our evidence goes squarely to motive. There\u2019s no direct proof of murder.\" said by Chance\n\"What about the strychnine that was purchased under diane\u2019s name?\" said by Christine\n\"Well, unfortunately, there is no record of her receiving it by delivery or picking it up. And there\u2019s no prints on the vial either.\" said by Chance\n\"Then how did she get it in her possession? And how did she touch the vial without leaving fingerprints? Obviously, she used gloves.\" said by Christine\n\"I mean, that\u2019s the only way. But why would she think she needed gloves? And more to the point, after she used the poison and achieved her goal, why did she keep the vial?\" said by Chance\n\"God, see, it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s discrepancies like these that can give a jury, reasonable doubt.\" said by Christine\n\"Yeah. There are enough holes in this case to give michael some leverage with a jury. I mean, maybe there is something to the possibility to an extreme setup. Should I look into that?\" said by Chance\n\"Wait, are you starting to buy the thought that phyllis is still alive?\" said by Christine\n\"I think it\u2019s a stretch. I think we should keep looking into stark. If diane and stark were working together, then maybe he crossed her. There could be something there. I don\u2019t know, but I know there\u2019s more to the story than what we know.\" said by Chance\n\"Okay, look, I am open to the fact that diane had a co-conspirator. I mean, there are elements here that she couldn\u2019t have done it alone. Oh, god, and what about the leak at the department? I mean, someone spoke about the murder weapon. No one on the outside knew about the scissors. So we have to plug that hole A.S.A.P.\" said by Christine\n\"Oh, excuse me one second. I gotta take this. Yeah.\" said by Chance\n\"Michael hit the jackpot when he linked stark\u2019s P.O. Box to this place.\" said by Kyle\n\"He did. I wish they still had security footage from that period. At least the manager told me he rented this room to a spencer jenkins.\" said by Jack\n\"He used mom\u2019s last name and reversed his initials. J.S. To S.J. Not much of a con man after all.\" said by Kyle\n\"At least I talked him into letting us in here.\" said by Jack\n\"How much did that cost you?\" said by Kyle\n\"I don\u2019t know what the going rate is, but I paid a lot more. Here. One of these.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, you\u2019re not too bad at this detective thing. You\u2019ve thought of everything.\" said by Kyle\n\"We can\u2019t overlook anything. No matter how small, no matter how seemingly inconsequential. Start looking.\" said by Jack\n\"I know a lot of time has passed since stark was here and we don\u2019t even know if phyllis was with him. The motel staff has probably cleaned this place multiple times, not to mention all the guests checking in and out.\" said by Kyle\n\"True, but we still could find something. This isn\u2019t exactly the grand phoenix. I\u2019m sure their housekeeping department is not meticulous. All we need to do is find something phyllis left behind that we can pull dna from and we prove that she\u2019s still alive and that your mother is innocent.\" said by Jack\n\"I\u2019m not trying to minimize tucker\u2019s affection for you or for dominic. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m just saying wherever he\u2019s concerned, caution is not a bad idea.\" said by Abby\n\"I completely agree with you. I\u2019ve had my guard up since he showed up to town and put a plant in our company. You know? But his priorities have seemed to have changed since he sold his company. And regardless of how we feel, he and your mom are getting a lot closer.\" said by Devon\n\"I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re right. My mom never would have moved him into the abbott house unless there\u2019s something more going on between them. Is everything okay? Are you late for a meeting or something?\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah. No, I\u2019m waiting for a package. But, how do you really feel about this? About them progressing? You know, if they keep moving forward into a real serious relationship? And it\u2019s your mom and my dad.\" said by Devon\n\"So, you\u2019re in such a great mood because of me?\" said by Ashley\n\"Not quite that simple. I\u2019m a very complex person, as you know.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, yes, I definitely know that. So then why are you in such a good mood?\" said by Ashley\n\"I don\u2019t know. Seeing dom\u2019s musical gifts really uplifted me. And then there\u2019s your invitation to me.\" said by Tucker\n\"Huh? What invitation was that?\" said by Ashley\n\"I seem to recall you inviting me to move from the guest room to your bedroom.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, yeah. That invitation.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yes, yes, yes, that invitation. I, um\u2026\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, I like slowly. But I think we could do better than just skivvies.\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, hello love birds. I hope you enjoyed your walk. I can\u2019t wait to be out there joining you, getting my steps around the neighborhood.\" said by Diane\n\"Don\u2019t get your hopes up. Not with that ankle monitor on. Actually, maybe you should give it a shot and see how quickly they throw you back in jail.\" said by Ashley\n\"Sorry, it\u2019s not going to happen. Besides, what would you and tucker do without jack and me around to set an example of what true love and happiness really looks like?\" said by Diane\n\"Okay. Why don\u2019t we head upstairs and pick up where we left off?\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah. Actually, I could think of a better idea. Look, why don\u2019t we leave the house entirely and get away from this insanity?\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, wait, wait. No, no, no. Don\u2019t\u2013 don\u2019t go so quickly. I was about to go through these bridal magazines. You see, I do have a wedding to plan. And I have to pick out the perfect dress for when I become mrs. Jack abbott. Hey, ashley, maybe you can help me.\" said by Diane\n\"Can you believe it? It\u2019s our first official date night since becoming moms.\" said by Mariah\n\"Thank you for babysitting, sharon. Uh, are you sure you\u2019re up for it?\" said by Tessa\n\"Am I up for it? I think the real question here is, are you? You two seem a little nervous to me.\" said by Sharon\n\"Nervous. No, get out of here. That\u2019s crazy. Um, just so you know, you have plenty of extra bottles in case she wakes up hungry.\" said by Mariah\n\"Oh, yeah, and her bunny is in her carrier. It really helps calm her down when she gets fussy.\" said by Tessa\n\"Oh, and I almost forgot, you made sure that the car seat base is installed properly, right?\" said by Mariah\n\"Relax. In fact, one of G.C.P.D\u2019s finest was in today and I had him take a look at it. Because, um, somehow I knew you would ask.\" said by Sharon\n\"Okay, good. Well, I\u2019m glad chance had a moment to spare.\" said by Mariah\n\"Actually, it wasn\u2019t chance. But I could ask him to come by here and just double-check it if it makes you more comfortable.\" said by Sharon\n\"No, no, it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m sorry. I know we\u2019re being overbearing.\" said by Mariah\n\"It\u2019s our first night away from aria since she\u2019s been born. And you know, all she\u2019s ever known is\u2013 is us and being with us.\" said by Tessa\n\"And we\u2019re not worried about you. I mean, you\u2019re basically the best mom on the planet and you have tons of baby experience. Although, it\u2019s been a minute.\" said by Mariah\n\"Oh, my gosh. Relax, will you? Watching after a baby is like riding a bike. You never forget.\" said by Sharon\n\"I\u2019ve never seen you ride a bike.\" said by Mariah\n\"But you have been through this experience many times. For us, it\u2019s just, uh, I mean, every day suddenly we have to develop this new skill just to catch up with whatever aria has learned that day. I mean, as opposed to who she was last week.\" said by Tessa\n\"I can\u2019t wait for that to taper off. I just feel like she\u2019s learning way too much, way too fast.\" said by Mariah\n\"Really, mariah? Because this is only the beginning. That gets even worse. Your kids continue learning more and more.\" said by Sharon\n\"Okay. How do you keep up?\" said by Mariah\n\"You don\u2019T. You just hold on for dear life and then, one day, they pick up and go to the university of michigan and rarely call you again.\" said by Sharon\n\"Okay, so I\u2019m guessing faith hasn\u2019t called in a couple of days.\" said by Mariah\n\"Maybe we should stay home tonight. I mean, what if we miss something?\" said by Tessa\n\"Yeah. You know, mom, uh, maybe we should just stay with aria. We could go home, we could take a nap, you know, save up that energy for aria\u2019s next big surprise.\" said by Mariah\n\"I mean, you\u2019re right. I mean, what if there\u2019s an emergency, we don\u2019t want to be all tired and worn out\u2013\" said by Tessa\n\"No, I won\u2019t hear of this. Date night is happening. That\u2019s it.\" said by Sharon\n\"We got a new development.\" said by Chance\n\"What happened?\" said by Christine\n\"So, remember the night of the gala, I had a stakeout, right? And I was frustrated as hell because by the time I got to the athletic club, phyllis had already been poisoned, collapsed, taken by the E.M.T.\u2019S. All that.\" said by Chance\n\"Yeah, right. But what\u2019s the new development?\" said by Christine\n\"It turns out the guys I was supposed to be watching couldn\u2019t have been anywhere near that spot that night. Chicago P.D. Had already picked them up. And here\u2019s the kicker. The call that sent me out there in the first place came in the very same day from a phone line at the athletic club. It was one of my cases so I personally had to follow up on it.\" said by Chance\n\"So, what you\u2019re saying is someone wanted you far away from the event that night.\" said by Christine\n\"Nothing. Nothing at all. I don\u2019t even know what we\u2019re looking for anymore.\" said by Kyle\n\"What do you make of this?\" said by Jack\n\"Long red hairs. What does that prove? I\u2019m sure a lot of redheads rent motel rooms.\" said by Kyle\n\"No, that\u2019s true, but it\u2019s something we can work with. This is a dna sample. All we have to do is compare that to a sample from a close relative.\" said by Jack\n\"Summer.\" said by Kyle\n\"Exactly. Can you find something of hers? A hairbrush, a water bottle? Something we can pull dna from.\" said by Jack\n\"That shouldn\u2019t be a problem.\" said by Kyle\n\"Good. Maybe we just caught a break.\" said by Jack\n\"Okay.\" said by Kyle\n\"Diane abbott. Mrs. Diane jenkins abbott. No, I\u2013 I should probably drop the jenkins. I should ask you to be my maid of honor. Wouldn\u2019t you love standing next to me\u2013\" said by Diane\n\"You know what I would love to do\u2026\" said by Ashley\n\"Ah, ah, ah. Here we go.\" said by Tucker\n\"I can\u2019t take any more of you.\" said by Ashley\n\"Bye.\" said by Diane\n\"I can\u2019t stand her. Why did you take me out of there? I just wanna kill her.\" said by Ashley\n\"I know I wanna kill her. Let\u2019s kill her.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, shut up. Mm.\" said by Ashley\n\"Let\u2019s go somewhere and celebrate.\" said by Tucker\n\"What are we celebrating?\" said by Ashley\n\"\u2018Cause we can go somewhere and celebrate together.\" said by Tucker\n\"Okay, let\u2019s go.\" said by Ashley\n\"What\u2019s so funny?\" said by Devon\n\"Well, apparently, um, it\u2019s from one of the dads in dominic\u2019s music group. Tucker was a big hit in the music class today.\" said by Abby\n\"Really? How so?\" said by Devon\n\"Well, the teacher recognized tucker and he played one of his old songs for the kids.\" said by Abby\n\"Gosh.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay. What is up with this package? You\u2019re very concerned with it. What are you waiting for?\" said by Abby\n\"I\u2019m waiting for the courier.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, you\u2019re waiting for your courier. That\u2019s very fancY.\" said by Abby\n\"What do you mean?\" said by Devon\n\"Uh, most people have a delivery guy deliver their package and you have a courier. Ooh.\" said by Abby\n\"Gosh. Really? You\u2019re making fun of me. You\u2019re an abbott and a newman and you own the most popular restaurant in town and you live in a penthouse that looks over the city, so\u2026 you wanna talk who\u2019s fancy? Look in the mirror.\" said by Devon\n\"Not a courier. I\u2019m so fancy.\" said by Abby\n\"This is a very special package. So it requires some professional assistance.\" said by Devon\n\"A special package?\" said by Abby\n\"That\u2019s right.\" said by Devon\n\"Ooh, could it be a gift? Devon, you shouldn\u2019t have. Oh, is it jewelry?\" said by Abby\n\"It is not jewelry. No.\" said by Devon\n\"It\u2019s not jewelry, okay. Is it keys to a brand new car?\" said by Abby\n\"No.\" said by Devon\n\"Ooh, a boat? A boat? Did you buy us a yacht?\" said by Abby\n\"Yes, I did.\" said by Devon\n\"You did?\" said by Abby\n\"How\u2019d you know? They\u2019re gonna deliver it right to the front door.\" said by Devon\n\"I love it. Ooh, or it could be something for dominic. Maybe that big stuffed elephant that we saw last week.\" said by Abby\n\"It\u2019s not that, but that\u2019s a great idea because he would love it.\" said by Devon\n\"He would love it. But I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s enough space in his room for it.\" said by Abby\n\"What are you trying to say? We need a bigger house.\" said by Devon\n\"Hm. Maybe. I mean, I don\u2019t know. Not right now. I mean I love that we have this penthouse overlooking the city. But dominic, well, he might need a yard. You know, he loves the chancellor mansion. He loves the\u2013 the grounds and the pond and\u2013 and all of the things.\" said by Abby\n\"Okay. So, you\u2019re saying we need to get a place like the chancellor mansion?\" said by Devon\n\"I\u2019m just planting a seed because I think that our growing boy needs a lot of room.\" said by Abby\n\"Well, I agree with you. So the seed has been planted. I\u2019ll think about it.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, it\u2019s your courier?\" said by Abby\n\"Oh, it\u2019s my fancy courier.\" said by Devon\n\"It\u2019s your fancy courier.\" said by Abby\n\"Something I\u2019ve been waiting for my whole life is here.\" said by Devon\n\"Thank you.\" said by Devon\n\"I mean it, you two are not changing your plans. You are going on that date night tonight.\" said by Sharon\n\"Okay. But mom\u2013\" said by Mariah\n\"No buts. Look as new moms, it\u2019s important that you learn to take time out for yourselves. It\u2019s gonna make you better parents and it\u2019s the only way you\u2019re gonna stay sane. And aria does deserve sane parents, wouldn\u2019t you say? Besides, it\u2019s way too early for you two to become helicopter moms?\" said by Sharon\n\"Oh, no. Mariah and I would never turn into those overprotecting, overbearing parents. Would we?\" said by Tessa\n\"No, nO. Well, no, way.\" said by Mariah\n\"Okay, you guys get out of here, would you? Go out and have a wonderful time. Aria and I are gonna be just fine. I promise you, you have nothing to worry about. Look, I\u2019ve got it all planned. We\u2019re gonna hang out here for a little while and then it\u2019s back to my place for a girl\u2019s night. Dinner, a bath, and some bedtime stories. We are going to have so much fun, aren\u2019t we, aria? We are going to bond and play and really get to know each other.\" said by Sharon\n\"Oh, well.\" said by Tessa\n\"I guess we\u2019re gonna have to force ourselves to have fun.\" said by Mariah\n\"But please, please call us if you need us.\" said by ", "answer": "Tessa"}

Is there something more drawing hope to thomas?\" said by Steffy\n\"That\u2019s what I\u2019m asking you. Do you think that?\" said by Liam\n\"Like\u2026 what? The collection? Thomas coming up with these new designs?\" said by Steffy\n\"No, not\u2013 not work.\" said by Liam\n\"Okay, so\u2026 douglas? Their role as parents? Douglas is always gonna keep them connected. And you know that. The four of you have been navigating that for a while\u2026 okay, so if it\u2019s not work or parenting, why do you think hope and thomas wanna spend all this time together?\" said by Steffy\n\"Listen, douglas is always gonna tie hope and thomas together. That\u2019s not\u2013 I\u2019ve made peace with that.\" said by Liam\n\"But you\u2019re worried about something else now?\" said by Steffy\n\"That\u2019s what I\u2019m asking. Should I be?\" said by Liam\n\"And I already told you no!\" said by Steffy\n\"I know, I know, but the\u2013 ugh. It\u2019s just the feeling. The feeling is not going away. I mean, I\u2013 look, I admit it. I thought that thomas was gonna be out of the company, right? I thought that he was gonna be out of hope for the future, and turns out that\u2019s not true, and I\u2019m trying to make peace with that too, but I also don\u2019t wanna come off as this overbearing, overprotective, controlling husband.\" said by Liam\n\"Okay, nobody thinks that.

She puts up with how much I care about you. She puts up with our history. She puts up with our family. She puts up with all of that.\" said by Liam\n\"Yeah, but hope and i are past that.

My father has forgiven him, and thomas knows how lucky he is to have it, have this chance, and I promise you, he is not gonna sabotage it. Okay? It\u2019ll be fine. Like I said, I promise, all right? All right, I gotta head out.\" said by Steffy\n\"Okay.\" said by Liam\n\"My father built this company for his kids, and now I wanna share it with you guys. Thomas, can you please just tell him how good it would be to have him on board?\" said by Ridge\n\"Well, honestly, I\u2013 I don\u2019t know if he needs to come on board, or wants to. I mean, I\u2019ve been seeing the stuff you\u2019ve been doing recently. It\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s innovative, and I\u2019m impressed.\" said by Thomas\n\"Thanks, man.\" said by Rj\n\"How is that helping, thomas?\" said by Ridge\n\"You know what, why don\u2019t you just be happy that rj\u2019s home?\" said by Taylor\n\"I am\u2013\" said by Ridge\n\"Okay, look, look. Hey. You\u2019re a forrester, right? You\u2019re rj, ridge jr. If you want a place here at the company, it\u2019s yours. You have birthright here as much as I do.\" said by Thomas\n\"Well said. And very true.\" said by Ridge\n\"Come on, dad. You don\u2019t want all of your kids working here, do you?\" said by Rj\n\"Hey. Just know you\u2019re welcome.\" said by Thomas\n\"I appreciate it.\" said by Rj\n\"Okay. I can understand why your father wants you to work here. I would love to have you here as well. But, we, as your parents, we\u2019re not gonna be pushy. We\u2019re going to allow you to follow your own path.\" said by Brooke\n\"Yeah. What your mom said, absolutely. As long as your own path, maybe it leads you back here into this office, that\u2019s all.\" said by Ridge\n\"[ Laughs ] Oh, god.\" said by Brooke\n\"What? When you dare to transform your hair\" said by Ridge\n\"Sorry! Sorry, sorry, sorry. Hi!\" said by Liam\n\"I was just texting you.\" said by Wyatt\n\"I know, yeah.\" said by Liam\n\"You totally missed the meeting, man.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Okay, I\u2013 it was\u2013\" said by Liam\n\"Oh, unlike this meeting that\u2019s been on the books for weeks now.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Are you okay? Did you handle it?\" said by Liam\n\"Yes, I\u2019m fine.\" said by Wyatt\n\"All right.\" said by Liam\n\"And yes, that\u2019s what I do. Probably better you weren\u2019t here anyway. You\u2019d screw things up. Clients like me better.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Oh my god, yeah, you\u2019re not upset at all.\" said by Liam\n\"I will be if you think you\u2019re gonna get a free lunch out of this.\" said by Wyatt\n\"I mean, I\u2019m a little hungry\u2013\" said by Liam\n\"Nope.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Why?\" said by Liam\n\"\u2018Cause you gotta work a little bit for me to be able\u2013\" said by Wyatt\n\"No. Just\u2013\" said by Liam\n\"No. Expense account\u2013\" said by Wyatt\n\"One\u2013\" said by Liam\n\"No.\" said by Wyatt\n\"One appetizer.\" said by Liam\n\"I\u2019m gonna tell dad.\" said by Wyatt\n\"I\u2019ll eat my spring rolls, you can give me the whole play-by-play of how you, you know, closed the deal and saved the company and yadda-yadda-yadda.\" said by Liam\n\"You know what? I got a better idea.\" said by Wyatt\n\"What?\" said by Liam\n\"How about you tell me where the hell you were? Because I know you, and I know something\u2019s eating at you. So why\u2019d you bail on me?\" said by Wyatt\n\"I was with steffy.\" said by Liam\n\"Okay, so, sorry to interrupt. This is\u2013 this is pretty wonderful, huh?\" said by Taylor\n\"Yeah.\" said by Ridge\n\"It absolutely is, because I can\u2019t believe that rj didn\u2019t tell anyone that he was coming home.\" said by Hope\n\"Okay, well, if your mom had known, she would\u2019ve\u2013 she wouldn\u2019t have been able to keep it to herself. She would\u2019ve been too excited.\" said by Taylor\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s true.\" said by Hope\n\"Hey, thomas? I think we need to have a little talk.\" said by Rj\n\"I think I know what this is about.\" said by Thomas\n\"You up to your old tricks again, thomas?\" said by Rj\n\"Yeah, look, um\u2026 I did some pretty terrible things. I hurt both of our families. But I\u2019m not gonna do anything like that again.\" said by Thomas\n\"So I\u2019ve heard.\" said by Rj\n\"Yeah, look, I\u2013 I was ostracized from the family, from the company and it hurt, really bad, but it caused me to turn inward, you know, look at myself and figure out my issues and I think I did, so I think I am a different person now.\" said by Thomas\n\"Okay. I\u2013 I hope so.\" said by Rj\n\"Hey, we all change, right? Even you.\" said by Thomas\n\"Listen, I\u2013 I\u2019ve been away for a while, thomas, doing my own thing, but that doesn\u2019t mean I was kept out of the loop. I kept up with everything, okay? So, like, I just\u2013 like I told mom and dad, I just\u2013 I don\u2019t wanna get involved in any family drama, okay?\" said by Rj\n\"I don\u2019t wanna start any.\" said by Thomas\n\"I still have to put you on notice. I can\u2019t let you mess around with my mom and dad again, or my big sister.\" said by Rj\n\"Yeah. I respect that.\" said by Thomas\n\"Okay.\" said by Rj\n\"So, we\u2019re good?\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah. Yeah, we\u2019re\u2013 we\u2019re good. I don\u2019t know, I figure if our moms could get along, at least become friends, there\u2019s no reason we can\u2019t be.\" said by Rj\n\"Yeah. You know, I, uh\u2026 I never thought I would see that happening.\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s gonna take some getting used to. Now, I\u2019m not gonna lie, it\u2019s actually one of the reasons I came back. Mom and taylor have been rivals, I think, for my entire life?\" said by Rj\n\"Yeah, I know. I know. Hey, look, um\u2026 we, uh, we haven\u2019t exactly been that close recently, but you know you\u2019re my half-brother and we can change that, right? We can spend more time together and I think we should. Well, hey, I mean, we have the same name, right? But you got stuck with our dad\u2019s name too, and that\u2013 that kinda sucks.\" said by Thomas\n\"[ Laughs ] Yeah. Yeah, it\u2019s definitely\u2013 it\u2019s hard to make a name for yourself when you share yours with someone as legendary as ridge forrester.\" said by Rj\n\"Yeah, no kidding.\" said by Thomas\n\"Wow! Lots of laughing coming from over here.\" said by Brooke\n\"Yeah, what are you guys talking about?\" said by Ridge\n\"Oh, you know, just the trials and tribulations of being forrester men, saddled with the insurmountable legacy of our amazingly talented and well-respected father.\" said by Rj\n\"Well put.\" said by Thomas\n\"How will we ever measure up?\" said by Rj\n\"Dad, charlie\u2019s going on about some huge surprise? What\u2019s\u2013\" said by Steffy\n\"Surprise.\" said by Rj\n\"Rj?\" said by Steffy\n\"You missed the meeting because you were with steffy?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Well, ye\u2013 and traffic was awful, by the way.\" said by Liam\n\"Dude, we have been working on this deal for weeks now. I cleared my whole afternoon.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s not like I wanted to be late, man. I\u2013 I just, time got away from me, I\u2019m sorry.\" said by Liam\n\"Time got away from you.\" said by Wyatt\n\"I texted you and I told you I was running late.\" said by Liam\n\"Oh, must\u2019ve been some kind of emergency, then, with kelly? Better have been.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Kind of.\" said by Liam\n\"Hm.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Kind of a mini-emergency. She left her homework at steffy\u2019s, and then\u2013 and then we started talking, and, uh, yeah. That\u2019s all.\" said by Liam\n\"About?\" said by Wyatt\n\"What do you think? Thomas.\" said by Liam\n\"Great. Our favorite person.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Who\u2019s\u2013 who\u2019s our server today? Is it\u2013\" said by Liam\n\"Mm-mm. Uh-uh. No foodsie \u2019til you explainsie\u2013\" said by Wyatt\n\"Why?\" said by Liam\n\"What\u2019s going on? I thought you and steffy already got into this?\" said by Wyatt\n\"We did. We have. We\u2019ve\u2013 she\u2013 she\u2019s still insisting that I have nothing to worry about.\" said by Liam\n\"Is there any reason why you should be?\" said by Wyatt\n\"I\u2013 I\u2013 I want to believe her. I do.\" said by Liam\n\"Okay. So then you\u2019re gonna stop bugging her? You\u2019re gonna stop flaking on meetings and everything? Is that it?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Oh, my god, wyatt. It\u2019s this one time.\" said by Liam\n\"Yeah, but it\u2019s just not like you! You\u2019re mr. Reliable! Okay, if this is gonna throw you off your game here, then you need to find some way to get past it. We got quarterlies coming up.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Then we want the same thing because I do wanna find a way past it, and that\u2019s why i was talking to steffy. I want\u2013 I want\u2013 I want\u2026 assurance.\" said by Liam\n\"And did you get it? Because I don\u2019t wanna hear that you bailed on me for nothing.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Steffy says that she and thomas and the whole family are in a really good place right now, so\u2026\" said by Liam\n\"Aw. Terrific.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Maybe that means thomas will keep his damn head on straight.\" said by Liam\n\"Fine. I forgive you.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Aw\u2013\" said by Liam\n\"A little bit. A little bit. Because I know steffy and the family have been going through a lot lately, with the sheila thing and ridge going mia and thomas disappearing and reappearing like a magic act.\" said by Wyatt\n\"See? You get it. Forresters need all the good news they can get right now. And I need all the bruschetta I can eat right now. Please? Please? Please.\" said by Liam\n\"Fine.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Yes!\" said by Liam\n\"I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here. Where have you been hiding? Why didn\u2019t anyone tell me that you were here?\" said by Steffy\n\"Well, nobody knew.\" said by Rj\n\"He just showed up.\" said by Brooke\n\"Yeah, I wanted to surprise everybody.\" said by Rj\n\"Well, you succeeded. Look at dad\u2019s face.\" said by Steffy\n\"What about my face?\" said by Ridge\n\"Your face. [ Laughs ] No, it\u2019s lit up. So is brooke\u2019S.\" said by Steffy\n\"I know. We\u2019re so happy.\" said by Brooke\n\"I can tell. Especially dad. You must be so happy to have your son back. No offense, thomas.\" said by Steffy\n\"No taken, stef.\" said by Thomas\n\"[ Chuckles ] And these two are actually getting along.\" said by Taylor\n\"Kinda like you and brooke.\" said by Steffy\n\"Steffy, you\u2019re still a rock star.\" said by Rj\n\"Obviously. See, this is the kind of energy we need around here, okay?\" said by Steffy\n\"Oh, no, please, don\u2019t you also start. He\u2019s\u2013 he\u2019s enough to handle. You\u2019re a whole lot tougher.\" said by Rj\n\"She is pretty tough.\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah.\" said by Steffy\n\"Nothing can keep you down, steffy.\" said by Rj\n\"I could say the same about you, mr. Adventure-seeker. What, you were, like, scaling mountains and jumping off of them? So, what are you doing now? What brings you back to L.A.?\" said by Steffy\n\"Aw, you know, I\u2019ve just got some opportunities, but i really wanna just stick around, spend some time with my family.\" said by Rj\n\"I think that\u2019s an excellent idea.\" said by Steffy\n\"I think it\u2019s a great idea. Yeah.\" said by Brooke\n\"And you know what? We still haven\u2019t figured out what he\u2019s gonna do for a job while he\u2019s here, but that can wait. We don\u2019t have to do that right now, just because I have a request.\" said by Ridge\n\"If he tells you to offer me a job, I already have one.\" said by Rj\n\"Okay, \u201crequest\u201d is not the right word. I\u2013 I have, um\u2026 I have an idea. And this is something that would mean a lot to me, and it\u2019s actually the first time we can do it, because these two ladies finally get along, and I\u2019m totally on board.\" said by Ridge\n\"Okay, what\u2013 what is it? What?\" said by Taylor\n\"Can we just all get together and have a picture of the two mothers and all the kids? Can we do that, please?\" said by Ridge\n\"Oh, a picture? Yeah. We should do that. Let\u2019s do it. Okay, rj, come here!\" said by Brooke\n\"Here, I can take it.\" said by Hope\n\"No! I\u2013 no, you\u2019re gonna be in the picture.\" said by Ridge\n\"Okay, so then are you gonna do it?\" said by Hope\n\"Hang on. Yeah, you need to be in it because you\u2019re not my daughter, but you\u2019re part of my family, have been for a long time, so.\" said by Ridge\n\"Okay. I love that.\" said by Hope\n\"Okay. You. Eat your heart out. This is how you do selfies.\" said by Ridge\n\"Oh, all right, dad.\" said by Rj\n\"Gotta turn it the other way.\" said by Steffy\n\"Come on, show me how it\u2019s done.\" said by Rj\n\"I got it! This, right?\" said by Ridge\n\"Well, you\u2013 yeah.\" said by Taylor\n\"Go like that.\" said by Steffy\n\"There you go.\" said by Rj\n\"Oh, yeah, yeah.\" said by Ridge\n\"Okay, your thumb\u2019s\u2013\" said by Steffy\n\"I can\u2019t even believe\u2013\" said by Ridge\n\"Very nice speech.\" said by Taylor\n\"All right, we\u2019ll start from the beginning. Okay, what do I do?\" said by Ridge\n\"Hit the button.\" said by Steffy\n\"Make sure you get all of our heads.\" said by Taylor\n\"There you go. Big circle.\" said by Rj\n\"Yeah, yeah. I know!\" said by Ridge\n\"You got it.\" said by Brooke\n\"Okay.\" said by Ridge\n\"No, don\u2019t go\u2013\" said by Steffy\n\"Don\u2019t go up.\" said by Taylor\n\"Okay, ready?\" said by Ridge\n\"Okay.\" said by ", "answer": "Brooke"}
{"content": "\"Thank you. Oh, good morning, kyle.\" said by Diane\n\"Son. Thank you for joining us on such tice\" said by Jack\n\"I can\u2019t stay long. I\u2019m pretty busy. Everything with marchetti is on overdrive, especially now that we\u2019re bringing on board the textile mills we acquired from victor.\" said by kyle\n\"I am well aware of the value of bringing manufacturing in house. That\u2019s not what we want to talk about.\" said by Jack\n\"I can tell by the looks on your faces it\u2019s pretty serious.\" said by Kyle\n\"Diane and I are going off the grid for a little while. In fact, we\u2019re on our way out of town right now.\" said by Jack\n\"I know it\u2019s short notice, but I do need to take this time away from work. Maybe you could explain the situation to summer for me? It\u2019s, um, extenuating circumstances.\" said by Diane\n\"Which are what, exactly?\" said by Kyle\n\"We\u2019re leaving to avoid any future psychological torture from jeremy stark.\" said by Diane\n\"[ Scoffs ] Wait. What kind of harm can he do from a prison cell?\" said by Kyle\n\"He is out of jail. They could not make the charges against him stick, so he\u2019s been released.\" said by Jack\n\"And he came right back here to genoa city.\" said by Diane\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Summer\n\"Hello. Excuse me. [ Chuckles ] I\u2019m so glad it\u2019s you who answered the door.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Mom, what are you doing here? I mean, harrison\u2019s at preschool and I\u2019m pretty sure jack doesn\u2019t want anything to do with you and I \u2014\" said by Summer\n\"Okay, listen, you don\u2019t have to remind me that I\u2019m not welcome here. I totally understand. I get it. I came here to turn things around.\" said by Phyllis\n\"I\u2019m not even sure that I want to know how you intend on pulling that off.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, it\u2019s simple. You\u2019re my daughter. I mean, don\u2019t you wish that things could go back to how we used to be? Maybe we could just go somewhere and have some coffee and just talk. Just\u2026talk. You\u2019re the light of my life. Do I need to remind you of that? Alright, well, I\u2019m not gonna take \u201cno\u201d for an answer. I\u2019m not gonna do that. I\u2019m gonna park myself on your sofa, and I\u2019m not moving.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Come in.\" said by Victor\n\"Hi.\" said by Ashley\n\"Ashley. Thank you for coming.\" said by Victor\n\"Sure. Uh, your text was kind of vague. Why did you want to meet with me?\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah. It\u2019s a business matter. Tucker mccall came to us and made a proposal. He suggested that perhaps we would buy his company.\" said by Victor\n\"He was carrying around a serious amount of debt. He was looking to unload mccall, and then suddenly and mysteriously somebody bought up the debt.\" said by Victoria\n\"Fascinating. What does that have to do with me?\" said by Ashley\n\"We were just wondering who might have the financial wherewithal and the desire to make such a deal.\" said by Victor\n\"My mother shared a theory on who that someone might be.\" said by Victoria\n\"Who is it?\" said by Ashley\n\"You.\" said by Victor\n\"Hey.\" said by Tucker\n\"Hello.\" said by Devon\n\"Thank you for coming.\" said by Tucker\n\"Like I said on the phone, you got 30 minutes to say whatever you want to say to me. And try not to lie.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay. Yes, you made your time limit very clear. Eh. And as much as I deserve your fury, I think once you\u2019ve heard what I have to say that ultimately you\u2019ll be glad that you decided to meet with me. So, I\u2019m here with a proposition that could change your life. Want luxury hair repair that doesn\u2019t cost $50?\" said by Tucker\n\"Stark not only beat the charges, but he had the nerve to show his face in genoa city again? When did this happen? How long have you known?\" said by Kyle\n\"We only found out ourselves a couple days ago when we ran into him here, actually. And then yesterday he had a package delivered to the house.\" said by Diane\n\"What kind of package?\" said by Kyle\n\"No, it\u2019s okay. It was \u2014 it was harmless. But he clearly sent it to rattle us and send a message that he was back and that he was planning to mess with me.\" said by Diane\n\"The man is a menace. He\u2019s sending potentially dangerous packages to our home where our family lives? Can\u2019t the police do anything about this?\" said by Kyle\n\"Unfortunately, he is considered an innocent man right now. That won\u2019t last too long \u2019cause we all know he\u2019s anything but innocent. But chance knows he\u2019s back in town, knows he has an agenda, and unfortunately has lost patience with your mother and me.\" said by Jack\n\"Why is that?\" said by Kyle\n\"Stark is convinced that we are the ones that set him up, and chance appears to agree with him.\" said by Jack\n\"What are you saying? The gcpd is just going to ignore that a known criminal is in town sending potentially dangerous packages to our house?\" said by Kyle\n\"I will tell you what chance told us. The police are not going to get involved unless there is an actual threat. The package turned out to be a book, a memento of his time with diane in L.A. The police can hardly arrest him for that, and there isn\u2019t enough evidence that he\u2019s the one that put it there in the first place.\" said by Jack\n\"The man\u2019s presence is a threat.\" said by Kyle\n\"I agree. That is why security has been beefed up and they are on full alert. I assure you the abbott home is safe and secure.\" said by Jack\n\"But jack suggested that we go away in order to not be able to run into him or get caught up in any of his insidious mind games.\" said by Diane\n\"You\u2019re letting him run you out of town again.\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, honestly, i don\u2019t see it like that. And you shouldn\u2019t, either.\" said by Diane\n\"Your mother\u2019s right. We are leaving the house so that stark isn\u2019t tempted to find other ways to come at us.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, and it\u2019s not all doom and gloom. I mean, jack and I are going to use this time for ourselves, to get away from everything and celebrate our reunion.\" said by Diane\n\"Look, a little time away will give us some perspective, and maybe we\u2019ll come up with another way to handle things. But right now the jet awaits and we\u2019ve got to be going. With any luck, stark will get bored and move on while we are having a romantic getaway.\" said by Jack\n\"I appreciate your, um, well-intentioned, albeit, uh, forceful invitation, but, mom, I don\u2019t have time to have coffee. I\u2019ve got to get to the office.\" said by Summer\n\"The office? This is more important than work. Come on. It\u2019s more important than work. You only have one mom. Okay?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Mom, of course I wish things were different.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay, good, good. Okay. That\u2019s enough.\" said by Phyllis\n\"I\u2019m sorry. I just \u2014 I really don\u2019t have the time or the energy to get into it with you right now. And, you know, just so you know, I\u2019ve talked to daniel since the last time we saw each other, and he filled me in on all of the fallout from you butting into his life, too.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh. Wow. So, this is how it\u2019s gonna be? You and daniel against me, talking together, commiserating against me?\" said by Phyllis\n\"I\u2019m not gonna speak for daniel, but I can\u2019t just brush aside my feelings. You interfering with stark \u2014 that could have put us all in serious danger. And you interfering in daniel\u2019s life, both professionally and personally, could have ruined his deal with chancellor-winters and caused irreparable damage in his relationship with heather.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay, got it, got it, got it. I mean, all I\u2019m hearing from you is \u201ccould have, could have, could have.\u201d It didn\u2019t happen. It certainly didn\u2019t happen. Why do you and your brother refuse to see that?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Because it\u2019s not the point! It\u2019s not the point. Mom, this is just another example of how you choose to operate. And it doesn\u2019t matter how many times you promise that you\u2019re gonna make it right or that you\u2019re gonna change. It\u2019s really \u2014 it\u2019s actually \u2014 it\u2019s pointless. And, honestly, I just \u2014 I can\u2019t keep showing up for it.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay, this is completely unfair. Do you know that all a mother wants to do is protect her child? That\u2019s all I want to do. I want to protect you and daniel. I want to protect you from diane. I want to help daniel fix his relationship with heather, who i don\u2019t like, but I want to help him fix it and fix his relationship with his daughter. Wh\u2013 why is that wrong?\" said by Phyllis\n\"That.\" said by Summer\n\"Now, why would you think that I would buy tucker\u2019s debt? And if I did, why do you care either way?\" said by Ashley\n\"After learning that his debt had been acquired, tucker pulled out of a deal to sell mccall to newman.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh. Okay. Well, that answers why you care, but why would you think I would do such a thing?\" said by Ashley\n\"You and tucker have a long history. Maybe your scheme to get information out of him about diane \u2014 maybe it brought back some of those old feelings. Or maybe you got sentimental and you bought his story that he was a changed man.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, come on. Victoria, I\u2019m not some doe-eyed ingenue that\u2019s gonna just fall for tucker\u2019s dumb lines.\" said by Ashley\n\"She is far too smart to believe anything that tucker mccall has to say, right?\" said by Victor\n\"Exactly.\" said by Ashley\n\"And I seriously doubt she harbors any illusions about that man having changed.\" said by Victor\n\"Right. So it\u2019s preposterous to think that I would make some kind of a huge and expensive gesture like that to buy up his debt. So, I guess we\u2019re done here.\" said by Ashley\n\"No, no, no. Please don\u2019t go. Ashley, please don\u2019t go.\" said by Victor\n\"Okay. Well, a life-changing proposition is exactly the kind of manipulation I\u2019m not interested in, so\u2026\" said by Devon\n\"Forgive me. That was a bit hyperbolic.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, you know, saying that you want to improve our relationship and actually doing it are two different things, and I don\u2019t know if you realize that.\" said by Devon\n\"[ Sighs ] I-I got a lot wrong. I made some big mistakes when i came back to town. And not just with you \u2014 with ashley. The two people that I expressly came back in order to impress and reconnect with. I did. I went about it all wrong. And now everything\u2019s come crashing down, and I\u2019ve only got myself to blame for that.\" said by Tucker\n\"That\u2019s one thing we can both agree on.\" said by Devon\n\"[ Chuckles ] Yeah. I tell you, it\u2019s been a relief to just drop the pretense of success and admit that I failed. Dropping this charade has given me energy and it\u2019s given me the time to \u2014 to try to fix what I\u2019ve broken. And not just for you and ashley, but for myself.\" said by Tucker\n\"Right. That all sounds great. I\u2019ve heard you say the exact same thing before with same conviction in your voice. So, I mean, why should I believe you this time?\" said by Devon\n\"Because this time I\u2019m gonna put my money where my mouth is.\" said by Tucker\n\"Really?\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. I\u2019ve decided to divest myself of everything that represents my old way of life. I\u2019m selling mccall unlimited.\" said by Tucker\n\"Hmm.\" said by Devon\n\"I\u2019m gonna wipe the slate clean and start new. And I would like nothing more than for you to take over my company. We\u2019re done\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, this is \u2014 yeah, this is certainly a new angle for you. What would make you think that I\u2019d want to buy your company?\" said by Devon\n\"Okay, I\u2019m gonna be honest with you. It is failing in some areas. Um, but for someone with, um \u2014 with vision and creativity, uh, there\u2019s still value and there\u2019s still the infrastructure to make it quite lucrative, if it\u2019s managed well. And I just know that that person is you.\" said by Tucker\n\"How do you know? How do you know that person is me?\" said by Devon\n\"Well, I built the company from the ground up, and I know you can relate to that. It was born out of my passion for music and the entertainment industry. And, uh [Chuckles] Although you didn\u2019t get much from me, you definitely inherited that. And, um\u2026 well, ultimately, it would just mean the world to me to see you at the helm.\" said by Tucker\n\"It sounds to me like you want me to do you a favor and buy you out of your debt.\" said by Devon\n\"No.\" said by Tucker\n\"No?\" said by Devon\n\"No, someone\u2019s already done it. Yeah.\" said by Tucker\n\"Mm.\" said by Devon\n\"And although I\u2019ve received some very lucrative offers, I would offer you the, uh \u2014 the [Chuckles] Friends and family price \u2019cause I just know you would run the company with integrity, intelligence, and heart.\" said by Tucker\n\"Maybe you made the move as some sort of power play, you know, a revenge tactic.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, that\u2019s an interesting theory. What would be the end game?\" said by Ashley\n\"Tucker would be beholden to whoever owns his debt.\" said by Victor\n\"I see. Well, if that\u2019s your line of thinking, then you should definitely consider devon. He has more motivation than anybody to want to get back at his father.\" said by Ashley\n\"Really?\" said by Victor\n\"Well, of course. When tucker came back to town, he wasn\u2019t just after jabot. He was after chancellor-winters. When devon found out about that, he was furious. I should know. I was there when he confronted his father, not to mention that he has all the capital he needs to make it happen.\" said by Ashley\n\"You know, i considered that angle, too, but it just doesn\u2019t seem like devon\u2019s style. And besides that, I heard he cut all ties with his father. No, whoever bought tucker\u2019s debt enjoys the game enough to keep playing it, which makes you our most likely suspect.\" said by Victoria\n\"Stark. I heard you were back in town. How do you even have the nerve to show your face in genoa city again?\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, you\u2019re not the first one to say that. Why do you find it so hard to believe that I\u2019d want to come back to this charming little town? Great food, beautiful people. Just like your wife, summer, and that adorable little kid of yours.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Hey, stay away from my family. And stop sending my mother tokens of your obsession. Do not make me tell you that again.\" said by Kyle\n\"Ohh. That sounds like a threat.\" said by Jeremy\n\"No, it\u2019s not a threat. It\u2019s a promise. If you have an ax to grind, you grind it with me.\" said by Kyle\n\"Relax. I\u2019ve decided to forgive and forget everything. In fact, I\u2019d like to tell jack and diane that myself. I must have really spooked them the other day when I saw them,\" said by Jeremy\n\"So, you admit it. You sent the gift.\" said by Kyle\n\"You wouldn\u2019t happen to know where jack and diane are, would you?\" said by Jeremy\n\"They left town. Flew out today. Won\u2019t be back anytime soon. So you should just get the hell out of genoa city and don\u2019t look back.\" said by Kyle\n\"What are you talking about? I\u2019ve owned up to plenty. I mean, all I\u2019m doing is taking the blame for everything. I mean, that doesn\u2019t seem to be enough. I\u2019m here apologizing to you. I even admitted that I was the one who lured jeremy stark into town.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yeah, and that you did it to help us. That\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s not an apology, mom.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, that\u2019s completely untrue. I mean, he asked me to find diane, and I refused to do that for him. I basically saved her life. I mean, all I see you doing is making allowances for diane, but you do nothing for me, and i don\u2019t understand that. I\u2019m your mother.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yeah. You\u2019re my mom. You are supposed to do right by me.\" said by Summer\n\"[ Exhales sharply ] Okay, summer, just \u2014 I-I can\u2019T. Seriously. What about daniel? What about daniel? I mean, I\u2019m taking the hit for all of his anger toward heather. I mean, it has nothing to do with me, but, hey, that\u2019s what I do. I\u2019m taking the hit. How come I\u2019m always the one to blame, I\u2019m always the one who\u2019s doing the wrong thing?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Because it was your fault, mom. You did those things. You\u2019re the one that made those bad choices all on your own.\" said by Summer\n\"We\u2019ve all made bad choices, haven\u2019t we, summer?\" said by Phyllis\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Summer\n\"And by the way, are you getting in nikki\u2019s face over this jeremy stark thing? \u2018Cause she was in on it as well. Are you talking to your grandmother like this? I mean, by the way, she flew to los angeles to find dirt on diane jenkins. Yeah. She did that \u2014 on her own dime. But you\u2019re not getting in her face, are you?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Obviously, I don\u2019t approve of what she did, either.\" said by Summer\n\"Mm. Mm. How come she doesn\u2019t get this, too? I know why. Because I fight. I stand up for what I believe, and I will not back down. And that\u2019s how I am. And I will never change. I will never, ever change. I\u2019m tired, summer. I am just so tired. Exhausted. Maybe at this point I\u2019m the one who\u2019s had enough.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Last-minute flight out of town? Sounds like your mother\u2019s trying to relive some of our old adventures.\" said by Jeremy\n\"She wants nothing to do with you.\" said by Kyle\n\"You think I\u2019d lose interest just because jack and diane are out of town?\" said by Jeremy\n\"You should. Because what business do you have in genoa city that necessitates you hanging around indefinitely?\" said by Kyle\n\"Why shouldn\u2019t I stay? I\u2019m in no rush. I have no place to be. That\u2019s what it\u2019s like when you spend years in federal prison. You lose your place in the world and you have to find another place. Well, genoa city could be that perfect spot. Very welcoming, present company excluded. I think I just found the perfect place to call home.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Mm, you should think again because that would be a big mistake.\" said by Kyle\n\"We\u2019ll have to agree to disagree. Vacations don\u2019t last forever. Sooner or later, you\u2019ll end up right back where you started.\" said by Jeremy\n\"I guess we\u2019ve both had just about enough.\" said by Summer\n\"Glad you understand, summer.\" said by Phyllis\n\"But your actions are not helpful. It breaks my heart that you can\u2019t see that.\" said by Summer\n\"[ Clears throat ]\" said by Phyllis\n\"You know [Sighs] I\u2019ve watched you try to evolve my entire life. I was always that kid with the parent who was still trying to grow up themselves. And I was there for all of your failed relationships, with dad and with jack, and you always said that you were gonna grow and that you\u2019d matured. And I always believed you, but inevitably you would go back to your old ways and things would just blow up all over again, just like they are now. And you know what? I should \u2014 [ Sighs ]\" said by Summer\n\"[ Clears throat ]\" said by Phyllis\n\"[ Breathes deeply ]\" said by Phyllis\n\"So, let\u2019s just say that I did buy tucker\u2019s debt. What would you intend to do about it?\" said by Ashley\n\"Newman remains very interested. We\u2019d be willing to make a lucrative deal to buy the company and all of the debt. And not only would we make it worth tucker\u2019s while. We would also make it worth your while. So, if it\u2019s true and you are behind all of this, perhaps we should just negotiate directly with you.\" said by Victoria\n\"I just don\u2019t think that ashley wants to be beholden to tucker mccall for any length of time. I mean, you\u2019ve had your fun with him. You\u2019ve made him sweat, right? Now it\u2019s time to make a deal.\" said by Victor\n\"Wow. This has been fascinating, if for no other reason but to be reminded of how your mind works, victor. You shouldn\u2019t be talking to me. Whatever tucker wants to do with his company is his business. Leave me out of it.\" said by Ashley\n\"Thank you for coming by, ashley.\" said by Victor\n\"So, like, how do you see this all working out? What\u2019s your big vision here? I buy your company and then what? You and I are bonded together for life?\" said by Devon\n\"That bond already exists, doesn\u2019t it? This would just be a bonus.\" said by Tucker\n\"Right, but you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re expecting me to welcome you back into my life with open arms, right?\" said by Devon\n\"Devon, I don\u2019t have any expectations. None. I just wanted to offer you this safety net.\" said by Tucker\n\"Why do I need a safety net?\" said by Devon\n\"I happen to know that you\u2019re in a very precarious business situation at the moment, um, the fight you\u2019re having with your sister and jill over hamilton-winters. Who knows how that\u2019s gonna go down?\" said by Tucker\n\"I know how it\u2019s gonna down, and it\u2019s none of your business, really.\" said by Devon\n\"That\u2019s true. It isn\u2019T. But I took a look at the available analytics, and legally the chancellor-winters merger \u2014 it\u2019s rock-solid. So, uh, you winning back hamilton-winters at this point \u2014 it\u2019s a long shot. The odds are it\u2019s not gonna work out in your favor.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, I don\u2019t need to hear your odds. So, thanks.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay, but wouldn\u2019t you like to have a powerhouse like mccall in your back pocket in case it does go sideways? It gives you something else to turn your attention to.\" said by Tucker\n\"I\u2019m not thinking like that. And it sounds like you\u2019re betting on me to lose.\" said by Devon\n\"No, no, no. On the contrary. I\u2019m offering you a strategy that will ensure you come out on top. I mean, let\u2019s say you do win hamilton-winters back and you\u2019re helming my company. You\u2019re gonna be at the helm of a company that will just leapfrog chancellor-winters and newman.\" said by ", "answer": "Tucker"}
{"content": "\"My sister meant well. But traci, she\u2019s so sweet. She just wants jack and I to lay down our swords. But from what I can tell, it\u2019s not working. Not even a little bit.\" said by Ashley\n\"So, it had no impact on you at all? Doesn\u2019t expending all this energy on hatred just wear you out?\" said by Tucker\n\"What is wrong with everybody? Why can\u2019t you see that what I\u2019m doing isn\u2019t because of my hatred for diane? It\u2019s because of love for my family and my brother. I don\u2019t get it.\" said by Ashley\n\"Hey, I got your text. Came as soon as I could. What\u2019s up?\" said by Jack\n\"Well, thanks for rushing over, but I\u2019m afraid it might be too late.\" said by Diane\n\"Why? What happened?\" said by Jack\n\"Well, I tried to bridge the gap between kyle and summer, but the whole thing might have backfired. It just went horribly wrong and now I\u2013 I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve made things even worse.\" said by Diane\n\"Kyle. Kyle! Can you please stop? Wait a second. Look, it\u2019s fine if you\u2019re pissed off and you want to storm out of society and it\u2019s fine if you hate me right now, but please, can you just stop with this evasion and silent treatment and talk to me?\" said by Summer\n\"I don\u2019t want to discuss this right now.\" said by Kyle\n\"Okay, then when? When are you gonna want to discuss this? Because if you\u2019re\u2013 you\u2019re really that angry that you\u2013 you don\u2019t feel like you can move past this at all, then you need to step up and say so.\" said by Summer\n\"Yep.\" said by Abby\n\"You sure?\" said by Devon\n\"Yep. Got it.\" said by Abby\n\"Hey.\" said by Chance\n\"Oh.\" said by Abby\n\"I\u2019m sorry to do this to you. I, uh, I know I\u2019m supposed to have him for a few more days, but I just got called into a new case. Louise has the flu, so\u2026 all that\u2019s kind of blown up my plan.\" said by Chance\n\"Um. Yeah. Yeah, no problem.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah?\" said by Chance\n\"Yeah.\" said by Abby\n\"Thank you.\" said by Chance\n\"We always love having dominic at home.\" said by Abby\n\"Uh, yeah. Look, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m kind of in a hurry, but there is something I\u2019d like to talk to you about while I\u2019m here. Uh, it\u2019s about dominic and this whole situation. It\u2019s just not really working out. Choosing a treatment for your chronic migraine \u2013\" said by Chance\n\"Additional sponsorship provided by\u2026\" said by Announcer\n\"Well, our boy knocked right out, so he must have had quite the day.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah, never had a dull moment with him. That\u2019s actually what I\u2019d like to talk to you about.\" said by Chance\n\"Is something wrong with him?\" said by Devon\n\"No, no, everything\u2019s fine. I just noticed that instead of enjoying the fact that he has two different places to live, I think it stresses him out. Every time we switch, he gets real fussy and uh, it\u2019s kind of a struggle to calm him down. I won\u2019t lie.\" said by Chance\n\"Oh, I\u2013 I didn\u2019t realize.\" said by Abby\n\"Well, don\u2019t get me wrong. It\u2019s just when he first gets to my place. Once he has settled in and we\u2019re having a good time, we got to pack his stuff up and come back here. So as much as we justify it to ourselves, I think the back and forth seems to be confusing him.\" said by Chance\n\"So, what are you suggesting? That we change our custody agreement?\" said by Abby\n\"You have convinced yourself that you are saving jack from himself.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m trying to do. I know that diane is a present danger, clear and present danger to our family\u2019s company and the fact that jack doesn\u2019t see that\u2013\" said by Ashley\n\"Jack is a grown man! He doesn\u2019t need protecting from anyone, by anyone. Least of all you.\" said by Tucker\n\"That\u2019s kind of harsh, don\u2019t you think? I mean a little\u2013\" said by Ashley\n\"When did you become your brother\u2019s keeper? If he wants to throw his life away with diane, that\u2019s his problem. But if it causes chaos at jabot, so be it. That\u2019s just how it goes.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, yeah, sure. Who cares, right? But it\u2019s really easy for you to say that. It\u2019s not your family. It\u2019s not your father who built that company, tucker.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah, but your father\u2019s company is now a yoke around your neck. You know, you\u2019re just\u2013 I think you\u2019re bigger and better than all of this pettiness. And it occurs to me that you have earned the right to call your own shots now. To build your own legacy.\" said by Tucker\n\"With you?\" said by Ashley\n\"Yes. You\u2019re damn right. Yes with me.\" said by Tucker\n\"Okay.\" said by Ashley\n\"So what\u2019s it gonna take to pull you across the finish line here, to\u2026 help you let go of this misguided need to protect jack and jabot.\" said by Tucker\n\"Our mother left us when we were just little kids. We\u2019ve been protecting each other ever since.\" said by Ashley\n\"I understand, but it\u2019s gone too far now. And it might be too late to save him anyway. I think what you need to concentrate on is purging yourself of this hatred for diane. And if you can do that, your whole world will be magnificent again.\" said by Tucker\n\"How exactly did you make things worse for summer and kyle? What did you do?\" said by Jack\n\"Well, summer and I came here after leaving the family meeting earlier. She wanted my help convincing kyle to forgive her. And well, she made it very clear that if I did help her, it would go a long way towards me making amends for my part in things, which\u2013 which is important to me. And then kyle showed up\u2026\" said by Diane\n\"Excuse me, summer, but would you mind if I speak to my mother in private?\" said by Kyle\n\"Uh, kyle, we can do that, but I think that maybe you should sit down and we should speak as a family first. You know, there are some things I need to tell you and, um, I\u2019d like for summer to be part of that conversation as well.\" said by Diane\n\"Look, mom, if this is about the problems between me and summer, I\u2019d prefer you didn\u2019t get involved.\" said by Kyle\n\"It\u2013 it is, but not in the way that you think.\" said by Diane\n\"Okay, in what way then?\" said by Kyle\n\"Did you know that harrison has been crying himself to sleep the last three nights?\" said by Diane\n\"What? How could that be? I\u2019ve read to him until he\u2019s fallen asleep every night.\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, he wakes up about half an hour later and comes and finds his didi with tears in his eyes.\" said by Diane\n\"Tears, why?\" said by Summer\n\"What\u2019s he so upset about? Why didn\u2019t he come to me?\" said by Kyle\n\"He wouldn\u2019t tell me what was going on at first, but then he finally asked what he was doing to make his mommy and daddy so upset.\" said by Diane\n\"Why didn\u2019t you tell us that he was crying at night?\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah, you should\u2019ve come to us with this right away.\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, I was afraid that you would think that I was interfering in your relationship. And plus I\u2013 I figured that the two of you would work things out soon, but it has been three nights in a row.\" said by Diane\n\"Wow. That is a lot for that kid to be carrying around.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, yeah.\" said by Diane\n\"I hate that he blames himself for the chaos and upset that\u2019s going on in our home. This is a lot for you to carry around. I mean, why didn\u2019t you tell me?\" said by Jack\n\"Well, I\u2013 I\u2013 I didn\u2019t tell you because it isn\u2019t true. I told a little white lie trying to push kyle past his anger toward summer since she betrayed him. I was hoping that it would focus them both on what\u2019s really important to them. Their family, their little boy.\" said by Diane\n\"It wasn\u2019t true. Seriously?\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, no. It just kind of came to me and I went with it.\" said by Diane\n\"You lied to kyle. Again.\" said by Jack\n\"I am suggesting that we change the custody agreement slightly. Look, we all know that dominic loves the mansion. It was his first place that he lived. I would like for you to consider moving into the chancellor house. Devon, I\u2019m sure your grandmother would love it. Abby, you could come back home and dominic could have all the space he could ever ask for to run, play and grow. I\u2019m gonna take an apartment closer to the police station. I don\u2019t need that big thing, okay? I don\u2019t need to be rattling around all by myself in that big old mansion. I would much rather dominic have it. That way I can come visit whenever. And the chancellor home, you know, the first place that he lived, will be his permanent home.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, okay. Well, this is, uh, it\u2019s not what I expected.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. Well, look, I, uh, I do have to run. I apologize. So, I\u2019ll let you guys talk it over, but just know I still want to share custody. I still want to see him as much as I can, okay? Nothing\u2019s changed and I understand this is a big move, so if you\u2019re not up for it, I totally get it. I just wanted to put it out there for dominic\u2019s sake. Talk to you soon.\" said by Chance\n\"Thanks.\" said by Devon\n\"Wow. Um, I was not expecting that at all, but I know chance is coming from a good place. But I mean, this is a huge decision for both of us. Is this even something that you would consider?\" said by Abby\n\"You\u2019re not wrong. It\u2019s exhausting, having all this hatred towards diane, but I can\u2019t just turn it on and off like a light switch, you know, not when she\u2019s such a threat.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah. I\u2019m sorry to tell you, but you\u2019re not the only one who\u2019s finding it exhausting. Diane seems to be occupying more space in your head than anyone else in your life right now. Wherever we go, diane seems to be with us. We might as well always ask for a table for three. We can\u2019t have a conversation without it eventually steering back to diane. Diane this, diane that. Jack, jabot, jabot, jack, enough already.\" said by Tucker\n\"I apologize.\" said by Ashley\n\"Enough of jabot.\" said by Tucker\n\"I am so deeply sorry. It can\u2019t always be about you. And maybe you\u2019re missing the point here. I can\u2019t just walk away from this company, tucker. It\u2019s in my dna. It always will be a part of me.\" said by Ashley\n\"So, you\u2019re always going to be miserable. You\u2019re always going to be consumed by hatred and paranoia? All right, think about this. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re right. Let\u2019s say your prediction about diane\u2019s right and she brings jabot crashing down. You know what we do? We swoop in, we scoop it up, we fold it into our own company, which would make us stronger than ever. And you could rein over everything you see. Yeah?\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, I don\u2019t want jack and traci and billy to think that I want to stab them in the back and destroy the family company. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing this for, you know that. I want to protect the company. I want to protect my father\u2019s legacy. That\u2019s what I mean when I say I\u2019m doing this out of love and not hatred. Don\u2019t you hear what I\u2019m saying?\" said by Ashley\n\"Right, then let diane crash and burn on her own. That\u2019s the best way to prove to jack what a threat she is anyway.\" said by Tucker\n\"I\u2019m not going to try to defend what I did other than to say my heart was in the right place. It was an innocent white lie. And you know what? Part of me is afraid that harrison might have picked up on the tension between his parents.\" said by Diane\n\"But you don\u2019t know that. I mean, he hasn\u2019t said that to you, has he?\" said by Jack\n\"No, no, I guess not. And I\u2013 I guess I took it too far. I just\u2013 I just wanted to rattle kyle into realizing what his anger towards summer could be costing his son.\" said by Diane\n\"I had no idea this was impacting my son like this. I\u2019ve had talks with him explaining that sometimes adults have arguments and it takes a little time for them to work through their problems, but I made it as clear as I possibly could that didn\u2019t mean we love him any less.\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, clearly it wasn\u2019t enough. He\u2019s\u2013 he\u2019s suffering.\" said by Diane\n\"Kyle, this is even more of a reason for us to start trying to work things out between us. Harrison has been through so much in his life already. We owe him a sense of security now. Don\u2019t you agree with that?\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, are you sure you didn\u2019t already know about harrison\u2019s apparent upset?\" said by Kyle\n\"No. How\u2013 how could I? I\u2019ve been sleeping in the pool house. I go in and I say good night to him when you\u2019re not around and then I go away.\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m still finding it odd that I\u2019m only hearing about this now. Harrison has shown no signs of being upset or worried. He\u2019s been the same happy-go-lucky guy. But if this is true, I am very concerned about my son and I will do everything I can to calm him down.\" said by Kyle\n\"What do you mean? If this is true?\" said by Diane\n\"Well, I\u2019m just having a hard time understanding that he could have such a strong reaction that I wouldn\u2019t have seen or sensed it. At least not to the level that kept him up at night. Something feels off here.\" said by Kyle\n\"And then the whole thing just spiraled from there. And I\u2013 I had to admit that I might have exaggerated the situation.\" said by Diane\n\"I can imagine how that went down.\" said by Jack\n\"I was just hoping that kyle could realize that he needs to find a way to forgive his wife.\" said by Diane\n\"You do realize what you\u2019ve done?\" said by Jack\n\"Yes, I know. And I know that it was a bit desperate. And I\u2013 and I know that I shouldn\u2019t have used our grandson that way, but it wasn\u2019t a total fabrication. I do think that harrison has picked up on the tension between his parents. He knows that there\u2019s something going on.\" said by Diane\n\"But you tried to convince kyle it was a lot worse than that.\" said by Jack\n\"Yes, I know. And then after I confessed to him, he stormed out. But summer was right behind him.\" said by Diane\n\"Honestly, I don\u2019t know what I want. All I know is that this is hell for me.\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, this is hell for me too. I believe what diane was saying earlier, that harrison is picking up on what\u2019s going on. He knows that there\u2019s a conflict between us and the question is how are we gonna fix it?\" said by Summer\n\"I don\u2019t know. Maybe what we need to do is take some time apart. Really apart while we try to figure this out.\" said by Kyle\n\"What does that mean? Like a formal separation? (Wheezing)\" said by Summer\n\"Kyle, you can\u2019t really mean that.\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m sorry. I\u2013 I can\u2019t get beyond this betrayal. You kept this a secret from me for weeks. You lied repeatedly to my face and all I wanted to do was comfort you. I thought something was wrong with me, that I couldn\u2019t do what you needed to help you feel better. How could you have been so cruel to me?\" said by Kyle\n\"I know that I handled it badly. I know that I did. But kyle, I was caught between protecting my mom and\u2013\" said by Summer\n\"Destroying mine? Still, you could have come to me. Told me everything and we could have found a way to deal with it together, but instead, you opted to betray my trust and freeze me out.\" said by Kyle\n\"Kind of like what you did when you worked with my grandpa behind my back. You know, I felt betrayed then too.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, no, no, no, this is completely different and you know, it. That wasn\u2019t life or death, incarceration or freedom. You took my love and my sympathy and you threw it back in my face. You broke my heart. And the worst part is you didn\u2019t trust me to help you through the trauma you were going through. The fact is you betrayed every bit of confidence I have in you. In us.\" said by Kyle\n\"But we can get through this. I know that we can. I love you. And you love me\u2026 don\u2019t you?\" said by Summer\n\"You chose your mother over me. You were willing to let my mom suffer and maybe spend the rest of her life behind bars.\" said by Kyle\n\"I would have never let it get that far. I promise you that.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, we\u2019ll never know for sure now, will we? No, I get the sense that this meeting at society was a clever little setup. Did you recruit my mother to help us bridge the gap? Was that stunt using harrison something the two of you cooked up?\" said by Kyle\n\"I didn\u2019t know what she was gonna do. But yes, I did tell diane that it would go a long way with me if she could help convince you to forgive me.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah. I thought so.\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, I was desperate. You weren\u2019t talking to me. I have never seen you that angry and I was\u2013 I was afraid for our marriage.\" said by Summer\n\"And where did that lead, summer? Look at where we are now. You have made one bad choice after another. I\u2026 I think we need some time to process everything that\u2019s happened. See what\u2019s left. If anything.\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, no, that\u2019s too extreme. Do we really have to go that far? If we love each other, if you have ever loved me, then we should be able to work this out.\" said by Summer\n\"I can\u2019T. Not right now. I need time to think through things.\" said by Kyle\n\"What does that mean? You want me to move out of the house completely?\" said by Summer\n\"Look, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m not gonna lie. It upsets me that you used harrison to force kyle\u2019s hand and I\u2019m not surprised that this blew up in your face.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m sorry. And I can see why you\u2019re upset with me, but what am I supposed to do? I swear I was only trying to do something good, something to try to get them back together, and I\u2013 I feel like I need to try because I am partially to blame for their problems.\" said by Diane\n\"Wait, what are you saying? You are not to blame for what summer did.\" said by Jack\n\"No, but my feud with phyllis is at the center of this whole thing. Jeremy stark came back to town because of me and then he took advantage of phyllis\u2019s intense hatred towards me.\" said by Diane\n\"You are no part of that scheme and summer went off the rails emotionally.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, yes, she did. But I\u2013 I think she was just grasping at any hope when she learned that her mother was alive. She had to do whatever she could to protect her, to\u2013 to try to clean up that mess and bring her back home safely.\" said by Diane\n\"That was your argument. Not using harrison.\" said by ", "answer": "Jack"}
{"content": "\"Hi. Beat me here. I hope you didn\u2019t wait too long.\" said by Lauren\n\"Not at all. How are you?\" said by Christine\n\"I am numb. I\u2019m\u2013 uh, all cried out. For now, anyway.\" said by Lauren\n\"So many people are in so much pain.\" said by Christine\n\"I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s gone. I mean, this never should have happened.\" said by Lauren\n\"I absolutely agree.\" said by Christine\n\"Hi, it\u2019s chance. We got the tox screen back from phyllis\u2019 blood sample.\" said by Chance\n\"And can I assume the results, based on the fact that you\u2019re calling me at all?\" said by Christine\n\"Fatal levels of alkaloids in her blood stream, possibly from strychnine.\" said by Chance\n\"Poison?\" said by Christine\n\"Yeah. Christine, this is officially a homicide investigation.\" said by Chance\n\"Okay. Make me a case. I\u2019ll take it from there.\" said by Christine\n\"Yeah, I\u2019ll be in touch.\" said by Chance\n\"Look at this. Michael took this picture of phyllis and me after a girl\u2019s spa day. We had some bubbly and\u2026\" said by Lauren\n\"Summer. Hey.\" said by Chance\n\"I need your help.\" said by Summer\n\"All right. What can I do for you?\" said by Chance\n\"You and I are gonna expose my mom\u2019s murderer.\" said by Summer\n\"No, we don\u2019t have to hold back anymore. I\u2019m no longer saving my pennies from mccall unlimited. So if there is some sort of passion project that you want to pursue, or\u2013 or maybe some high-end acquisition, then I\u2019d like to hear about it. Great. Yes. Put together a presentation and we can bring in finance and marketing and we\u2019ll get a meeting on the books. All right.\" said by Victoria\n\"Good afternoon.\" said by Nick\n\"Hey. What are you doing here? I thought you\u2019d be spending the day with summer.\" said by Victoria\n\"I mean, that was my plan but every time I try and talk to her or offer to help with the service, she just tells me to back off and says she\u2019s got it handled.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, imagine that. The daughter of two unstoppable powerhouses, and\u2026 the granddaughter of an unmovable force wanting to take on the world herself.\" said by Victoria\n\"What do you think I should do?\" said by Nick\n\"Maybe don\u2019t hover so much. Just give her a little space and make sure that you keep an eye on her, though, in case she\u2019s taking on too much.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah. She could also just be going all in as like a coping mechanism.\" said by Nick\n\"Which is why you\u2019re also at work today, I assume.\" said by Victoria\n\"That\u2019s part of it.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, you know that your boss is not going to fire you for taking bereavement leave.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, you can\u2019t fall behind, vic, with all of your grand plans and your corporate shopping sprees.\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2019m planning on putting some of my purchases on hold for a while.\" said by Victoria\n\"Really? You waiting for a bigger fish to come along?\" said by Nick\n\"No. No, I\u2019m waiting for a whale.\" said by Victoria\n\"Something bigger than the deal you just passed on?\" said by Nick\n\"Gargantuan. There are far more lucrative fish in the sea than mccall unlimited.\" said by Victoria\n\"Hey.\" said by Devon\n\"Hey.\" said by Tucker\n\"Come on in.\" said by Devon\n\"Thanks. I wasn\u2019t sure if you were gonna be up for company after what happened last night.\" said by Tucker\n\"I still can\u2019t believe that that happened at all.\" said by Devon\n\"I know.\" said by Tucker\n\"It is\u2013 phyllis was one of a kind.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. Just a reminder to live life to the fullest, huh?\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah.\" said by Devon\n\"Cherish the people around you\u2026 and don\u2019t take the time you have left for granted, right?\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah, I agree with every word of that. Is that why you came over here?\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. If we\u2019re gonna build a better relationship, we gotta start somewhere.\" said by Tucker\n\"Baby steps.\" said by Devon\n\"Right.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah. Want a drink?\" said by Devon\n\"What\u2019s this?\" said by Tucker\n\"It\u2019s apple juice.\" said by Devon\n\"I see.\" said by Tucker\n\"It\u2019s dominic\u2019s favorite.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay. Is it a good vintage?\" said by Tucker\n\"I think so. Check the year.\" said by Devon\n\"No, that\u2019s right. Uh\u2026 family is all about give and take and I have something of relative value that I would like to pass on to you. You, um\u2013\" said by Tucker\n\"You\u2019re talking about wanting me to buy your company as a backup plan in case the lawsuit goes bad, right?\" said by Devon\n\"It\u2019s the perfect solution.\" said by Tucker\n\"Right. Uh. So, you need to know that lily and I had a conversation at the gala, after they had the dedication to neil.\" said by Devon\n\"That was a beautiful gesture, by the way.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah, it really was. And it made me stop and realize just how important family is. And for me that\u2019s lily. So, she and i talked things through and that is why I will not be buying mccall.\" said by Devon\n\"[ Sighs ] Given that bit of news, you wouldn\u2019t happen to have anything stronger than apple juice, would you?\" said by Tucker\n\"Listen. I know it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s not what you want to hear but it is what it is.\" said by Devon\n\"What is it, exactly? I\u2019m trying to understand your thought process in this.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah, I\u2019m gonna be going back to work at chancellor winters, so I\u2019m not gonna need to buy mccall unlimited.\" said by Devon\n\"It is\u2013 it\u2019s terrific news about you and lily mending fences. I\u2013 I mean that and, um, I\u2019m happy for you.\" said by Tucker\n\"Thank you.\" said by Devon\n\"Um. But\u2026 do you really think there\u2019ll be any lasting peace between you with the company going public?\" said by Tucker\n\"It\u2019s not gonna be an issue anymore.\" said by Devon\n\"Since when?\" said by Tucker\n\"Since jill decided to keep chancellor winters a private company.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh. Well, congratulations all around then.\" said by Tucker\n\"Thank you.\" said by Devon\n\"Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but\u2026 that wouldn\u2019t preclude you from acquiring mccall on your own, would it? Having a little something on the side.\" said by Tucker\n\"I don\u2019t\u2013 I don\u2019t want to have anything on the side or any easy way out. This is my family company.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. Leaves me on the horns of a dilemma, however. What to do with mccall?\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, actually jill said that she would buy your company if you weren\u2019t included in the deal.\" said by Devon\n\"Summer, you have more than enough on your plate right now.\" said by Chance\n\"Look, just hear me out. I know that it might sound crazy, but I am convinced that my mom\u2019s death was not an accident and I\u2019m not gonna give up until I know the whole truth.\" said by Summer\n\"We are investigating every possibility.\" said by Chance\n\"What if stark married her for her money and then he killed her to get it?\" said by Summer\n\"That\u2019s the theory that your working with?\" said by Chance\n\"Well, diane has got to be involved. This feud has been going on for decades. She left town in disgrace. She had years to plot her revenge. She threatened my mom\u2019s life the very same night that she died.\" said by Summer\n\"And you don\u2019t think that could have been a coincidence?\" said by Chance\n\"Don\u2019t you owe it to us to find out for sure?\" said by Summer\n\"That is what I plan to do, summer.\" said by Chance\n\"I know how to find out the truth.\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, I can\u2019t let you get involved in a police investigation. Okay? Not only could you compromise the case but if anything would happen to you\u2013\" said by Chance\n\"Just come to my mom\u2019s memorial service. That could be part of a murder investigation, right? Come, see who shows up, study their demeanor.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah, that is something that we are interested in doing.\" said by Chance\n\"Everyone who cared about my mom is gonna be there and people who wanted her dead. It\u2019s guaranteed to be emotional. Tears, sadness, disbelief, and you\u2019re gonna be there to see it all. Okay? Watch the mourners\u2019 reactions. Study their behavior. Watch diane.\" said by Summer\n\"Summer\u2013\" said by Chance\n\"No. No one was closer to my mom than I was and she tried to warn me. She tried to warn all of us and we just\u2013 we ignored her. We refused to believe her. She must have felt so alone and I know how that feels right now. Look, you don\u2019t have to believe me. Just be there. Watch diane. Find the evidence and make her pay.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay. Listen. There\u2019s something you should know.\" said by Chance\n\"The gala wasn\u2019t supposed to end that way. Phyllis\u2019s life was not supposed to end in that moment. She had so much more life to live\u2026 with her kids, her\u2013 her grandkids and her new career path. I mean, she was always reinventing herself, from\u2026 the computers and the cosmetics and the magazine and the hotel. And I always held out hope that she would find\u2026 her true love. And then years down the line, we would be sitting in\u2013 in our caftans, poolside, drinking martinis and laughing. And talking about the extraordinary life that we had lived.\" said by Lauren\n\"It\u2019s, uh, heartbreaking\u2026 to lose someone. Yeah, you\u2013 you lose their laugh, their support\u2026\" said by Christine\n\"I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re talking about phyllis anymore.\" said by Lauren\n\"Uh, maybe not.\" said by Christine\n\"Oh, honey. Are you ready to talk about what happened with paul? I\u2013 I mean, unless you think I\u2019m overstepping.\" said by Lauren\n\"Can friends really overstep at this point in our lives? I mean, we\u2013 we know each other so well and I know\u2026 that you\u2019re hurting over phyllis.\" said by Christine\n\"But you\u2019re hurting too. So, talk to me.\" said by Lauren\n\"Paul and I had something really special, for a really long time. But now, that\u2013 that time has come\u2026\" said by Christine\n\"Hey, baby.\" said by Victor\n\"Poor lauren. She\u2019s really broken up about phyllis. A lot of people are.\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh, I don\u2019t know.\" said by Victor\n\"Oh, victor. What were you expecting from victoria?\" said by Nikki\n\"Loyalty, sweetheart. Loyalty. It\u2019s as if she enjoys going up against me.\" said by Victor\n\"That is not true.\" said by Niki\n\"Yes, it is.\" said by Victor\n\"She was merely making a sound business decision. You can\u2019t take that personally.\" said by Nikki\n\"Let me explain something to you. She refuses to buy mccall unlimited. Not because it\u2019s good business, simply because she doesn\u2019t want adam to be at the helm of it.\" said by Victor\n\"I can see how upset you are about this. But I love how you\u2019re allowing victoria to run newman enterprises without your assistance.\" said by Nikki\n\"Well, I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m mad that the mccall deal isn\u2019t moving forward.\" said by Nick\n\"You were never a big fan of the idea.\" said by Victoria\n\"No. But last time I talked to you, you were ready to go all in. What changed?\" said by Nick\n\"Well, many factors played into my decision. Too many competing interests, too much interaction with tucker. It was just gonna be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. That\u2019s all.\" said by Victoria\n\"Huh. You know, it\u2019s a shame that nobody mentioned that much earlier in the process that those were the potential hazards or that you would be better off putting all of your energy and passion into a much more lucrative project.\" said by Nick\n\"No, no, no, no. Let\u2019s\u2013 let\u2019s not rush this. Let\u2019s enjoy this moment. It feels great. So, how did dad take the news that you\u2019re not buying this company for adam to run on his own? Is he on board with this?\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, no, quite the opposite. And he\u2019s making his disapproval terribly clear.\" said by Victoria\n\"I do not like that smile.\" said by Nick\n\"Nothing. I was just thinking about how I told dad that if he really wants to give adam a shiny new toy that he can break, well, he can buy him mccall unlimited with his own money. But I am keeping newman very, very far away from that disaster.\" said by Victoria\n\"Now, the deal was devon\u2026 to sell to you. Not jill. Not lily. You.\" said by Tucker\n\"And why does that matter to you?\" said by Devon\n\"Because I want it to be a family company. I\u2013 you\u2019re my son. And I know that you don\u2019t have much\u2026 loyalty to me, but\u2026 I want to be a part of your life. I wanna be a part of my grandson\u2019s life and future.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, listen, man. I\u2019m sure that you and I can figure out something. It\u2019s just when it comes to doing business together\u2013\" said by Devon\n\"The thing is that\u2013 that\u2026 that I think you need mccall as much as it needs you, because, now, you can like it or not, you and I are cut from the same cloth.\" said by Tucker\n\"I don\u2019t\u2013\" said by Devon\n\"Yes. Yes. No, you are a lone wolf like me. You work best when you\u2019re the one calling the shots, because you\u2013 you go with your gut and you follow your instincts. Which were spot on, by the way, when they told you to pull out of that chancellor merger. Right?\" said by Tucker\n\"Right. My instincts are telling me right now that I need to get to my next meeting.\" said by Devon\n\"Wait. Wait. Hold on. No, no, sit down. I wanna talk to you more about it.\" said by Tucker\n\"I have nothing left to say to you. Okay? I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m not gonna buy your company. I appreciate you offering it to me. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re gonna figure out what to do with it. And as far as having a relationship with me and your grandson, just keep showing me that you\u2019ve actually changed.\" said by Devon\n\"I have changed.\" said by Tucker\n\"All right. Like I said, there\u2019s somewhere I need to be.\" said by Devon\n\"I\u2019m gonna share some information with you. But I want you to promise to leave the detective work to me. I can\u2019t have you snooping around, jeopardizing this case. You\u2019re not nancy drew. So, leave it alone fine.\" said by Chance\n\"Fine.\" said by Summer\n\"Now, take a breath. Prepare yourself. This is gonna be tough.\" said by Chance\n\"Just say it.\" said by Summer\n\"We ran a toxicology test on your mother\u2019s blood and we found a lethal amount of poison. Now that is all the details that I have right now. But what I can tell you\u2013\" said by Chance\n\"So, it\u2019s true.\" said by Summer\n\"The me says that the symptoms do line up with a severe case of poison.\" said by Chance\n\"It was diane.\" said by Summer\n\"We don\u2019t know that.\" said by Chance\n\"Come on. They were up in that suite alone before they started fighting. It would have been the perfect opportunity for diane to poison my mom. Do they know her cause of death? Was it the accident, or\u2013\" said by Summer\n\"The amount of toxins found in her blood was at a lethal level. So that is the probable cause of death.\" said by Chance\n\"I just found out that my mom was poisoned and you want me to keep it a secret?\" said by Summer\n\"If the truth gets out before I build a case, it could hinder our ability to get a conviction. That\u2019s it.\" said by Chance\n\"How long?\" said by Summer\n\"Until I get more answers.\" said by Chance\n\"Oh, my god. Everybody has been trying to tell me that it was just a medical issue and then the accident. But I knew\u2013 I knew that that was wrong.\" said by Summer\n\"Can I count on you to keep this between us?\" said by Chance\n\"Can I count on you to be at the memorial service?\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, it\u2019s your mother\u2019s celebration of life. Do you really want to make that a part of the investigation?\" said by Chance\n\"Are you kidding me? She would love it. All the drama, the excitement. Besides, you already know all the players in her story. So, everybody\u2019s gonna be comfortable around you. Chance\u2026 if you want to find my mom\u2019s killer, that is where you need to be.\" said by Summer\n\"All right. Let me know when and where.\" said by Chance\n\"I\u2019M\u2026 saving those details.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, so I guess you can keep a secret.\" said by Chance\n\"I\u2019m just trying to prevent any of her enemies or\u2026 the media from causing any trouble.\" said by Summer\n\"Huh. Interesting choice.\" said by Chance\n\"I\u2019ll let you know the details when the time is right. Will I see you?\" said by Summer\n\"Look, I can\u2019t make any promises with any of this\u2026 but I\u2019ll see what I can do. Not flossing well?\" said by Chance\n\"Baby, by telling me how impressed you were with my hands off attitude towards victoria, you\u2019re also telling me you don\u2019t want me to interfere in whatever she does.\" said by Victor\n\"Darling, I would never presume to tell you what to do.\" said by Nikki\n\"No, you would just\u2026 gently suggest it.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, that\u2019s what marriage is, a series of gentle suggestions.\" said by Nikki\n\"What if I have a suggestion of my own for you?\" said by Victor\n\"Well, I don\u2019t need them because I\u2019m already perfect.\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh.\" said by Victor\n\"And that is what you always tell me.\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh, I forgot, baby. I forgot. How can I forget.\" said by Victor\n\"And I know that you will stay out of victoria\u2019s way because that is the smart thing to do.\" said by Nikki\n\"Well, I can assure you that under no circumstances, will I interfere in what victoria endeavors to do. However, adam needs my full attention. More than any of his siblings. He is my priority.\" said by Victor\n\"And being your friend for so long, you can\u2019t convince me that you\u2019re fine when I know you\u2019re not. Tell me what happened.\" said by Lauren\n\"Things have been off for months. Maybe longer. His frustration with his work and\u2013\" said by Christine\n\"I thought his retiring was so he could enjoy this next phase of his life.\" said by Lauren\n\"In theory, yes. But\u2026 you know, the build up\u2026 to get to that decision was\u2026 intense. And then at christmas\u2013\" said by Christine\n\"You guys went skiing and you barely made it home in time to see danny.\" said by Lauren\n\"Yeah, we went away to see if we could fix things. Not so long after we realized\u2026 we couldn\u2019T.\" said by Christine\n\"I\u2019m so sorry. And I\u2019m really glad you\u2019re opening up about this now.\" said by Lauren\n\"Yeah. It just felt really\u2026 strange to talk about it. And now, you know, paul\u2019s in portugal and I\u2019m back in the da\u2019s office, so.\" said by Christine\n\"You know that michael and I love you both. Right?\" said by Lauren\n\"I do.\" said by Christine\n\"And we\u2019re here for you. Oh, honey. And if you want to complain about paul. I mean, honestly, who better to. Who would understand more than me, right? And if you want to talk, cry or scream, you call me. I\u2019ll be there for you.\" said by Lauren\n\"Thank you.\" said by Christine\n\"What are you doing here, stark?\" said by Chance\n\"In my late wife\u2019s suite, collecting her belongings. What are you doing here?\" said by Jeremy\n\"Looking into all potential evidence, which I\u2019m sure you can appreciate.\" said by Chance\n\"And just now you\u2019re coming to this room? I guess you\u2019ll have an arrest by the end of the year.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Arrest for what?\" said by Chance\n\"I told you. Diane. She was responsible for phyllis\u2019 death. Now, I don\u2019t know how, but she did something. So, I guess you\u2019re here collecting more evidence against her.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Yeah, we got all hands on deck, don\u2019t you worry about that.\" said by Chance\n\"I want to see everything you\u2019ve uncovered so far. I want to know your next steps.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Yeah, I forgot that\u2019s how it works. I usually share every facet of my investigation with ex-cons.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, I\u2019m her husband. Doesn\u2019t that count for something?\" said by Jeremy\n\"Yeah. Sure. You get a mention in the obituary. You know what? Now, that I got you here, stark. I\u2019d like to ask you some questions.\" said by Chance\n\"Mr. Newman.\" said by Devon\n\"Hey, devon.\" said by Victor\n\"It\u2019s good to see you.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah, please have a seat.\" said by Victor\n\"Thank you very much.\" said by Devon\n\"How are you, my man?\" said by Victor\n\"Doing well.\" said by Devon\n\"Probably wondering why I asked you to join me.\" said by Victor\n\"Oh, I have a couple of guesses.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, yeah. Why don\u2019t you give me an update.\" said by Victor\n\"What would you like an update on?\" said by Devon\n\"Well, my grandson, for one, and then what\u2019s your involvement now with chancellor winters?\" said by Victor\n\"Your grandson is doing fantastic.\" said by ", "answer": "Devon"}
{"content": "\"I am so proud of you, baby girl. You and I know that your grandma would be proud of you too.\" said by Daniel\n\"I\u2019m sorry, baby.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Lucy, that was so beautiful. Thank you. I know how much you loved our mom. And I\u2019m so glad that you two got a chance to spend time together a few months ago. None of us knew that it would be their last real time together. And now\u2026 now, my mom\u2019s never gonna never gonna see lucy become an amazing adult. She\u2019s never gonna see harrison grow up. I really do want this to be a celebration of my mom\u2019s life. I really do, but that is so hard to do when we don\u2019t understand why she was taken from us so soon. Or how. I mean, if only we could know what happened that night. Someone knows the truth. That\u2019s all that I want. That\u2019s all that I\u2019m desperate for it\u2019s what my mom deserves. Answers. Any answers could help my family sleep at night and then maybe, maybe, maybe, then we could say goodbye.\" said by Summer\n\"Sweetheart, perhaps it\u2019s time to focus on the celebration.\" said by Kyle\n\"No, there\u2019s been so many beautiful tributes to my mom tonight, but not everybody has had a chance to speak. Diane, we haven\u2019t heard from you. Is there anything that you\u2019d like to say about my mom?\" said by Summer\n\"Hi.\" said by Abby\n\"Hey.\" said by Devon\n\"Do you believe all this stuff? I mean, this is insane. I am insane. My stuff, it\u2019s grown exponentially. All my clothes, all of my shoes and don\u2019t even get me started started on dominic\u2019s things. This is what happens when you have two of everything. One for when he\u2019s with me, one for when he\u2019s with you. I mean, uh, what are we gonna do? We need more storage? Do I need to rent another place downstairs for extra storage?\" said by Abby\n\"Hang on. Shh. Get your breath, okay? Welcome to your home.\" said by Devon\n\"Aw.\" said by Abby\n\"Victoria.\" said by Audra\n\"Audra. I didn\u2019t hear you.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah, you were a million miles away. Where was your head just now?\" said by Audra\n\"You and my mom go way back. You definitely had history.\" said by Summer\n\"Yes, we did, but um\u2026\" said by Diane\n\"Good job, summer.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Uh, this is a time for phyllis\u2019s loved ones. Um, the people who knew her best.\" said by Diane\n\"Say anything. Say what\u2019s in your heart.\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate for diane to speak on this occasion.\" said by Jack\n\"You know, victor hasn\u2019t said anything. Perhaps he\u2019d like to add something.\" said by Diane\n\"I shall share my thoughts with my granddaughter in private.\" said by Victor\n\"That is a wonderful idea and I think I\u2019ll follow his lead.\" said by Diane\n\"Oh, come on, diane. Don\u2019t be shy. I know that you can do this. I mean, you had no problem sharing how you felt about my mother the last time you saw her. So please, just think of this as a chance to help my family grieve. And that\u2019s why I wanted to keep this informal, intimate so that we could all lean on each other and speak our truths. The way my mom would have wanted.\" said by Summer\n\"This is exactly what I needed. And these flowers, they\u2019re heavenly. We\u2019re actually doing this.\" said by Abby\n\"Yes, we are actually doing this.\" said by Devon\n\"I really, really, really don\u2019t want to leave but there is so much left to do.\" said by Abby\n\"You don\u2019t have to go anywhere. Let the movers handle everything else. You\u2019re exactly where you need to be. And there\u2019s one more thing.\" said by Devon\n\"One more thing.\" said by Abby\n\"Yes.\" said by Devon\n\"Hmm.\" said by Abby\n\"I think you\u2019re gonna like it.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh. My very own set of keys.\" said by Abby\n\"Yes.\" said by Devon\n\"This makes it official.\" said by Abby\n\"Right?\" said by Devon\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Abby\n\"It will be really official though when louise brings dominic here because I got him some apple juice and some new baby bongos.\" said by Devon\n\"You\u2019re spoiling us.\" said by Abby\n\"Well, that\u2019s the plan. I don\u2019t know if I can guarantee roses and champagne every single time you come home, but I\u2019m never gonna stop trying to surprise you.\" said by Devon\n\"I like the sound of that. Not the surprising me part, but the coming home part. I love you for this, for wanting me and dominic here, for making this real.\" said by Abby\n\"Fine. Okay. Um, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m not even sure what to say. As everyone here knows, uh, phyllis and I weren\u2019t exactly friends.\" said by Diane\n\"You don\u2019t have to do this.\" said by Jack\n\"No, no, jack, it\u2019s okay. Because what I do know is that she loved her children and that you and daniel meant everything to her. And I\u2013\" said by Diane\n\"Um, I think that\u2019s maybe my cue to speak. You know my mother, um, I don\u2019t really know if I could sum mom up in mere words. A friend of mine once described her to me as fierce. I would definitely say that that is an understatement. You know how when you\u2019re a kid, you think that your mom is the most beautiful person in the world. That\u2019s how I saw her. That\u2019s how I\u2019ll always see her. You know, this is, um\u2026 just paint and paper. Um, it resembles her. But my mom, she\u2026 she was an adventure. I mean, she crackled, she dazzled.\" said by Daniel\n\"My mind was on a new venture. The risks, the rewards, how to maximize capital investment to accelerate growth.\" said by Victoria\n\"Sounds exciting.\" said by Audra\n\"Very.\" said by Victoria\n\"Is there anything I can do to help?\" said by Audra\n\"No, I\u2019ve got this. Thank you.\" said by Victoria\n\"These are the figures for the langston deal.\" said by Audra\n\"Thank you. Adjusted earnings before taxes total indebtedness ratio. Excellent.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah, I went ahead and did an analysis on the adjusted free cash flow to, you know, get a better idea of the company\u2019s operating performance.\" said by Audra\n\"You\u2019re one step ahead. That\u2019s exactly what I was gonna ask for next.\" said by Victoria\n\"I like to be thorough.\" said by Audra\n\"You continue to impress.\" said by Victoria\n\"Just doing what I love.\" said by Audra\n\"Well, you\u2019re providing superb backup for nate, that\u2019s for sure.\" said by Victoria\n\"That\u2019s the plan. To give nate everything he needs. Uh, so he can do his job to the best of his ability.\" said by Audra\n\"Well, he does continue to\u2013 to prove himself, doesn\u2019t he? It\u2019s been a while since we\u2019ve had a ceo of newman media with his talent.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah, I know exactly how gifted he is. You know, his instincts are remarkable. So, it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he shot straight up the ladder here, you know, or somewhere else. So, it doesn\u2019t hurt that I am familiar with practically every aspect of the projects that matter most to him.\" said by Audra\n\"Correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but what I\u2019m hearing right now is that if nate were promoted, or if he were poached, you would want to take his place?\" said by Victoria\n\"When I look at my son,\" said by Danny\n\"I guess I\u2019m always looking for the next challenge. Uh, but of course, this is all just hypothetical, at least for now. But, you know, who knows what the future will bring?\" said by Audra\n\"Well, as for the now, nate just started as a ceo of newman media and you\u2019re an even more recent hire.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah, I\u2013 I\u2019m very aware of that. I have a great deal to learn and a lot to offer, which is why I want to make myself as useful as possible. So until the day comes when you need a new ceo, you know, I look forward to continuing to prove myself to newman media and to you.\" said by Audra\n\"What\u2019s on your mind, pretty lady?\" said by Devon\n\"I\u2019m nervous, but in a good way. I\u2019m excited and happy and I\u2019m looking forward to what\u2019s ahead for us in the future.\" said by Abby\n\"Well, I know exactly what you mean because after these last few months of being angry, being hurt and making bad choices, I finally feel like I\u2019m getting back to the life that I want. And that\u2019s spending time with the people that make me happy. Which means staying with chancellor-winters and lily. And making a life and a home, right here with you and dominic. And you got me here. I\u2019ve never been more excited about my future.\" said by Devon\n\"Um, listen everyone, I just want to say on behalf of my sister and myself, thank you all so much for coming out today. Uh, you have no idea how much it means to us to be able to share our mom with you and to hear your love for her. So, please just have another drink, maybe share a story and uh, let\u2019s just keep this celebration going just a bit longer.\" said by Daniel\n\"Hey, hey, hey. Are you okay?\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m fine. Just why did summer make me get up and say something about phyllis? And she wasn\u2019t taking no for an answer. It was just really\u2013 it was just really awkward.\" said by Diane\n\"It was awkward. Summer\u2019s lost her mother. I think her grief is hitting her pretty hard.\" said by Jack\n\"My beautiful girl. You just remember that you have your mother\u2019s heart, strength and courage. And you have all of our support. Don\u2019t you ever forget it.\" said by Victor\n\"I won\u2019t, grandpa.\" said by Summer\n\"It was a beautiful service, darling.\" said by Nikki\n\"Thank you for letting me do it my way. I know that you were worried.\" said by Summer\n\"Only about you. Your mother would be so proud. I love you.\" said by Nikki\n\"I love you.\" said by Summer\n\"That was such a beautiful song.\" said by Lauren\n\"There wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the house, you know, thanks to you.\" said by Michael\n\"Well, I\u2013 I just wanted to honor phyllis.\" said by Danny\n\"It was a wonderful tribute. She would\u2019ve been so moved. Despite everything, you\u2019re a huge part of her life.\" said by Michael\n\"I loved your speech. It was really, really beautiful. And I could tell it came from your heart. And I hope you know that your mom is always with you. Her spirit, her love, the memories that you have. Because I mean, as much as it hurt to lose my parents, I feel them with me every single day.\" said by Lily\n\"Excuse the interruption. I thought we could all grab a bite to eat. What do you say? And of course, lily, we\u2019d love for you to join us.\" said by Danny\n\"Yeah, of course. I\u2019d love that. Thank you.\" said by Lily\n\"Great.\" said by Danny\n\"Um, let me just say goodbye to summer real quick.\" said by Daniel\n\"Sure, of course.\" said by Danny\n\"Hey.\" said by Daniel\n\"Hey.\" said by Summer\n\"I just wanna tell you, this whole event was so wonderful. Mom really would have loved it.\" said by Daniel\n\"I\u2019m so glad that you spoke.\" said by Summer\n\"Me too. I love you.\" said by Daniel\n\"I love you.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah.\" said by Daniel\n\"You think you\u2019ve won diane, don\u2019t you? You haven\u2019T. I will do anything to protect my family. Anything, and I will expose you for the lying, cheating psychopath that you really are. And your marriage, that\u2019ll never happen as long as I\u2019m alive. My moderate to severe plaque psoriasis\u2026\" said by Phyllis\n\"The young and the restless will continue. If you think you have dupuytren\u2019s contracture,\" said by Announcer\n\"There you are.\" said by Victoria\n\"Sorry, I\u2019m late. I had to run back and grab some notes that I forgot this morning.\" said by Nate\n\"No, not at all. Don\u2019t worry about it. It gave me a chance to go over the figures for the langston report that audra compiled. She also put together an analysis of the operating performance.\" said by Victoria\n\"Above and beyond, as usual. She is impressive.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, that\u2019s one word for it, I suppose.\" said by Victoria\n\"Did something happen?\" said by Nate\n\"You know, while I am, um, happy that you didn\u2019t decide to go back to medicine after the other night\u2019s events, I have this feeling that your coo doesn\u2019t feel the same.\" said by Victoria\n\"Still in the dark.\" said by Nate\n\"Audra has her eyes on your job.\" said by Victoria\n\"Gotta love her.\" said by Nate\n\"You\u2019re not concerned?\" said by Victoria\n\"I\u2019d be a little disappointed if she wasn\u2019t angling for my desk. That\u2019s what makes audra so damn good at her job. Her ambition, confidence. Maybe I see something of myself in her.\" said by Nate\n\"And you don\u2019t mind looking over your shoulder?\" said by Victoria\n\"Uh, the last thing I want to do is discourage her enthusiasm. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with a second in command who\u2019s on top of what\u2019s going on.\" said by Nate\n\"I hope that that doesn\u2019t mean that you have any plans to move on?\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, I love my job. I\u2019m not going anywhere. At least, not by choice. So, you are stuck with me.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, I\u2019m very glad to hear that.\" said by Victoria\n\"But, thank you for including me.\" said by Lily\n\"Of course. Yeah. I thought it would be good if we all, you know, decompressed. Spent some time with loved ones.\" said by Danny\n\"Yeah.\" said by Lily\n\"Did you know that before your father became a gifted artist and game developer, he was a banana?\" said by Danny\n\"Excuse me?\" said by Lucy\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s right, yes. And lily was a strawberry.\" said by Danny\n\"I cannot believe you told your dad about that. Really? You told him?\" said by Lily\n\"Apparently I did.\" said by Daniel\n\"What happened?\" said by Lucy\n\"Well, these two free spirits free spirited themselves all the way to the west coast.\" said by Danny\n\"You guys ran away?\" said by Lucy\n\"No, not exactly.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yes, exactly. We ran away. We did and we needed jobs, so.\" said by Lily\n\"And the only way we could make any money was\u2026\" said by Daniel\n\"Pretending to be fruit?\" said by Lucy\n\"Yeah, something like that. Pretty much.\" said by Daniel\n\"Ah, you kids are something else. You know, I still have that video your mom sent me of your graduation day. I showed it to everybody on the tour, I think many times and uh, I\u2019m just so proud of you and so was your mom. Not just for the huge milestone, but for the man you were becoming.\" said by Danny\n\"Every time I turn around, she is staring at me.\" said by Diane\n\"Hey, as lovely as all of this has been. I think everyone here is on edge.\" said by Jack\n\"Why is he even here? What, were he and phyllis particularly close?\" said by Diane\n\"As I understand it, he\u2019s here to make sure stark doesn\u2019t cause any trouble. I, for one, am grateful he succeeded.\" said by Jack\n\"Summer.\" said by Kyle\n\"Excuse me.\" said by Chance\n\"How are you holding up?\" said by Kyle\n\"Even after all of this, I just can\u2019t believe she\u2019s really gone.\" said by Summer\n\"She would\u2019ve loved it. The wonderful memories, all the people who loved her, danny\u2019s song. I think she really would have liked the part where you put my mother on the spot. Any particular reason you did that?\" said by Kyle\n\"Just um, just kind of came to me in the moment. I guess I was sort of channeling my mom, you know. How she liked to mix things up.\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, what is it?\" said by Kyle\n\"Diane, can I speak with you outside, please?\" said by Chance\n\"Uh, no. No, she\u2019s not going anywhere.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, I\u2019m not trying to cause a scene. I just need to speak with diane.\" said by Chance\n\"What do you want to speak with me about?\" said by Diane\n\"This is a memorial service. A family is mourning, this isn\u2019t the place.\" said by Jack\n\"I agree. Whatever the authorities want can wait.\" said by Kyle\n\"Why don\u2019t we just hear what detective chancellor has to say?\" said by Summer\n\"I want to go home.\" said by Diane\n\"How about meeting us at the house?\" said by Jack\n\"Listen, jack, I was trying to be discreet about this, but if this is how you wanna do it, fine. Diane jenkins, you are under arrest for the murder of phyllis summers.\" said by Chance\n\"Solid metrics, favorable debt to equity ratio.\" said by Victoria\n\"With nowhere to go but up. These numbers are even more promising than I anticipated.\" said by Nate\n\"And using the cash we have earmarked for mccall gives us the liquidity to take langston to the next level.\" said by Victoria\n\"Your instincts to jettison the mccall deal were spot on. This purchase is going to expand our market share and make one hell of a power statement.\" said by Nate\n\"Mm-hmm. And newman is all about power. So, we\u2019re agreed?\" said by Victoria\n\"It\u2019s a go.\" said by Nate\n\"All right. Well, then I will call first thing in the morning and I\u2019ll make the offer. All right, work hours are over. How about we have a drink to celebrate? I bought this new bourbon that I\u2019ve just been dying to try. And if I remember correctly, we seemed to enjoy the last bottle that we shared?\" said by Victoria\n\"Very much.\" said by Nate\n\"Those empanadas were so good.\" said by Lily\n\"Mm. Not nearly as good as those grilled cheese you used to make when we were kids.\" said by Daniel\n\"What are you talking about? You said I burned them.\" said by Lily\n\"No, they were just a little crispy. It\u2019s made with extra love, right?\" said by Daniel\n\"Yes, absolutely.\" said by Lily\n\"I think that I actually prefer them that way now.\" said by Daniel\n\"No, you don\u2019T.\" said by Lily\n\"You know what? It, uh, it looks like my granddaughter could use some rest.\" said by Danny\n\"Oh, okay. When\u2019s the last time you slept?\" said by Daniel\n\"Oh, no, dad, it\u2019s okay. You\u2019ve had bigger things to worry about than my jet lag.\" said by Lucy\n\"No, no, no, no. Let\u2019s\u2013 let\u2019s get you back to the hotel.\" said by Daniel\n\"No, no. I mean you\u2013 you stay. You haven\u2019t even ordered dessert yet and that\u2019s your favorite part.\" said by Lucy\n\"Your daughter knows you well. I can take her back, and besides, I will enjoy having a little extra time with this little angel.\" said by Danny\n\"Well, okay then. I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m convinced.\" said by Daniel\n\"Great. All right.\" said by Danny\n\"Let\u2019s go.\" said by Lucy\n\"Oh, right now? Okay. Okay.\" said by Daniel\n\"Come here, you. I love you.\" said by Danny\n\"I love you too, dad.\" said by Daniel\n\"Bye, dad.\" said by Lucy\n\"Have a good night.\" said by Lily\n\"Okay. Thank you, for everything.\" said by Danny\n\"Of course.\" said by Lily\n\"Okay, we\u2019re off.\" said by Danny\n\"Okay.\" said by Daniel\n\"Have fun.\" said by Lucy\n\"All right. Bye guys.\" said by Lily\n\"See you soon.\" said by Danny\n\"Get some rest.\" said by Lily\n\"I will.\" said by Lucy\n\"Bye.\" said by Lily\n\"Did you see that?\" said by Daniel\n\"What?\" said by Lily\n\"Pretty sure the two of them are just trying to set us up.\" said by Daniel\n\"What?\" said by Lily\n\"Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law\u2013\" said by Policewoman\n\"Are handcuffs really necessary here?\" said by Jack\n\"Don\u2019t make this harder than it has to be.\" said by Chance\n\"This is a mistake. I did not do anything. I did not kill phyllis.\" said by Diane\n\"This is insane. Diane is to blame for an ambulance accident that phyllis died in? She was at the gala all night. There are people, many of whom are in this room, can verify it.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, there is new evidence. A lethal amount of toxin was found in her blood prior to the crash.\" said by Chance\n\"Phyllis was poisoned? That can\u2019t be.\" said by Jack\n\"That certainly explains her stumbling and the way she fell.\" said by Lauren\n\"So, you think I poisoned phyllis? That\u2019s ridiculous.\" said by Diane\n\"There\u2019s no way my mother did this.\" said by Kyle\n\"No, it had to be jeremy stark. He did this, you know\u2013\" said by Diane\n\"Why haven\u2019t you arrested stark? No one here believes he\u2019s married to phyllis.\" said by Jack\n\"I am following the evidence.\" said by Chance\n\"And it leads to diane? That makes no sense at all. What possible proof do you have that she\u2019s involved?\" said by Jack\n\"You know what, I\u2019m not gonna answer any more of your questions. I\u2019m gonna have to take her. Let\u2019s go. Come on.\" said by ", "answer": "Chance"}

And I also know how important family is to you.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s the whole reason behind this merger in the first place.\" said by Lily\n\"Right. I mean, you pinned all your hopes on building a company and family that was working together. I know that you poured your heart and soul into making that a reality.\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, I thought it would be a success.\" said by Lily\n\"Right. Because business plus family equals success.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yes, I know. It\u2019s a faulty formula.\" said by Lily\n\"Well, maybe this time there were just too many variables. I\u2019m not really a math guy, so\u2026 look, all I can tell you is every time I would have a show, you know, an exhibit that was disappointing or even a single painting that just didn\u2019t feel right, I would always wind up doing a postmortem afterwards. I\u2019d analyze every aspect of it and try and figure out what went wrong.\" said by Daniel\n\"Right, so that you could see how to do it better next time.\" said by Lily\n\"Exactly.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s exactly what I was doing last night. I just kept going over and over in my mind of how we ended up here. I just \u2014 I wish that devon and I could figure out an amicable solution.\" said by Lily\n\"But you tried.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah, I tried everything. I offered to give him the company name, told him I missed him and I wanted to work things out between us.\" said by Lily\n\"I\u2019m sure you did everything that you could. And you need to be clear about that when you walk into that arbitration. You didn\u2019t want this fight. You did everything in your power to try and keep things from getting this far off the rails. There were just too many variables.\" said by Daniel\n\"Why are you telling me this?\" said by Lily\n\"\u2018Cause I want you to stop beating yourself up and just accept the fact that you\u2019re absolutely right to do whatever it takes to win.\" said by Daniel\n\"I don\u2019t get it. Why don\u2019t you want me to go with you? I mean, I want to be there for you. Is this about amanda?\" said by Abby\n\"No, it\u2019s not entirely.\" said by Devon\n\"Because I know how complicated this is for you emotionally, and I want to be there. I want to support you. I mean, are you worried that it\u2019s gonna be awkward seeing her again with me by your side?\" said by Abby\n\"No, this is not about me. It\u2019s about you. I\u2019m thinking about you. Do you want to be in that room and sit across from her and know that she\u2019s gonna do whatever she has to do and say whatever she has to say to win?\" said by Devon\n\"Alright, what are you so worried about? Are you scared that I\u2019m not gonna be able to keep my mouth shut, that I\u2019m gonna tell lily and amanda exactly what I think about what they\u2019re doing?\" said by Abby\n\"No. You\u2019re more than welcome to do that.\" said by Devon\n\"\u2018Cause I promise I just want to be there for you. I want to support you. I want to have your back.\" said by Abby\n\"You want to know how to support me the best?\" said by Devon\n\"How?\" said by Abby\n\"I want you to stay home with our son and have the best day possible so that, no matter what happens in that hearing today, I know that I can come home to the both of you.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay.\" said by Abby\n\"Okay?\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah, fine. I will stay here with dominic, and we will have so much fun. But when you get home, we\u2019re gonna throw our arms around you and give you lots of love and kisses and remind you of all the good things in your life. But I\u2019m gonna be thinking about you every second of the day.\" said by Abby\n\"Well, I\u2019ll be thinking about you, too. You have any idea how grateful i am for you? I mean it. You and dominic are everything to me.\" said by Devon\n\"Uh, excuse me, diane. I didn\u2019t lie.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Oh, really? What do you call that phony emotional outpouring you gave jack and me at society? \u201cOh, I would never have anything to do with him. He\u2019s dangerous. He\u2019s a bad guy.\u201d\" said by Diane\n\"I am shocked to see him here. I thought he was on his way to europe, so\u2026\" said by Phyllis\n\"You\u2019re lying, phyllis, and you know it. It\u2019s obvious that jeremy never left town. And you know how I know that? Because he\u2019s right here.\" said by Diane\n\"Hold on, diane. Phyllis is telling the truth.\" said by Jeremy\n\"[ Scoffs ]\" said by Diane\n\"I was on the jet, i was on my way, and I realized i forgot my lucky socks. So I turned around, come back to get them.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Oh, for pete\u2019s sake.\" said by Diane\n\"Oh, come on, diane. You remember my lucky socks. I don\u2019t dare conduct business without them. But the big surprise is that you\u2019re back in town. What happened? Did you and jack get sick of each other already?\" said by Jeremy\n\"Well, I\u2019ll admit we left town to get away from you, but then we realized what a mistake it was. Why should we let you have that kind of control over our lives? So we decided to simply ignore you and come back. Because, you see, jeremy, your tactics aren\u2019t going to work on me. I\u2019m not afraid of you now. You have no power over me.\" said by Diane\n\"Wow. Did you buy that? I didn\u2019T. We used to struggle with greasy messes.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Are you gonna talk to your dad about him seeing you come downstairs in my shirt?\" said by Devon\n\"Ohh, yeah. I\u2019m probably not gonna talk to him about that today because, um, I want to focus on you and everything that you have going on. Promise me that you will take to heart everything that christine has to say. And don\u2019t let your anger get in the way. Just let her guide you through this.\" said by Abby\n\"I will not lose it. I promise.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay. \u2018Cause I know that that anger is really coming from the hurt that you\u2019re feeling. And, trust me, I understand. But lily will do anything to win, and she\u2019ll probably use that to provoke you. This is about law and contracts. It\u2019s not about family issues or an ex with an ax to grind.\" said by Abby\n\"I know. I know that. And I\u2019m gonna leave it all outside the door. And I will not let my personal feelings affect what happens in that hearing, okay?\" said by Devon\n\"Okay.\" said by Abby\n\"Can you believe it, nikki? Tonight\u2019s the night. It\u2019s finally here. Thank you, honey. Thank you. The genoa city bicentennial gala. Oh, my gosh, we\u2019ve been working so hard to pull all of this together, and it\u2019s finally, finally gonna happen.\" said by Traci\n\"Oh, I know, but it seems like there\u2019s still so much to do. Oh, we are expecting a lot of press, local and national, so please double-check the rsvp list.\" said by Nikki\n\"I have done that, and everything is accounted for. Um, and you\u2019re absolutely right. There are going to be some amazing vips, both locally and nationally.\" said by Traci\n\"Ah, fantastic. Just as we had hoped.\" said by Nikki\n\"Yes. And how about you? Were you able to go over the numbers with michael and lauren for the caterer? The last thing we need is to run out of alcohol or food on a night like this.\" said by Traci\n\"Oh, tell me about it. No, no, no, no. They are all set. They finalized the arrangements this morning.\" said by Nikki\n\"Everything\u2019s going to be perfect. This is the biggest event in genoa city in a really long time.\" said by Traci\n\"Absolutely. This is going to be an unforgettable celebration, bringing together the former and current members of our community.\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh, it\u2019s so exciting.\" said by Traci\n\"[ Sighing ] Oh. My only regret is that you and I didn\u2019t get to spend a lot of one-on-one time together planning it.\" said by Nikki\n\"Ah, I know, nikki. It\u2019s just there was too much to do!\" said by Traci\n\"That\u2019s for sure. Well, it\u2019s all coming together now. And things are almost set for a special presentation we have planned, too.\" said by Nikki\n\"I am so looking forward to it. But you know what? The entire evening is going to just be spectacular. There\u2019s something about a masked ball that really speaks to the novelist in me.\" said by Traci\n\"Well, you\u2019re right. There always seems to be a hint of intrigue and romance in the air when people arrive masquerading in a world of fantasy.\" said by Nikki\n\"[ Laughs ]\" said by Traci\n\"It should prove for a magical evening.\" said by Nikki\n\"It\u2019s my kind of party.\" said by Traci\n\"Recent events? Like what? Are you talking about something specific?\" said by Nikki\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Traci\n\"It makes perfect sense the two of you found each other. It\u2019s just a match made in hell.\" said by Diane\n\"Hell. What was that like? I mean when you died. But you didn\u2019t really die. Hey, but tell me \u2014 when you fake die, do you go to fake hell? How does that work?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Trust me, phyllis, you won\u2019t be going to fake hell. I can\u2019t believe you went running to kyle and summer with the news that jeremy had left town, knowing full well that they would relay that information to jack and me. You wanted to get us back to town and put us in danger. Shame on you! And you know what? I bet there wasn\u2019t a moment\u2019s hesitation before using your own daughter as a pawn in your scheme. How low can you go?\" said by Diane\n\"Is it hard for you to manufacture this level of outrage? Is that difficult? You know, the thing about you from before \u2014 at least you knew that you were a terrible person. But now it\u2019s like you\u2019ve just bought this fairy tale that you\u2019ve created of, you know, saintly reform.\" said by Phyllis\n\"I have reformed.\" said by Diane\n\"Okay, now you\u2019re just a hypocrite.\" said by Phyllis\n\"You were so much more fun when you were taylor jensen back in L.A.\" said by Jeremy\n\"I have apologized for my mistakes, and I have made every effort to prove that I\u2019ve changed.\" said by Diane\n\"Okay, but, see, there\u2019s still quite a few people who don\u2019t believe that. There\u2019s still a few people who will never forgive or forget what you did to them. And those people will be so happy if someone comes along and makes you pay for what you did. I mean, I\u2019m not one of those people. But, anyway\u2026\" said by Phyllis\n\"I hope that two of you enjoy each other\u2019s company. I can\u2019t think of two people who deserve each other more.\" said by Diane\n\"I don\u2019t even know him.\" said by Phyllis\n\"It must really bother you, though, that all your attacks against me have only made me stronger and even more united with jack.\" said by Diane\n\"You actually believe that. Seriously? Things must not be that great between you and jack, or else you wouldn\u2019t feel the need to scream it from the rooftops.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Mm. Yeah. You know what? It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s fascinating that you keep insisting that you don\u2019t have any romantic interest in jack, and yet, my gosh, you\u2019re so obsessed with the fact that we\u2019re in love and we\u2019re back together again.\" said by Diane\n\"Okay, well, I\u2019m not obsessed, and you don\u2019t have the capacity for love.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Unless you can fall in love with a bank account.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Well, look at that. He knows you very well.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Alright, alright, you guys can just keep attacking me. But pretty soon you are going to hear some news that lets you know your hatefulness won\u2019t win. I don\u2019t care what either of you think. I don\u2019t have the time or the energy for your nonsense.\" said by Diane\n\"I\u2019m just talking in general terms about things that have happened lately, nothing specific. You know, there\u2019s just been a lot of circumstances that have affected a lot of us on many levels.\" said by Traci\n\"Traci, you\u2019re not a very good liar.\" said by Nikki\n\"[ Sighs ] I know.\" said by Traci\n\"So, what news were you talking about? Something at the abbott house? Diane and jack\u2019s rekindled romance? Or were you referring to the fact that jeremy stark is back in town?\" said by Nikki\n\"Jeremy stark. Why would you bring him up?\" said by Traci\n\"Oh, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard plenty about that man, all the danger that he poses to every one of us. And just for the record, luring him back to town was strictly phyllis\u2019s idea.\" said by Nikki\n\"I\u2019ll see you.\" said by Devon\n\"Mm. I\u2019m still worried.\" said by Abby\n\"You\u2019re still worried.\" said by Devon\n\"I\u2019m still worried.\" said by Abby\n\"For what? What are you worried about?\" said by Devon\n\"[ Sighs ] Honestly, what do you think\u2019s gonna happen? You think I\u2019m gonna hear something that amanda says and just freak out and start yelling at people and flipping chairs over or what?\" said by Abby\n\"No, nothing that dramatic, but I know you have that in you. Look, I have seen you passionate, I have seen you angry, and most people just see cool, calm devon. Nothing rattles you. But I know there\u2019s a lot underneath the surface.\" said by Abby\n\"Well, it makes me happy that we\u2019ve been in each other\u2019s lives for long enough that you do know that about me.\" said by Devon\n\"But you know who else knows that about you?\" said by Abby\n\"Who?\" said by Devon\n\"Lily and amanda. And I don\u2019t want them to use it against you.\" said by Abby\n\"I\u2019m prepared, though.\" said by Devon\n\"Are you?\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah.\" said by Devon\n\"Really?\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay. Because what if amanda \u2014 sit down. What if she gets in your face with a lot of questions?\" said by Abby\n\"I understand what you\u2019re doing, and, yeah, I know, she\u2019s \u2014 yeah, she might say that.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah, and we have to prepare for all contingencies.\" said by Abby\n\"Well, you\u2019re preparing both of us.\" said by Devon\n\"How can you be so calm? There is so much at stake.\" said by Abby\n\"Because I know that no matter what happens today, I\u2019m always gonna be able to come home to my life, which is you and dominic.\" said by Devon\n\"Yes, and that will never change, but\u2026\" said by Abby\n\"Right.\" said by Devon\n\"I know how much this means to you.\" said by Abby\n\"Sure, it means a lot to me, but in the grand scheme of things\u2026 it\u2019s like \u2014 it\u2019s like that talk that we had a long time ago about love.\" said by Devon\n\"When was that?\" said by Abby\n\"You don\u2019t remember that? It was a while back. I don\u2019t know exactly what i said, but I remember that we both agreed that real love and a real relationship is when you can count on the person to catch you when you\u2019re falling. And I know that no matter what happens today in that hearing, you and dominic are gonna catch me.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah.\" said by Abby\n\"Right?\" said by Devon\n\"[ Breathes deeply ]\" said by Abby\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Diane\n\"Hey. What\u2019s got you so riled up?\" said by Jack\n\"You will never guess who I ran into at the grand phoenix. Phyllis and jeremy stark, thick as thieves.\" said by Diane\n\"Wait. He\u2019s already back in town?\" said by Jack\n\"He never even left. We were right to suspect that phyllis was lying when she said that he had flown off to europe. And no doubt she was also lying when she said that she didn\u2019t want anything to do with his plans for me.\" said by Diane\n\"Unbelievable.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Diane\n\"What am I saying? Of course it\u2019s believable. It\u2019s phyllis. She never changes. It\u2019s not bad enough that she decided to throw in with this man. She dragged summer and kyle into it, too. She lied to them and used them to deliver her lies to us.\" said by Jack\n\"It was all a plan to get us to let our guard down. They wanted us to think that the coast was clear so that we would come running back to town.\" said by Diane\n\"The question is why? What are those two planning?\" said by Jack\n\"What was that about? I mean, what is going on? What news is diane talking about? What is she up to?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Who cares? It doesn\u2019t matter.\" said by ", "answer": "Jeremy"}

Duly noted. Can we get back to work now?\" said by Victoria\n\"It\u2019s the kind of energy you get when you go for the kill and you win.\" said by Nikki\n\"Yes. I love when newman has a big win.\" said by Victoria\n\"I hear elena dawson stormed out of here. Was that your big victory?\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh, there it is. Why didn\u2019t you just lead with that, mom? And no, elena and I did not get into some knock-down, drag-out over nate. To be perfectly honest, she did not play the victim. She let nate and I know exactly what she thinks of us, and she broke her contract, which I am more than happy to let her do.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh. Well, I\u2019m glad it didn\u2019t get too ugly.\" said by Nikki\n\"Mom, you have been very vocal about your disapproval of me and nate and how we got together. I\u2019m not proud that we hurt elena. I\u2019m noT. I\u2013 it weighs on me. The guilt, the sneaking around. I\u2019m glad that she knows about it now so that she can move on and have time to heal.

The distance between us, I feel like I\u2019m losing a little bit more of you every day.\" said by Kyle\n\"You have done nothing but love me and I\u2019ve treated you horribly. I\u2019ve just been so furious at diane and\u2026 that\u2019s spilled over to you. I was looking for answers to my mom\u2019s death, and I thought that you were in denial. So, I shut you out to protect myself, to punish you. I don\u2019t know, but it was wrong. And kyle, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m so sorry.\" said by Summer\n\"Not gonna lie, I felt like the enemy. It hurts, but I know you were hurting more. Your grief and anger. Summer, your mom is alive. You can let go of that pain now.\" said by Kyle\n\"How do I do that? I know that my mom is\u2026 supposedly alive, but\u2026 that grief, it\u2019s just turned into terror. I don\u2019t know where she is. I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s okay. And if the police, they go looking for her and they find her\u2026 or what if they don\u2019t?\" said by Summer\n\"Hey, hey. Come here. I know what will help. Seeing your mom with your own two eyes, that she\u2019s not only alive, but that she\u2019s home and safe where she belongs. I promise I will make that happen.\" said by Kyle\n\"Of course, you take tucker\u2019s side. You don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on here.\" said by Jack\n\"Why don\u2019t you tell me what\u2019s going on?\" said by Ashley\n\"Actually, let\u2019s you and I grab a drink somewhere\u2013\" said by Tucker\n\"I got a better idea. Why don\u2019t you go grab a drink? Ashley isn\u2019t going anywhere \u2019till we hash this out.\" said by Jack\n\"I don\u2019t like the way you\u2019re talking to me. Now stop it. What\u2019s happening?\" said by Ashley\n\"Would you excuse us, please?\" said by Jack\n\"No, I\u2019m good.\" said by Tucker\n\"Out with it.\" said by Ashley\n\"Okay. I won\u2019t even ask if you were trying to stage a coup at jabot. I already know the answer.\" said by Jack\n\"I\u2019m shocked it took billy so long to talk to you, frankly.\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, you are hereby on notice. If you have any intention of following through with your plans, you will fail miserably. You will have no standing. You will lose all credibility. Your reputation will be trashed.\" said by Jack\n\"A coup?\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, yeah, like he\u2019s not part of it. Ashley found jabot documents in your hotel room back when she knew who our real enemies were.\" said by Jack\n\"You know very well tucker has nothing to do with this. The only enemy our family has is your fianc\u00e9E.\" said by Ashley\n\"You leave diane out of this.\" said by Jack\n\"It\u2019s impossible. All roads lead back to diane.\" said by Ashley\n\"This is about your anger.\" said by Jack\n\"No, it\u2019s about me trying to protect our family\u2019s legacy, jack.\" said by Ashley\n\"This is about your efforts to try to bring diane down.\" said by Jack\n\"I will not let our company and our family be diane\u2019s latest casualties. And that\u2019s what\u2019s gonna happen if you don\u2019t wake up.\" said by Ashley\n\"The only threat to this family right now is you.\" said by Jack\n\"She\u2019s gonna drag us all down, jack. I\u2019m not gonna let it happen.\" said by Ashley\n\"No more. This has to stop. She found it.\" said by Diane\n\"You look like you could use a drink.\" said by Audra\n\"Not a bad idea.\" said by Nate\n\"What\u2019s going on?\" said by Audra\n\"Elena showed up at victoria\u2019s office while I was there. That\u2019s what\u2019s going on.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah. I thought that\u2019s where she might be headed. Um, I ran into her at crimson lights. She was locked and loaded.\" said by Audra\n\"And you sent her in our direction?\" said by Nate\n\"No, I just listened.\" said by Audra\n\"Well, she ripped into victoria and me and quit the podcast.\" said by Nate\n\"All wrapped in her self-righteous, wronged-woman fury. You know some people will never understand how the world works.\" said by Audra\n\"I do feel bad about how it all went down, audra.\" said by Nate\n\"Okay, it\u2019s over, nate. Stop beating yourself up.\" said by Audra\n\"Ah, it\u2019s hard not to feel guilty. And it didn\u2019t help that devon ran into me and he piled on.\" said by Nate\n\"I mean, you do know that when you screw people over, you don\u2019t get to feel sorry for yourself when they dump on you.\" said by Audra\n\"I\u2019m just tired of being judged.\" said by Nate\n\"Please tell me there\u2019s more news in this pity party you\u2019re throwing yourself.\" said by Audra\n\"There is. And it\u2019s very encouraging.\" said by Nate\n\"Finally, the good part.\" said by Audra\n\"Nick and victoria recently got into it. Apparently nick\u2019s worried that I\u2019m using my relationship with her to gun for his job, or nikki\u2019S.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, kudos to nick for reading your final agenda. But I mean, he couldn\u2019t be more wrong. You know, any fool can see that you actually have feelings for victoria, as much as it pains me. Uh, not because I\u2019m interested anymore.\" said by Audra\n\"Hmm. Then what\u2019s the problem?\" said by Nate\n\"Well, it makes you vulnerable. And emotions can really mess with your head. Get in the way of the best-laid plans and blow everything to hell.\" said by Audra\n\"Won\u2019t happen. I\u2019m an excellent multitasker.\" said by Nate\n\"And you have me to watch your back. Well, you know, I have to say, I was expecting bigger news than nick\u2019s nervous. And I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s a good thing. You know, nick\u2019s gonna be more protective of his position and his sister, and more suspicious of you. None of this works in our favor.\" said by Audra\n\"Uh-huh. Nick\u2019s and victoria\u2019s relationship is increasingly acrimonious. He attacks me, she defends me. After their latest battle, victoria made it a point to let me know that nick is afraid that I want his job. Well, I let it be known that I wasn\u2019t averse to the idea of moving up, at some point. And victoria didn\u2019t have a problem with it\u2026 at all.\" said by Nate\n\"Victoria, it\u2019s not that I disapprove of your relationship with nate. I am concerned.\" said by Nikki\n\"There\u2019s nothing to be concerned about.\" said by Victoria\n\"All I want is your happiness.\" said by Nikki\n\"Well, then just be happy for me, mom. Look, could you please just be the one person who at least tries to understand? Dad has interrogated me. Nick won\u2019t let up about nate being too ambitious, being a threat to newman enterprises, not being trustworthy enough. I don\u2019t wanna hear it anymore.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, those are valid concerns.\" said by Nikki\n\"But they don\u2019t know nate the way that I do. He has this energy and this openness. I\u2013 I can be myself around him. He\u2019s not gonna judge me. And we build each other up. We inspire each other. We are so in sync with each other.\" said by Victoria\n\"Darling, you have had that same synergy before.\" said by Nikki\n\"Do not mention ashland, mom, or J.T. Or my horrible taste in men. Because nick has been happy enough to remind me of that already.\" said by Victoria\n\"What ashland did to you was devastating. And it has been a long time before you would even consider a romantic relationship, that you could trust your feelings again.\" said by Nikki\n\"Then I have your blessing?\" said by Victoria\n\"I\u2019m your mother. I will always look out for you. But maybe it\u2019s time that I let you look out for yourself and trust your instincts, trust your heart.\" said by Nikki\n\"Do you really mean that?\" said by Victoria\n\"I do.\" said by Nikki\n\"Thank you. And I promise you, I\u2019m not gonna push things with nate. We\u2019re in a good place and I intend to keep things as they are for now.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, I think that caution and moderation are always good things. So, I\u2019ll get back to those contracts.\" said by Nikki\n\"Mom, thank you for your support. It means more to me than you know.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh.\" said by Nikki\n\"You\u2019ve been so supportive, I\u2013 I don\u2019t deserve it.\" said by Summer\n\"You\u2019re my wife. I love you. And it wasn\u2019t that long ago that you were helping me deal with my mother coming back into my life. There were a lot of pieces to pick up and you helped put me back together.\" said by Kyle\n\"Hey.\" said by Daniel\n\"I am so not in the mood for another argument.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, then let\u2019s not argue. We have to talk about mom.\" said by Daniel\n\"I\u2019m all talked out. Especially with you.\" said by Summer\n\"Being angry at each other isn\u2019t gonna solve anything.\" said by Daniel\n\"There\u2019s a lot more to solve after you opened your mouth.\" said by Summer\n\"Hey, look who I found.\" said by Kyle\n\"Lucy, hey, it\u2019s good to see you back in town.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah.\" said by Lucy\n\"Are\u2013 are you okay?\" said by Summer\n\"It\u2019s all right.\" said by Daniel\n\"I heard about what happened. I\u2019m really sorry for what phyllis and that creep stark did to your mom.\" said by Lucy\n\"We cannot go on like this. The constant arguing and\u2013 and yelling, it\u2019s not healthy.\" said by Diane\n\"I\u2019ve got a solution.\" said by Ashley\n\"Diane is not going anywhere.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, that\u2019s enough. We have chased kyle and summer into the pool house. Allie\u2019s moved in with noah. Traci has escaped to new york. This is not a home. It\u2019s a battleground. So, for all of our sakes, could you maybe do us a favor and try to show a little mutual respect and con\u2013\" said by Diane\n\"Okay, this is really rich coming from you.\" said by Ashley\n\"Ashley, I\u2019m warning you.\" said by Jack\n\"No, you don\u2019t get to warn me and you don\u2019t get to give me orders.\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, but it\u2019s fine for your boyfriend here to give me orders in this house.\" said by Jack\n\"You want peace, diane? Why don\u2019t we have summer and kyle move back into their home? The one that you chased them out of. We\u2019ll make some adjustments to your ankle monitor and you move into the pool house. You\u2019ll be very comfortable there. It\u2019s almost exactly the same as it was before you burned it down.\" said by Ashley\n\"Is there no level you won\u2019t stoop to?\" said by Jack\n\"Just trying to protect my family, jack.\" said by Ashley\n\"After coming and going from this house, sometimes for years, treating it as little more than your pied\u2013terre, you now wanna command it as your territory? I don\u2019t think so. While you have been off on your adventures abroad, I have been living in this house, managing and maintaining this house as a family home! Diane is more family than tucker will ever be. If you can\u2019t comply with the rules, if you need to attack her constantly, I suggest you rethink your living arrangements.\" said by Jack\n\"Tucker\u2019s a part of this family.\" said by Ashley\n\"The hell he is.\" said by Jack\n\"Diane is your fianc\u00e9E. Tucker\u2019s mine.\" said by Ashley\n\"Wait, you\u2019re engaged?\" said by Jack\n\"Since when?\" said by Diane\n\"Is this some kind of joke?\" said by Jack\n\"Why would I joke about something as amazing and wonderful as being engaged to the man I love?\" said by Ashley\n\"Well, the man you love looks as surprised as we are.\" said by Diane\n\"That\u2019s only because we weren\u2019t planning on sharing the big news yet.\" said by Tucker\n\"Right.\" said by Ashley\n\"But I couldn\u2019t be happier hearing the words out loud.\" said by Tucker\n\"He just moved in. You didn\u2019t want him living in your room.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, we didn\u2019t wanna rush things. But, you know, when it\u2019s right, it\u2019s right. And when you\u2019re this happy, why wait?\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah. All this happiness, why\u2013 why keep it a secret?\" said by Diane\n\"We didn\u2019t wanna risk a public announcement \u2019cause it\u2019s so easy to get poisoned at those things, you know?\" said by Tucker\n\"Yes.\" said by Ashley\n\"Is this another one of your nasty, petty little games? Making a mockery of marriage and love.\" said by Jack\n\"That\u2019s offensive because our engagement is a testament to our love for each other and to change and forgiveness.\" said by Ashley\n\"I appreciate you saying that, lucy.\" said by Kyle\n\"Maybe I\u2013 I shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\" said by Lucy\n\"No, it\u2019s fine.\" said by Summer\n\"I miss phyllis. I really do. But faking her death and\u2013 and framing your mom for it, why would her and that stark guy do something so terrible?\" said by Lucy\n\"A lot of people feel the same way.\" said by Summer\n\"Hopefully we can get this resolved soon. Get her back here with us.\" said by Daniel\n\"Summer and I were just talking about how much she needs to see her mother face-to-face.\" said by Kyle\n\"Um, don\u2019t you have a manicure at the spa, kiddo?\" said by Daniel\n\"I just\u2013 I saw uncle kyle and wanted to know if there was an update about phyllis. I\u2019m really sorry there isn\u2019T.\" said by Lucy\n\"So are we.\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, I mean, you better scoot if you don\u2019t wanna be late. Kyle, would you mind showing her where the spa is?\" said by Daniel\n\"Dad, there are signs everywhere.\" said by Lucy\n\"Hey. You\u2019re gonna deny me a few extra minutes of catching up?\" said by Kyle\n\"No. That\u2013 that would be nice.\" said by Lucy\n\"Let\u2019s do it. I wanna hear about portugal.\" said by Daniel\n\"You told lucy?\" said by Summer\n\"What did you want me to do?\" said by Daniel\n\"Wait until mom was back. I mean, god, daniel, what are you gonna do next? Take out a full page ad? Tell the whole world?\" said by Summer\n\"When are you gonna accept that telling the truth is the right thing to do for our sake and mom\u2019s?\" said by Daniel\n\"Not if it lands her in prison or a life on the run forever looking over her shoulder.\" said by Summer\n\"This could be a positive development. Now, victoria obviously trusts you. The closer you get, the deeper her divide with nick. We can definitely use that. And it doesn\u2019t hurt that she already has the idea of you moving up in the ranks.\" said by Audra\n\"I didn\u2019t push. Just finessed it. Which is the key to getting what we want.\" said by Nate\n\"I should probably give you a heads-up. Um, I once told victoria I was interested in your job someday. And I wasn\u2019t particularly shy about it.\" said by Audra\n\"She told me.\" said by Nate\n\"She did?\" said by Audra\n\"She actually warned me about you. That craven ambition of yours.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, I meant it as more of a compliment to you and how amazing you are and how you\u2019ll probably be promoted or poached by another company.\" said by Audra\n\"And you\u2019d be more than ready to step in. For the record, I told victoria I admired your ambition.\" said by Nate\n\"Hmm.\" said by Audra\n\"But let\u2019s be clear about one thing moving forward\u2013 no unilateral moves. We\u2019re a team now. So, either we\u2019re in this together or not at all.\" said by Nate\n\"I\u2019m very in.\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah, well, to be competitive, we need to shift that service to an ott platform. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Research on my desk by the end of the day. Okay, great. Thank you. Victoria.\" said by Adam\n\"Dining alone again?\" said by Victoria\n\"Um, it\u2019s how I get the most work done.\" said by Adam\n\"You must be very busy these days, especially given from what I understand, you think that newman media might be a threat to your new company.\" said by Victoria\n\"Huh. Do you deny it?\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, absolutely not. We are most definitely a threat to you. You didn\u2019t live this strong, this long to get put\" said by Victoria\n\"So, what\u2019s our next move?\" said by Audra\n\"There could be an opportunity on the horizon. Something we might be able to parlay into getting closer to our goals.\" said by Nate\n\"So, what is it?\" said by Audra\n\"Newman media may be headed for a showdown with adam newman.\" said by Nate\n\"Thank you so much.\" said by ", "answer": "Adam"}
{"content": "\"Ah, you\u2019re looking a little lost. Can I help you find something?\" said by Nikki\n\"Yeah. If you were the blueprints for the abu dhabi project, where would you be?\" said by Nick\n\"Abu dhabi? Um, let me see\u2026 abu dhabi is right\u2026 here.\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh, there we go. Thanks, champ.\" said by Nick\n\"Hey, you\u2019re not leaving, are you?\" said by Nikki\n\"No, I\u2019m just covering for victoria in the meeting with the international team.\" said by Nick\n\"Good because there\u2019s a new rule around here. Only one of you is allowed to leave town at the same time.\" said by Nikki\n\"You\u2019re stuck with me.\" said by Nick\n\"So, um, I heard the news. I guess I should be congratulating adam and sally. They\u2019re expecting a baby girl.\" said by Nikki\n\"Well, hello. Are you my escort?\" said by Sally\n\"Um, do you need one?\" said by Adam\n\"I\u2019m not sure. I was hoping you would tell me on the way.\" said by Sally\n\"I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\" said by Adam\n\"So your being here has nothing to do with why victor just asked to see me?\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2019m sorry, baby. I\u2019m sorry, I put this in\u2013 in your hands. I\u2019m sorry I put you in this position. It\u2019s not fair.\" said by Phyllis\n\"No, it\u2019s not fair. I\u2019m just scared. I\u2019m scared that if you don\u2019t come with me right now and clear all of this up, I\u2019m just scared that I\u2019m never gonna see you again.\" said by Summer\n\"No, no. I don\u2019t intend for that to happen. That will never happen, okay? Summer, all I need is time.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Hey.\" said by Kyle\n\"Hey.\" said by Elena\n\"Hey. I\u2013 I thought maybe you weren\u2019t coming.\" said by Audra\n\"Oh, I considered it. You never seem to have good news for me, audra. I might be better off avoiding you.\" said by Elena\n\"Right. Well, brace yourself because I finally have good news.\" said by Audra\n\"Oh, yeah.\" said by Elena\n\"You asked and I delivered. I tracked down jt hellstrom.\" said by Audra\n\"Hungry?\" said by Nate\n\"I\u2019m starving.\" said by Victoria\n\"Did you look at the menu?\" said by Nate\n\"Yep, I already know what I want. Avocado toast.\" said by Victoria\n\"Avocado toast.\" said by Nate\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Victoria\n\"You know, avocados were once considered an aphrodisiac.\" said by Nate\n\"No, no, no. That was just a marketing story. Yeah. You see, avocado growers wanted people to eat more of them, so the advertising companies came up with reverse psychology.\" said by Victoria\n\"You\u2019re kidding?\" said by Nate\n\"No, I\u2019m not. Yeah, a little bit of, \u201cyou don\u2019t want this delicious juiciness. It will blow your mind,\u201d and then, avocado sales went right through the roof.\" said by Victoria\n\"You really do have a one-track mind\u2026 about business. Of course.\" said by Nate\n\"Right now, I have other ideas.\" said by Victoria\n\"Mm.\" said by Nate\n\"I think I get to decide what\u2019s top priority and that\u2019s us. So, now we know what I want. What is it that you want?\" said by Victoria\n\"Hm. I want what I shouldn\u2019t want because if I have it, it will only lead to trouble.\" said by Nate\n\"I don\u2019t think we\u2019re talking about carbs anymore, are we?\" said by Victoria\n\"I\u2019m afraid not. Carbs, now that I can stay away from.\" said by Nate\n\"Additional sponsorship provided by\u2026\" said by Announcer\n\"Uh, I\u2019m not my father\u2019s errand boy.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay, I apologize. I didn\u2019t mean anything by it. I was just curious.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, the great victor newman consults with no one. He acts first, then he complains about your poor performance later. So how did this date with my dad come about?\" said by Adam\n\"Uh, he just text me and asked to see me.\" said by Sally\n\"Was he asking you or was he telling you?\" said by Adam\n\"Telling.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, that was definitely him. When and where?\" said by Adam\n\"Why? Are you planning on crashing?\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2019m providing backup. Trust me, you\u2019re gonna need it.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay, I\u2019m not afraid of victor newman.\" said by Sally\n\"But I did hear a hint of something fear adjacent when you asked me if I knew why he wanted to talk to you.\" said by Adam\n\"You\u2019re related to him. Are you telling me that you don\u2019t dread being summoned, even just a teensy bit?\" said by Sally\n\"Look, one thing I can predict is it\u2019s not gonna be nice and the scars could last a lifetime.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay, you\u2019re not helping. So, if you\u2019re not here because of victor, then please\u2026 explain yourself?\" said by Sally\n\"Dad told you the news. Did he also tell you about the stunt he tried to pull the other day?\" said by Nick\n\"Uh, no, he usually keeps those to himself. What did he do?\" said by Nikki\n\"He tried to poach me.\" said by Nick\n\"For what?\" said by Nikki\n\"Dad thinks that if adam and I ran mccall unlimited together, it would bring us closer. Maybe even so close that I would magnanimously decide to back away from sally, allowing adam to be with the mother of his child. Which is so insulting to sally, like she can\u2019t make decisions on her own or that she\u2019s just some trophy that adam and I are competing for.\" said by Nick\n\"So you turned him down?\" said by Nikki\n\"Well, what do you think?\" said by Nick\n\"If I had known what he was planning, I would have nipped it in the bud.\" said by Nikki\n\"He\u2019s just so focused on breaking us up.\" said by Nick\n\"Now honey, I just have to say that children have a way of bringing their parents together. And the chemistry between sally and adam was undeniable.\" said by Nikki\n\"Whose side are you on?\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2019m on your side, but I know sometimes it doesn\u2019t feel like I am.\" said by Nikki\n\"Let me ask you this. If adam and sally are just so perfect for each other, why aren\u2019t they together right now?\" said by Nick\n\"That\u2019s a good question. Why aren\u2019t they?\" said by Nikki\n\"Remember when you used to hug me like this all the time?\" said by Kyle\n\"No.\" said by Summer\n\"Your arms, you used to wrap them around me so tightly like you were trying to keep me from falling off a cliff. And I loved every minute of it.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019ll have to hug you more.\" said by Summer\n\"Mm. I\u2019ll hold you to that. Hey, how was that errand you had to run? You know, you had to do this one thing and maybe it would get you some closure.\" said by Kyle\n\"Um, that I\u2026 it was\u2013 it was nothing. It was\u2013 it was fine.\" said by Summer\n\"Can you tell me now what that was all about?\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, I\u2013 I thought that you were starting to give me some space.\" said by Summer\n\"No, whatever\u2013 whatever you want. I just thought that if you\u2026 what I mean is, I\u2019m glad you did whatever you did because this is the first time you\u2019ve said actual sentences to me in a long time.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019m gonna try to do better.\" said by Summer\n\"You need time and I promise I\u2019ll back off. Just please don\u2019t move into the guest room. Don\u2019t go anywhere, ever. We\u2019ll just sit like this. We\u2019ll get old and forgetful and grow roots like couch potatoes, but at least we\u2019ll have each other.\" said by Kyle\n\"That sounds nice.\" said by Summer\n\"Tell me something. This is serious. Do you blame me for what happened to phyllis?\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle\u2026\" said by Summer\n\"No, I understand if you would because you think my mother is guilty, so I\u2019m also guilty by association.\" said by Kyle\n\"It doesn\u2019t work like that. And I don\u2019t\u2013 I don\u2019t feel that way.\" said by Summer\n\"As much as I know my mother is innocent, I respect the fact that you don\u2019T. And probably never will, unless we\u2019re lucky enough to get a miracle. People call it the biggest smalltown festival in minnesota.\" said by Kyle\n\"I wanna build a trust.\" said by Adam\n\"Trust.\" said by Sally\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Adam\n\"Between us?\" said by Sally\n\"A trust fund for the baby.\" said by Adam\n\"Now?\" said by Sally\n\"Well, it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s never too soon. Matter of fact, we probably should start arranging getting her into walnut grove.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, she doesn\u2019t even have a name.\" said by Sally\n\"She has the newman name, which carries a lot of weight. So you\u2019re right, she probably doesn\u2019t have to worry about getting into preschool. But I just want you to know, and you, that you will never want for anything. You\u2019re right, she doesn\u2019t even have a name and I\u2019m just ready to give her the world.\" said by Adam\n\"That\u2019s a conversation we don\u2019t need to have because I know how much you love connor.\" said by Sally\n\"There were, um, certain advantages that come from being a newman that I did not have access to when I was a child. But I want you to know that this little firebrand is gonna have full and equal access to everything the other kids are entitled to. So you don\u2019t have to worry.\" said by Adam\n\"I\u2019m not. As long as you know that I would never use our child to grab for a slice of the newman pie.\" said by Sally\n\"Never.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay because money\u2019s great, but true worth comes from within.\" said by Sally\n\"Absolutely, yeah. She\u2019s got you and I\u2019m already wrapped around her finger. So, she\u2019s gonna be just fine.\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah. Lucky for us, we have several more months to figure out the details of her life. But, for now, victor is waiting.\" said by Sally\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Adam\n\"Your father wants what\u2019s best for everyone in the family. And if we all agree about the connection between sally and adam\u2013\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh, the connection. Mom, seriously?\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2013 I\u2019m just saying. Maybe it should give you pause. I mean, remember how he held on to sharon for all those years? How long is sally gonna be able to keep him out of her life?\" said by Nikki\n\"Sally and I have talked about this many times. We are setting boundaries.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, well, put up as many fences as you want. Flowers will bloom where they choose.\" said by Nikki\n\"Just imagine how much progress we\u2019d be making on the dubai project if we spent half as much time focusing on that as you are on my love life. Mom, sally, and I are good. Seriously. And the baby\u2019s gonna thrive. Adam\u2019s gonna have to figure out how he fits into our lives. End of story.\" said by Nick\n\"Being with you, like we just were, was not on my itinerary for this trip.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, you know, some of the best things in life, they just happen unexpectedly. You\u2019re not even paying attention and they just fall into place. Are you trying to convince me that you don\u2019t feel that too?\" said by Victoria\n\"I betrayed elena. I don\u2019t want to be that kind of guy who lies to his girlfriend.\" said by Nate\n\"I know that your conscience is bothering you. I know that. We didn\u2019t have to do this. The question is why\u2013 why did we?\" said by Victoria\n\"I need to do the right thing.\" said by Nate\n\"Hello.\" said by Jt\n\"Hi. Um, I am dr. Elena dawson. You must be jt hellstrom.\" said by Elena\n\"Yeah, I got the message to expect your call. Something about a, uh, a podcast.\" said by Jt\n\"Yeah. Uh, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already heard, but I host a podcast that spotlights stories of people who have medical conditions that have changed their lives.\" said by Elena\n\"Sounds interesting.\" said by Jt\n\"I have actually only heard a thumbnail of your story. I know you survived\u2026\" said by Elena\n\"Brain tumor, undiagnosed. Yeah. Changed my life and everybody around me.\" said by Jt\n\"Wow. Sounds traumatic.\" said by Elena\n\"It was. Be honest with you, I\u2019m not\u2013 not crazy about the idea of revisiting that time.\" said by Jt\n\"Oh, um, audra told me that you were willing to talk.\" said by Elena\n\"So, you work for newman enterprises, right?\" said by Jt\n\"I do.\" said by Elena\n\"Yeah, well, if this request came from victoria, then, uh, I owe it to her to hear you out. We all need fiber for our digestive health,\" said by Jt\n\"If I could just find solid proof that my mother wasn\u2019t involved.\" said by Kyle\n\"Just let michael do his job.\" said by Summer\n\"Everything is 10 times more complicated now that stark is dead. The cops and the D.A., They have tunnel vision on this. They\u2019ve already arrested my mother, so if I can just find the proof, then maybe\u2026 I promise I won\u2019t involve you in any of that.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019m already involved.\" said by Summer\n\"What do you mean, how?\" said by Kyle\n\"Your mom is standing trial for killing my mom. I\u2013 I\u2013 I\u2019m deeply involved. And I\u2013 I just think\u2013 I just think talking about it is just stirring up all these feelings, and I don\u2019t want to sleep in the guest room. So can we please just not?\" said by Summer\n\"I guess this part\u2019s gonna take some work.\" said by Kyle\n\"And forgiveness. A lot of forgiveness.\" said by Summer\n\"As long as we have each other, nothing else matters, right? We\u2019ve done hard work before.\" said by Kyle\n\"Um, the thing about victoria is while she is the C.E.O. Of all things newman and she is very hands-on with the media division, her involvement\u2013\" said by Elena\n\"She wants to stay in the wings, I get it. Look, when I had that brain tumor, I did things that I never would have. Things that I\u2019ll regret forever. But that was not me.\" said by Jt\n\"Of course. And you know, this is an opportunity for you to let the world know that those incidents only happened because of your condition. You are living proof that with a proper diagnosis and treatment, patients can go on to have a very regular life.\" said by Elena\n\"And all I gotta do is talk?\" said by Jt\n\"I think a lot of people would be inspired by your story. You may even change a life.\" said by Elena\n\"Yeah, I guess I could do that.\" said by Jt\n\"I\u2019m really happy to have you on board. The first thing that we\u2019ll do is book your flights and your hotel.\" said by Elena\n\"To genoa city? No, forget it. No, there\u2019s no way I can ever go back there again.\" said by Jt\n\"All right, I guess we\u2019re having a discussion. So, let\u2019s do it. Let\u2019s discuss this guilty conscience of yours. Where was he exactly during our little escapade? Was he\u2013 was he out in the hallway? Was he locked in another room? Was he hiding under the bed?\" said by Victoria\n\"Uh, my conscience was asleep at the wheel, again. The problem is you are irresistible.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, okay, I see.\" said by Victoria\n\"And that little voice in the back of my head is as charmed by you as I am.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, I have to say it sounds like he isn\u2019t very good at his job.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, most of the time he is excellent, but occasionally, he\u2019s terrible.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, no. So, you do like me?\" said by Victoria\n\"Come on, you know I do. I like everything about you and that\u2019s part of the problem because this, what I feel for you is, is far more than just the physical attraction.\" said by Nate\n\"I guess the question is, what do we do now? Hi.\" said by Victoria\n\"The young and the restless will continue.\" said by Announcer\n\"I like this.\" said by Kyle\n\"Which part?\" said by Summer\n\"All of it. The talking, the not talking, holding, having you all to myself. No arguing.\" said by Kyle\n\"That\u2019s nice. I wish that we could stay like this forever.\" said by Summer\n\"I know what you mean.\" said by Kyle\n\"But you know, the second we move, the real world rushes in and it\u2019s not as much fun as it used to be.\" said by Summer\n\"Then we won\u2019t move. Are you hungry?\" said by Kyle\n\"I probably should be.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay, I can take care of that. Say no more. Tracy! Anyone!\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, no. Absolutely not. You cannot call your aunt to make you some food. If\u2013 if you want something you\u2019ve got to get up and get it for yourself.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay, I\u2019ll be fast. Don\u2019t move. I love you.\" said by Kyle\n\"I love you more.\" said by Summer\n\"It all boils down to this, okay? You either save your mother-in-law or you save me.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Well, I hope you\u2019re right about sally. That things are as wonderful as you\u2019re saying.\" said by Nikki\n\"They are. You have nothing to worry about.\" said by Nick\n\"Because if she breaks your heart, she\u2019s gonna have a whole world of worry to deal with. And she\u2019s gonna need you because once that baby comes, she will need help and there is no man better equipped to deal with a baby than you.\" said by Nikki\n\"I mean, babies do love me.\" said by Nick\n\"They do.\" said by Nikki\n\"Would you mind if I interrupted for a moment to talk to nicholas?\" said by Adam\n\"I don\u2019t mind if he doesn\u2019T.\" said by Nikki\n\"It\u2019s fine.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, I hear you\u2019re expecting a girl. Congratulations.\" said by Nikki\n\"Thank you.\" said by Adam\n\"I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be a joy. Little girls are such blessings.\" said by Nikki\n\"That\u2019s very kind of you. I appreciate it.\" said by Adam\n\"If this is about mccall, don\u2019t bother. I don\u2019t want to be involved.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, it\u2019s too late because you already are. This isn\u2019t about business. It\u2019s about victor.\" said by Adam\n\"I hope I haven\u2019t kept you waiting long.\" said by Sally\n\"Sally, not at all. Please have a seat. So, I understand congratulations are in order.\" said by Victor\n\"Thank you.\" said by Sally\n\"That little girl is on the way. How sweet is that?\" said by Victor\n\"Yeah. Yeah, we are all very excited.\" said by Sally\n\"You mean all that includes the father and nicholas?\" said by Victor\n\"Yeah. Yeah, it\u2019s a little complicated, I guess.\" said by Sally\n\"Little complicated. Not really, you know. My sons, you may as well know, have a penchant to fall in love with the same woman.\" said by Victor\n\"You know, I\u2019m really curious as to why you asked me here if that\u2019s gonna be the topic of conversation.\" said by Sally\n\"I just want you to know that they have more in common than they would like to admit.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, my relationship with adam is ancient history, and nick and I are very happy and I do not see that changing for any reason, whatsoever.\" said by Sally\n\"I admire your confidence, but I did not ask you here to commiserate about your love life. I asked you here to talk about my grandchild, your child. There are certain things you need to know before the baby is born. That\u2019s me before dawn powerwash.\" said by Victor\n\"I was supposed to be a different man when I took this job. I wanted to build a career, earn my family\u2019s trust back. Be the man I used to be.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, and now you\u2019re in a hotel room with the wrong woman.\" said by Victoria\n\"Right woman, wrong time.\" said by Nate\n\"Gosh, could somebody please put me in touch with the division that\u2019s in charge of time machines? Because whatever universe you and I could be together would be amazing. What? What? What are you smiling about now?\" said by Victoria\n\"Why is being with you so easy?\" said by Nate\n\"Because you don\u2019t have to pretend to be somebody that you\u2019re not. There\u2019s no expectations.\" said by ", "answer": "Victoria"}
{"content": "\"Oh, nick. Oh, finally.\" said by Sally\n\"So, I\u2019ve put together a set of cad drawings from our sketches. I\u2019ve got fabric swatches, paint chips. You know, I just think it\u2019s really important to get lily and devon\u2019s eyes on this asap.\" said by Chloe\n\"Chloe\u2013\" said by Sally\n\"So we can get a sense of what they\u2019re\u2013 I know what you\u2019re going to say. That they hired us to define their new style for chancellor-winters, but I just think it\u2019s really smart to involve them early on because then we can help guide them to what we are envisioning. What? What\u2019s wrong?\" said by Chloe\n\"I want extra guards stationed here and regular checks of the grounds. You see anything suspicious, you let me know. All right. Thanks. All right. Security\u2019s beefed up just in case cameron tries to do something stupid, like come back to genoa city.\" said by Nick\n\"Thank you.\" said by Sharon\n\"I\u2019ll let my dad know too.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, that makes me feel better, but I don\u2019t\u2013 I don\u2019t wanna overreact.\" said by Sharon\n\"Sharon, when cameron kirsten\u2019s involved, there\u2019s no such thing as overreacting.\" said by Nick\n\"I can\u2019t help thinking about those creepy packages. Now, I\u2019m convinced that was blood that we saw on the champagne bottle. And he is trying to send a message with that motel matchbook.\" said by Sharon\n\"Try not to let him get in your head.\" said by Nick\n\"How could I not? They were hand delivered.\" said by Sharon\n\"He could have paid someone to do that.\" said by Nick\n\"Or it could mean cameron\u2019s already here.\" said by Sharon\n\"You okay?\" said by Cameron\n\"It was me. I\u2019m an idiot. My boyfriend is always on me not to walk and text.\" said by Faith\n\"Don\u2019t you hate it when your significant other is right?\" said by Cameron\n\"Totally. But I am sorry.\" said by Faith\n\"No harm, no foul. Let\u2019s just chalk it up to, um, a cautionary lesson.\" said by Cameron\n\"I will never multitask while texting again.\" said by Faith\n\"Yeah. I don\u2019t believe you, but, uh, I appreciate the promise. Hey, are you\u2013 are you faith newman?\" said by Cameron\n\"I am. Do I know you?\" said by Faith\n\"This is a small world. I\u2019m an old friend of your parents.\" said by Cameron\n\"Hey.\" said by Tucker\n\"Hi.\" said by Ashley\n\"Ooh, I like your hair that way.\" said by Tucker\n\"[ Laughs ] Thank you. I was just about to text you. I thought you were standing me up.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah, I almost did. For our grandson.\" said by Tucker\n\"I thought dominic\u2019s music class was over an hour ago.\" said by Ashley\n\"We had a little jam session afterwards.\" said by Tucker\n\"The two of you?\" said by Ashley\n\"Yes. Him on drums, me on xylophone.\" said by Tucker\n\"Sorry I missed that. I\u2019m sure it was pretty cute.\" said by Ashley\n\"It was. I\u2019m telling you, man, he is a prodigy. And, uh, if our fake engagement becomes in a legit wedding, then I think he\u2013 he needs a better gig than ring bearer. He should be, uh, you know, the headliner of the band.\" said by Tucker\n\"Duly noted. Oh, my god. What the hell is she doing here? This is unbelievable. I mean, she\u2019s supposed to be under house arrest. Does she always have to push the limits?\" said by Ashley\n\"What are you doing?\" said by Tucker\n\"I\u2019m gonna call the police. She has to go back to jail. As someone living with type 2 diabetes,\" said by Ashley\n\"Additional sponsorship provided by\u2026\" said by Announcer\n\"I was in the park earlier and I had an episode.\" said by Sally\n\"What does that mean?\" said by Chloe\n\"I just felt wobbly. Some double vision.\" said by Sally\n\"Sally!\" said by Chloe\n\"It passed.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, I hope you checked in with your doctor.\" said by Chloe\n\"Yeah, adam took me. She says that I am at risk for preeclampsia.\" said by Sally\n\"Oh, honey. I\u2019m so sorry.\" said by Chloe\n\"I hate this. But my doctor told me that I really need to take it easy for a while.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, of course. Of course. Whatever you need.\" said by Chloe\n\"What if it\u2019s everything?\" said by Sally\n\"No, no. It\u2019s okay. We\u2019ve got this.\" said by Chloe\n\"I know, but it\u2019s just when we landed our first client and there is so much to do. I\u2013 if we do not impress chancellor-winters, our company is dead in the water. So, I really hate to put this on you, but I\u2019m really gonna need you to take the lead on this for now.\" said by Sally\n\"Of course. We\u2019re gonna figure this out. Okay? I\u2019ll\u2013 I\u2019ll bring the swatches and the paint chips to you. You\u2019ll sign off on all the samples and, you know, you\u2019ll still be involved. Just\u2013 just from here.\" said by Chloe\n\"I mean, it\u2019s too much.\" said by Sally\n\"It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s fine, okay? I\u2013 I\u2019ll drive everything. I\u2019ll do the in-person meetings until you get the all clear. I just want you to take care of yourself. I don\u2019t want you to risk anything, okay? And I promise, you can trust me to keep this job on track.\" said by Chloe\n\"I\u2019m just terrified.\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2019m sorry. Have we met?\" said by Faith\n\"No, I\u2013 I\u2013 I did some work with your dad and newman enterprises years ago. And your mom and I, well, we\u2013 we go way back. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m being rude. I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m ck. Nice to meet you.\" said by Cameron\n\"You too.\" said by Faith\n\"So, your mom and dad are good?\" said by Cameron\n\"Yep. They\u2019re doing great.\" said by Faith\n\"That\u2019s great. That\u2019s great. Please give \u2019em my best. Hey, can you do me a favor? I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m terrible at directions and my phone is dead. So, uh, I have to do this the old fashioned way. Can you point me to that address?\" said by Cameron\n\"Hold on a second. Wait, wait.\" said by Tucker\n\"Why?\" said by Ashley\n\"Well\u2013\" said by Tucker\n\"She\u2019s clearly in violation of her bail restrictions.\" said by Ashley\n\"No, I understand. It\u2019s very suspicious. But in my experience, it\u2019s best to collect all the facts before you\u2013\" said by Tucker\n\"Okay. All the facts are that she\u2019s supposed to be under house arrest. So what else do we need to know?\" said by Ashley\n\"Just humor me a second and let\u2019s consider the consequences of calling the cops.\" said by Tucker\n\"I call the cops. They come, they take her away, and then we don\u2019t have to live with her under the same roof anymore.\" said by Ashley\n\"Okay. The devil\u2019s advocate here. Will diane really be that foolish and brazen?\" said by Tucker\n\"Yes. She faked her death and disappeared for years. So, yes.\" said by Ashley\n\"Why?\" said by Tucker\n\"I don\u2019t know. Maybe she\u2019s going stir crazy. She couldn\u2019t take it anymore. She knows jack will do anything and everything she wants. She\u2019s a very resourceful person. She could have figured out a way to get rid of her ankle monitor and she wouldn\u2019t get caught.\" said by Ashley\n\"Why don\u2019t we go and see what she has to say for herself? Put the screws to her a little bit before we call the cops.\" said by Tucker\n\"Fine. What the hell are you doing here?\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, I imagine the same thing you are. I\u2019m here to enjoy a good meal.\" said by Diane\n\"I see you took my advice and figured out how to remove the ankle bracelet. Of course, in my scenario, you were meant to disappear.\" said by Tucker\n\"I told you. She thinks she can get away with anything.\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, no. You caught me. What am I gonna do now?\" said by Diane\n\"Go back to jail where you belong.\" said by Ashley\n\"Are you seriously calling the police? Go ahead.\" said by Diane\n\"Don\u2019t even think about it. Overactive bladder? I\u2019ve been there.\" said by Jack\n\"What the hell is going on? Have you lost your mind?\" said by Ashley\n\"You\u2019re the one who\u2019s lost control, ashley. Let it go.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, jack, you\u2019re spoiling my fun. I wanted to see ashley trying to explain her outrage when the police arrived.\" said by Diane\n\"So, what\u2019s the joke?\" said by Tucker\n\"Christine has dropped all charges. Diane is a free woman.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, okay. So what technicality did michael dig up to get you off?\" said by Ashley\n\"No technicality. I\u2019ve been innocent all along.\" said by Diane\n\"The only way they would let you free is if phyllis\u2019s real killer confessed.\" said by Tucker\n\"There was no killer.\" said by Jack\n\"Phyllis is alive.\" said by Diane\n\"Yeah, it was hand delivered, sharon, but I don\u2019t think even cameron\u2019s bold enough to knock on your door, leave that cigar box with all of us inside here.\" said by Nick\n\"I wish I could agree, but I remember all too well what that monster is capable of. He\u2019s not easily intimidated, nick.\" said by Sharon\n\"Hey.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, I toured all of my regular spots and I can report that not much has changed in genoa city since I\u2019ve been at college.\" said by Faith\n\"Well, that\u2019s reassuring.\" said by Sharon\n\"I\u2019m gonna go grab a snack. Oh, I ran into an old friend of yours. Like, literally nearly knocked the poor guy over. [ Chuckles ]\" said by Faith\n\"What old friend?\" said by Nick\n\"He recognized me somehow, but I had never met him. Uh, he goes by his initials. C something maybe.\" said by Faith\n\"Ck?\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s it. Nice guy.\" said by Faith\n\"Okay. Well, this is a no stress zone for you starting now.\" said by Chloe\n\"Thank you.\" said by Sally\n\"And I know what you\u2019re going through. You know, when I was pregnant the first time with delia, um, I fell off a ladder and I thought I was gonna lose her. And then after we got through all of that\u2026 um, my little angel decided to come into this world during a snowstorm so far away from any hospital.\" said by Chloe\n\"What\u2019d you do?\" said by Sally\n\"I did what any mom to be does in a crisis. I fought with everything I had to keep her safe. I did. I did that time. At least I did.\" said by Chloe\n\"Look, I\u2019m so sorry. I did not mean to bring up any hard memories. I know that you were an amazing mom to her.\" said by Sally\n\"And I know that you have the same fight in you. So, you just need to grab onto that inner superhero because I promise you that will not be the only crisis you ever deal with in your little girl\u2019s life.\" said by Chloe\n\"I really appreciate your support.\" said by Sally\n\"You know, I gotta say, I was a little surprised that you called adam instead of nick.\" said by Chloe\n\"I did call nick, but he didn\u2019t answer. So i\u2013 I just tried adam and he came right away.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, that doesn\u2019t sound like nick.\" said by Chloe\n\"Yeah. No, not at all. And I still haven\u2019t heard from him, so I\u2019m really hoping that everything\u2019s okay.\" said by Sally\n\"Ah. Well, look at that. Right on cue. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s him. Oh.\" said by Chloe\n\"I, um, I had to come back. (Wheezing)\" said by Adam\n\"I said I was okay.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, if you\u2019re going to stay put, you\u2019re gonna need some snacks and not any old kind. I, uh, checked in with a doctor friend who recommended salt-free and healthy options and bottled water.\" said by Adam\n\"That\u2019s considerate.\" said by Sally\n\"Not really. It was just an excuse to check back in on you, but I see you are in good hands. How is she doing?\" said by Adam\n\"Well, she\u2019s right here and doing fine.\" said by Sally\n\"And under strict orders from me. Do not stress and not think about work because I\u2019ve got us covered. Which reminds me, I need to get to that meeting at the office furniture showroom. Um, I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but, um, I\u2019m happy that you\u2019re here so I can pass the baton.\" said by Chloe\n\"Uh, baton accepted.\" said by Adam\n\"And I heard you stepped up today. So, um, you know, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re doing the right thing.\" said by Chloe\n\"I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m glad sally felt that way.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay. Um, listen, do not stress out. You call me if you need anything and that is an order.\" said by Chloe\n\"Thank you.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, you might change your mind once you try the, uh, salt free options.\" said by Adam\n\"I mean, for coming back.\" said by Sally\n\"Here. Is this him?\" said by Sharon\n\"That\u2019s him. But this article says that he was arrested. What\u2019s going on and why did you call chance when I mentioned his name?\" said by Faith\n\"That man is extremely dangerous, faith.\" said by Nick\n\"If you see him again, you steer clear. You understand me?\" said by Sharon\n\"And then you call us immediately and then chance.\" said by Nick\n\"Now, you\u2019re freaking me out.\" said by Faith\n\"Hey, thanks for getting here so quickly.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, I got your message. Faith saw this guy? Oh, hey. You wanna tell me exactly what happened?\" said by Chance\n\"Yeah. Go ahead, sweetheart.\" said by Sharon\n\"It was nothing really. It seemed like no big deal. I was texting and walking and bumped into him. We laughed about it. He recognized me, which I guess was weird since we\u2019ve never met.\" said by Faith\n\"Anything else? Or was that it?\" said by Chance\n\"He asked how my mom and dad were. Then he needed directions. Uh, said his phone had died. So, I looked up the address for him and told him how to get there. Some bar. Hold on.\" said by Faith\n\"All right, give me a second. Hey, it\u2019s chancellor. I need you to send an officer over to a bar on the south side of town. I\u2019m gonna text you over a name, address, and a picture of this guy we\u2019re looking for. I think he might be there. All right, thank you.\" said by Chance\n\"That\u2019s near the motel where\u2013\" said by Sharon\n\"There\u2019s no way he\u2019s there. He\u2019s just sending another one of his sick messages.\" said by Nick\n\"Okay. Well, this time, he used our daughter to do it.\" said by Sharon\n\"We\u2019ve gotta follow up on this lead. See if he was there and see if he talked to anybody. It\u2019s the only thing we have to go on right now.\" said by Chance\n\"Will someone please tell me what\u2019s going on?\" said by Faith\n\"And chance was able to prove daniel\u2019s story that he saw phyllis and that she was alive.\" said by Jack\n\"They found a program from phyllis\u2019s memorial at the motel.\" said by Diane\n\"And they pulled dna and fingerprint evidence from it to prove that phyllis was alive after her own memorial.\" said by Jack\n\"Which means that I didn\u2019t kill phyllis the night of the gala, which I\u2019ve been telling everyone all along.\" said by Diane\n\"Why are you looking at me like that?\" said by Ashley\n\"Well, because if I was someone who thought the worst of everyone, like you do, I might think that this was a plan hatched by the coven.\" said by Diane\n\"The what?\" said by Ashley\n\"The coven. You, nikki and phyllis have been out to get me since I came back to town.\" said by Diane\n\"Okay.\" said by Ashley\n\"I wouldn\u2019t have put it past the three of you to try to frame me for phyllis\u2019s murder.\" said by Diane\n\"Moving on, it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s a wonderful thing that phyllis is alive. I mean, for daniel, for summer. It\u2019s a miracle, really.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah. It is. Well, of course, I hate that summer has been thinking the worst of me too when it was her mother that was clearly in on this with jeremy stark. She admitted as much to her son.\" said by Diane\n\"Right. Well, maybe you can explain why phyllis would be driven to do such a thing since you did the same thing yourself.\" said by Ashley\n\"Enough, you have been hurling accusations at her for weeks now. All of it has been proven false. You can\u2019t cut her a break?\" said by Jack\n\"You know, you really gotta hand it to phyllis. I mean, it was almost the perfect revenge play.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, phyllis is definitely going to be punished. She\u2019s not getting away with this.\" said by Jack\n\"No, but right now, it\u2019s about celebrating. Would you care to join us for some champagne?\" said by Diane\n\"No, thank you.\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, well, we can toast at home.\" said by Diane\n\"This day has just gotten a lot worse.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah. Let\u2019s look on the bright side.\" said by Tucker\n\"What bright side?\" said by Ashley\n\"We\u2019re not living with a murderer.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah. The way I see it though, this nightmare with diane has just begun. Febreze!\" said by Ashley\n\"The young and the restless will continue.\" said by Announcer\n\"I\u2019m not trying to hide anything from you.\" said by Sharon\n\"Okay. Then tell me who ck is.\" said by Faith\n\"He is a painful part of my past. It\u2019s very difficult to talk about.\" said by Sharon\n\"You\u2019re obviously upset and I don\u2019t wanna make you feel worse, but you guys have me worried.\" said by Faith\n\"I\u2019ll tell you what. Let\u2019s give your mom some time. Can you please, for now, just accept the fact that ck is a very dangerous person, and he needs to be avoided at all costs?\" said by Nick\n\"Of course. But I hope that you talk to me about it at some point. I\u2019m not a kid anymore.\" said by Faith\n\"Okay, I just got a confirmation that cameron is not at the bar. And according to the bartender, he hasn\u2019t been there all day.\" said by Chance\n\"Then nick was right. It was just another tactic to get to me and it worked.\" said by Sharon\n\"Do you have enough now? Clearly, this run-in with our daughter was planned. He\u2019s not hiding out. He is taunting sharon. Can you at least find out where he\u2019s staying?\" said by Nick\n\"Nick. You wanna put this guy away for good, right? Then, we have to play this by the book. I do not have enough to arrest him. I don\u2019t even have enough to question the guy. So, I\u2019m gonna get some units to canvas the hotels and motels in the area. Let\u2019s get some eyes on him, and we\u2019ll go from there.\" said by Chance\n\"All right. I\u2019m gonna get my dad\u2019s security team on this toO. Oh, when did I miss this?\" said by Nick\n\"What is it?\" said by Sharon\n\"Sally\u2019s trying to get ahold of me.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, well, I hope everything is okay.\" said by Sharon\n\"Hey, it\u2019s, uh\u2013 it\u2019s me. Sorry I missed your call. Um, call me back, okay? All right, bye. Went to voicemail.\" said by Nick\n\"All right, well, maybe, you should go. Uh, we\u2019re fine here, and you have alerted ranch security, chance is here.\" said by Sharon\n\"Okay. Okay, I will come back by here after I check in with her, okay?\" said by Nick\n\"I mean, obviously, I\u2019m thrilled that phyllis is alive. That goes without saying.

Slower and longer.\" said by Danielle\n\"Longer.\" said by Deacon\n\"Yes. A drop in 15 degrees temperature, it will make the crust go puffier, airier, crispier.

I\u2019ll be right back.\" said by Eric\n\"All right.\" said by Rj\n\"Well, there you go. The forrester men, now they know how to put on a show. Your granddad taught me, but it turns out no one had to teach you. You know all this stuff already. You know what? That kind of knowledge could come in very handy around here.\" said by Ridge\n\"You know, when you asked me back to hope for the future, I vowed to do it right this time. Because that\u2019s what you and the company needed from me, and douglas too. Total commitment. And that\u2019s how this company started, you know.

I\u2019m gonna take hope for the future beyond anything forrester creations has ever done.\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah. Well, we hit a slump when we could least afford to have one and things looked pretty bleak, but thanks to your help, we were able to turn things around.\" said by Hope\n\"Thrilled to do it.\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah, I just wanna make sure though that you don\u2019t get so caught up in this, that you don\u2019t have any time for yourself, or to spend with douglas.\" said by Hope\n\"Oh, I promise that\u2019s not gonna happen. And we had so much fun at the game last weekend.\" said by Thomas\n\"Remind me again, how many hot dogs did you let that boy eat? Was it?\" said by Hope\n\"Uh, not as many as me. Look, I promise it wasn\u2019t as many as me. And uh, and I also\u2013 gosh, we had\u2013 we always have fun when we\u2019re together, but um, I\u2013 I did let him know that obviously you and I are just really busy right now.\" said by Thomas\n\"That is true. And I guess that answers my question from earlier, about rj. I mean, I know you saw him when he first got home, but I\u2019m guessing you haven\u2019t had any time to spend with him since?\" said by Hope\n\"Not really. Honestly, we just haven\u2019t crossed paths or had a chance to connect.\" said by Thomas\n\"So, you haven\u2019t been avoiding rj at all? And I\u2019m just curious about how you really feel about rj being back. That\u2019s all. She\u2019s feeling the power of listerine.\" said by Hope\n\"Might you be deacon sharpe, the proprietor of this fine dining establishment?\" said by Boucie\n\"Ah, yeah. And you are?\" said by Deacon\n\"Count boucie, master sommelier to the stars and the answer to all your dreams. It\u2019s a pleasure to make your acquaintance fine, sir.\" said by Boucie\n\"Uh, yeah. Pleasure\u2019s mine. Who\u2019s this?\" said by Deacon\n\"Uh, that\u2019s my grandson.\" said by Boucie\n\"Hi.\" said by Orville\n\"Hi.\" said by Deacon\n\"I hope it\u2019s all right that I brought him along.\" said by Boucie\n\"Yeah, no problem.\" said by Deacon\n\"Gramps, I\u2019m hungry.\" said by Orville\n\"Ah, we\u2019ll get something to eat in a little while. Just go sit down and\u2013\" said by Boucie\n\"But gramps, I\u2019m hungry.\" said by Orville\n\"Just sit down. We\u2019ll be right with you.\" said by Boucie\n\"I\u2019m guessing you saw my ad for a wine expert?\" said by Deacon\n\"And count boucie is the man you are looking for.\" said by Boucie\n\"Uh-huh.\" said by Deacon\n\"How do I feel about rj being back? I think it\u2019s great.\" said by Thomas\n\"Okay. I wasn\u2019t sure.\" said by Hope\n\"Well, I mean, I know that dad and brooke really missed him.\" said by Thomas\n\"Well, so have I.\" said by Hope\n\"You understand why he stayed away though, right? He just wanted to avoid the family drama.\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah, but he knows we\u2019re past that now.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah, he does.\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah, I mean, I\u2019ve been updating him on everything. I mean, mom and taylor are being besties now. Bill helping ridge put sheila back in jail. I mean, douglas is home. He knows we\u2019re on better terms now.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah. Everything seems kind of copacetic, doesn\u2019t it?\" said by Thomas\n\"Let\u2019s hope it stays that way.\" said by Hope\n\"I don\u2019t see any reason why I shouldn\u2019T.\" said by Thomas\n\"Wow, that is good to hear. I just know that I\u2019m thrilled that rj is back home, in los angeles, but I understand if your feelings are a little more complicated, nuanced, complex.\" said by Hope\n\"You know, I\u2019m not kidding. Grandpa is 100% a-list.\" said by Rj\n\"Ha. He would love to hear you say that. And it\u2019s great to see him so happy with donna too.\" said by Ridge\n\"Yeah. Well, you know, those logan women bring it out in the forrester men.\" said by Ridge\n\"Oh, yeah. And vice versa.\" said by Rj\n\"Well, it\u2019s working for them.\" said by Ridge\n\"But not you and mom?\" said by Rj\n\"Listen, your mom and I, we\u2013 we have some great memories and we created you. This incredible kid.\" said by Ridge\n\"Well, it\u2019s great that she\u2019s in a happier place now.\" said by Rj\n\"It is great.\" said by Ridge\n\"You look happy too.\" said by Rj\n\"Of course, I\u2019m happy, you\u2019re back. I mean, your mom and I, we couldn\u2019t be happier.\" said by Ridge\n\"Well, I mean, I\u2019m\u2013 I think the whole truce with taylor plays a part in it too, right?\" said by Rj\n\"Yeah. No, I\u2019m sure it does. And\u2013 and if I had known that that was a possibility, I would have encouraged it years ago.\" said by Ridge\n\"Well, you know, from what I\u2019ve heard, it definitely sounds like you, uh, played a part in making it happen, so.\" said by Rj\n\"Really? You\u2019re gonna do that?\" said by Ridge\n\"Yeah.\" said by Rj\n\"So you came back just to rub it in. Is that it?\" said by Ridge\n\"No, dad. I\u2013 I\u2019m just, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m just curious, you know what\u2019s going on between you and mom?\" said by Rj\n\"Uh, so you\u2019re a count?\" said by Deacon\n\"Uh, at your service.\" said by Boucie\n\"And a wine sommelier?\" said by Deacon\n\"Not any wine sommelier.\" said by Boucie\n\"All right, you\u2013 you service the stars.\" said by Deacon\n\"Uh, you inquired about said services. You won\u2019t find anybody better than count boucie. I have an exceptional wine mind and a distinguished palate. Give me a chance and uh, I\u2019ll prove it to you.\" said by Boucie\n\"Um. Oh.\" said by Deacon\n\"I just get it, okay? It\u2019s your baby half-brother rj. I understand if there are some competitive feelings there.\" said by Hope\n\"He, look, he hasn\u2019t been around in a long time and it may take us a minute to\u2013 to reconnect, but I don\u2019t see him as competition. And also\u2013 oh yeah, I\u2013 I\u2013 I look, I promise. I\u2013 I meant what I said. I\u2019m glad that he\u2019s back and if he wants to come and work here, I will make him feel welcome.\" said by Thomas\n\"Of course, you would.\" said by Hope\n\"Look, I am glad that he\u2019s back, but more than me, I think that your mom and my dad are really glad that he\u2019s back.\" said by Thomas\n\"What did you ask me? You asked me how things are between me and your mom? Was that it?\" said by Ridge\n\"No, if you don\u2019t want to talk about it\u2013\" said by Rj\n\"No, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t wanna talk about it. I just\u2013 I\u2019d appreciate it if you\u2019re not gonna play matchmaker.\" said by Ridge\n\"No, dad. Come on, I\u2019m not gonna do that.\" said by Rj\n\"Well, we\u2019ve already had it, right? Steffy and thomas, they wanted me back with their mom and that didn\u2019t work out well.\" said by Ridge\n\"Yeah, well, thomas did a little more than he should have. But like I said, I don\u2019t wanna get involved in any family drama.\" said by Rj\n\"Well, I think that\u2019s wise.\" said by Ridge\n\"Thanks.\" said by Rj\n\"And as far as your mom and me, we\u2019re um, I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re just chilling.\" said by Ridge\n\"Chilling.\" said by Rj\n\"Yeah, chilling. We\u2019re just gonna leave it alone for now.\" said by Ridge\n\"Right. \u2018Cause you\u2019re so good at that. Come on, dad. I know what you\u2019re like when you set your mind on something, talk to me, talk to me.\" said by Rj\n\"Now, that\u2019s another forrester trait that you were given.\" said by Ridge\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s an invaluable one, as long as we\u2019re not butting heads.\" said by Rj\n\"We\u2019re not, right? We\u2019re not butting heads.\" said by Ridge\n\"No, no, no, not us.\" said by Rj\n\"You know why? \u2018Cause I\u2019m glad that you\u2019re here. I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m so happy to see you and so impressed with the man that you\u2019ve become. The man that\u2013 that you\u2019re becoming. I need to talk about the future a little bit and it\u2019s not, there\u2019s no pressure here. It\u2019s just\u2013 it\u2019s what I told granddad, you know. You\u2019re\u2013 you\u2019re talented and you\u2013 you\u2013 you have, um, you have this passion and understanding for something.\" said by Ridge\n\"And\u2013 and I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m using it.\" said by Rj\n\"Yeah, I know you\u2019re using it.

You were given a gift. I don\u2019t know if it started with your granddad, I think it did, but he gave it to me. He gave it to thomas, you have it. It\u2019s a gift to create beauty. And I see it in you. I see it in your work, I see it in your videos, your art. You look at\u2013 at the world in a\u2013 in a\u2013 in a very unique way and whatever you see, you find a way to\u2013 to make it tangible for everybody. I need you to do something for me. I need you to show me. No, I don\u2019t, I\u2013 no, you don\u2019t need to show me because I already know.

And I saw you struggle, I saw\u2013 I saw how hard it was for you to trust me, and I\u2013 I just wanted to be worthy of that trust.\" said by Diane\n\"I have never loved you more.\" said by Jack\n\"When we were dancing, I was thinking about how I could have never had this kind of day as the person I was before. But I\u2019m free of the past, of\u2013 of so much bitterness. Falling in love with you again, seeing your grace, your generosity of spirit, learning from you\u2026 I\u2019ve found a compassion of my own. Even for phyllis. As angry as I am with her, I also pity her.\" said by Diane\n\"I thought we weren\u2019t gonna talk about phyllis tonight.\" said by Jack\n\"You\u2019re right. Let\u2019s talk about you some more.\" said by Diane\n\"No, I got a better topic. You said earlier you can\u2019t wait to get married.\" said by Jack\n\"That\u2019s right.\" said by Diane\n\"So, when? When can we be pronounced husband and wife?\" said by Jack\n\"Diane is unfinished business for me.\" said by Ashley\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Tucker\n\"I can\u2019t focus on anything else until I handle that, which is why I need your help.\" said by Ashley\n\"A very wise woman once forced me to become a better man in spite of myself. And, uh, I kind of like who I\u2019ve become. Feels very good. This, however, feels very\u2026 aggressive.\" said by Tucker\n\"Are you not hearing anything I\u2019m saying to you? I\u2019m doing this for the right reason. I want to save my family, and the abbott legacy, which, by the way, used to be jack\u2019s reason for existing until diane hijacked his brain.\" said by Ashley\n\"Do you really believe that diane is after jabot?\" said by Tucker\n\"Yes. She\u2019s not marrying jack because she loves him, she wants access to respectability, to money, to power.\" said by Ashley\n\"And jabot is her ticket?\" said by Tucker\n\"Yes, she will convince jack to give her her position that she\u2019s not qualified for, and she\u2019ll use it to claw her way to the top, which is why I\u2013 you know, as I told you, I spoke to the board.\" said by Ashley\n\"So, your idea is to weaponize the board against jack in order to save jack?\" said by Tucker\n\"Whatever.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s the only way.\" said by Ashley\n\"How\u2019s our girl?\" said by Nick\n\"She\u2019s awake, and, um, on high alert. She\u2019s snuggling with borgnine, I think he makes her feel a little safer. But now that we\u2019re back home, she\u2019s gonna try to get some sleep.\" said by Sharon\n\"This is crazy. It makes me want to hunt down this creep and run him out of town myself.\" said by Nick\n\"Nick.\" said by Sharon\n\"I know, I know. Calm and reasonable.\" said by Nick\n\"Maybe, it\u2019s time we let victor and nikki know what\u2019s happening. Why give your family just any eggs\" said by Sharon\n\"I\u2019ve already alerted ranch security. If we bring my dad in on this, it\u2019s gonna turn into a whole different situation, and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m ready for that.\" said by Nick\n\"Well\u2026 your dad does have resources that we don\u2019t have access to.\" said by Sharon\n\"I know, but if we ask for his help, he\u2019s gonna want something in return.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, his family is in danger. He would do whatever it takes to protect them.\" said by Sharon\n\"He absolutely will, but I\u2019m telling you, he will use it as leverage to get something he wants from me, like\u2026 make me work with adam at mccall, which he\u2019s already tried to do and it\u2019s never gonna happen.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, I think you\u2019re overreacting.\" said by Sharon\n\"[ Sighs ] Am I? He hates my relationship with sally. We already have the police on this, sharon.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, you said yourself, they\u2019ve come up with nothing on cameron so far.\" said by Sharon\n\"I do hate the waiting.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, I know. You\u2019re horrible at it. Nick. If you take matters into your own hands, I don\u2019t know if we will be so lucky as we were last time. It\u2019s a miracle that we\u2019re actually still here after what went down in that plane.\" said by Sharon\n\"I know.\" said by Nick\n\"We should have worked with victor from the start last time, instead of waiting until I was framed for frank\u2019s murder. This time, we know who cameron is, we know what he\u2019s capable of, and we need to be reaching out for all the support we can get. We need your father.\" said by Sharon\n\"If I\u2019m gonna ride shotgun on this thing, we need to analyze every angle.\" said by Tucker\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Ashley\n\"Like, when things don\u2019t go according to plan. \u2018Cause jack, if nothing else, is beloved by all. Yes, he is.\" said by Tucker\n\"Mm.\" said by Ashley\n\"And it\u2019s gonna take real artistry to convince the board that he\u2019s unfit. And billy\u2019s on his side. And traci, well, she just wants to get along with everyone. What about kyle? I don\u2019t see us getting his vote. And do you want to bring abby through the ringer?\" said by Tucker\n\"Okay, okay, you\u2019re right. I know, there\u2019s parts of this plan that require some serious finessing, but nobody finesses better than you. Right?\" said by Ashley\n\"Mm-hmm. But if you\u2013 if you come at the king and you miss\u2026 jack would be lionized, he\u2019d be untouchable, and diane would be right there with him. And you would\u2019ve lost your family in the process.\" said by Tucker\n\"I\u2019m not going to fail. Period. It won\u2019t happen.\" said by Ashley\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Tucker\n\"And then, diane will lose, you know, her access to respectability, power, and money, and she will lose interest in jack. And she\u2019ll move on to the next jeremy stark, and jack will be sadder, but he\u2019ll be wiser.\" said by Ashley\n\"Thanks to you.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yes. Thanks to me. I\u2019ll save my brother, I\u2019ll save my family.\" said by Ashley\n\"Mm.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, and by the way, diane will get a long overdue karmic kick in her ass.\" said by Ashley\n\"Hmm.\" said by Tucker\n\"Don\u2019t you want to be along for the ride, baby?\" said by Ashley\n\"All right. I\u2019m in.\" said by Tucker\n\"Mm.\" said by Ashley\n\"But if we\u2019re going in full throttle like this, I have a suggestion.\" said by Tucker\n\"Of course.\" said by Ashley\n\"We get married immediately.\" said by Tucker\n\"Okay. Before we set an actual date, there\u2019s just a few details I wanna run by you.\" said by Diane\n\"Okay, but I pre-agree to almost everything.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Chuckles ] Good idea. Okay, I\u2019d like it to be small, yet elegant. After our big announcement at the gala, I\u2019m a little gun shy about grand gestures.\" said by Diane\n\"Understandably. Small and intimate is ideal.\" said by Jack\n\"Good. And I\u2019d like harrison to be our ring bearer.\" said by Diane\n\"That would be my choice, too. He will steal the show, you know that, don\u2019t you\u2013\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, oh, I\u2013 I hope so. And normally, I would ask kyle to walk me down the aisle, but I\u2019m assuming that you\u2019re going to want him to be your best man, so\u2026\" said by Diane\n\"I love that. I would like nothing better.\" said by Jack\n\"Good. And\u2026 mm. I do have one more idea.\" said by Diane\n\"Summer? You\u2019re certain?\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, our family means everything to me, jack, and I want our wedding to reflect that. And since phyllis pulled this horrible stunt, summer\u2019s been\u2013 well, she\u2019s been lost to us. I want her to know that she\u2019s important, that she\u2019s loved, and I want our wedding day to prove that phyllis has no power over our family.\" said by Diane\n\"If you\u2019re so damn remorseful, and want to make amends, and do the right thing, turn yourself in!\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, that isn\u2019t the answer.\" said by Summer\n\"No, it\u2019s okay, summer. I know how kyle feels.\" said by Phyllis\n\"No, you have no idea how I feel.\" said by Kyle\n\"You\u2019re right, you\u2019re right, I have no idea how you feel. [ Sighs ] I should be punished for what I did. I realize that. I will accept punishment, but please, kyle, no police. No police, not until I clear my name.\" said by Phyllis\n\"And there it is. You just made it about saving your own ass.\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, please.\" said by Summer\n\"That\u2019s okay. I know I was wrong, and I am so sorry. In a million ways, I am sorry. But that\u2019s why I\u2019m back. To do the right thing, kyle. Just like your mom did. I\u2019m here to take responsibility, and have accountability. And I\u2019m gonna start by admitting that I resented your mother.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Oh, that\u2019s an understatement.\" said by Kyle\n\"I did. Because she had everything I wanted. She had a family, she had a son who loved her. And my kids wanted nothing to do with me. And I was alone. I was completely alone. And then, jeremy stark started whispering in my ear, and I tried to push him away, but he kept coming back. And I am ashamed to say that I wanted your mother hurt. And so I gave in to jeremy\u2019s plan.\" said by Phyllis\n\"So, you\u2019re a victim?\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah. Just like your mom. Because jeremy took advantage of your mom when she was weak and vulnerable, just like he did me. But then, I realized\u2026\" said by Phyllis\n\"By killing him.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yes. But it wasn\u2019t murder, kyle. It was self-defense.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Your word against a dead man\u2019s?\" said by Kyle\n\"But it\u2019s true. It was self-defense, and that\u2019s why I need more time. I need to find a way to clear my name. Kyle, please. [ Gasping ] For my family, my life. I mean, it\u2019s in your hands right now. Hey, dad. I got an a on my book report.\" said by Phyllis\n\"How do you plan to clear your name? And how do you expect to stay hidden? Because the gcac isn\u2019t exactly in the middle of nowhere.\" said by Kyle\n\"Hey, listen, it wasn\u2019t the smartest thing to do, but I couldn\u2019t stay away. Um\u2026 I couldn\u2019t be away from my babies, so\u2026\" said by Phyllis\n\"Kyle, I can\u2019t lose my mom again. I know that you understand how that feels.\" said by Summer\n\"Hey, um\u2026 let\u2019s look at this, um, rationally.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Rational? You?\" said by Kyle\n\"You remember when your mother came back, right? Back from the dead? And you were so angry at her. Like you are at me right now. And it took some time, kyle, but you forgave her, and the two of you have built this amazing relationship, and, oh, my gosh, it\u2019s so beautiful to watch. It truly is. And all I\u2019m asking for is just time.\" said by Phyllis\n\"No, it\u2019s totally different.\" said by Kyle\n\"How\u2019s it different? Uh, well, I mean, your mom was gone for years and years, so, in that sense, yeah, \u2019cause, for me, it\u2019s just been A\u2026 but these are the similarities. Your mother was unhappy and the idea of a brand new life seemed very, very appealing and I completely understand that. But we couldn\u2019t be away from our babies, so we had to come back. And you see, that is the same. You see that, right?\" said by Phyllis\n\"No.\" said by Kyle\n\"I will make this right, I just\u2013\" said by Phyllis\n\"No, no, no. Stop. Stop. I watched summer cry herself to sleep. I watched her retreat into her grief to a point I didn\u2019t know if she could ever return. You did that. And then you magically reappear with all your tears and your victimhood and your apologies, and you expect summer to risk it all to help you avoid a punishment you deserve.\" said by Kyle\n\"I would never put my daughter in harm\u2019s way.\" said by Phyllis\n\"It has already happened. I feel guilty even being in this room. It makes us all complicit. And you don\u2019t even give a damn because all you think about is yourself.\" said by Kyle\n\"That\u2019s not true.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Hmm? Aiding and abetting. Obstruction of justice. Collusion. We could all go to jail for being in this room, and then what happens to harrison? Have either of you thought about that?\" said by Kyle\n\"It\u2019s late, is everything all right? Is faith home?\" said by Nikki\n\"Uh, yeah, she\u2019s upstairs asleep, hopefully.\" said by Sharon\n\"So, what is going on?\" said by Victor\n\"It\u2019s cameron kirsten.\" said by Nick\n\"What about him?\" said by Nikki\n\"He\u2019s back in genoa city.\" said by Sharon\n\"What?\" said by Nikki\n\"They let that slimeball out of prison?\" said by Victor\n\"Yeah. He\u2019s definitely here.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, no!\" said by Nikki\n\"For a few weeks now I\u2019ve been receiving these mysterious gifts. Um, a champagne bottle that apparently has blood on it, uh, a postcard from denver, colorado, and then a cigar box with a matchbook inside from the southside hotel, and that was delivered here despite security.\" said by Sharon\n\"But have you seen him?\" said by Victor\n\"Yes. Tonight at the coffeehouse, nick was helping me close up. Mostly he just taunted us and then he left, but the scary thing is, he approached faith when she was in chancellor park and pretended to be an old friend.\" said by Sharon\n\"Have you called the cops?\" said by Victor\n\"Yeah. We brought chance in on this. He, uh\u2013 he told us what cameron\u2019s been up to. Apparently, he got out of prison, moved out to la. He got a new girlfriend, one that looks eerily similar to sharon. He then beat her up, ended up back in prison, did more time, but now he\u2019s out again. Back to playing his old sick mind games.\" said by Nick\n\"Chance has the police looking for cameron, but so far, nothing.\" said by Sharon\n\"Maybe we should put additional guards at the gate and a patrol around the perimeter?\" said by Nikki\n\"That\u2019ll be done before we get back to the house. This is unbelievable.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, I would feel much more comfortable if sharon and faith stayed at our house for the night.\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh, that is so nice of you. Thank you. That\u2019s really up to faith. She can be a little bit stubborn, but thank you so much for the offer.\" said by Sharon\n\"I promise you, I\u2019ll do everything I can to keep you safe, okay? Join me in the\" said by Victor\n\"No, I\u2013 I wouldn\u2019t do anything to hurt harrison ever.\" said by Summer\n\"No, no, no, it has already happened. If this goes on any longer and the cops catch you, how do we explain mommy\u2019s in jail?\" said by Kyle\n\"It\u2019s not fair!\" said by > Summer\n\"It\u2019s the reality, summer.\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, we get it. My mom has made huge mistakes. I know. And she\u2019s willing to accept the consequences, but she deserves a fighting chance. Kyle, if we don\u2019t help her find a way to clear her of killing stark, then she\u2019s gonna be at the mercy of christine, and that\u2019s not justice!\" said by Summer\n\"Maybe she should have thought about the consequences before she framed my mother for murder, killed stark, dragged you into this mess. I will never forgive you for this.\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, I\u2019m gonna make this right. I swear to you. I swear to you, I\u2019m gonna make this right. I just need time, just a little bit of time, and only you can give that to me.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Oh, you are relentless.\" said by Kyle\n\"Please. Kyle, please.\" said by Summer\n\"No cops\u2026 for now.\" said by Kyle\n\"Okay, uh, go. Go ahead.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Not what you had planned, huh?\" said by Daniel\n\"[ Chuckles ] No. Not at all.\" said by Phyllis\n\"You know I love summer and I would like nothing more than to see her stand up for you, but I\u2013 I don\u2019t think she will accept and I don\u2019t want to see you get your feelings hurt.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, I have to at least try. Just like I have been trying with her.\" said by Diane\n\"I know, I know.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Chuckles ] Okay, so when you asked me to marry you at the cabin, I kind of\u2013 kind of had a little day dream about what our wedding day would look like.\" said by Diane\n\"Uh-huh.\" said by Jack\n\"And that included having summer accept me as part of her family. And I\u2019m not ready to give up on that. I have my life back, jack, and I want to do what my heart says is right. And that includes being there for summer.\" said by Diane\n\"And I say, by all means, follow your heart.\" said by Jack\n\"You know what else my heart is saying?\" said by ", "answer": "Diane"}
{"content": "\"Thank you.\" said by Lily\n\"Thank you very much.\" said by Devon\n\"Wait just one second here. You two are talking? To each other? This is very unexpected.\" said by Jill\n\"I know. I think we both just realized that when two people think they\u2019re right, they stop listening.\" said by Lily\n\"And so I decided to pay attention to what lily was actually asking of me. And I did what I knew our dad would want me to do if he were here.\" said by Devon\n\"And I think we both realized, too, that we were heading down a path where we were really damaging our relationship.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah. And family is way too important for that. So, as of tonight, I am no longer fighting the merger and I\u2019m going to drop the suit.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, my god. This is incredible. Oh, I\u2019m so relieved. You know what? We need a special bottle of bubbly. What do you say we send somebody down the cellar and we\u2019ll get a really great vintage?\" said by Jill\n\"Maybe we hold off on that for now.\" said by Devon\n\"What aren\u2019t you telling me?\" said by Jill\n\"Well, he\u2019s dropping the lawsuit, you know.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah. It hasn\u2019t resolved everything.\" said by Devon\n\"Look. Lily and devon are smiling with each other, all relaxed and maybe even happy.\" said by Nate\n\"They look like themselves again, the way things should be.\" said by Elena\n\"Thank god it happened, but I don\u2019t know what did the trick.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, the only important thing is that they\u2019re on the right path. And now we have something else to celebrate.\" said by Elena\n\"Anything\u2019s possible.\" said by Nate\n\"Tonight turned out beautifully.\" said by Christine\n\"Oh, thank you so much.\" said by Nikki\n\"So, how did things go with victoria and your father?\" said by Sharon\n\"Uh, better than expected, actually.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, that sounds promising.\" said by Sharon\n\"I realized how fun it could be when my father and i get along.\" said by Adam\n\"In what way?\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, victoria is jealous. This father and son reunion is killing her. Just seeing her try not to work herself into a frenzy \u2014 it\u2019s a gift that keeps giving.\" said by Adam\n\"Adam\u2026\" said by Sharon\n\"I know what you\u2019re gonna say. Okay? And you\u2019re right. We\u2019re not here to celebrate victoria driving herself crazy. Tonight is about genoa city\u2019s bicentennial.\" said by Adam\n\"That\u2019s right. And as long as we are here celebrating history and fond memories and longevity, here\u2019s to us, best of friends.\" said by Sharon\n\"To us.\" said by Adam\n\"Is this is where the party is?\" said by Nina\n\"[ Gasps ] Nina!\" said by Christine\n\"[ Laughs ]\" said by Nina\n\"Oh, my gosh, it\u2019s so good to see you. What? No one told me you\u2019d be here.\" said by Christine\n\"Well, I wanted to surprise everybody.\" said by Nina\n\"You look fabulous.\" said by Christine\n\"So do you! Thank you very much.\" said by Nina\n\"Wait, wait, wait. I just \u2014 it\u2019s so good to see \u2014 I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re here.\" said by Christine\n\"I mean, wild horses weren\u2019t gonna keep me away. I\u2019m part of this town. You can\u2019t celebrate without me.\" said by Nina\n\"That is the truth.\" said by Christine\n\"[ Chuckles ] Aww, it\u2019s so good to be home.\" said by Nina\n\"So, how you doing? You cold?\" said by Nick\n\"A little, yeah. But it was totally worth it. The rooftop view is gorgeous.\" said by Sally\n\"It\u2019s nothing compared to what I\u2019m looking at right now.\" said by Nick\n\"You, always with the right thing to say.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, it makes up for the fact that I\u2019ve been a subpar date.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, you\u2019ve been attentive, courteous.\" said by Sally\n\"Haven\u2019t even asked you to dance yet.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, I thought maybe it had something to do with your abilities.\" said by Sally\n\"Uh, what? Wh\u2013 did you just question my abilities as an answer?\" said by Nick\n\"I don\u2019t know. I have heard things.\" said by Sally\n\"Oh, no, no. You \u2014 let\u2019s go. It\u2019s on.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Chuckling ] Okay.\" said by Sally\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, I got to say, this is by far the best bicentennial gala this city has ever seen. In fact, I think I\u2019m going to rsvp for the next one.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah, you should do that.\" said by Jack\n\"Your brother is in full billy abbott mode tonight. I think he\u2019s very pleased with himself over his new job at jabot. Billy told me the good news.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Oh, yeah. Funny how things work out, huh?\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. This is the start of an exciting new era for your family and jabot.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Yeah. We hope so.\" said by Jack\n\"You okay?\" said by Billy\n\"Uh, yeah. I-I just have something I have to handle. Will you excuse me, please?\" said by Jack\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Billy\n\"Of course.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Maybe we\u2019ve been too hard on her, set up too many rules and boundaries, and now she\u2019s telling how proud she is of us? I mean, is this how she acts when she\u2019s at her breaking point?\" said by Summer\n\"We can\u2019t be the only kids who are freaked out by their mom telling them how proud she is of them, can we?\" said by Daniel\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Summer\n\"I mean, are we the ones who are in need of repair?\" said by Daniel\n\"I think I need another champagne.\" said by Kyle\n\"You know, I\u2019m gonna see if I can find her and figure out what the heck\u2019s going on.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah.\" said by Summer\n\"Hey. Everything okay?\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah. A \u2014 a guy crashed into me. He was wearing a mask. Diane and I wondered if it was stark.\" said by Jack\n\"What? You don\u2019t think he\u2019s here? Did he do something, say something?\" said by Kyle\n\"No, he wouldn\u2019t dare.\" said by Summer\n\"Security is already on the lookout.\" said by Jack\n\"You just let them do their job and you do yours. Make tonight unforgettable.\" said by Kyle\n\"You\u2019re right. I got a big announcement to make.\" said by Jack\n\"Where is your bride-to-be, anyway?\" said by Kyle\n\"I wish I knew.\" said by Jack\n\"Kyle? It\u2019s mom! Kyle? Hey, kyle, are you okay?\" said by Diane\n\"Not yet.\" said by Phyllis\n\"We\u2019re done here, phyllis. It\u2019s over.\" said by Diane\n\"Oh, believe me, for the first time in your life, you are correct. It is so over. I used to wait to run my dishwasher\" said by Phyllis\n\"It is so good to see you. We\u2019re gonna have a lot of fun.\" said by Christine\n\"I am so excited to see everybody. Of course there\u2019s one vip who I\u2019m just dying to give a big hug to, but it\u2019s past his bedtime.\" said by Nina\n\"Your adorable grandson, dominic.\" said by Christine\n\"Yeah. Chance has him tomorrow, so i have to wait until then to see him, but \u2014 I don\u2019t know. Some stupid visitation agreement or something.\" said by Nina\n\"Yeah, no, I know it\u2019s hard. But from what I understand, chance is handling it pretty well. Speaking of which, where is he?\" said by Christine\n\"Oh, he\u2019s on some big stakeout or something? I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll be here later. Geez. Police work, right? It never ends.\" said by Nina\n\"Mm-hmm. Yeah. I know about that.\" said by Christine\n\"So, where\u2019s paul? What, now that he\u2019s retired, he\u2019s out on the lake fishing all the time?\" said by Nina\n\"Uh, he\u2019s in portugal, spending a bit more time with heather and lucy.\" said by Christine\n\"He had to go now, with all the excitement in town?\" said by Nina\n\"You know paul. Family first.\" said by Christine\n\"Esther, how have you been enjoying the evening so far?\" said by Victor\n\"Oh, my goodness, it\u2019s a delightful night. Honoring neil, the excitement.\" said by Esther\n\"Oh, we\u2019re so glad you could be here.\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh, me too. Mrs. C would have loved every minute of this, from the planning to the designing to greeting every guest at the door.\" said by Esther\n\"And the very last to leave.\" said by Nikki\n\"[ Laughs ] Boy, she sure knew how to throw a party. She brought out the best in people.\" said by Esther\n\"Mm. I can see her now in an incredible gown, making her way through the crowd.\" said by Nikki\n\"Yeah. Every stranger a friend.\" said by Esther\n\"Well, wait a minute. Every stranger was on guard because, as you know \u2014 we all know \u2014 katherine had a tongue as sharp as a knife, you know?\" said by Victor\n\"Yeah.\" said by Esther\n\"Endlessly entertaining.\" said by Nikki\n\"Yes.\" said by Victor\n\"Yes. It\u2019s almost like she\u2019s here now.\" said by Esther\n\"Yes. I miss katherine. I think we all do.\" said by Victor\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Nikki\n\"Cheers to her.\" said by Victor\n\"To mrs. C.\" said by Esther\n\"Uh, aunt traci. Have you seen my mom?\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle. Hi, sweetie. No, no, I haven\u2019T. But you know what? If I do see her, I will tell her that you\u2019re looking for her.\" said by Traci\n\"Yeah. Thanks.\" said by Kyle\n\"Excuse me. I couldn\u2019t help overhearing\" said by Leanna\n\"What, you\u2019ve seen my mom \u2014 diane?\" said by Kyle\n\"She was on her way upstairs after a little chat with [Whispering] Phyllis.\" said by Leanna\n\"Oh, no.\" said by Kyle\n\"Can I ask you something? How\u2019s it been for you having your dad and mother back in your life?\" said by Leanna\n\"Look, I don\u2019t know you, but I take it you never stop looking for trouble.\" said by Kyle\n\"Why would I, my dear? It\u2019s what I do best.\" said by Leanna\n\"Tricking me into thinking kyle was sick? You know, that\u2019s a new low, even for you. No wonder you\u2019re alone tonight. You\u2019ve tried for months to unmask me, but the only thing you\u2019ve accomplished is letting everyone get a glimpse of your truly desperate existence.\" said by Diane\n\"My goodness, you know so much about me, but you just don\u2019t know when to shut up.\" said by Phyllis\n\"You\u2019re the problem, phyllis. You couldn\u2019t let it go. And now everyone sees who you really are. So, if you\u2019ll excuse me, my family needs me.\" said by Diane\n\"You\u2019re not going anywhere until I say so.\" said by Phyllis\n\"[ Gasping ]\" said by Diane\n\"Why are you watching me like that?\" said by Nate\n\"Because everyone thinks you are the most debonair, relaxed man in this room, but they don\u2019t know you like I know you.\" said by Elena\n\"[ Chuckles ] What is the casual observer missing?\" said by Nate\n\"That your mind is working in overtime right now and that you can\u2019t figure out how in the world devon and lily are even in the same room without fighting.\" said by Elena\n\"I don\u2019t care about the method, just the results. And they seem to be on track.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, maybe now you can let go of the guilt and your sense of responsibility that you were feeling when they were fighting.\" said by Elena\n\"And concentrate on other, more pressing concerns.\" said by Nate\n\"For instance?\" said by Elena\n\"You.\" said by Nate\n\"Tell me more.\" said by Elena\n\"I \u2014 I keep having these thoughts going around and around in my head. Here you are in this unbelievable dress, and all i can think about is getting you back home.\" said by Nate\n\"Hmm. Sounds like you\u2019re reading my mind.\" said by Elena\n\"But first\u2026 may I have this dance?\" said by Nate\n\"Smooth.\" said by Elena\n\"Why do you seem surprised?\" said by Nate\n\"It\u2019s been a while.\" said by Elena\n\"Huge turnout.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah. Yeah. Huge.\" said by Chelsea\n\"You okay? You need anything?\" said by Billy\n\"Mm, no, I\u2019m good.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Okay.\" said by Billy\n\"I\u2019m great. This \u2014 this beats staying home and watching old movies any day.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Good.\" said by Billy\n\"[ Sighs ] Yeah, um\u2026\" said by Chelsea\n\"[ Gasps ] Well, look who\u2019s here. Billy abbott. It\u2019s been too long.\" said by Leanna\n\"Not long enough.\" said by Billy\n\"[ Laughs ] Aren\u2019t you going to introduce me?\" said by Leanna\n\"Chelsea, this is \u2014\" said by Billy\n\"Chelsea lawson. I am world-famous journalista leanna love. It\u2019s a pleasure. You have stories, and I want to know them all. What do you say to carving out a few minutes for me? We should talk. What\u2019s the #1 retinol brand\" said by Leanna\n\"Hey, babe.\" said by Kyle\n\"Hey. Any luck finding diane?\" said by Summer\n\"Nothing.\" said by Kyle\n\"Jack sent a text and he didn\u2019t hear back, so we need to track her down.\" said by Summer\n\"And leanna saw my mom going upstairs after talking to your mother.\" said by Kyle\n\"Upstairs where?\" said by Summer\n\"She\u2019s not on the roof. Maybe a suite?\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, I \u2014 I was thinking, we haven\u2019t seen my mom in a while, either, not since the speeches. And now they\u2019ve both disappeared?\" said by Summer\n\"[ Chuckling ] Oh. Should I take off my diamonds and heels so we can have a good old-fashioned catfight? Is that what you want?\" said by Diane\n\"No. No. You\u2019re not worth the trouble, diane.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yeah, and you\u2019re not worth my time. You see, there\u2019s an incredibly handsome man downstairs who adores me, and he is minutes away from making an announcement that will change our lives forever.\" said by Diane\n\"Unless he\u2019s gonna tell everybody what a manipulative bitch you are, I\u2019m not interested.\" said by Phyllis\n\"You will be. Phyllis, you have spent so much energy trying to get me out of your life. But guess what. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\" said by Diane\n\"Oh, that is right. You are not going anywhere\u2026 until you listen to what i have to tell you.\" said by Phyllis\n\"You should go in the lounge and kick up your heels, sharon.\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah. The music\u2019s great, isn\u2019t it?\" said by Sharon\n\"[ Laughs ] I know how much you love to dance. You know, there\u2019s a lot of potential dance partners out there. Unless you are, uh, waiting for someone in particular?\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, nina. I hope this evening never ends. All these familiar faces all together.\" said by Traci\n\"It really has been wonderful, hasn\u2019t it? I mean, I just love catching up with everyone.\" said by Nina\n\"Everyone?\" said by Traci\n\"[ Chuckles ] Well, there\u2019s just, you know, one or two people I don\u2019t need to see.\" said by Nina\n\"I actually find it kind of entertaining to run into the people I don\u2019t need to see.\" said by Traci\n\"It wasn\u2019t even his umbrella!\" said by Abby\n\"Nina? I think I might have lost you.\" said by Traci\n\"I\u2019m sorry. Just random work thoughts.\" said by Nina\n\"Oh, really? Are you writing anything interesting?\" said by Traci\n\"As a matter of fact, I am. It\u2019s about an overprotective mother who\u2019s obsessed with her son, who, on the most exciting night of the year, has decided to skip the party because he\u2019s afraid to run into the last woman he loved because she shredded his heart. He\u2019s such a good soul. He deserves to be happy. But he probably blames himself for what happened.\" said by Nina\n\"Um, this sounds a little specific.\" said by Traci\n\"You know, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m just figuring out chance may not be on a big stakeout at all. I think he skipped this gala to avoid her.\" said by Nina\n\"[ Laughing ] That\u2019s the one!\" said by Daniel\n\"That\u2019s it!\" said by Abby\n\"That\u2019s it!\" said by Daniel\n\"Abby. Look, I know their breakup was really shocking, but I thought they were getting along.\" said by Traci\n\"Yeah, well, chance probably made it look that way because he\u2019s such a good person, but she broke his heart. She hurt him. He didn\u2019t deserve that.\" said by Nina\n\"No, of course he didn\u2019T.\" said by Nikki\n\"I think I\u2019ve got some things to say to her.\" said by Nina\n\"Uh, nina, right now? I mean, seriously. Everyone is having a wonderful time. Do you think that\u2019s wise?\" said by Traci\n\"I came a long way to get here. I am so not interested in being wise.\" said by Nina\n\"Thank you!\" said by Daniel\n\"I\u2019m gonna go talk to her.\" said by Nina\n\"I\u2019ll take any chance I get to laugh these days.\" said by Daniel\n\"Oh, no.\" said by Abby\n\"Oh, no, what? Oh, no.\" said by Daniel\n\"Daniel, would you mind if I had a few words with abby? Alone. Having diabetes can raise a lot of questions.\" said by Nina\n\"Devon, what are you saying?\" said by Jill\n\"I\u2019m saying that lily and I still have a lot to figure out just \u2019cause we still have very different approaches to the way we do business.\" said by Devon\n\"I think what devon is too polite to say is that it\u2019s gonna take him a while to trust me again.\" said by Lily\n\"Well, no. Listen. The most important thing here is you and you being in my life. So, moving forward, if there\u2019s anything that could possibly jeopardize our relationship, it has to be gone.\" said by Devon\n\"Am I hearing you right? Are you telling me that you would consider walking away from chancellor-winters?\" said by Jill\n\"Well, let\u2019s just give devon some time to think about things, right? I mean, this is all happening really fast.\" said by Lily\n\"So, would tomorrow be too soon?\" said by Jill\n\"How about we take one step at a time?\" said by Devon\n\"Well, can you blame me for wanting to get back to the fun stuff? You know, the buying, the selling, the taking over the world?\" said by Jill\n\"Yeah, no, I can\u2019t blame you at all, jill.\" said by Devon\n\"Seriously, thank you so much for agreeing to end this hideous chapter. And then we can all start a new one, right?\" said by Jill\n\"I\u2019d say so.\" said by Devon\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Jill\n\"Cheers to that.\" said by Devon\n\"Cheers to that.\" said by Jill\n\"Cheers. [ Chuckles ]\" said by Lily\n\"How could you?\" said by Nina\n\"I never meant \u2014\" said by Abby\n\"No, really. Please explain to me what chance ever did to make you think that he deserved to be treated like that.\" said by Nina\n\"Nothing. Chance didn\u2019t do \u2014\" said by Abby\n\"You know, when I heard it, I thought, \u201cno, it\u2019s a lie.\u201d It couldn\u2019t be true. How could it be? You were the one who refused to believe the stories of his death when he was overseas. And you went there and you found him and you brought him back to his son and to his family, just to break his heart?\" said by Nina\n\"That was never my intention.\" said by Abby\n\"Oh, you didn\u2019t mean to destroy his dreams of having a family with you? Well, that\u2019s nice to hear. I\u2019d hate to think what hell you would unleash if you meant to hurt him.\" said by Nina\n\"I loved chance with all of my heart.\" said by Abby\n\"No, except the part that slept with devon. Devon! Dominic\u2019s biological father. It\u2019s like you went out and you found the one person to hurt chance the most.\" said by Nina\n\"It wasn\u2019t like that.\" said by Abby\n\"No?\" said by Nina\n\"No. And, look, I am sorry. I will forever be sorry for the pain that I caused chance. He didn\u2019t deserve that.\" said by Abby\n\"I really hope that he gets past what you did to him because I never will.\" said by Nina\n\"If I want to ask someone to dance, I will do so. I don\u2019t need you to do it for me.\" said by Sharon\n\"Of course not. But time is passing away. I just thought maybe you were waiting for gcpd\u2019s number-one detective.\" said by ", "answer": "Adam"}

I promise, together, you and I are unstoppable.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah.\" said by Diane\n\"Is something the matter?\" said by Lauren\n\"No, no, no, no. It\u2019s just, uh, I was setting the stage for our romantic rendezvous and I received an unexpected visitor.\" said by Michael\n\"Well, that explains why I had an extra hour to kill before I arrived.\" said by Lauren\n\"Sorry about that.\" said by Michael\n\"Well, who was it?\" said by Lauren\n\"The not-so-late, great Phyllis Summers.\" said by Michael\n\"You saw Phyllis? Oh, my god. How\u2013 how was she? How did she seem?\" said by Lauren\n\"Oh, you know, same old Phyllis. She was wearing a trench coat and dark glasses to avoid being recognized.\" said by Michael\n\"I would\u2019ve given anything to see her. Oh, my god. It must have been just so surreal.\" said by Lauren\n\"Well, that\u2019s one word for it. Behold, behold.\" said by Michael\n\"What?\" said by Lauren\n\"What your best pal walked in on, not to mention, myself, barely clothed.\" said by Michael\n\"This is so romantic. The candles, the flowers, and ooh, look at this. My favorite Champagne. You put a lot of effort into this.\" said by Lauren\n\"You are so worth it.\" said by Michael\n\"Ah, and then Phyllis crashes this?\" said by Lauren\n\"Yeah. Where she wiped out an entire platter of chocolate-covered strawberries.\" said by Michael\n\"Yes, and look, I really want to partake in all of this, but come here. First, I want to hear everything that you and Phyllis talked about.\" said by Lauren\n\"Have you figured out a way for her to come home without her life being wrecked?\" said by Lauren\n\"Kyle. Kyle! [ Sighing ] Where is he?\" said by Summer\n\"We\u2019re completely in sync. Just proof we were meant to be. And everything we went through in the past, breaking up, getting back together again, breaking up again.\" said by Kyle\n\"It\u2019s just proof that once we finally made it permanent, we were destined to last forever.\n\n[phone chimes]\" said by Kyle\n\"(via text) Spoke with Michael. May finally see a way out of all this.\" said by Phyllis\n\"This is all your fault.\" said by Summer\n\"Wow. That was\u2013\" said by Kyle\n\"Something we both needed.\" said by Audra\n\"Apparently.\" said by Kyle\n\"Hey.\" said by Audra\n\"Um, hm.\" said by Kyle\n\"Mm, everything good?\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah. Yeah, definitely.\" said by Kyle\n\"Listen, this was something really fun that happened. No more, no less. So, if you\u2019re thinking about making, you know, a smooth escape, like, that\u2019s cool with me. Like, I get it. No pressure from me.\" said by Audra\n\"I don\u2019t want to go home. From the very first touch,\" said by Kyle\n\"This a good time? I\u2019ll take that as a yes.\" said by Nick\n\"Dad, how are you after everything that happened?\" said by Summer\n\"Oh. You mean with Cameron Kirsten? How\u2019d you hear about that?\" said by Nick\n\"Faith told me when she was letting me know that she was headed back to Michigan. Oh, my god, it\u2019s horrible. Look, I know that this might sound bad, but I\u2019m glad that he\u2019s dead.\" said by Summer\n\"That\u2019s not bad at all. Cameron meant business. He was determined to take out as many of us as possible.\" said by Nick\n\"In a sewer? I\u2013\" said by Summer\n\"It\u2019s just like his mind. Sitting over in that cell, rotting away, obsessing about Sharon. I guess he thought this would bring things full circle.\" said by Nick\n\"Are Sharon and Faith really okay?\" said by Summer\n\"They\u2019re doing the best they can considering the traumatic experience they went through.\" said by Nick\n\"It\u2019s so scary. I mean, if that had happened to Harrison I\u2019d\u2013\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, listen, we\u2019re dealing with it, all right? We\u2019re all tough. We\u2019re determined to get through it.\" said by Nick\n\"How\u2019s everything else? You okay?\" said by Summer\n\"I don\u2019t know if you heard this or not, but I\u2019m taking some time away from Newman Enterprises. It\u2019s not my call, but with everything that\u2019s happened, maybe it\u2019s for the best. Also, Sally lost the baby.\" said by Nick\n\"Dad, when?\" said by Summer\n\"The day Faith got kidnapped. Adam was with her. I didn\u2019t even know about it until after it happened.\" said by Nick\n\"That is so awful. I\u2013 I know how much this baby meant to you.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s a lot to deal with all at once.\" said by Nick\n\"How is Sally doing?\" said by Summer\n\"Not great.\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2013 I\u2019m so sorry.\" said by Summer\n\"Thanks. So, I know you never would have called me over at this hour unless there was something wrong. What\u2019s going on?\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, I don\u2019t know, Dad. I\u2013 I can\u2019t pile anything else onto you.\" said by Summer\n\"Hey, I\u2019m your dad. Pile away.\" said by Nick\n\"No, seriously. It\u2019s okay, let\u2019s talk next week when all of this isn\u2019t so fresh.\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, you\u2019re anxious, and something\u2019s going on, so talk to me.\" said by Nick\n\"I don\u2019t even know where to start. God. [ sobbing ] I have messed up my marriage so bad.\" said by Summer\n\"How?\" said by Nick\n\"Kyle wants to separate. He asked me to move out.\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m so sorry, Summer. I\u2019m sorry. All right, I want you to talk to me, okay? Tell me everything.\" said by Nick\n\"I laid out a scenario for what Phyllis could expect, legally speaking, if she were to surrender.\" said by Michael\n\"With you representing her?\" said by Lauren\n\"That would be the plan.\" said by Michael\n\"Can you keep her out of prison?\" said by Lauren\n\"There are no guarantees.\" said by Michael\n\"I knew you were gonna say that.\" said by Lauren\n\"Look, her best shot is to come in from the cold and at least let me try.\" said by Michael\n\"But she has to be terrified to come all the way back here and then wind up in a cell.\" said by Lauren\n\"Well, she is, but her only other option is equally grim.\" said by Michael\n\"Right. Looking over her shoulder, the rest of her life is no choice.\" said by Lauren\n\"Or she could put her faith in me, which seems a no-brainer.\" said by Michael\n\"Honey, she\u2019s scared.\" said by Lauren\n\"As well she should be. Do you know what she told me? \u201cLet me think about it.\u201d Before she ate the last strawberry and vamoosed. Now, all I can do is, wait. Wait!\" said by Michael\n\"I hope she makes the right choice because I really miss my friend.\" said by Lauren\n\"Me too. You know, I\u2019ve known Phyllis has been alive for a while, but seeing her in person\u2026\" said by Michael\n\"How did she seem? I mean, she\u2019s been through so much.\" said by Lauren\n\"That\u2019s exactly what you said. She\u2019s worried and afraid and hiding behind a big old wall of bravado.\" said by Michael\n\"Hm. That\u2019s our Phyllis.\" said by Lauren\n\"It was incredible to see her, but at the same time, uh, it was heartbreaking.\" said by Michael\n\"I wish I could go back in time and just talk her out of that insane scheme.\" said by Lauren\n\"No, no, no, listen to me. Phyllis got herself into that jam, and I intend to get her out of it, but she\u2019s gonna have to at least pay for some of her crimes. And her life will never be the same.\" said by Michael\n\"Don\u2019t be so sure. Diane played dead for many years. Came back and look at her life now.\" said by Lauren\n\"Another toast? How many is that?\" said by Diane\n\"I\u2019ve lost count.\" said by Jack\n\"That\u2019s my favorite number.\" said by Diane\n\"To your resilience. No matter what life throws you, you never let it keep you down.\" said by Jack\n\"I\u2019ll drink to that.\" said by Diane\n\"I mean that. I really do admire that you have your problems like anyone else, your insecurities, your worries, your frustrations. You never let it derail you. Not Ashley\u2019s resistance and ugliness, not Phyllis eluding the law after the abominable things she did to you.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, one thing that does worry me is that Kyle came here to sleep to get even farther away from Summer, it\u2013 it hurts my heart.\" said by Diane\n\"Yeah, mine too.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. But still, you and I had some steep mountains to climb to get to this point and I\u2013 you know, I have to hope that things will work out for them, too.\" said by Diane\n\"I really believe they will. But they may have to learn the hard way about love and forgiveness.\" said by Jack\n\"You know, we\u2019re lucky, Jack. One good thing about getting older is that we\u2019ve been around long enough to know that struggle is just a part of life.\" said by Diane\n\"Thinking about the kids again?\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. You know, you take the bad with the good and you cherish what you have when you have it. It\u2019s a lesson I failed to learn \u2019til I had lost everything. Or I should say I threw it away with both hands, but I was\u2013 I was younger then, I\u2013 I made a lot of mistakes.\" said by Diane\n\"Didn\u2019t we all?\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. But having you back in my life, it, uh, it makes me want to be better. To\u2013 to be a better person. I mean, I\u2019m so grateful for every moment that we have and I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m not taking any of it for granted.\" said by Diane\n\"I think luck, I think fate play a part in all of this. How lucky we are that life brought us back together when we could really be partners.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. I\u2019ll try not to ruin things this time.\" said by Diane\n\"No, I think we are both walking into this marriage with our eyes wide open. You are not perfect. God knows I am not perfect\u2013\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, hey, hey, hey, watch what you say about my fianc\u00e9. He\u2019s pretty perfect. Okay, can you, um, can you allow me one moment of pettiness? I take great pride in knowing that Phyllis and Ashley are still stuck in the past. They\u2019re still dwelling on old grievances. I actually feel sorry for them.\" said by Diane\n\"You know what? I don\u2019t find that petty at all. I absolutely agree.\" said by Jack\n\"You hungry? Maybe you want to order room service or go out.\" said by Kyle\n\"I have to be honest with you. I really do have a huge day tomorrow. I\u2019m taking the reins at Newman Media while, uh, Nate fills in for Nick.\" said by Audra\n\"Hm.\" said by Kyle\n\"So, I actually need you to make that smooth exit we talked about.\" said by Audra\n\"Oh, you\u2019re kicking me out. I feel so used.\" said by Kyle\n\"Listen, I like pillow talk as much as the next girl, okay? Tonight, however\u2013\" said by Audra\n\"Your mind is on work.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yes.\" said by Audra\n\"I get it.\" said by Kyle\n\"Look, if I misled you in any way, I\u2013\" said by Audra\n\"No, no, not at all. You\u2019ve been very upfront about everything. I appreciate the honesty. It was fantastic.\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, I\u2019m glad you feel that way.\" said by Audra\n\"So, I suppose I should get dressed.\" said by Kyle\n\"Hm. You can do that. After we shower.\" said by Audra\n\"Ooh, I think that\u2019s one hell of a great idea.\" said by Kyle\n\"I mean, I\u2019m sorry, you are struggling with this. I cannot believe your mother faked her own death and has put you and Daniel through this. You don\u2019t deserve it. Where is she now?\" said by Nick\n\"I don\u2019t know. She won\u2019t say. She\u2019s trying to protect me and Daniel, and herself.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah, probably more herself.\" said by Nick\n\"She did offer to turn herself in if it would save my marriage, but\u2013 but I couldn\u2019t let her do that. And it wouldn\u2019t have helped anyway. We need to keep searching for a way for her to come home without being arrested for Stark\u2019s murder. Dad, what are you thinking?\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2013 I mean, what am I thinking? Uh, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m grateful that your mother\u2019s still alive.\" said by Nick\n\"Only now you could kill her?\" said by Summer\n\"My feelings are complicated. I cannot understand why she\u2019s making you feel responsible for solving problems that she created.\" said by Nick\n\"What else is new? Though, if I\u2019m being fair, and if we\u2019re being fair to her, a lot of this is Stark\u2019s fault. And not to mention the fact that Diane faked her death and tried to pin it on other people and it never caught up to her, so I know mom\u2019s logic was really, really screwy, but I do see that there was some justice to it.\" said by Summer\n\"Sweetheart, I know you love your mother, but we\u2019re also talking about Kyle\u2019s mother.\" said by Nick\n\"You\u2019re right. I tried to protect my mom. And it turns out it might have cost me my marriage.\" said by Summer\n\"How many times have we said that Phyllis is her own worst enemy?\" said by Lauren\n\"Too many to count.\" said by Michael\n\"I mean, since the day we met her, it has been one ghastly mistake after another.\" said by Lauren\n\"If we were ever asked to print out a timeline of all her misdeeds, our printer would explode.\" said by Michael\n\"Isn\u2019t that the truth? And yet, god help me, I adore her.\" said by Lauren\n\"Yeah. Likewise.\" said by Michael\n\"What do you think it would take for Phyllis to turn over a new leaf, huh?\" said by Lauren\n\"When we thought Mom was dead, I\u2013 I couldn\u2019t even stand to be in the same room as Kyle. He kept on shielding Diane and he\u2013 he wouldn\u2019t even accept the possibility that his mom had murdered mine. And\u2013 and it made me so angry. But then suddenly there was mom. And she had killed Stark, and she was asking me not to tell anyone that she was alive.\" said by Summer\n\"Including Kyle.\" said by Nick\n\"Especially Kyle. Because of course he would have gone straight to the police. And\u2013 and Mom needed time to be able to prove that it was self-defense. And I went along with it. I froze Kyle out to protect mom, even though it meant prolonging his mom\u2019s suffering. And I\u2013 I knew that it was horrible even when I was doing it. But I just\u2013 I couldn\u2019t risk anybody finding out the truth before she\u2019d come up with a plausible defense.\" said by Summer\n\"And the longer this dragged on, the more distance it created between you and Kyle.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Sighing ] Dad, it was such a disaster. Kyle was so upset that Diane was in jail, and there I was, and I had information that could have gotten her out and I didn\u2019t do that. I put Mom first. I put her ahead of Kyle\u2019s feelings. Ahead of our marriage, and\u2026 ahead of what I knew was right. But I had convinced myself that\u2013 that I didn\u2019t have a choice, that I\u2013 I had to do what I did. He won\u2019t even look at me now and I\u2013 I don\u2019t know what to do. God. [ Sobbing ] How do I fix this?\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, my god. [ Sighing ] Your mother, um\u2026 she put you in a terrible position, Summer. All right? Now, I have to believe that Kyle\u2019s eventually gonna see that. He loves you. He\u2019s gonna see what this is doing to you and how much you regret hurting him.\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2013 I\u2019d like to think that. That Kyle\u2019s just reacting right now, but\u2026 we have such a long history. And it\u2019s taken us a long time to build up this trust. And I destroyed it.\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m glad we ran into each other.\" said by Kyle\n\"Mm-hmm. So am I. I had a fabulous time and I\u2019m sure I\u2019m gonna have a great night\u2019s sleep. And I\u2019m sure you will, too.\" said by Audra\n\"No doubt.\" said by Kyle\n\"If this happens again, great. If not, I had a sensational time.\" said by Audra\n\"Agreed. Good night, Audra.\" said by Kyle\n\"Good night.\" said by Audra\n\"Hey.\" said by Jack\n\"Hey. Uh, what\u2013 what are you doing here?\" said by Kyle\n\"Oh, well, we\u2019re just headed home after a lovely evening.\" said by Jack\n\"What about you?\" said by Diane\n\"We don\u2019t mean to pry. We saw you headed upstairs earlier and, uh, assumed that you needed a room because of the situation with Summer.\" said by Jack\n\"I\u2013 I needed to get out of the way from the tension in the house.\" said by Kyle\n\"A nice hot shower to clear your head.\" said by Diane\n\"Uh, yeah. Yeah. It, um, it helped, but I realized staying away from the house isn\u2019t going to solve anything. I want to be near Harrison when he wakes up.\" said by Kyle\n\"Everyone needs to get away sometimes.\" said by Jack\n\"What would it take to rehabilitate Phyllis?\" said by Michael\n\"Can people change that much?\" said by Lauren\n\"Hmm. I did. Prison helped.\" said by Michael\n\"Yeah, but with Phyllis, she\u2019s been there, done that. I mean, even hitting rock bottom didn\u2019t exactly have an effect on her.\" said by Lauren\n\"Well, maybe that\u2019s the answer, in the end. You know, Phyllis is Phyllis. Maybe there\u2019s no saving the woman.\" said by Michael\n\"You don\u2019t believe that. And neither do I. Of course, people can evolve.\" said by Lauren\n\"People, yes. But Phyllis\u2026\" said by Michael\n\"Well\u2026 [ Lauren clicking her tongue ] \u2026If she wanted something badly enough, maybe it\u2019s just finding the right motivation.\" said by Lauren\n\"Summer, I understand why you\u2019re worried this rift between you and Kyle is permanent, but I really believe you can get through it if it\u2019s something you both want.\" said by Nick\n\"That\u2019s the thing. He\u2019s so mad at me that I\u2013 I don\u2019t think that Kyle wants to fix this. This might really be the end for us.\" said by Summer\n\"I wish I had the, uh, just the right words that would help you feel more hopeful.\" said by Nick\n\"It\u2019s okay. God, my stomach is in knots. My brain keeps telling me to fight for my family, but I just feel so lost right now.\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m sorry Phyllis put this in motion. She was asking far too much of you.\" said by Nick\n\"Right, but I could have said no. And I did. I told her that it was horrible of her to put me in this position. All because she hates Diane, I\u2013\" said by Summer\n\"And what did she say to that?\" said by Nick\n\"That I was right to resent her. That she felt awful. But she couldn\u2019t handle being locked up and I couldn\u2019t handle her going on the run. It would have been like she died all over again.\" said by Summer\n\"I wish you\u2019d come to me sooner so I could help.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, I really wish that I had too, but once I confided in Daniel and he started telling everybody, it just\u2013 it unraveled so quickly. [ Summer sighing ] I know that Mom is Stark\u2019s victim\u2026 but I cannot help but hold her responsible for this mess.\" said by Summer\n\"As well you should.\" said by Nick\n\"You know, I really wish that I could just be happy that Mom was alive. I really do. But everything with Kyle is so bad and it\u2019s just getting worse and it\u2019s all because she has this grudge against Diane. I mean, I am so stupid. I should\u2019ve never agreed to keep this secret. It\u2019s come with too high of a price.\" said by Summer\n\"Look, I know you love your mother, but there\u2019s always a trade-off with her.\u00a0 [ Nick sighing ] I mean, she is a cyclone. She mows down everything in her path.\" said by Nick\n\"Including my marriage, apparently. I\u2013 I seriously don\u2019t know if Kyle\u2019s ever gonna forgive me or if this separation is gonna turn into a divorce. [ Summer sighing ] And the worst part is after all of this\u2013 after all of this, we don\u2019t\u2013 we don\u2019t even have a way to bring Mom home without her being arrested for Stark\u2019s murder. So I just\u2013 I feel like I\u2019ve already lost them both. God. I\u2019m just scared that no matter how much I try, there\u2019s\u2013 there\u2019s really not a way for me to make this right. [ Summer sighing ]\" said by Summer\n\"I love your optimism. It\u2019s one of my favorite traits of yours.\" said by ", "answer": "Michael"}

But I promised her that I wasn\u2019t gonna let her down or leave her to fight for herself the way that my parents did to me and that is exactly what she had to do! God! Oh, my god!

Uh, seems like a lifetime ago. It was before cameron showed up.\" said by Nick\n\"Right. She was frustrated from being cooped up, okay? She was worried about you, what you were doing, so she wouldn\u2019t sleep. She was threatening to leave if she didn\u2019t get some food that wasn\u2019t room service, so I took her out.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, come on, man. You were supposed to keep her blood pressure low.\" said by Nick\n\"I know that. Don\u2019t you think that I know that? I wish to god\u2013 we were having a good time, okay? We were laughing, we were relaxed.

Wait, sally, I\u2013\" said by Nick\n\"We called you about a hundred times.\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah, I couldn\u2019t answer.\" said by Nick\n\"And what was more important than being with sally?\" said by Adam\n\"Things were getting out of control for us, man. It was life and death.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, for us too.\" said by Adam\n\"What are you talking about?\" said by Nick\n\"Nick, you don\u2019t have a damned clue about what we went through.

Our little girl is gone.\" said by Adam\n\"I guess I have my answer to how far I would go to keep you safe.\" said by Sharon\n\"Were you scared when I was gone?\" said by Faith\n\"Are you kidding? I was terrified.\" said by Sharon\n\"Because I wasn\u2019T.

Sure that you\u2019re gonna hear it from her when she\u2019s up to it.\" said by Adam\n\"So, I guess they put her on medication and it wasn\u2019t working?\" said by Nick\n\"The, um, the condition that they warned her about, the eclampsia, they just\u2013 they said that they had to induce labor. There\u2013 there was a risk, there wasn\u2019t any time and I understood the risks, but you know, the worst thing that could happen, it never happens.\" said by Adam\n\"But it did tonight.\" said by Nick\n\"There was a complication and elena said\u2013 she said I had to make a decision. She said if you had to choose only one, who would you choose? Would you choose sally or the baby?

But, I\u2019m glad you were there. Thank you.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, I didn\u2019t do it for your gratitude.

Or if she\u2019s okay, her well-being. God, yeah, I was really looking forward to getting to know that little girl. I was ready to give her the world. I would\u2019ve given my life for her and now, we\u2019re just\u2013 we\u2019re just supposed to go on. The sun still comes up, the world keeps spinning without her in it.

God, I wish I had a lifetime with you. I loved you your whole life. I know it wasn\u2019t very long, but\u2026 there was a joy and a lightness that I never had. I finally had that slice of happiness I\u2019d always seen in other people. And I wasn\u2019t alone anymore. I was never gonna be alone again. Somebody to love\u2026 and loved me.

At least, that\u2019s what they say anyway. I mean, how is a person supposed to bounce back after everything goes out of control? I mean, no matter how many prayers you say, no matter how many times that I apologize for doing something wrong, nothing changes, dad. I mean, I thought this time, it would be different. I thought, \u201cI\u2019m gonna be good.\u201d This is a chance for me to do it right. A new baby. So, I\u2019m gonna pay attention. I\u2019m gonna do things right.

Big mistake. What you do in moments like this is you turn to people who love you.\" said by Victor\n\"Who the hell would that be? I mean, I look around, I\u2013 I\u2019m alone.

It must be nice.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah.\" said by Devon\n\"Well, I have been anxiously waiting to hear how everything went with amanda. I got to say, I was very relieved that chance did not show up at the gala tonight. I did not want another awkward interaction with him. Although, uh, nina sure let me have it. She had some choice words for me, which brought back this feeling of guilt, which\u2026 I\u2019m not gonna talk about right now because I want to know how everything went after I left.\" said by Abby\n\"No, that\u2019s okay. It\u2019s \u2014 everything got out of control after you left.\" said by Devon\n\"I mean, amanda has every right to be upset, but there\u2019s got to be a way for the two of you to make peace.\" said by Abby\n\"Oh, it had nothing to do with amanda.

Got a hot tip about a car theft, but it turned out to be a dud. It\u2019s almost like somebody didn\u2019t want me to be here tonight.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here because we need some law and order after what happened.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Yeah, I\u2019ve been brought up to speed on what happened. I\u2019m gonna need statements from everybody. Now, stark, can you prove that diane wanted to harm phyllis?\" said by Chance\n\"All of the tension from the last few months, all of the verbal attacks and threats from diane towards phyllis.\" said by Jeremy\n\"What?\" said by Diane\n\"It all happened upstairs in phyllis\u2019 suite. She told me after the fact, but I believe that kyle, summer, and jack witnessed the whole thing. Isn\u2019t that right, jack? And I believe that you said something like, \u201cI should do the world a favor and strangle her to death.\u201d Did I get that right? Phyllis said diane said the exact thing to her. But don\u2019t take my word for it. Ask these two because they were there the whole time.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Is that true? Did you threaten phyllis tonight? Hi, I\u2019m karen.\" said by Chance\n\"Okay, diane, I am just trying to understand the events that led to phyllis collapsing. So, why don\u2019t you fill me in on what you know about that? Of course we can take this down to the station, make it official if you\u2019d like.\" said by Chance\n\"What exactly are you trying to imply?\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, I mean, how has phyllis\u2019 clearly being unwell turned into something that diane\u2019s under suspicion for? Some known criminal makes random accusations, and now you\u2019re suddenly questioning my mother like she\u2019s to blame? This is outrageous.\" said by Kyle\n\"Under the circumstances, the questions are necessary. Now, when phyllis fell, did she lose consciousness? Or could you tell if she was intoxicated at all?\" said by Chance\n\"Uh, chance, that didn\u2019t seem to be the case. I didn\u2019t detect any signs of alcohol.\" said by Nate\n\"But her breathing was shallow, and her heart rate was faint.\" said by Elena\n\"She was a picture of health until that moment. No complaints. Which makes this so suspicious.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Hey, I\u2019m handling this. Thank you. Diane, he is claiming that phyllis had reason to be fearful of you. So, I\u2019m gonna ask you again, and please answer the question. Did you two have a physical altercation tonight? And did you threaten her life?\" said by Chance\n\"Oh, my god. Do you really think I did something to her? That\u2019s insane.\" said by Diane\n\"Any word from daniel?\" said by Amanda\n\"Um\u2026 no, nothing.\" said by Lily\n\"Well, he apologized again for hurting me with abby. I\u2019m sure you guessed that much. And then we just \u2014 we just started talking about business, how he\u2019s dropping the lawsuit.\" said by Amanda\n\"I know. I am so relieved.\" said by Lily\n\"Be careful. I know devon may appear remorseful, like he\u2019s willing to put all tensions aside, but never forget that he was willing to take down chancellor-winters. I would not be so quick to trust him.\" said by Amanda\n\"Yeah, I know that you\u2019re still hurting, but he is my brother.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah, no, you\u2019re right. I can\u2019t forget what he did to me. I can\u2019t act like it didn\u2019t happen. But I also can\u2019t ignore how it affects his trustworthiness.\" said by Amanda\n\"I understand. But what happened between you two is not the same as what happened between us.\" said by Lily\n\"Isn\u2019t it? I mean, someone is willing to rationalize their betrayals in one situation, and\u2026\" said by Amanda\n\"Well, good thing devon doesn\u2019t play golf.\" said by Lily\n\"That\u2019s not my point.\" said by Amanda\n\"No, I know. I get your point. I do. But devon also \u2014 he loves his family. Family is very important to him, okay? It was the whole reason behind our merger. It\u2019s at the core of all of the issues that we even had.\" said by Lily\n\"And look where that led.\" said by Amanda\n\"Okay, look, I get it. But we are finally back on track. We are. And now that the lawsuit is over, maybe now we can start to rebuild our bond that we had, maybe even work together again. I mean, it\u2019s the first time i feel hope for us.\" said by Lily\n\"Oh, ashley, you know that I\u2019m not gonna take no for an answer. Look how things have gone since I\u2019ve been back.\" said by Tucker\n\"You mean when you landed your helicopter in my backyard? How did that turn out for you, by the way?\" said by Ashley\n\"Okay, but did I give up on my plans? No, I did not. I came right back with a sentimental gift from our past.\" said by Tucker\n\"Which I dumped in the trash immediately.\" said by Ashley\n\"And, again, I was undeterred.\" said by Tucker\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Ashley\n\"So, I came up with a brilliant idea for the romantic picnic in the park.\" said by Tucker\n\"In the dead of winter.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yes, but I fed you your favorite delicacies, along with some, um \u2014 you know, some flavorful intel on stark and diane.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh. Oh, you\u2019re right. That was beautifully incriminating and tied up in a nice, little bow. It was very romantic.\" said by Ashley\n\"I know. And then I offered to set you up with your own company, which I believe was quite an aphrodisiac for you because\u2026 I believe you remember what happened after that.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, I sure do. It led to me finding out that you lied to me about your true intentions regarding jabot, and I left the country.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah, that was a slight misstep, but a well-intentioned one, you have to admit. And then I gave up control of my company to you.\" said by Tucker\n\"I bought your debt for one goal only, and that was to own you completely.\" said by Ashley\n\"It\u2019s so funny. I-I actually like the sound of that. So, what do you say? Let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s make the tie that binds us a matrimonial one.\" said by Tucker\n\"You just never stop.\" said by Ashley\n\"Now, I understand why you\u2019re hesitant, so why don\u2019t we take it in stages?\" said by Tucker\n\"What does that mean, stages?\" said by Ashley\n\"Well, for now, we could just consider it a \u2014 a game, a fun ploy, no actual commitment. But publicly, we would announce the engagement.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, I think I see where you\u2019re going with this. So, you want to steal jack and diane\u2019s thunder. They would hate that so much.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah.\" said by Tucker\n\"Hmm. My a1c stayed here, it needed to be here.\" said by Ashley\n\"Alright, diane, here\u2019s what I need you to do. I need you to explain to me exactly what happened and then leave it for me to judge the veracity of stark\u2019s claim. You got it? So, once again, did you two have some sort of altercation where you threatened her life?\" said by Chance\n\"Phyllis lured me up to her room under false pretenses. She claimed that kyle was really sick and \u2014 and that he was asking for me. And supposedly he was laid out in her suite upstairs.\" said by Diane\n\"And you believed her?\" said by Chance\n\"Well, I texted kyle to verify, but he didn\u2019t respond.\" said by Diane\n\"I left my phone at the bar and didn\u2019t realize till later. That\u2019s why I missed her text.\" said by Kyle\n\"So you went up to the room?\" said by Chance\n\"Yes, of course I did. I was concerned about my son. But then phyllis followed me in there and \u2014 and trapped me.\" said by Diane\n\"And there was a physical altercation?\" said by Chance\n\"Yes, but she provoked it. She \u2014 she came at me and then she pushed me down. And then she started unleashing all these horrendous accusations. I mean, she lost it. She said that I had wronged her in every possible way and that i had ruined her life and \u2014 look, this had been building for months, and I just \u2014 I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, so I responded.\" said by Diane\n\"In what way?\" said by Chance\n\"[ Sighs ] Any negative comments that i might have made were done in the heat of the moment. I wasn\u2019t seriously threatening her.\" said by Diane\n\"Alright, during your scuffle, did she hit her head?\" said by Chance\n\"No.\" said by Diane\n\"Any kind of injury?\" said by Chance\n\"No.\" said by Diane\n\"Detective, is this really necessary? We are not the criminals here.\" said by Jack\n\"Hold on, jack. There\u2019s no need to be so defensive. I\u2019m just sorting out the facts.\" said by Chance\n\"I am hardly being defensive. I just think our focus needs to be on phyllis and how she is doing.\" said by Jack\n\"Maybe we should call the hospital and see if there\u2019s an update.\" said by Elena\n\"If there are any questions you have, I suggest you address them to stark. That is the big mystery tonight, how in a million years phyllis would marry a man like that. I\u2019d like some answers. I\u2019d like them now.\" said by Jack\n\"You think jack hides the good scotch when he knows I\u2019m gonna be around?\" said by Tucker\n\"How could he know that you were coming over? You don\u2019t even know when you\u2019re coming over. That makes no sense.\" said by Ashley\n\"Gee, lady, you got yourself a big brain.\" said by Tucker\n\"I do. Thank you. Nope.\" said by Ashley\n\"You like my idea, though, don\u2019t you?\" said by Tucker\n\"Mm, well\u2026 I \u2014 I find it intriguing.\" said by Ashley\n\"Mm-hmm. It\u2019s because you want to see the look on diane\u2019s face when she finds out the news of our impending marriage.\" said by Tucker\n\"Mm, it would be gratifying on so many levels. It would be. I\u2019ll think about it.\" said by Ashley\n\"Fair enough.\" said by Tucker\n\"But your work is far from done.\" said by Ashley\n\"Meaning?\" said by Tucker\n\"Meaning you have to get devon to buy mccall. As owner of your debt, I have a vested interest in this coming to fruition.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah. So you\u2019ve said.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yes. And I also do not want the newmans to get their dirty, little hands on it.\" said by Ashley\n\"I\u2019m working on it.\" said by Tucker\n\"Why is my relationship with phyllis so hard for you to understand, jack? We\u2019re kindred spirits, both on the outside, taking on all comers, giving as good as we get. A woman like that deserves respect and support. Seems like once upon a time you knew about that, but then you forgot.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Why aren\u2019t you at the hospital with your wife right now?\" said by Jack\n\"There\u2019s no other place I\u2019d rather be right now, but I was under the impression i was being questioned by the police.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Well, there\u2019s not an official investigation yet, so you are free to go. But I would recommend that you don\u2019t leave town.\" said by Chance\n\"Summer, what are you doing back here? How\u2019s phyllis?\" said by Kyle\n\"Is she okay? Has she already been released?\" said by Jack\n\"No, that\u2019s what we came to tell you. The ambulance never arrived at the hospital.\" said by Summer\n\"What do you mean? What are you saying?\" said by Jack\n\"Memorial dispatch lost contact with the driver. We have no idea where our mom is.\" said by Summer\n\"I thought you were following the ambulance to the hospital.\" said by Jack\n\"When we got out to my car, the ambulance was already gone. So, we went straight to the hospital.\" said by Daniel\n\"And the ambulance wasn\u2019t there. There was no sign of mom. She hadn\u2019t been admitted or anything.\" said by Summer\n\"None of this is making any sense.\" said by Kyle\n\"I know, especially since the dispatcher has no idea what happened to their vehicle.\" said by Summer\n\"Something is definitely wrong here.\" said by Kyle\n\"Dad is at the hospital in case the ambulance does show up, but we didn\u2019t feel like we could just sit there helpless.\" said by Summer\n\"I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here, but if our mom is in danger, then we need your help. Can you find out where she is?\" said by Daniel\n\"Chance, please. Something is seriously wrong. We need to know that she\u2019s okay.\" said by Summer\n\"Son, is there anything I could do to help?\" said by Danny\n\"If I could think of anything, I\u2019d say yes. But it\u2019s like summer said. We both just feel a little helpless right now.\" said by Daniel\n\"Alright, stark. What the hell is going on?\" said by Jack\n\"The whole thing is strange. One minute she\u2019s fine, then she\u2019s slurring her words, and then she\u2019s laid out on the floor.\" said by Elena\n\"Something caused a syncopal episode like that \u2014 loss of oxygen to the brain, sudden drop in a heart rate or blood pressure, something neurological.\" said by Nate\n\"You always think it\u2019s neurological, but with those symptoms, it could be anything. It could be a heart attack, dehydration.\" said by Elena\n\"Stroke, tia. Seizure, even. She hasn\u2019t had an accident or injury or a blow to the chest or head that we know of.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah, I\u2019m really interested to see her cat scan and mri results. Maybe I\u2019ll call the hospital and see if there\u2019s any updates.\" said by Elena\n\"Yeah. I\u2019m sure her family would appreciate that.\" said by Nate\n\"Interesting, isn\u2019t it?\" said by Audra\n\"What\u2019s that?\" said by Victoria\n\"The two of them \u2014 I think I can finally see the spark they share. Well, I think I\u2019m going to call it a night. Looks like my boss has his hands full.\" said by Audra\n\"I will see you tomorrow morning at the office.

And it was lucky that nate and elena were there to help out until the paramedics got there.\" said by Devon\n\"Wait. Did phyllis make this big scene before or after my uncle jack\u2019s engagement announcement?\" said by Abby\n\"I don\u2019t know. I think it happened at the same time.\" said by Devon\n\"How do you not know?\" said by Abby\n\"Because I wasn\u2019t there for jack\u2019s announcement. I was still talking to amanda.\" said by Devon\n\"Uh-huh. Well, how did your conversation with amanda go?\" said by Abby\n\"We kept it civil for the most part, even though she has every reason to resent me.\" said by Devon\n\"To resent both of us.\" said by Abby\n\"Mostly just talked about business and lily and i figuring things out.\" said by Devon\n\"How did she feel about you dropping the suit against chancellor-winters?\" said by Abby\n\"Oh, she was skeptical about that because she doesn\u2019t really trust me these days for some reason.\" said by ", "answer": "Devon"}

I know you\u2019ve moved on from fashion as a career, but can you really resist making our baby the fashion model of the year?\" said by Adam\n\"I\u2019m embarrassed to say I hadn\u2019t even thought of that.\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2019m surprised.\" said by Adam\n\"Right?\" said by Sally\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Adam\n\"But now that you mention it, I mean, how can I resist? Our baby can\u2019t wear clothes off the rack, right?\" said by Sally\n\"No! Never.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, it\u2019s a newman family reunion. Should have called. I would\u2019ve got the potato salad and the picnic basket ready.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, I don\u2019t know about dad, but I\u2019m definitely not here to see you.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, well maybe you\u2019re here to dangle some fresh new company in front of me, only to yank it away again just for fun.\" said by Adam\n\"Surprised to see you here, son. Especially with that lady.\" said by Victor\n\"Adam and I just ran into each other.\" said by Sally\n\"That\u2019s right. I, uh, I insinuated myself into sally\u2019s private tea time. You know how pushy I can be and she was too nice to ask me to leave, but I will not keep her any longer. She\u2019s all yours.\" said by Adam\n\"Hey, we\u2019re both going to have to be understanding of summer\u2019s feelings. How could we not? She\u2019s lost her mother. Grief has colored every part of her life. She\u2019s looking for answers. She wants to blame someone. And diane is her mother\u2019s greatest enemy. But the truth will come out. We\u2019re gonna see to it, right?\" said by Jack\n\"Absolutely, we are.\" said by Kyle\n\"And when it does, summer will see that diane is innocent, just as clearly as we do.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. Well, I\u2019m relieved to hear your faith and mom hasn\u2019t wavered. It\u2019s just you and me, dad. No one else believes in her. Now, all we have to do is convince the world.\" said by Kyle\n\"No. What we have to do is figure out what kind of case the gcpd is building against her. What possible evidence could be so damning against diane? I know they came here. I know they searched the house. What could they have found?\" said by Jack\n\"Well, I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s something that links the poison in phyllis\u2019s system to mom. Whatever it is, it was planted.\" said by Kyle\n\"You\u2019re right. You\u2019re right. Stark found some way to get manufactured evidence into this house.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, how could he even get in here with all the security?\" said by Kyle\n\"I don\u2019t know. He did it somehow.\" said by Jack\n\"Okay. Well, however he did it, there is no doubt in my mind that he\u2019s framing mom.\" said by Kyle\n\"Oh, clearly this is payback for how diane and I framed him for that jewelry heist with the newmans. God. He got exactly what he wanted. All of our lives are turned upside down. This is my fault. Diane would not be in this position if it weren\u2019t for me.\" said by Jack\n\"I can\u2019t imagine how painful it is being here.\" said by Chance\n\"It\u2019s just like the memorial service. Coming here is a part of my penance.\" said by Summer\n\"Penance? Summer, none of this is your fault. You don\u2019t have to do penance for anything. I hope you know that.\" said by Chance\n\"No, I do. I treated my mom so badly at the end. I know that diane\u2019s been arrested, but until she is convicted and sentenced, I owe my mom an enormous debt. I just\u2026 I don\u2019t know why I didn\u2019t trust her. I should have believed her and\u2026 that\u2019s a mistake that I\u2019m gonna regret for the rest of my life.\" said by Summer\n\"Give yourself a break, okay? Take some time to grieve. You\u2019re being really hard on yourself.\" said by Chance\n\"I am grieving. Coming here, it\u2019s not just a penance. It also brings me some comfort, you know? This is forever gonna be the last place I saw my mom alive.\" said by Summer\n\"Listen, I have a plan. I will say that I came up with this entire scheme. That it was all me. I\u2019ll keep your name out of it completely.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Who\u2019s going to believe that? How could you possibly explain it all? Huh? The hijacked ambulance, the poison, the dead body doubles. What possible reason would you give for marrying me when you knew you were gonna fake your own deaths supposedly without me even knowing about it? No. There\u2019s too many holes. It won\u2019t work.\" said by Jeremy\n\"No. I\u2019ll come up with plausible answers for every single thing. Trust me.\" said by Phyllis\n\"There\u2019s no way I wouldn\u2019t be implicated. So no, we are moving on with our plan whether you like it or not.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Look at you. You think you\u2019re scaring me, don\u2019t you? You\u2019re nothing compared to the terrifying thought of my children needing me and I\u2019m not there for them? My strength as a mother is fiercer than anything you got.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Dad, I refuse to let you take any of the blame for what mom is going through. Stark has been out for revenge since the day he showed up. He had a plan even before the burglary in chicago. He was determined to make mom pay for rejecting him and helping put him away.\" said by Kyle\n\"Of course, I know you\u2019re right, but I have to take some responsibility for underestimating stark. I thought by just standing up to him, freezing him out, he would be neutralized. That not giving him that power in our lives, he would ultimately just give up and go away. Wow, was I wrong.\" said by Jack\n\"Hey, stark has gotten lucky.\" said by Kyle\n\"No, he has been one step ahead the whole way. I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong about any of this. And now\u2026 and now phyllis has paid for her life by mistakes I made.\" said by Jack\n\"Hey, hey. Who could have known how deranged that man is? That he would go as far as to murder phyllis to punish mom. That\u2019s how little he values life.\" said by Kyle\n\"I appreciate you defending me, but I\u2013 I deserve some of this guilt I am carrying. I\u2026 god, I handled this whole thing so badly. And moving forward, we can\u2019t do that. We can\u2019t make any mistakes. We know now, this man is a murderer and if he has that little value for human life, believe me, there\u2019s no stopping him from killing again.\" said by Jack\n\"My children are suffering. They\u2019re tortured. You didn\u2019t hear the pain in their voice. Oh. I was wrong. I was wrong to do this. My children don\u2019t hate me.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Okay.\" said by Jeremy\n\"No. Shh.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Okay. But you\u2019re out of it now, okay? So deal with it. They made it very clear how they felt about you before your divorce.\" said by Jeremy\n\"I know, but\u2013 but they regret it. Seriously. Please, please just listen. They are tortured. They are tormented right now losing their mom like this.\" said by Phyllis\n\"You are blowing this way out of proportion.\" said by Jeremy\n\"I want you to see this from my angle, where I\u2019m coming from, please.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Okay. I really don\u2019t care where you\u2019re coming from. I only care about where you\u2019re going. Away.\" said by Jeremy\n\"No!\" said by Phyllis\n\"Okay.\" said by Jeremy\n\"I\u2019m not going away!\" said by Phyllis\n\"We had a deal and I held up my end of the deal. Okay? This is exactly what you signed up for. What the hell did you think was gonna happen?\" said by Jeremy\n\"I didn\u2019t know my children were going to suffer.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Oh, they\u2019ll get over it.\" said by Jeremy\n\"No, they won\u2019t get over it.\" said by Phyllis\n\"You wanted a part in taking diane down. Okay, you got it. We pulled it off. Plus you got to see her escorted away in cuffs. That had to be some sort of a satisfaction, huh? Justice served.\" said by Jeremy\n\"At what cost, huh? At what cost? Because what my kids are going through right now, it\u2019s not worth it.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Okay. You\u2019ll get over it.\" said by Jeremy\n\"I did an impulsive thing and I regret it.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Okay. You\u2019ll get over it.\" said by Jeremy\n\"I\u2019m not gonna get over it! Because everyday, I\u2019m gonna look in the mirror and all I\u2019m going to see is diane jenkins. This is what she did. And she let her son suffer for years and years thinking that she was dead. I cannot do that. I can\u2019t go through another minute of this knowing how my children feel. I cannot do it.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Okay, just shut up and think. The only reason your kids softened towards you is because they think you are dead. Now, once you become alive again and they realize that you deliberately put \u2019em through this hell, trust me, it\u2019s not gonna be sunshine and roses. And on top of that, there\u2019s gonna be some serious consequences.\" said by Jeremy\n\"What are you talking about?\" said by Phyllis\n\"You\u2019ll be facing charges too. And what kind of a happy reunion will it be with you behind bars, okay? That could be you in the prison cell instead of diane. Poor ol\u2019 diane, the living martyr. You\u2019re gonna be the locked up criminal. Hm? Are you gonna let her get away with that, huh? Are you gonna let her win?\" said by Jeremy\n\"Actually, if you will excuse me. I should be going.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, I showed up at the right time. I\u2019ll drive you to the athletic club then.\" said by Nick\n\"Sure you don\u2019t wanna stay and order something?\" said by Sally\n\"No, I\u2019m good.\" said by Nick\n\"All right. Then, uh, good night.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah. Thanks again for, um\u2026 thanks.\" said by Adam\n\"That was quite a display, son.\" said by Victor\n\"Mm-hmm. What\u2019s that?\" said by Adam\n\"You know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. You and your brother fawning over that woman.\" said by Victor\n\"Okay. Well, I can\u2019t speak for nick, but I hope you have a good night.\" said by Adam\n\"Son.\" said by Victor\n\"Enjoy your coffee.\" said by Adam\n\"I\u2019m talking to you. Don\u2019t walk away from your father, okay?\" said by Victor\n\"You\u2019re right, dad. We have to be on high alert where stark is concerned. We have no idea what he\u2019s capable of.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019m gonna call security. Have them double up. I don\u2019t want that man anywhere near this house, especially with harrison here.\" said by Jack\n\"Agreed. But one way or the other, we have to prove he\u2019s behind what happened to phyllis. How do we even do that?\" said by Kyle\n\"Carefully. Very carefully. Especially now that we know he\u2019s not above murder.\" said by Jack\n\"I\u2019m gonna go check on mom at the police station, see if she needs anything. Hopefully, the initial shock has worn off and maybe she\u2019ll have some fresh ideas as to how stark managed to pull this off.\" said by Kyle\n\"Give her my love. Tell her I\u2019ll be there shortly to update her on the whole lawyer situation. I have calls out to every major law firm in chicago, milwaukee, minneapolis. I\u2019m not gonna give up \u2019til I find the right lawyer. We have to find her the right lawyer.\" said by Jack\n\"What are you doing all alone here tonight? I can\u2019t imagine that you\u2019re still working.\" said by Summer\n\"Actually, I am. I like to take in the crime scene while I think. That helps me kinda paint a picture of what happened. Can\u2019t get that sitting at a desk.\" said by Chance\n\"Have you come up with anything?\" said by Summer\n\"No, not yet. I\u2019m just taking notes.\" said by Chance\n\"Would it help you if I reenacted it? I mean, when my mom collapsed, I\u2013 I\u2013 I remember every single second of it. I keep replaying it in my head. The whole night, really, from the time that I\u2013 I criticized her at the bar \u2019til when she crumpled here on the floor. I just\u2013\" said by Summer\n\"Summer\u2013\" said by Chance\n\"No, seriously. It\u2019s fine. I promise you. It\u2019s all I think about anyway.\" said by Summer\n\"Let me call somebody for you, okay? Maybe your dad or kyle, maybe your brother.\" said by Chance\n\"No, there\u2019s no need. Daniel\u2019s grieving and kyle\u2019s convinced that his mom is innocent and my dad just hates seeing me in pain. He just wants to give me a shoulder to cry on, but that\u2019s not what I need right now. There\u2019s only one thing that\u2019s gonna make me feel better.\" said by Summer\n\"What\u2019s that?\" said by Chance\n\"Knowing that my mom\u2019s true killer will be punished.\" said by Summer\n\"You can see that there\u2019s no way back, right? Only forward. You made your bed, now you have to live with it.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Oh, okay. You\u2019re right. I have to stick with the plan. I have to stick with the plan. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll lose everything. Oh, my god. Yeah.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Good. I was hoping you were gonna say that. Because the alternative\u2026\" said by Jeremy\n\"You made it clear what the alternative is.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Look, there\u2019s nothing bad with starting over. Just picture this. A secluded beach on a remote island where the water is bluer than the sky, the wave splashing against the shore, sipping our tropical drinks while we watch the sunset.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Sipping our drinks?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Oh, I\u2026 I didn\u2019t mention that? Change of plans. I\u2019m coming with you. When you have chronic kidney disease.\" said by Jeremy\n\"The young and the restless will continue. This isn\u2019t charmin! No wonder I don\u2019t feel as clean. Besides, I wouldn\u2019t want you to be all lonely out there. I think I need to be right by your side, so you won\u2019t be running home anytime soon. I\u2019ll be right there to remind remind you that there\u2019s no turning back now.\" said by Announcer\n\"Is that good news?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yep. And the timing couldn\u2019t be better. It\u2019s an old colleague of mine. He\u2019s helping me with my offshore accounts. I\u2019ve arranged to send half of your money to the island.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Wait a second. Wait. You\u2019re\u2013 you\u2019re sending half of my money to your offshore account? I mean, why would you do something like that? You\u2019re just implicating yourself. Diane hasn\u2019t even been found guilty.\" said by Phyllis\n\"[ Scoffs ] Look, diane is still in jail. There\u2019s no one that\u2019s gonna be tracking me.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Yeah, but if you disappear, it makes you culpable and then the police are on your tail, and then that brings you to me and this all blows up in our face.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Hm. Maybe you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll stay here until she\u2019s convicted and then when it\u2019s safe, I\u2019ll come join you.\" said by Jeremy\n\"You\u2019ll join me.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Oh, yeah. We make a great team. There\u2019s no reason to break things up when we have endless possibilities.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Please have a seat, son.\" said by Victor\n\"All right. I\u2019m listening. What more is there to be said between us, dad?\" said by Adam\n\"I really am sorry you feel that way.\" said by Victor\n\"I\u2019m just\u2013 I\u2019m not sure that this conversation is necessary.\" said by Adam\n\"I hope you will take my advice in the spirit in which it is given.\" said by Victor\n\"Go on.\" said by Adam\n\"I think you\u2019re making a terrible mistake.\" said by Victor\n\"You\u2019re gonna need to be a little more specific.\" said by Adam\n\"I\u2019m talking about sally spectra.\" said by ", "answer": "Victor"}
{"content": "\"Did you just ask me to \u2014\" said by Diane\n\"I asked you to marry me. Yes, I did. I want to spend the rest of my life with you.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, I-I-I think you got caught up in the moment. This \u2014 this can\u2019t be real.\" said by Diane\n\"No, it\u2019s as real as it gets.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack. [ Sighs ]\" said by Diane\n\"Even if it was a spontaneous impulse, it is no less sincere. This feels right to me. This feels inevitable. Diane, it\u2019s as simple as this. I love you. You love me. We belong together.\" said by Jack\n\"I think it\u2019s more complicated than that.\" said by Diane\n\"No, it doesn\u2019t have to be. Wait. Wait. Don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t say anything. Don\u2019t give me your official answer yet. You \u2014 you sit tight. Don\u2019t go anywhere.\" said by Jack\n\"What, you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re leaving?\" said by Diane\n\"I will be back as soon as I can.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Exhales sharply ]\" said by Diane\n\"I\u2019m in your room. What happened?\" said by Phyllis\n\"You don\u2019t remember?\" said by Jeremy\n\"Oh, god.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Drowning your sorrows.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Then I walked out of the hotel.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Well, I tweaked my back a little when I picked you up off the street, but no one else was hurt.\" said by Jeremy\n\"You picked me up off the street?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yeah, I watched you stumble out of the hotel lobby. I had a bad feeling, so i decided to keep an eye on you.\" said by Jeremy\n\"You\u2019re a good samaritan.\" said by Phyllis\n\"I saved your life. You walked into traffic, cars were swerving, and then you just passed out right in the middle of the street.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Oh, my god.\" said by Phyllis\n\"You didn\u2019t bang your head or get hit or anything, maybe some bumps and bruises, but all of that alcohol \u2014 whew \u2014 you were pretty out of it.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Then you brought me here. Why?\" said by Phyllis\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Adam\n\"Look, you shouldn\u2019t feel the need to check in.\" said by Sally\n\"I will take care of everything sally needs until the baby arrives.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Sighs ] Look, I-I get that you\u2019re together, and I know that you\u2019re gonna be around. I\u2019m not fighting that. And I will try to resist the urge to spontaneously check in. But, um, I would really like to come to some of your doctor\u2019s appointments or ultrasounds.\" said by Adam\n\"Um, yeah. I\u2019ll think about it.\" said by Sally\n\"[ Sniffles, sighs ]\" said by Adam\n\"Look at that. Twice in one day.\" said by Nick\n\"Imagine that.\" said by Adam\n\"You expecting someone?\" said by Nick\n\"Uh, nope. All alone. And you?\" said by Adam\n\"I just ordered some food for takeout. Won\u2019t be ready for a little bit.\" said by Nick\n\"Ah.\" said by Adam\n\"I\u2019m gonna sit.\" said by Nick\n\"Okay. Uh, so, what\u2019s on your mind? Or do I know already?\" said by Adam\n\"We haven\u2019t had a chance to talk, you know, just the two of us, since sally\u2019s big news.\" said by Nick\n\"Thank you.\" said by Summer\n\"Summer.\" said by Sally\n\"Hey.\" said by Summer\n\"Hi. Dessert for the family?\" said by Sally\n\"Uh, it\u2019s actually a breakfast treat for harrison.\" said by Summer\n\"Does he have a sweet tooth in the morning?\" said by Sally\n\"[ Chuckles ] Are you really that interested in my son\u2019s food preferences?\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2026 excuse me?\" said by Sally\n\"I mean, I-I think you\u2019re just attempting to be polite, but, sally, we really \u2014 we don\u2019t have to do all that.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay. Fine.\" said by Sally\n\"I mean, if you want to talk, I\u2019d much rather talk about what\u2019s going on with you and my dad.\" said by Summer\n\"[ Clears throat ] Uh, what is it exactly that you want to know?\" said by Sally\n\"I mean, he hasn\u2019t really talked to me about you much lately, so I figured either things have gone south or they\u2019re getting more serious and he hasn\u2019t wanted to get into a debate with me about it.\" said by Summer\n\"[ Chuckles ] Um\u2026yeah, there is actually something that you should know. It\u2019s probably best to hear it from me. I am pregnant. For copd, ask your doctor about breztri.\" said by Sally\n\"Nephew.\" said by Billy\n\"Uncle.\" said by Kyle\n\"Hey, what\u2019s going on? What are you doing here?\" said by Billy\n\"Just left a meeting with a couple of vendors. And you?\" said by Kyle\n\"You know, contemplating life\u2019s mysteries. Hey, I tried to get ahold of your dad, but I couldn\u2019t reach him. Is he, uh \u2014 is he still at the office, or did he head home already?\" said by Billy\n\"Neither. He\u2019s out of town.\" said by Kyle\n\"Emergency business meeting or what?\" said by Billy\n\"Emergency, no. Business, no he and my mother decided to have a last-minute getaway.\" said by Kyle\n\"Ooh, la la. Romantic getaway, huh?\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah. They\u2019ve been growing a lot closer lately. Mom even moved in.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah. Uh, jack filled me in. He seems really excited about the way things are going.\" said by Billy\n\"Mm.\" said by Kyle\n\"Kind of crazy, right, how they\u2019d find each other after all those years? I told him I couldn\u2019t be happier for him.\" said by Billy\n\"I\u2019m sure he appreciate that.\" said by Kyle\n\"You actually sounded sincere there.\" said by Billy\n\"I am. Not everyone is thrilled. Ashley is \u2014\" said by Kyle\n\"Oh, she is livid.\" said by Billy\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Kyle\n\"Or so I hear. What about you? How are you feeling about your parents reuniting?\" said by Billy\n\"My contact with allie was never about deception. It was about reaching out. Trying to give you back something that you didn\u2019t even know you\u2019d lost.\" said by Diane\n\"I hope you don\u2019t expect her to thank you.\" said by Jack\n\"But what about you? I know you\u2019re grateful.\" said by Diane\n\"Oh, is that what you want? A thank-you? Thank you, diane. Are we done here?\" said by Jack\n\"I\u2019m trying to make amends.\" said by Diane\n\"To me. Not to the people you hurt. The people you used and exploited. The people accused of your murder. All you left in your wake was heartache and fear and anger. Some of us got over it. Others? Like kyle? You stole from him something he can never get back. Your tore that little boy\u2019s heart out. And for that, I will never forgive you.\" said by Jack\n\"Back in la, I hid my past. I was living a lie. I \u2014 I couldn\u2019t get close to anybody because of it. And here in genoa city, I am dodging grenades, but I have to earn my conversations and my companionship. I have to face the damage that I\u2019ve done, head on.\" said by Diane\n\"That is your mission.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. It\u2019s going to take a while. But being here with you today and talking about kyle and harrison and being open about my past, it\u2026\" said by Diane\n\"I guess I just didn\u2019t realize how, uh \u2014 how hard it would be to redeem myself, how long this battle would take.\" said by Diane\n\"I can see this has been tough on you. My advice? Take the clean slate kyle and i have offered you. Let that fortify you from here on.\" said by Jack\n\"Thank you. It means a lot. I appreciate you so much. You have the least reasons of anyone to make me feel worthy, believed, safe. And yet you do.\" said by Diane\n\"What can I do to convince you that there is nothing to this?\" said by Diane\n\"I\u2019m not sure you can. This has been eye-opening for me. I\u2019ve been giving you the benefit of the doubt for a long time now, but if I\u2019m honest with myself, I still have trouble trusting you, and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s ever going to change.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Diane\n\"I was there for you, phyllis, helping you in your moment of need.\" said by Jeremy\n\"[ Exhales sharply ] You brought me up here because you\u2019re still trying to devise a plan against diane and you\u2019re scheming and you want me to be a part of it. So you figure I will because you picked me up off the ground.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Off the street. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s security footage of the whole thing. But I got there quick enough so you weren\u2019t hurt. And it may look like you just tripped. It was handled discreetly. But imagine if there\u2019s a video that shows you being wasted, wandering into traffic, passed out. Oh, how the mighty have fallen. A danger to herself and to others. Poor, poor phyllis.\" said by Jeremy\n\"People already think that about me, so you don\u2019t have much leverage.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Well, this incident could have been so much worse if I hadn\u2019t been there.\" said by Jeremy\n\"You\u2019re trying to threaten me and coerce me into doing what you want. I won\u2019t have that. My moderate to severe plaque psoriasis\u2026\" said by Phyllis\n\"You\u2019re in a tough spot, adam. I sympathize with you. I really do.\" said by Nick\n\"Um, thank you?\" said by Adam\n\"My concern is how you handle things from here on out.\" said by Nick\n\"And I assume by \u201chandle things,\u201d you mean between the three of us, you, sally, me. I mean, four if you include our baby.\" said by Adam\n\"Mainly with sally.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, look, I-I hear her loud and clear when she says this baby doesn\u2019t change anything between us, okay? I\u2019m gonna be a father to my child, but I\u2019m not looking to interfere with what you and she have. Does that cover the bases to your satisfaction?\" said by Adam\n\"Sounds like we\u2019re on the same page, which makes me happy. I\u2019m not at all worried about my relationship with sally. We are solid. My concern is for her well-being.\" said by Nick\n\"I \u2014 I can\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t believe this. You\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re pregnant with my little brother or sister?\" said by Summer\n\"Uh, no. I\u2019m not pregnant with nick\u2019s child.\" said by Sally\n\"Oh, my god. Thank god. I mean, you\u2019re not that far along, though. What does that mean? That you slept with some other guy behind his back?\" said by Summer\n\"No, no. It\u2019s not like that.\" said by Sally\n\"What\u2019s it like, sally?\" said by Summer\n\"Okay. There was one other person, one time, a while ago, and it was about two people saying goodbye. Nick and I discussed it immediately, and he understood.\" said by Sally\n\"So, adam. He\u2019s the \u2014 wow. Of course. Who else would it be?\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah. No, you\u2019re right. It\u2019s adam\u2019s baby. But your father is very supportive.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah. He\u2019s a good guy, but you must have really hurt him.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah, he was disappointed.\" said by Sally\n\"Okay, so obviously, it\u2019s best for everybody if you and my dad just go your separate ways so that you and adam have time to figure all of this out before your due date.\" said by Summer\n\"[ Chuckles ] Yeah, that\u2019s not happening. Look, I have zero desire to re-ignite anything with adam, baby or no baby. We are co-parents, and that\u2019s all. You know, in regards to your father and me, yeah, we\u2019ve talked about what this means for us, and obviously it\u2019s an ongoing conversation, but we want to stay together. Look, nick is in this with me, and he\u2019s everything that I could want in a partner.\" said by Sally\n\"Of course he is, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you \u2014\" said by Summer\n\"That I what? That I deserve him? Is that what you are gonna say?\" said by Sally\n\"Something like that.\" said by Summer\n\"You know, I\u2019m really grateful that nick and I have something so special that we both still want to make it work. So, hopefully, after you have time to think all of this through, you can accept that.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah. I-I think I\u2019m gonna need some time to think about all of this. No, wait. Actually, I\u2019ve thought about it, and, sally, you could not be more selfish.\" said by Summer\n\"That man better not even contemplate hurting my son.\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, I saw how bad this sounds. Don\u2019t worry. We will handle this together.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, damn right we will.\" said by Kyle\n\"And I will do everything necessary to protect your mother.\" said by Jack\n\"After dina died, I was closer to kyle and my sisters and billy and abby and the whole abbott family. But now it turns out the teardrop of love may not have only brought me family love. It may have brought me a beautiful, captivating, gorgeous woman. Maybe the gem just needed a little time to do its magic. My celebrity colorist?\" said by Jack\n\"Why do you care what i think about my mom and dad being together?\" said by Kyle\n\"Because you\u2019re family. We\u2019re not exactly close because you\u2019re a pain in the neck. But I\u2019m on your side and I do care about what you think. I hope you know that.\" said by Billy\n\"So, all the sudden, you\u2019re going to be the understanding uncle?\" said by Kyle\n\"[ Chuckles ] Your dad said you\u2019re on the fence, but he believes eventually you\u2019ll come back around. Is he right about that?\" said by Billy\n\"Time will tell.\" said by Kyle\n\"Look, kyle, it\u2019s understandable you\u2019d have mixed feelings about all this.\" said by Billy\n\"I want my parents to be happy. If they can do that together, I\u2019m all for it. It\u2019d be cool for them to have a stable relationship after all these years.\" said by Kyle\n\"But you\u2019re worried that someone\u2019s gonna get hurt.\" said by Billy\n\"I\u2019d hate to see that happen. And given their history\u2026.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah. I hear you there.\" said by Billy\n\"Look, if I\u2019m telling the truth, I\u2019m more worried about my mom hurting my dad than the other way around. I know she\u2019s worked so hard to turn her life around. She\u2019s trying to be a better person, and I love that. And I don\u2019t doubt her feelings towards him.\" said by Kyle\n\"But it\u2019s impossible to forget what\u2019s happened in the past, the way she just up and left you as a kid. You know, I haven\u2019t been through what you have, but I can relate on some level.\" said by Billy\n\"How so?\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, my mom, jill, wasn\u2019t exactly a doting maternal presence in my life when I was young. In fact, she still isn\u2019T. You know, I think I broke the family record for being the youngest kid sent off to boarding school.\" said by Billy\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Kyle\n\"She just wasn\u2019t interested in being a mother. And I resented that for a long time. But on the flip side, I had an amazing dad. You know, even when we would butt heads \u2014 and we did \u2014 I always knew that he was there for me, no matter what.\" said by Billy\n\"Like my dad.\" said by Kyle\n\"Naturally you feel protective of the parent that was a constant in your life. And your instincts are telling you to protect yourself, as well. Look, no matter how good things are right now, you\u2019re already half-prepared for being disappointed all over again. But I believe that people can become the person that you want them to be, that you hoped they\u2019d be. And \u2014 and I hope that diane does that for you. I hope she can prove that history doesn\u2019t have to repeat itself\u2026and you get the family that you always wanted.\" said by Billy\n\"Hello?\" said by Jack\n\"Jack.\" said by Diane\n\"Oh, good. You\u2019re still here.\" said by Jack\n\"As if I\u2019d have gone anywhere. Uh, where \u2014 where \u2014 where did you go?\" said by Diane\n\"Madame\u2026\" said by Jack\n\"Thank you.\" said by Diane\n\"I\u2019d like to propose a toast. To the new life you have created for yourself, to the incredible changes you\u2019ve brought to mine.\" said by Jack\n\"Mm.\" said by Diane\n\"When I think of our future together, believe me, it is spectacular.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Sighs ] Well, I like the sound of that. Cheers.\" said by Diane\n\"Cheers.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah.\" said by Diane\n\"Okay. May I?\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah.\" said by Diane\n\"I want to get this right.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Chuckles ] Oh, jack.\" said by Diane\n\"Diane jenkins, would you do me the honor of becoming my wife?\" said by Jack\n\"[ Exhales sharply ]\" said by Diane\n\"Will you make me, at long last, the happiest, the luckiest man in the world?\" said by Jack\n\"[ Exhaling sharply ]\" said by Diane\n\"I assume you need this. I have aspirin, too.\" said by Jeremy\n\"I don\u2019t want aspirin. Thank you. I\u2019m good. I will take care of myself.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Tough. Self-sufficient. I admire that. But I suggest you examine what led to your incident tonight.\" said by Jeremy\n\"I\u2019m getting a lecture from a felon?\" said by Phyllis\n\"[ Laughs ] Well, from what I\u2019ve seen, your whole world is falling apart, whether you want to admit it or not. And I bet it\u2019s tearing you up. I know what happens when you let things like that fester inside. I spent six long years in prison, and for the first couple, I was consumed with bitterness. Then one day I had a realization which gave me a sense of calm.\" said by Jeremy\n\"I know you want to tell me about it, so go on.\" said by Phyllis\n\"I decided I wasn\u2019t gonna let those burning feelings eat me alive anymore. I was gonna use them as fuel for a plan aimed at one specific target \u2014 the person that ruined my life. And I believe that approach could work wonders for you, as well, especially since the target of your anger is the same as mine \u2014 diane jenkins. We can bring her down, phyllis. With purpose comes serenity. Ubrelvy helps u fight migraine attacks.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Jack, you are by far the most loving, romantic, incredible man I\u2019ve ever known. And I \u2014 I do love you so much. I\u2026 my entire life is changed because of the second chance you\u2019ve given me. And I am so grateful.\" said by Diane\n\"I get that you\u2019re upset, okay? I can hardly blame you. It is a lot to take in.\" said by Sally\n\"No kidding.\" said by Summer\n\"Look, nick and I have been very open with each other since the very beginning, okay? We share our feelings. We don\u2019t keep secrets from each other. And, no, we have no idea what the future holds. But as of right now, we want to stay together and keep building our relationship. So, if nick wants to be with me, that\u2019s his decision to make, and I hope you can respect that.\" said by Sally\n\"[ Scoffs ] My dad is extremely protective of the people that he\u2019s close with. So of course his natural instinct is to stick by you, whether or not it\u2019s good for him.\" said by Summer\n\"Nick is happy with me. We\u2019re happy.\" said by ", "answer": "Sally"}
{"content": "\"Thank you.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Oh, thanks, but we\u2019re not on A\u2026\" said by Chelsea\n\"I\u2019m not sure what makes this table the most romantic table. I mean, I\u2019ve sat at every table here. There\u2019s, I mean, nothing special about this table. I think she\u2019s just trying to ingratiate herself, right? And she can expect a big tip from me for doing so.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah, but that was weird, right?\" said by Chelsea\n\"What part of it?\" said by Billy\n\"Well, she totally misinterpreted why we\u2019re here.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Yeah, she did.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah. She \u2014 she thought we were on a date.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Yeah.\" said by Billy\n\"But we\u2019re not on a \u2014 wait, do you think this is a date?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Hey, sally, it\u2019s me.

No, I think you\u2019re just trying to distract me from that awkward moment earlier.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Why, because she thinks we\u2019re on a date?\" said by Billy\n\"Well, you didn\u2019t answer my question.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Here\u2019s the thing. When I\u2019m on a date with someone, they know it\u2019s a date. I can be that charming.\" said by Billy\n\"Oh, really?\" said by Chelsea\n\"I said i can be.\" said by Billy\n\"[ Laughs ] Well, I am sorry I jumped to conclusions.\" said by Chelsea\n\"[ Chuckles ] You\u2019re forgiven.\" said by Billy\n\"I mean, all joking aside, it\u2019s, I\u2019m sure, way too soon for you to be dating. You just broke up with lily.\" said by Chelsea\n\"You\u2019re probably right about that.\" said by Billy\n\"And that\u2019s certainly the case with me, you know, especially after everything I\u2019ve been through the past few months.\" said by Chelsea\n\"That\u2019d be a tricky first-date conversation.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Look, just to ease your mind \u2014 okay? \u2014 This is nothing more than two friends just checking in on each other, okay? We\u2019ll enjoy some food. We\u2019ll talk about whatever we want, nothing more. That is my promise to you.\" said by Billy\n\"I like the sound of that.\" said by Chelsea\n\"And just to drive the point home, at the end the night, we\u2019ll split the check.\" said by Billy\n\"[ Laughs ] That\u2019s fair.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Flowers, candles, champagne. And why are you wearing a tux?\" said by Diane\n\"Well, I got out of the shower and I went to the closet and I saw this hanging there. And I thought, \u201cboy, I haven\u2019t worn a tuxedo in a long time.\u201d And I look good in a tuxedo.\" said by Jack\n\"Yes, you certainly do. But, jack, I was just here. How did you pull this together so quickly?\" said by Diane\n\"Oh, I had a little help.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh. Kyle and summer?\" said by Diane\n\"Actually, mrs. Martinez.\" said by Jack\n\"Ah. Ah. Well, I\u2019ll be sure and thank her the next time I see her. You know, this is amazing, but I\u2019m half-expecting the rest of the abbotts to come waltzing through at any minute, and i doubt they\u2019ll be as smitten with your efforts as I am.\" said by Diane\n\"Kyle and summer have taken harrison to the movies. Allie is out with friends. Traci is on a plane on her way to new york to see her publisher. We are alone in this house. You can relax.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, that\u2019s good to know. I know a lot of people are probably thinking the worst of this relationship. They might even think that I was pursuing you all along. But come on. Look at you.\" said by Diane\n\"How could you not?\" said by Jack\n\"Mm. [ Chuckles ]\" said by Diane\n\"To hell with the naysayers. To us.\" said by Jack\n\"To us.\" said by Diane\n\"Come on. Talk to me.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Sally\n\"Tell me what\u2019s going on.\" said by Nick\n\"Can we just write it off as hormones? My mind, my body, they\u2019re just \u2014 they\u2019re just overwhelmed. And \u2014 I don\u2019t know. Everything\u2019s in full-on baby mode right now.\" said by Sally\n\"It seems like there\u2019s more to it than that.\" said by Nick\n\"I don\u2019t know. The whole blood pressure problem got me thinking about so many things that can go wrong bringing a child into this world. That\u2019s not even taking into account when the child\u2019s actually here and having to take care of it and having to raise it. I mean, this is just\u2026 this is just my first moment of true and genuine fear. And it definitely won\u2019t be the last. I mean, the child\u2019s not even gonna be here for months, and I\u2019m already a mess? How the hell am I gonna be a mom? I used to pre-rinse dishes cause my old detergent\" said by Sally\n\"Here you go.\" said by Victoria\n\"[ Sniffs ] Wow. Whew. It smells so smooth, it probably drinks itself.\" said by Nate\n\"25-year-old single malt. I told you, it\u2019s the good stuff.\" said by Victoria\n\"Mmm.\" said by Nate\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Victoria\n\"Must be some box we\u2019re stepping out of.\" said by Nate\n\"I just thought that it would be nice to step away from the 9:00-to-5:00 corporate structure.\" said by Victoria\n\"I thought you thrived in that environment.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, normally i do, but I learned from my father that sometimes it\u2019s good to mix things up, to escape, to brainstorm, to generate ideas, especially when you have your sights set on a target that might be just a little bit unorthodox.\" said by Victoria\n\"You have to think like the target. That makes sense. Mmm. Another one of these, and i might generate all the ideas.\" said by Nate\n\"Ah, see? I think it\u2019s working.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay, so, what is our target?\" said by Nate\n\"I want to scoop up omega sphere, and I want to take down mccall unlimited.\" said by Victoria\n\"You want to go after tucker mccall? I\u2019ll drink to that.\" said by Nate\n\"That\u2019s right.\" said by Victoria\n\"Look, this is completely normal, okay? You\u2019re supposed to have fears about becoming a parent.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, but you\u2019re not supposed to be overwhelmed by them.\" said by Sally\n\"Of course you are. Everybody goes through it.\" said by Nate\n\"Even you?\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, even me. Seriously, I was worried sick with every kid. Now, it did get easier, but it\u2019s still very scary.\" said by Nick\n\"But you\u2019re a natural. I\u2019ve seen you with your kids. You\u2019ve got, like, a dozen world\u2019s best dad mugs.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, if everybody says it, it must be true.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Laughs ]\" said by Sally\n\"Look, I got those mugs ironically. Before noah was born, I wasn\u2019t ready for that. I was a mess, like you are, too, but you\u2019re gonna get through it. I promise. You know, part of the problem is the buildup. Nine months seems like it\u2019s forever. But trust me \u2014 it goes by so fast. And then the baby gets here, and everything changes.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, then it gets really scary.\" said by Sally\n\"No, no, no. That\u2019s the crazy part. When your baby\u2019s born and you see it and you get to hold it, it\u2019s just \u2014 everything makes sense. Right now, everything is like the unknown for you, but I\u2019m telling you, when they hand that baby to you, you can\u2019t imagine loving something that much. The fear goes away, and everything becomes clear to you.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Sniffles ] So, that\u2019s what it was like? It was like this magical transformation the second that noah was born?\" said by Sally\n\"I mean, of course there are some bumps and mistakes along the way. I got to be a dad. You know, my life went in a completely different direction. It was natural. It\u2019s going to be that way for you, too.\" said by Nick\n\"Look, I can believe that you became this outstanding father that you were always meant to be fairly easily. It\u2019s just different for me.\" said by Sally\n\"How so?\" said by Nick\n\"When you were growing up, you had a loving mother and father around. Even if they weren\u2019t always together, you knew that they loved you, right?\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, of course.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Inhales sharply ] I never had that. I \u2014 I learned that people let each other down very young.\" said by Sally\n\"[ Smooches ]\" said by Nick\n\"[ Gasps ]\" said by Sally\n\"Ooh [Clicks tongue] I think I\u2019m gonna do the clams and the muscles.\" said by Billy\n\"Sounds delicious.\" said by Chelsea\n\"You know what? I\u2019m definitely not. I\u2019m definitely gonna do the crab enchiladas. I can\u2019t say no to those.\" said by Billy\n\"[ Sighs heavily ]\" said by Chelsea\n\"What\u2019s on your mind?\" said by Billy\n\"It\u2019s nothing.\" said by Chelsea\n\"No, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s something because you\u2019ve been here a thousand times. You know everything that\u2019s on that menu, and yet you\u2019ve been staring at it for 10 minutes.\" said by Billy\n\"[ Whispering ] Our server.\" said by Chelsea\n\"[ Whispering ] What about her?\" said by Billy\n\"She thinks we\u2019re on a date.\" said by Chelsea\n\"[ Chuckles ] I think she made an innocent mistake.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah, but what if she knows who we are?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Yeah, maybe she does. I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t see the problem.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, she\u2019s gonna say something to abby, like, \u201cI saw your uncle billy with chelsea lawson on a date.\u201d And then it creates a whole rigamarole, and then your family gets involved. I mean, is that what we want?\" said by Chelsea\n\"No, no, we definitely do not want my family asking any questions about what\u2019s going on between us. Excuse me?\" said by Billy\n\"What are you doing?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Damage control.\" said by Billy\n\"Everything is fantastic. We are just about to order, but, um, something that\u2019s a little bit more important for you to know \u2014 um, this is not a date.\" said by Billy\n\"How long have you been planning this?\" said by Diane\n\"Uh, I was gonna do something special on new year\u2019s eve, but we kind of had other things to deal with.\" said by Jack\n\"Yes, I am glad that\u2019s all behind us.\" said by Diane\n\"You know what? I\u2019m glad I waited.\" said by Jack\n\"Why is that?\" said by Diane\n\"Because I\u2019m even more enamored with you than I was just weeks ago.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Diane\n\"If you haven\u2019t noticed, I\u2019m kind of taken with you.\" said by Jack\n\"Mm. Likewise. And you don\u2019t even need this tux to impress me, although I do appreciate the effort. You know, this is, uh \u2014 this is incredible. A year ago, I would have never imagined that this was happening. I didn\u2019t even know if I could return to my old life here. But for the two of us to have found each other again, it takes my breath away. I mean, nobody could have predicted this.\" said by Diane\n\"There I have to disagree with you. As unexpected, as unpredictable as this moment was, I \u2014 I think it\u2019s been in the cards for a long time.\" said by Jack\n\"What do you mean?\" said by Diane\n\"Finding you again may just be the fulfillment of a prophecy, all brought about by my mother.\" said by Jack\n\"I love it. This is bold. This is the kind of move devon would have quashed at chancellor-winters. Too risky.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, I told you, we do things differently here.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yes. I love it. Alright, look, let\u2019s jump right in. First things first, we need to lure daniel and his project to newman media.\" said by Nate\n\"That\u2019s right. We need to give him something that chancellor-winters can\u2019T. What is that?\" said by Victoria\n\"The full power and magnitude of newman enterprises. We have deeper pockets.\" said by Nate\n\"Yes. Well, the money angle is good, but it might take a little more to convince daniel.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, I can let daniel know that chancellor-winters will micromanage and second-guess him constantly.\" said by Nate\n\"You\u2019re right.\" said by Victoria\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Nate\n\"He\u2019s an artist. He won\u2019t have any control over his baby over there.\" said by Victoria\n\"They will be breathing down his neck every step of the way.\" said by Nate\n\"Why don\u2019t we make that a part of the agreement? Give him autonomy. Put that in writing.\" said by Victoria\n\"They\u2019d never give it to him.\" said by Nate\n\"We\u2019re starting to look pretty good in comparison, don\u2019t you think?\" said by Victoria\n\"And I know how they typically structure their deals. We\u2019ll just have to make sure we\u2019re better at it.\" said by Nate\n\"Wow. You really were wasted over there, weren\u2019t you? They had no idea what they had at chancellor-winters.\" said by Victoria\n\"And you haven\u2019t heard about my secret weapon yet.\" said by Nate\n\"I want to help you. I\u2019m just not sure how.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, you brought snacks. That\u2019s pretty good.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah.\" said by Nick\n\"Although I cannot believe you brought me caramel corn.\" said by Sally\n\"I can take that home with me.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, don\u2019t you dare. Look, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m really sorry that I dumped all this on you.\" said by Sally\n\"That is not the way this works, sally. We\u2019re in this together. You\u2019re not dumping anything on me. You\u2019re sharing, and I want you to continue to do that, alright?\" said by Nick\n\"It\u2019s just hard for me to lean on anyone.\" said by Sally\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Adam\n\"I know you don\u2019t wanna look too far into the future, but all we have to do is get you through your next doctor\u2019s appointment. Everything gets a lot less scary.\" said by Nick\n\"Maybe.\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2019m here for all of it, from picking out furniture for the nursery to buying all the \u201cI\u2019m having a baby\u201d books. I\u2019m here, okay?\" said by Nick\n\"And snacks. Can you be in charge of snacks?\" said by Sally\n\"Well, obviously.\" said by Nick\n\"That sounds amazing.\" said by Sally\n\"It will be.\" said by Nick\n\"You know, besides all of, like, the soccer and the santa claus and all the other kid stuff\u2026 where does that leave us? Where do we stand?\" said by Sally\n\"I don\u2019t have an answer, uh, for you regarding that. I think it\u2019s too soon for us to make a decision about our future. But as far as being a parent, I\u2019m solid, okay? That I am certain of. Hey. What\u2019s wrong?\" said by Nate\n\"[ Sniffles ]\" said by Sally\n\"What\u2019s wrong? I thought I was doing a pretty decent job making you feel better. What\u2019s bothering you now?\" said by Nick\n\"[ Inhales sharply ] If your moderate to severe crohn\u2019s disease\" said by Sally\n\"Everything was great. Thank you.\" said by Billy\n\"It was delicious.\" said by Chelsea\n\"O-okay.\" said by Billy\n\"You know, I can\u2019t tell whether she\u2019s charmed by you or annoyed by you.\" said by Chelsea\n\"It\u2019s definitely one or the other, but that\u2019s the way it goes with me. It\u2019s a love and hate thing, not a lot in between.\" said by Billy\n\"And why do you think that is?\" said by Chelsea\n\"I\u2019m a lot.\" said by Billy\n\"You are a lot.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Yeah. [ Chuckles ] Yeah. See, but that\u2019s why this could not be a date \u2014 because I would never actually admit that to someone that I was on a date with.\" said by Billy\n\"That\u2019s a very good point. Well, I wasn\u2019t so concerned whether we thought it was a date. It was more, would your family think this is a date?\" said by Chloe\n\"I think my family is a little, uh, busy right now. Apparently, jack and diane are back together.\" said by Billy\n\"Huh. Well, you don\u2019t seem too troubled about that.\" said by Chelsea\n\"I believe in giving someone a second chance.\" said by Billy\n\"Sometimes a third chance.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Whatever it takes.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, I\u2019m grateful for it.\" said by Chelsea\n\"I know what you\u2019re thinking \u2014 dessert.\" said by Billy\n\"[ Gasps ] I was thinking about dessert. How did you know?\" said by Chelsea\n\"It\u2019s a talent. I can usually tell when someone\u2019s thinking dessert. I\u2019m usually right. Who doesn\u2019t love dessert?\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah. Thank you for this. Dinner with you is exactly what I needed.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Sorry I wasn\u2019t here when your mother died. She was an amazing woman. But I still don\u2019t see how dina predicted that you and I would reunite after years of everyone thinking I was dead.\" said by Diane\n\"My mother didn\u2019t exactly predict it. Her jewelry did.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Laughs ] What in the world are you talking about? Wait a second. How much champagne have you had?\" said by Diane\n\"[ Laughs ] Hear me out.\" said by Jack\n\"Okay.\" said by Diane\n\"Years ago, when they first met, my father bought my mother an antique emerald necklace. It was beautiful, had lots of history, even had a name \u2014 the teardrop of love.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Diane\n\"I have pictures of dina upstairs, a very young dina wearing it proudly. Anyway, when they split up, my mother traveled all over the world, and in her travels, somehow that necklace got lost. So, just before she died, I was able to track it down.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m sure she appreciated that.\" said by Diane\n\"Oh, boy, did she. It was quite a reunion. And when she died, each of us got a little piece of the necklace. My section\u2026\" said by Jack\n\"Ah.\" said by Diane\n\"\u2026Got me these cufflinks.\" said by Jack\n\"Nice. And that\u2019s a lovely story, but i still don\u2019t see how it predicted that we would get back together.\" said by Diane\n\"There was a legend attached to the necklace. It held that whoever wore the necklace, whoever was around the gem, found love.\" said by Jack\n\"I see.\" said by Diane\n\"Over time, I realized that if the legend is true, it might just be about family love. After diana died, I was closer to kyle and my sisters and billy and abby and the whole abbott family.\" said by Jack\n\"Hmm.\" said by Diane\n\"But now it turns out the teardrop of love may not have only brought me family love. It may have brought me a beautiful, captivating, gorgeous woman. Maybe the gem just needed a little time to do its magic. That kiss was brought to you by my lucky cufflinks.\" said by ", "answer": "Jack"}

You haven\u2019t been down here zoning out since I left, have you?\" said by Chloe\n\"I\u2019m not sure, actually. You know, it was a big night. Champagne was poured, and I-i think I just lost track of time.\" said by Billy\n\"Hey, look at me. Something\u2019s wrong. What happened? Billy, talk to me.\" said by Chloe\n\"Don\u2019t tell me to be quiet.\" said by Daniel\n\"Keep your volume down.

It\u2019s too late and too early to accomplish anything. And even if, there is nothing you or any of us can do right now.\" said by Danny\n\"Oh, sure there is. I can go back downstairs and I can beat some answers out of my new stepdad.\" said by Daniel\n\"Beating stark to a pulp isn\u2019t going to accomplish anything. You know that, daniel.\" said by Danny\n\"There\u2019s gotta be something that we can do. There\u2019s gotta be some reason this happened. Someone is responsible for this, and if I could find them, then maybe I could just \u2014\" said by Daniel\n\"What? What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? You gonna hurt \u2019em? Destroy their lives and yours? It\u2019s not gonna bring your mother back. Phyllis is gone, and we have to accept it.\" said by Danny\n\"No. No, I don\u2019T.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yes, yes.\" said by Danny\n\"No, I can\u2019t accept that! Mom never gave up on us. You know, she loved us in her own overbearing way. But if this had happened to me or this happened to someone or anybody else that she cared about, she\u2019d be storming the police station. She\u2019d be storming the hospitals. She\u2019d be kicking butt and taking names, demanding to know everything that they know, hiring private detectives. She wouldn\u2019t be sleeping at all, that\u2019s for damn sure. And I-I just feel like there\u2019s nothing that I can do for her.\" said by Daniel\n\"We all feel powerless right now. It\u2019s only natural.\" said by Danny\n\"No. You know what hurts the most? Is I can\u2019t blame mom\u2019s death on anyone else. She\u2019s dead because of me.\" said by Daniel\n\"It was an accident.\" said by Nate\n\"I can\u2019t help feeling like we let phyllis down somehow.

And then I keep wondering if we knew that emt driver that she died with.\" said by Elena\n\"Yeah. Make sure they\u2019re taking up a collection for his family at memorial.\" said by Nate\n\"But the real question is, why did she need an ambulance in the first place? Why did this seemingly-healthy woman pass out out of the blue? I think we owe it to phyllis to find some answers.\" said by Elena\n\"Anything I can get for you?\" said by Jack\n\"Answers?\" said by Diane\n\"Yeah, I\u2019d like a few dozen of those myself. How does this happen? Doesn\u2019t make sense. How could phyllis be gone?\" said by Jack\n\"I mean, I was just \u2014 it was supposed to be such a memorable night.\" said by Diane\n\"Oh, it will be, for all the wrong reasons.\" said by Jack\n\"I can\u2019t shake the feeling that the announcement about our engagement had something to do with it.\" said by Diane\n\"Glad you\u2019re awake.\" said by Ashley\n\"This isn\u2019t the right time for a fight, ashley. We\u2019re all aware of your low opinion about our engagement, so any insults you\u2019re going to hurl at me, just save it, \u2019cause I am not in the mood.

At all. Do you?\" said by Billy\n\"No.\" said by Chloe\n\"Good, because that was a promising kiss.\" said by Billy\n\"Yes, it was.\" said by Chloe\n\"Well, I\u2019m glad to hear you say that, because that was the highlight of my night. Actually, that was the best part of my last month.\" said by Billy\n\"[ Laughs ]\" said by Chloe\n\"I\u2019m looking forward to do that again, to make sure that it was as incredible as I remember it.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, that\u2019s a possibility. Ok, so it\u2019s not about the kiss?\" said by Chloe\n\"No, it\u2019s got nothing to do with you, chelsea.\" said by Billy\n\"When I was standing in front of the mirror, tying my tie before the gala, I wondered how the night would end. This is not how I envisioned it.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah, I don\u2019t think anyone had this in mind.\" said by Elena\n\"And then [Clears throat] Standing in the lounge dedicated to neil, I was watching you from across the room. I couldn\u2019t hear what you were saying, but watching you laugh, as beautiful as you are in that dress, all night, all I could picture was coming back home, and, uh\u2026\" said by Nate\n\"I was watching you, too.\" said by Elena\n\"I did not catch you.\" said by Nate\n\"I\u2019m smoother than you are.\" said by Elena\n\"And what were you thinking?\" said by Nate\n\"Same as you.\" said by Elena\n\"Why, dr. Dawson, am I being seduced?\" said by Nate\n\"Well, if you have to ask, maybe I\u2019m doing it wrong.\" said by Elena\n\"I miss you.\" said by Nate\n\"I miss you, too. Maybe when we get back home, we can finish the night how we planned to, but for now, we need to find some answers for phyllis.\" said by Elena\n\"This late at night?\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, I have faith in us.\" said by Elena\n\"You are not responsible at all for your mother\u2019s death. You hear me?\" said by Danny\n\"You weren\u2019t here the past few months. You didn\u2019t see the way that I treated her. Yeah, she didn\u2019t mean any harm. What did I do? I blamed her for everything. Pushed her out of my life. My god, the time that I wasted. I could have been with her, and maybe then\u2026\" said by Daniel\n\"What else could you have done?\" said by Danny\n\"I don\u2019t know, dad. Seen the signs? I mean, told her I loved her. Told her how much she meant to me. Instead, I just \u2014 I turned my back on her.\" said by Daniel\n\"Don\u2019t do this. You\u2019re gonna drive yourself crazy.\" said by Danny\n\"You know, when I lost heather and lucy, all mom wanted to do was help me. All she wanted to do was make sure that everything was alright with me. And you know what I did? I told her to stay the hell out of my life.\" said by Daniel\n\"Daniel, the last thing your mother would ever want is for you to be doing this to yourself.\" said by Danny\n\"We were supposed to have time, you know, to forgive and forget, brush things under the rug. Even at the gala, you told me to get past things with mom. And what did I say? \u201cNot tonight.\u201d And now, not ever.\" said by Daniel\n\"You\u2019ve got to hang on to the good memories. Yes.\" said by Danny\n\"[ Sighs ] You know what I\u2019m gonna remember? I\u2019m gonna remember that I was the one who called her out in front of the whole town. That I broke her heart. I\u2019m gonna remember how she looked at me and how hurt she was. That\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna remember. That\u2019s what\u2019s gonna play over and over and over again in my head for the rest of my life.\" said by Daniel\n\"I think there\u2019s been enough conflict for one night.\" said by Ashley\n\"Then you heard.\" said by Jack\n\"Yes, from kyle and summer. Frankly, I\u2019m heartbroken. Phyllis had me convinced that she was indestructible.\" said by Ashley\n\"Hey.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, kyle. I\u2019d ask how summer is doing, but\u2026\" said by Diane\n\"How can we help her?\" said by Jack\n\"I wish I knew.\" said by Kyle\n\"I think, you know, just give her space and then be there for her when she does reach out, right?\" said by Ashley\n\"She\u2019s just sitting by her son\u2019s bed, watching him sleep, barely even speaking. Anyway, how\u2019s daniel doing?\" said by Kyle\n\"He really went off on stark. Who could blame him? Going on about his marriage to phyllis, waving a marriage certificate in everyone\u2019s face?\" said by Jack\n\"It kind of makes you think, doesn\u2019t it? When a person marries someone who is universally despised \u2014 kind of like pouring salt on the wound of people that really care. (Wheezing)\" said by Ashley\n\"Mom must have felt so betrayed by her own kids, like we stabbed her in the back. You know, she needed us and she spent her whole life just trying to make sure that we were happy. How could we let this happen? It\u2019s not supposed to end like this.\" said by Daniel\n\"It\u2019s gonna take some time, daniel. You have been through a lot tonight, you really have. And I will do whatever you need me to do, but tomorrow. Right now. You\u2019re gonna get some rest.\" said by Danny\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Daniel\n\"Ok? Yeah, no, you do.\" said by Danny\n\"I can\u2019T. Not now.\" said by Daniel\n\"Punishing yourself isn\u2019t gonna bring your mother back. I know you want answers. We all do. But there\u2019s nothing we can accomplish tonight. Absolutely nothing.\" said by Danny\n\"Speak for yourself.\" said by Daniel\n\"Alright. If you can\u2019t sleep, then go to the gym, do a workout, take a shower, do whatever you got to do to get out of this downward spiral. And then we will pick up right where we left off tomorrow. Ok? Tomorrow.\" said by Danny\n\"[ Sighs ] Yeah. Ok. Ok. And I \u2014 I\u2019m sorry.\" said by Daniel\n\"For what? Driving your old man crazy?\" said by Danny\n\"For acting like I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s suffering.\" said by Daniel\n\"Hey. We have to support each other. Tomorrow, you can be strong for me.\" said by Danny\n\"Yeah.\" said by Daniel\n\"Ok.\" said by Danny\n\"I think I am gonna go take that shower.\" said by Daniel\n\"Ok.\" said by Danny\n\"Might actually help me sleep.\" said by Daniel\n\"Good. You go for it. Come here. I love you.\" said by Daniel\n\"I love you, too. The hell are we gonna do without her?\" said by Daniel\n\"Hello?\" said by Lily\n\"Lily, hi. Um, it\u2019s, uh \u2014 it\u2019s danny.\" said by Danny\n\"Danny, I am so sorry about phyllis. I \u2014 I don\u2019t even know what to say.\" said by Lily\n\"I-I mean, how is everyone holding up? How \u2014 how is daniel?\" said by Lily\n\"That\u2019s the thing.\" said by Danny\n\"I-I was gonna call, but I just assumed that he was with summer, trying to work through all of this.\" said by Lily\n\"He\u2019s um \u2014 he\u2019s not with his sister.\" said by Daniel\n\"What\u2019s going on?\" said by Lily\n\"Daniel\u2019s in a really \u2014 a really dark place right now.\" said by Danny\n\"For you to equate our relationship with whatever criminal or immoral activity the two of them were involved in \u2014\" said by Diane\n\"Now is not the time to be speaking ill of the dead, diane. Especially when her grieving daughter is right upstairs. Let\u2019s just put our differences aside, ok?\" said by Ashley\n\"Thank you. It still doesn\u2019t feel real.\" said by Kyle\n\"If there\u2019s anything I can do at all, please let me know.\" said by Ashley\n\"I know. Thank you.\" said by Kyle\n\"I mean it. Morning, noon or night, ok?\" said by Ashley\n\"Well, I\u2019m glad ashley decided to back off. She was only making things worse.\" said by Diane\n\"Thank you, all of you, for setting aside your differences while we try to handle this crisis.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yes, of course.\" said by Jack\n\"And just know that your dad and I will do whatever we \u2014\" said by Diane\n\"Hey, summer. I thought you were trying to rest.\" said by Kyle\n\"That was the plan.\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, I \u2014 I can\u2019t imagine what a difficult time this is for you.\" said by Diane\n\"No. You can\u2019T.\" said by Summer\n\"You don\u2019t have to worry about a thing. I promise you, we will get to the bottom of all of this.\" said by Jack\n\"Yes. We\u2019re sure that jeremy is involved, and we\u2019ll find the connection. And I \u2014 I am just so sorry that your mother paid the price.\" said by Diane\n\"You\u2019re sorry? You caused this. All of this. I used to pre-rinse dishes cause my old detergent\" said by Summer\n\"Billy, I am so sorry. H-how is this even possible?\" said by Chloe\n\"I don\u2019t honestly know. You know, I\u2019m not even sure how to feel about it. I mean, it\u2019s awful, you know, and it\u2019S\u2026 it\u2019s shocking.\" said by Billy\n\"Of course, but I mean, this is \u2014 this is someone you used to love.\" said by Chloe\n\"Yeah. You know, that was a long time ago. And, you know, things did not end very well between us.\" said by Billy\n\"But at one point in time, she meant everything to you.\" said by Chloe\n\"You know, I made a lot of mistakes. And I\u2019m not saying that I regret us breaking up. You know, our relationship ran its course, but, you know, things happened, and I wasn\u2019t much more than a piece of gum on the bottom of her shoe for a long time, but we were able to work at that and we got to a decent place. How does \u2014 how does that even happen?\" said by Billy\n\"Time. Forgiveness. Sometimes a lot of forgetting.\" said by Chloe\n\"Yeah. You know, she started working at the hotel, running the hotel, and moving in different circles and all those positive things that we built during our relationship, it all faded away. You know, phyllis has the ability to drive anyone to dabble in their worst habits.\" said by Billy\n\"She was definitely a handful.\" said by Chloe\n\"Yeah, we brought out the worst in each other. Her being gone, it just \u2014 it feels wrong.\" said by Billy\n\"You don\u2019t have to babysit me all night, dad. I\u2019m completely capable of taking care of myself. Lily.\" said by Daniel\n\"Your dad let me in. I hope it\u2019s ok that I\u2019m here.\" said by Lily\n\"Summer. Whatever plan jeremy had come up with, I promise you, I had nothing to do with it. I was as shocked and horrified by what happened tonight as anyone and \u2014 and what a horrible way for you to find out that your mother had married him.\" said by Diane\n\"I don\u2019t care about jeremy stark right now. This is about you, diane.\" said by Summer\n\"W-we\u2019re just wondering how you imagine diane is involved in\u2013\" said by Jack\n\"Imagine? Jack, I don\u2019t need an imagination. We were all there. We were witnesses. You said to my mom that you would be doing the world a favor if you strangled her to death.\" said by Summer\n\"Those were words spoken in the heat of the moment, but you have to understand that \u2014\" said by Diane\n\"I do.\" said by Summer\n\"I \u2014 I know that you\u2019re hurting, but I mean this from the bottom of my heart \u2014 I had nothing to do \u2014\" said by Diane\n\"[ Laughs ] Your heart? Oh, my gosh. Your infamous boundless heart.\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, what happened tonight was an accident.\" said by Jack\n\"Is there a word for an accident that some people don\u2019t regret? Some random, unfortunate event that actually benefits certain people?\" said by Summer\n\"Maybe we should go upstairs and try to get \u2014\" said by Kyle\n\"No! Nothing is gonna change by the morning. You have no right to talk about my mom! You didn\u2019t like her! We all knew that! You resented her because she knew exactly who you are. And as long as she was alive, you would have no real place here. You know what? My mom was real. She was more honest and true than you could ever hope to be. And you couldn\u2019t be her, so you had to destroy her.\" said by Summer\n\"Don\u2019t do this.\" said by Jack\n\"No! I didn\u2019t speak up before, but I am going to now. My mom was right. I mean, we all see it. We all see it, don\u2019t you? I mean, you really are the monster that she was warning us about. You did every single thing that she said that you did. You came in and you took over her life. You\u2019re standing there clutching your pearls, saying that you\u2019re going to find the real culprit.\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m sorry, mom. She doesn\u2019t mean it.\" said by Kyle\n\"She means every damn word! Kyle, this is me being honest for the first time in a very long time. Why don\u2019t you try it, diane? Tell the truth. My mom\u2019s dead. It\u2019s what you wanted all along, isn\u2019t it? \u2013 Bedtime!! \u2013 Bedtime.\" said by Summer\n\"I just wish I had some answers, especially for her children.\" said by Elena\n\"When someone so young and full of life dies, it\u2019s only natural to want to learn something from it.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s certainly given me perspective.\" said by Elena\n\"What\u2019s your take away?\" said by Nate\n\"Just to make sure the people in my life know how much they mean to me. It was also nice working with you again. We make a great team.\" said by Elena\n\"It was fun, stretching those old muscles again.\" said by Nate\n\"To think, it could be like this every day.\" said by Elena\n\"Listen, we will always be a team. Being a doctor will always be in my blood. But it\u2019s a part of my past now. As you know, my life is moving in new directions, and I know it\u2019s hard for you to accept, but I need you to respect it.\" said by Nate\n\"Daniel, I\u2019m so sorry.\" said by Lily\n\"Don\u2019t tell me my dad called you.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah, I think he just thought maybe I could help. I don\u2019t really know how, but I\u2019m here.\" said by Lily\n\"No, I\u2019m glad. Really, I am. I think I could probably use the company and maybe having someone who\u2019s not going through the same emotional minefield I am will do me some good.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah. Do you want anything? You want me to get something from room service for you or?\" said by Lily\n\"No. No. No.\" said by Daniel\n\"Can\u2019t eat or drink? I\u2019ve been there.\" said by Lily\n\"You\u2019re familiar with this territory?\" said by Daniel\n\"Unfortunately, I am.\" said by Lily\n\"What was it like for you, losing neil?\" said by Daniel\n\"Um\u2026 it felt like the end of the world, you know, because it\u2019s this person who has been there since the beginning. They\u2019ve been there for every story in your life, you know. They were there on your first day of school, the first time you fell down and hurt yourself. Your first love, your first heartbreak. And then they\u2019re gone.\" said by Lily\n\"Without warning.\" said by Daniel\n\"And I think that\u2019s the hardest part, is just the the suddenness of it, because, you know, there was so much that I wanted to still do with my dad. And I was angry, too, you know, really angry because it\u2019s like, what is this world where someone who surrounds you with their love is just gone?\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah.\" said by Daniel\n\"And I feel like it makes you divide your life into segments. You know, like there\u2019s before my dad died, and \u2014 and now, you know. And I still pick up the phone sometimes to call him.\" said by Lily\n\"What about when your mom died?\" said by Daniel\n\"Well\u2026 they, um\u2026 they never found her body, so that\u2019s, like, a whole other trauma that I don\u2019t let myself think about.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah. Probably played head games with yourself. Told yourself that it was a mistake. She was still out there somewhere, needing your help.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah. Because it\u2019s like, how could someone who is so much larger than life, you know, just be gone? But you have to let go.\" said by Lily\n\"[ Crying ] Well\u2026 [ Laughs ] That\u2019s gonna be a problem. Yeah, it\u2019s a family trait, you know. Don\u2019t let go of anything very easily.\" said by Daniel\n\"I know. You know, I heard this saying that I think is so true. And it\u2019s like, \u201cgrief is love with nowhere to go.\u201d And I know that\u2019s how you feel because I know you had so much that you wanted to say to her and experience with her.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah, it just feels like it\u2019s gonna hurt forever.\" said by Daniel\n\"It will hurt forever. It will. But I promise you, it\u2019ll get better. You just have to take it day by day. Or in this case, hour by hour.\" said by Lily\n\"Well, even that sounds too hard.\" said by Daniel\n\"But, daniel, just know that you have people who love you and want to support you, ok?\" said by Lily\n\"The words that you \u2014\" said by Summer\n\"They were just words, summer. They were completely regrettable.\" said by Diane\n\"So it\u2019s just dumb luck that my mom died and made your wish come true?\" said by Summer\n\"No, that\u2019s not what diane is saying.\" said by Jack\n\"No, diane \u2014 I want to hear it from her. I want to hear it from her. Tell me. Tell me how you felt when you heard that my mom was dead.\" said by Summer\n\"Maybe we should go upstairs and make sure harrison is still \u2014\" said by Kyle\n\"No! My mom called your mom a threat, and now she is gone!\" said by Summer\n\"Just let me take care of you, ok? Harrison needs you, and so do I. Everything else can wait. Let\u2019s go talk. Ok? Please. Ok.\" said by Kyle\n\"I just miss her so much. I didn\u2019t know I could miss her so much\u2026 and this is for the rest of my life. I \u2014 I can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019T.\" said by Summer\n\"[ Sighs ] Hey, hey. Come on. Come on.\" said by Kyle\n\"[ Clicks tongue ] Poor girl.\" said by Diane\n\"Summer needs someone to blame for her life being turned upside down.T remeer this tomorrow.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, well, maybe summer is too upset to be thinking clearly, but what about you, jack?\" said by Diane\n\"What do you mean? What about me?\" said by Jack\n\"Do you think I\u2019m responsible for what happened to phyllis?

For what?\" said by Chloe\n\"Being a lousy date. You know, I might have looked like a million bucks and rocked it on the dance floor, but now we\u2019re sitting here talking about a friend that just passed away. And it\u2019s not how I thought the night was gonna end.\" said by Billy\n\"Why don\u2019t you come upstairs? To sleep.\" said by Chloe\n\"Well, that\u2019s the strangest offer I\u2019ve ever gotten. And I\u2019m gonna take you up on it.\" said by ", "answer": "Billy"}

Like korean barbecue tacos or like \u2014\" said by Audra\n\"Like country rock.\" said by Nate\n\"You like country?\" said by Audra\n\"Are you kidding me? How could you not? It\u2019s got everything \u2014 heart, soul, relatable stories. What I\u2019m saying is, unexpected combinations can change people\u2019s perspectives.

Give the people a taste of the unexpected, something they might think they don\u2019t like but make it more appealing. If we rely on algorithms, we\u2019re just giving people what they\u2019re used to. We need to open their minds to new ideas.\" said by Nate\n\"How do you suppose we do that?\" said by Audra\n\"Ooh, that\u2019s the fun part. We blow it all up.\" said by Nate\n\"[ Knocks on door ] I hope I\u2019m not interrupting.\" said by Victoria\n\"No, we were just going over our content-development strategies.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, I\u2019d like to steal you for a minute.\" said by Victoria\n\"Sure, no problem.

Wouldn\u2019t be, right.\" said by Tucker\n\"Why not?\" said by Ashley\n\"\u2018Cause you\u2019re not coming at this and I\u2019m not coming at this as equals. You see?\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh.\" said by Ashley\n\"You\u2019ve got the upper hand here.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh. Because I own your debt? And other parts of you. I\u2019m talking about your heart.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah.\" said by Tucker\n\"Or so you\u2019ve told me.\" said by Ashley\n\"See, there\u2019s an imbalance.\" said by Tucker\n\"Mm.\" said by Ashley\n\"And where there is inequality, there\u2019s no true understanding.\" said by Tucker\n\"I see.\" said by Ashley\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Tucker\n\"So this show of self-restraint is because I\u2019m calling the shots. Are you really that intimidated by me? Really?\" said by Ashley\n\"Hey. I just got off the phone with christine, and she just said that chancellor-winters filed its response to my lawsuit.\" said by Devon\n\"Uh, yeah, that\u2019s what you wanted.\" said by Lily\n\"And it was submitted by amanda sinclair.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah, she\u2019s taking on the case.\" said by Lily\n\"So you hired my ex, who hates me, to try and keep hamilton-winters out of my hands?\" said by Devon\n\"Well, I mean, she\u2019s familiar with your inability to commit, and you know about her winning record, so, uh, yeah, she\u2019s eager to take it on.\" said by Lily\n\"[ Scoffs ] So this is what you\u2019ve resorted to? You\u2019re using my personal life against me. One prilosec otc each morning blocks\" said by Devon\n\"Devon, amanda handled our merger. She knows the intricacies and loopholes better than anyone.\" said by Lily\n\"Oh, so you\u2019re going to sit there and act like this isn\u2019t a personal attack on me?\" said by Devon\n\"It\u2019s not a personal attack on you. It\u2019s a business decision.\" said by Lily\n\"Keep telling yourself that.\" said by Devon\n\"Sorry, just because you cheated on her does not mean that we\u2019re not going to use her when she\u2019s the best person for the job.\" said by Lily\n\"Really?

Now you care?\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah.\" said by Devon\n\"You didn\u2019t care about her sick mother when you were cheating on her.\" said by Lily\n\"Okay, so you\u2019re going to go that low. Are you proud of yourself for what you\u2019re doing?\" said by Devon\n\"I\u2019m sorry. Do you think this lawsuit takes you to higher ground? You\u2019re suing us to take back control of your company, so why shouldn\u2019t I do the same? Or, you know, to paraphrase what you said, I\u2019m trying to stop you from tearing down everything that I\u2019ve built and what I\u2019ve achieved with chancellor-winters. So you wanted a war? This is it.\" said by Lily\n\"Thank you.\" said by Audra\n\"Hey, can I get an espresso to go?\" said by Elena\n\"Elena, hi.\" said by Audra\n\"Audra, hey. So how are you settling in at newman?\" said by Elena\n\"Oh, everything\u2019s great. Except for the coffee. Where would I be without crimson lights?\" said by Audra\n\"Best in town.\" said by Elena\n\"Mm. Maybe I should grab a cup of coffee for nate before I go. You know, that man works so hard. Always thinking. So many game-changing ideas.\" said by Audra\n\"Nate\u2019s very ambitious.\" said by Elena\n\"Yep. Probably the same dynamic as when he was a surgeon, right? Everyone\u2019s dying for his approval or to hear his ideas or pick his brain about new projects. I can already tell I\u2019m going to learn so much working under him.\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah, nate\u2019s always been the kind of person who\u2019s great at everything.\" said by Elena\n\"Yeah, you know, it\u2019s refreshing to work with someone who knows what he wants and how to command that from the people around him.\" said by Audra\n\"Sounds like you really enjoy working with nate.\" said by Elena\n\"Mm, absolutely. You know, we\u2019ve got an easy rapport. He\u2019s really nurturing, but exacting, too. And he can be quite the taskmaster, but he makes it fun. He\u2019s a good partner.\" said by Audra\n\"I always thought so.\" said by Elena\n\"But all work dynamics are different, you know? As close as nate and I are, it doesn\u2019t compare to his connection with victoria.\" said by Audra\n\"If you take a look at these numbers and then you plug in the projection over the next few quarters, you\u2019ll see how everything in this sector is on the rise.\" said by Victoria\n\"It looks promising.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah, I think that everything is right on track. We just need to tweak a few things, and then we should see some improvements in the next few\u2026\" said by Victoria\n\"No. No, no, you\u2019re good.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah, just play around with this data a little bit and see how it works for you.\" said by Victoria\n\"I will do.\" said by Nate\n\"And, you know, if you apply this to all the projects that you\u2019re working on, you will get a grasp of where you\u2019ll be in the next few quarters, for sure.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay. Thanks.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah. Is everything okay?\" said by Victoria\n\"No. Uh\u2026 maybe this is a good time for us to discuss what\u2019s going on. Between us.\" said by Nate\n\"I\u2019m not in the least bit\u2026 resentful that you\u2019ve bested me in this situation.\" said by Tucker\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Ashley\n\"I\u2019m more than happy to implement the changes that you\u2019ve suggested. I just feel like it\u2019s a little\u2026 it\u2019s just not a good idea to get involved in a situation so inherently manipulative. Hmm? What do you think? See how I\u2019m evolving past that kind of behavior?\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah. Good answer.\" said by Ashley\n\"Okay.\" said by Tucker\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Ashley\n\"I\u2019m going to keep you abreast of the situation with devon.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah, you got to focus on devon.\" said by Ashley\n\"I do. Good day.\" said by Tucker\n\"Wait one second. I spoke with victor and victoria, actually.\" said by Ashley\n\"Did you?\" said by Tucker\n\"I did, yeah. They accused me of purchasing your debt.\" said by Ashley\n\"Ah. And did you confirm or deny it?\" said by Tucker\n\"Mm.\" said by Ashley\n\"You confirmed it?\" said by Tucker\n\"I did not, of course. And victor didn\u2019t believe me. He thought I did purchase your debt so that I could punish you.\" said by Ashley\n\"And victoria?\" said by Tucker\n\"She believes that my motives are more benign, I think. But regardless, they\u2019re very anxious to get their hands on your company.\" said by Ashley\n\"That\u2019s not news.\" said by Tucker\n\"What is news is that they\u2019re willing to pay top dollar. Far, far more than it\u2019s worth. What do you think?\" said by Ashley\n\"Selling to the newmans would put you back in control financially.\" said by Ashley\n\"Mm.\" said by Tucker\n\"You can start all over again, right? You wouldn\u2019t have a care in the world.\" said by Ashley\n\"No, not a care.\" said by Tucker\n\"Mnh-mnh.\" said by Ashley\n\"I could travel. I could, uh\u2026 I could have endless excitement. Fast cars. Fast women. When cold symptoms keep you up, You wanted to find out if i would abandon my plan to sell to devon and go for the big bucks instead, didn\u2019t you?\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, you, originally, were planning to sell to the newmans.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yes, I know, and if I did, I\u2019d have more money than god, but then I\u2019d be alone. Okay? So if I\u2019m going to make this deal, I choose whichever door leads to you.\" said by Tucker\n\"Being with you is worth more.\" said by Tucker\n\"I just \u2014 let me be clear about what you\u2019re saying here, \u2019cause I want to make sure I understand. Before, you would say that, by me removing hamilton-winters from this partnership, I\u2019d be devaluing both companies, but, in reality, you\u2019re just worried about me devaluing your accomplishments.\" said by Devon\n\"Why can\u2019t both things be true?\" said by Lily\n\"Oh, they can be, but, I mean, if we\u2019re just trying to protect our businesses here, why am I the only bad guy?\" said by Devon\n\"Because you signed a contract. You agreed to the merger. So it\u2019s one company. So I\u2019m doing what needs to be done. And you know what? We are both going to lose money, we\u2019re both going to lose time, we\u2019re probably going to lose our dignity, but you know who\u2019s going to walk away with nothing? It\u2019s going to be you.\" said by Lily\n\"Lily, I didn\u2019t want this fight. I didn\u2019t \u2014 I never wanted to fight with you. I just wanted my business and the company that I created with my father. That\u2019s it.\" said by Devon\n\"Devon, you have got to stop acting like you are the only one who can carry on his legacy.\" said by Lily\n\"Well, why am I the only one trying to protect the company that he left behind?\" said by Devon\n\"Saving hamilton-winters is not going to bring dad back. And if it did, I would be right there with you, fighting. But it\u2019s not. So you\u2019re wrong. And if it takes a judge to prove that to you, then so be it.\" said by Lily\n\"So this is you just saying you don\u2019t give a damn?\" said by Devon\n\"Actually, no, it\u2019s the opposite. My dad was more than a name, and he was definitely more than a company. He transcends that. So, you know what? Start a new company. Or take the money that we offered you and retire. I don\u2019t care. But if you go down this path, I guarantee you will regret it.\" said by Lily\n\"I never thought I\u2019d say this in a million years, but I\u2019m almost glad neil isn\u2019t here to see who you\u2019ve turned into.\" said by Devon\n\"[ Scoffs ]\" said by Lily\n\"Um\u2026 nate and victoria have been friends for a long time. I think he\u2019s always admired her business acumen, and she hired him after he left chancellor-winters, so I think it\u2019s only natural that he\u2019d be grateful.\" said by Elena\n\"Mm. Definitely a lot of gratitude going on.\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah, I think that he should be appreciative. Just like you seem to be since nate hired you after you were let go.\" said by Elena\n\"Yeah, but I\u2019m hardly a neophyte in the business world. But, nate, now, I have to hand it to him. The way he\u2019s been able to close that hierarchy gap between him and victoria, they are so in sync it\u2019s crazy. It\u2019s like they were destined to be partners. Business partners, of course.\" said by Audra\n\"I\u2019m glad he has such a supportive boss.\" said by Elena\n\"Yeah. It\u2019s a shame he didn\u2019t have that at chancellor when he was working with family.\" said by Audra\n\"I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s appropriate to discuss.\" said by Elena\n\"You\u2019re right. Family dynamics can be tricky. Relatives don\u2019t always have the strongest bonds. But, you know, it\u2019s funny. When you have the right person by your side, just everything falls into place regardless of what their relationship is to you. Nate must be that person for victoria. The real deal.\" said by Audra\n\"And what do you mean by that?\" said by Elena\n\"Well, nate may only be in charge of one division now, but it\u2019s pretty clear victoria has much bigger plans for him.\" said by Audra\n\"Must we discuss the elephant in the room?\" said by Victoria\n\"[ Chuckles ] If we\u2019re going to get any work done. Look, I\u2019ll start. I feel a certain attraction to you, but I shouldn\u2019T.\" said by Nate\n\"Because of elena. What\u2019s going on between the two of you? Maybe whatever it is will clarify what\u2019s going on between the two of us.\" said by Victoria\n\"That\u2019s the problem. Elena and I are in a good place, for the first time in a long while.\" said by Nate\n\"And yet?\" said by Victoria\n\"Twice.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yes. [ Clears throat ] Multiple times.\" said by Nate\n\"So that\u2019s a problem?\" said by Victoria\n\"I think there have been some mixed messages.\" said by Nate\n\"Yes, it seems like the wires are definitely crossed. But not for me. I know what I want. However, I\u2019m unencumbered, and I\u2019m free to get involved with whoever I want. But, unfortunately, it\u2019s not the same for you.\" said by Victoria\n\"I apologize for this.\" said by Nate\n\"Don\u2019t apologize. Just figure out what you want because whatever happens or doesn\u2019t happen is entirely up to you. (Vo) the shape that stole your heart\" said by Victoria\n\"Look, I can\u2019t deny feeling an intense connection. As if the job weren\u2019t exciting enough, knowing I get to see you during the day\u2026\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s a pleasant bonus for me, too.\" said by Victoria\n\"But I ultimately lost my career as a surgeon because of an impulse I acted on.\" said by Nate\n\"So your concern is about your job?\" said by Victoria\n\"My concern is about all the above. Business. Personal. The man I need to be.\" said by Nate\n\"A man who\u2019s faithful to his girlfriend. So who am I to you?\" said by Victoria\n\"You\u2019re\u2026irresistible. Intoxicating. And you make me feel powerful.\" said by Nate\n\"But you\u2019re with elena.\" said by Victoria\n\"And I can\u2019t hurt her the way she and I hurt devon.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, that\u2019s very admirable.\" said by Victoria\n\"So no matter what I may or may not be feeling, we can\u2019t ever kiss again.\" said by Nate\n\"Did we kiss? I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ve been so busy. It must have just slipped my mind. Was it good?\" said by Victoria\n\"Unforgettable. But I would hate to see what kind of negative impact this could have on our personal lives.\" said by Nate\n\"Why would it? We won\u2019t tell anyone. And in the future, I will not kiss you, and you will not kiss me.\" said by Victoria\n\"Agreed.\" said by Nate\n\"And we\u2019ll be sure to keep a safe distance away from each other and avoid eye contact at all times.\" said by Victoria\n\"Contact of any kind.\" said by Nate\n\"You know, there\u2019s one other thing to consider. You say that what you and elena did caused you to leave your career in the medical field and come here. But maybe here is where you belonged all along. Maybe you need more than she\u2019s able to give you.\" said by Victoria\n\"So what do you think victoria has in store for nate?\" said by Elena\n\"I am not privy to that level of information. In fact, I was just kicked out of meeting with nate because victoria wanted to have a word in private.\" said by Audra\n\"About what?\" said by Elena\n\"Uh, data, numbers.\" said by Audra\n\"But wouldn\u2019t you be included in that discussion since you are the coo?\" said by Elena\n\"Yeah, I thought that was rude, too. But when victoria wants to meet with nate, I make myself scarce.\" said by Audra\n\"Hm. And, um, does has happen often?\" said by Elena\n\"Look, all I know is that victoria must see something truly magnificent in him to give him so much one-on-one attention.\" said by Audra\n\"I suppose.\" said by Elena\n\"He\u2019ll be moving up in the newman organization any day now. You should be so proud of your boyfriend.\" said by Audra\n\"You expected to see my wheels turning as i formulated my grand plan to sell mccall to newman for millions more than it\u2019s worth, didn\u2019t you?\" said by Tucker\n\"I thought it was a strong possibility.\" said by Ashley\n\"I\u2019ve never been happier to disappoint you.\" said by Tucker\n\"Won\u2019t be the first time. I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be the last.\" said by Ashley\n\"Ashley, the only thing I\u2019m interested in at this point is to have a fresh start with the two people who matter the most to me in life, you and devon. That\u2019s it.\" said by Tucker\n\"Okay, tell me this. What happens if you can\u2019t convince devon to buy your company? And I\u2019m not convinced that you actually want to be a better man. What if we both turn our backs on you? What then?\" said by Ashley\n\"I would still forge ahead with my mission of self-improvement. Here\u2019s the thing. No matter who purchases mccall, the sale will provide me with the means of a fresh start. Uh\u2026 the way lived my life up until now, yes, has made me rich, but I\u2019m completely devoid of the things that matter, and a major loss has forced my hand, finally.\" said by Tucker\n\"So to be a better person, you need to be abandoned completely?\" said by Ashley\n\"Is that what you\u2019re planning to do? If I can\u2019t win devon over, are you just going to turn your back on me?\" said by Tucker\n\"It doesn\u2019t feel good, does it?\" said by Devon\n\"Sorry, the comment of dad being ashamed of me?\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah. Same thing you said to me last time we got an argument about this.\" said by Devon\n\"No, I actually wish he were here to see what I\u2019ve become, because I know that he would be incredibly proud of me.\" said by ", "answer": "Lily"}

That is if your offer was serious and you meant it.\" said by Tucker\n\"Of course, I meant it. You belong here, as long as you behave.\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh. Is that the real reason why you invited me here?\" said by Tucker\n\"Maybe.\" said by Ashley\n\"You want me to be here?\" said by Tucker\n\"Hm. Thank you.

The weather?\" said by Lauren\n\"I was hoping we could try to renew some sense of normalcy, you know, get things back the way they were. That appears not to be possible, especially in this place.

I have been trying to contain myself and I can\u2019t do it anymore. How do you justify defending the woman who murdered our best friend?\" said by Lauren\n\"Working late? I like to see it.\" said by Jack\n\"Hey, I, uh, sorry, I commandeered the big chair. I just wanted to stay on top of things in your absence. I know that you\u2019re dealing with other things.\" said by Billy\n\"Please, please proceed. I like seeing you here. You are the co-C.E.O.

I\u2013 I just came from seeing diane.\" said by Jack\n\"Really? I thought kyle said she didn\u2019t want to see anyone.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah, well, I chose to ignore her. I told her I refused to let this thing come between us, to tear us apart. What\u2019s more, I told her that I wanted to marry her now more than ever and I wanted to do it right away.\" said by Jack\n\"And what did she say?\" said by Billy\n\"Mom?\" said by Summer\n\"It\u2019s just me.

I mean, I\u2019m happy you didn\u2019t let me give up and run away.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, well, I can\u2019t really take credit for that. I just gave you alternative moves that you could make.\" said by Ashley\n\"You cracked the door open just enough for me to believe that maybe we can make it work this time around.\" said by Tucker\n\"Maybe being the operative word. You know, there\u2019s no guarantees.\" said by Ashley\n\"I know. But I\u2019m glad that we both agreed that this is at least worth exploring. And uh, anyway, it was a very romantic gesture to offer to share your home with me and I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m rather looking forward to seeing the look on jack\u2019s face when he\u2013\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah.\" said by Ashley\n\"When he sees me coming down the stairs for breakfast.\" said by Tucker\n\"I don\u2019t want to talk about jack right now.\" said by Ashley\n\"Sure.\" said by Tucker\n\"Let\u2019s not do it.

Do you remember when diane was cuffed and hauled out of here and she begged you to represent her and you refused, as you should? That was your gut telling you, you should not give that woman the benefit of the doubt.\" said by Lauren\n\"You\u2019re right. You\u2019re right. How could I not? I was reeling. We all were. We had just found out that phyllis had been poisoned.\" said by Michael\n\"And after jack pleaded with you personally, you still refused. What superseded your reluctance? Your enormous ego?\" said by Lauren\n\"How could you even say that?\" said by Michael\n\"Because I remember you telling me that victor and nikki were giving you a hard time for even thinking about defending diane. So what was this, the ultimate pushback to prove that you can make your own decisions?\" said by Lauren\n\"You hold on now. That is a gross oversimplification. I would not just blithely sacrifice my job with victor because my fragile and enormous ego was bruised.\" said by Michael\n\"Then tell me. Tell me what it was? Because it certainly seems that your desire to prove a point was more important than everything, including my feelings. You knew exactly how I would react with you defending diane and you went and you did it anyway.\" said by Lauren\n\"So you asked diane to marry you, right then and there? And she didn\u2019t give you an answer?\" said by Billy\n\"Nope. I\u2019m not sure why. I thought that offering to marry her now would make her see that my faith in her is unshakeable. That I could make her see that I deeply believe she was coming home. That any day now, we could start to rebuild this new chapter in our lives that\u2013 that we dreamed about.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. Well, you know, jack, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m sure she\u2019s scared, you know, and overwhelmed. I\u2019m not surprised that she put the brakes on. She\u2019s trying to get through her life right now, hour by hour.\" said by Billy\n\"I know\u2013 I know all that. That\u2019s why I\u2019m doing everything I can to give her some sense of comfort.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, I know. I\u2019m sure she appreciates that, but I can\u2019t imagine she was prepared for you to show up and say, \u201clet\u2019s get hitched right now\u201d, you know. As much as she loves you, and she does love you, that is pretty impulsive.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah, I will admit to that.\" said by Jack\n\"Look, maybe she\u2019s thinking that there\u2019s more to this than you asking her to marry you.\" said by Billy\n\"Meaning what?\" said by Jack\n\"I think it\u2019s pretty clear that you think things are spinning out of control right now and maybe this is your attempt to desperately find something that you can control.\" said by Billy\n\"Billy, the last thing I need right now is you analyzing me. My suggestion did not come out of the blue. We are engaged. I fully intend to spend the rest of my life with her. I was simply moving up the timetable.\" said by Jack\n\"Why don\u2019t you just slow down a little bit, okay? This isn\u2019t something you can outrun, jack.\" said by Billy\n\"What are you talking about? What am I trying to outrun?\" said by Jack\n\"Not that long ago, you were ready to spend the rest of your life with someone else. Someone that you loved deeply. You called her red, and now she\u2019s gone and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve even begun to mourn that loss yet.\" said by Billy\n\"You are overwhelmed and emotional and I think I know what\u2019s going on. I haven\u2019t told anyone this, but I see mom too. I see her all the time. Someone walking by me on the street and\u2013 and my heart, it skips a beep.\" said by Daniel\n\"This wasn\u2019t like that, daniel. This was real.\" said by Summer\n\"I know that it seems that way. I mean, those fleeting moments, they\u2013 they feel real to me too. But our mind, it plays tricks on us, especially in a stressful situation like this. And I think that\u2019s why mom, she comes to me in my dreams and you know, when I\u2019m alone, sometimes I find myself talking to her. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just my way of trying to hold on to her, I guess. Trying to still feel close and connected with her. I just keep thinking about the way she died and going over and over all the unanswered questions.\" said by Daniel\n\"What if I had answers to those questions? Moderate to severe eczema\" said by Summer\n\"Once again, you have misconstrued things. My desire to marry diane is quite separate from my need to mourn phyllis.\" said by Jack\n\"With all due respect, I\u2013 I disagree, jack. It seems like to me, you\u2019re avoiding your pain and your grief by simply focusing on your future with diane.\" said by Billy\n\"Believe me, I have grieved. I poured my heart out at that memorial service. I am not in denial.\" said by Jack\n\"I\u2019m not saying you are, but what I am saying is that you\u2019re not really allowing yourself to understand what\u2019s going on inside of you. I mean, everything has been moving at warp speed since that gala. I\u2019m sure you haven\u2019t had a second to even take a breath.\" said by Billy\n\"God, that is the truth. That party was so chaotic and the chaos hasn\u2019t stopped since.\" said by Jack\n\"No, it\u2019s been a nonstop nightmare.\" said by Billy\n\"No sooner were we passed the trauma of phyllis\u2019s memorial service, and diane was arrested.\" said by Jack\n\"And you\u2019re gonna do what you do, you\u2019re gonna make sure everyone else is okay. From diane and kyle to daniel and summer, without taking a second for yourself.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah, I suppose part of that might be true.\" said by Jack\n\"You know what? You and phyllis, you weren\u2019t in the best place when she died and I would imagine that would make her loss even harder. Jack, I think you gotta allow yourself to acknowledge who phyllis was to you. How much she meant to you. You two had a rich, deep history and you got to allow yourself the time to grieve that.\" said by Billy\n\"What I know now is that\u2026 everything that we believe to be true is a lie. Mom\u2019s not dead.\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, I know that you really want to believe that mom\u2019s not dead. I do too.\" said by Daniel\n\"Daniel, just listen to me, please. I know that it sounds crazy, but is it really that hard to believe that not everything is as it seems?\" said by Summer\n\"We saw mom collapse in front of us. Nate and elena, they weren\u2019t pretending to try and help her. They did everything that they could to save her and now we know that she was poisoned and the ambulance crashed and burned. I mean, there\u2019s not a person in this world that could survive all of that.\" said by Daniel\n\"What if she survived? And it was all a part of this scheme that was orchestrated by jeremy stark. I mean, you thought that he was involved from the beginning, didn\u2019t you?\" said by Summer\n\"Yes. But I\u2013 I\u2013\" said by Daniel\n\"Don\u2019t you see, can\u2019t you see it? He played on all of mom\u2019s emotions. He forced her to be part of his plan for revenge against diane. And frame diane for murder. Mom didn\u2019t have a choice. And even though she regretted things that she\u2019s done, she was\u2013 she was trapped.\" said by Summer\n\"Look, even if any of that is true, why wouldn\u2019t mom come home now? They found stark\u2019s body, she\u2019d be free to come back to us.\" said by Daniel\n\"Not if she was the one that killed him.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh my god, summer. Oh, my god.\" said by Daniel\n\"Daniel, listen to me. It was an accident. She was trying to get away from him and she can\u2019t come back to us because then she would be arrested for his murder.\" said by Summer\n\"If it was self-defense, why wouldn\u2019t she come back and explain everything?\" said by Daniel\n\"Because who would believe her? Who would believe her? She would be the one in jail right now for murder instead of diane. Daniel, we have to do something. I don\u2019t know\u2013 I don\u2019t know what, but we have to do something. We can\u2019t just let our mom slip away from us forever.\" said by Summer\n\"That\u2019s not at all the way it happened. I didn\u2019t just deliberately take diane\u2019s case to go against your wishes.\" said by Michael\n\"Then why did you?\" said by Lauren\n\"It was victor and nikki\u2019s rush to judgment. They had diane tried and convicted without any awareness of the facts. They didn\u2019t just suspect diane was to blame for phyllis\u2019s murder, they knew it.\" said by Michael\n\"So, who cares what victor and nikki think, right?\" said by Lauren\n\"That\u2019s when I realized that\u2019s just the kind of jury that diane\u2019s gonna go up against in court. A bunch of biased people who have already made up their mind. Everybody deserves legal representation. Guilty or innocent and they deserve an attorney who works to make sure that the system is\u2013 that the system works fairly for everybody.\" said by Michael\n\"Well, I can\u2019t argue with that.\" said by Lauren\n\"Exactly.\" said by Michael\n\"But there are other top attorneys that could have defended her. Lawyers with no emotional ties.\" said by Lauren\n\"I think I\u2019m a good attorney because of my emotional ties and you are partially to blame for that. It is why I\u2019m passionate about what I do.\" said by Michael\n\"Not this time. This is phyllis, our best friend, the victim, the woman who has gone through hell with us.\" said by Lauren\n\"You know she meant the world to me.\" said by Michael\n\"And yet you choose not to fight for her, but her killer could go free because of you. And if that happens, I don\u2019t know if I can ever look at you again.\" said by Lauren\n\"Summer, I know how hard it is to let go. I\u2019m dealing with it, okay? And I want you to know that I love you and I will be here for you every step of the way. I will.\" said by Daniel\n\"You think I\u2019m a wreck, don\u2019t you? You think I\u2019m out of my mind?\" said by Summer\n\"I think that you have to admit it is a pretty wild string of theories. But I understand. I get why you would be so desperate for there to be something that would tell us that mom\u2019s still out there somewhere.\" said by Daniel\n\"She is. I saw her.\" said by Summer\n\"If only that were true, it would make everything easier between you and kyle and it would probably fix the whole problem with diane.\" said by Daniel\n\"It would change everything.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah, it would. And that\u2019s a nice thought, but it isn\u2019t real. And it\u2019s not healthy for us to be obsessing over things that aren\u2019t gonna happen, summer. You and kyle, you\u2019re gonna be fine. Right now, there is absolutely nothing that either one of us can do. You should really go home and get some rest. Come on. Just let me\u2013\" said by Danie\n\"So you just don\u2019t believe me? You\u2019re not even willing to consider that I\u2019m telling the truth. God, I just wish\u2013 I wish that there was a way to show you. I want to prove it to you. Mom! Mom!\" said by Summer\n\"It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay.\" said by Daniel\n\"For better or worse, there was never anyone like phyllis. There never will be anyone like her again.\" said by Jack\n\"No. No, she\u2019s a one-of-a-kind. And that\u2019s a good thing because I don\u2019t think this world could handle another phyllis summers.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah, yeah, yeah, go.\" said by Jack\n\"Hey, chels, what\u2019s up?\" said by Billy\n\"I cannot imagine going through life without you. Whatever problems we have, I want to fix them with you. Whatever obstacles life puts in our way, I want us to take them on together. Marry me.\" said by Jack\n\"I still\u2013\" said by Phyllis\n\"Then\u2013 then there\u2019s really only one word to say. Say yes.\" said by Jack\n\"Yes. Yes.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yes, yes. Yes, you\u2013 you will marry me?\" said by Jack\n\"Just put this on, put this on quick, please. Before I come to my senses, just do it. So, you just want to throw in the towel because of one setback?\" said by Phyllis\n\"This is not a small setback. And I have you now, I can hold you, I can kiss you. I can spend the rest of my life\u2013\" said by Jack\n\"No jack! Jack, something is missing. We don\u2019t have a baby. We won\u2019t have a baby.\" said by Phyllis\n\"We have each other. We have each other. That\u2019s enough. That\u2019s enough for me.\" said by Jack\n\"If anybody was a fool, it was me. I was a fool. Anybody who sleeps with a married man is an idiot. I know you hate me and I understand that, but see, we can get past this stuff. People do this. And that\u2013 that thing with nicholas, it\u2013 it just\u2013 it just happened, jack.\" said by Phyllis\n\"That thing with nicholas didn\u2019t just happen. See, first, you have to take off your clothes.\" said by Jack\n\"Listen, I never meant to hurt you. I honestly didn\u2019T.\" said by Phyllis\n\"You know what? You\u2019re absolutely right. Anything you say right now would be meaningless. Yeah, I know, you love hanging out with me. You know what though? We\u2019re gonna get you out of here and we\u2019re gonna get you to a hospital and you\u2019re gonna have this little girl. And she\u2019s gonna have a full head of red hair.\" said by Jack\n\"And nick will see her born.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yeah, I could use a sub. Think I need a breather, coach.\" said by Jack\n\"I hope you didn\u2019t mean that.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Why? What?\" said by Jack\n\"Because my water just broke.\" said by Phyllis\n\"What?\" said by Jack\n\"I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m the right person to help you through this, but I\u2019m here and I\u2019m staying. Unless you want ashley or\u2013 or tracy to come up, we can call them?\" said by Phyllis\n\"No no, no, I don\u2019t want anybody else. Look, I know\u2013 I know I keep saying this over and over again, I couldn\u2019t do this without you, red. Maybe the reason I didn\u2019t move on with my romantic life was because I already was with the most amazing woman I\u2019ve ever known. Maybe you set the bar too high, red.\" said by Jack\n\"Listen, I don\u2019t\u2013 I don\u2019t think you should say things that you\u2013 you might not mean.\" said by Phyllis\n\"I\u2019m not saying this because I\u2019ve had too much to drink. I\u2019m saying it because it\u2019s true. I have never stopped loving you and I don\u2019t think I ever will. This isn\u2019t charmin!\" said by Jack\n\"The young and the restless will continue. (Vo) is she tired? Sad? Bored?\" said by Announcer\n\"Home sweet home.\" said by Tucker\n\"You didn\u2019t bring a lot with you.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah, I haven\u2019t officially checked out of the athletic club.\" said by Tucker\n\"I see. So you didn\u2019t think that my invitation was sincere?\" said by Ashley\n\"Can you blame me?\" said by Tucker\n\"No.\" said by Ashley\n\"I have a question though, about the arrangements. Jack is not the only one who lives here besides you. How are the others gonna react?\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah. Yeah, it\u2019s gonna be awkward, right? But you know what? They\u2019re gonna adapt because everybody in this household has bigger things on their mind than you. And besides, I mean, if you haven\u2019t noticed it\u2019s a pretty big place.\" said by Ashley\n\"It seems like it, yeah. Well, I promise I\u2019ll\u2013 I\u2019ll try to give tracy and carla and summer all the breathing room they need.\" said by Tucker\n\"I hope that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re gonna hole off somewhere and be a hermit.\" said by Ashley\n\"Does that sound like me?\" said by Tucker\n\"No, but maybe I can see you somewhere sitting in your new sanctuary, nursing your favorite beverage. Brooding, perhaps.\" said by Ashley\n\"Why would you go there?\" said by Tucker\n\"Because the tucker mccall I know doesn\u2019t handle being at loose ends well. So, I\u2019m just thinking maybe you should start thinking about what you want to do next.\" said by Ashley\n\"Hm.\" said by Tucker\n\"I understand exactly how you feel. I wouldn\u2019t be able to live with myself if I knew I had let phyllis\u2019s murderer walk. But I truly believe diane\u2019s telling the truth. Look, I\u2019ve known a lot of bald faced liars in my life, yeah. And I have developed excellent radar for the art of lying and diane is telling the truth. She believes she\u2019s innocent. That\u2019s why, to her, the only logical conclusion is that she was set up. Unfortunately, the man to blame for that will never pay for his crime.\" said by Michael\n\"And if jeremy stark is at fault, then why the hell would he be allowed to get away with that?\" said by Lauren\n\"Because his body just washed up on a shore of a nearby lake.\" said by Michael\n\"What?\" said by Lauren\n\"I\u2019m afraid so. And now I\u2019m left with more questions than before. You can\u2019t get answers from a dead man. The fact that I can\u2019t call jeremy stark to the stand makes it a hell of a lot harder to keep diane out of prison. But I\u2019m not gonna let that happen because that means stark would win, even from the grave.\" said by ", "answer": "Michael"}
{"content": "\"I understand how urgent this is, but there is a right way and a wrong way to clear mom.\" said by Daniel\n\"Okay. What would be so wrong with finding a witness that saw the whole thing?\" said by Summer\n\"It\u2019s a fake witness. One who could make matters worse 20 different ways.\" said by Daniel\n\"What about my idea to find, um, the emt? Carson. He\u2013 he saw what stark did.\" said by Summer\n\"He\u2019s also a fugitive. He was a part of the plot. He\u2019s not a credible witness. He\u2019d be lying under oath, which means he\u2019d be tacking another felony onto his record. Look, say that you did, by some miracle, convince this guy to do what you\u2019re asking for some huge sum of money. Carson would hold that over your head for the rest of your life. He\u2019d continue to extort you. You\u2019d never be rid of him. Not to mention the fact that he might invent details that\u2013 that contradict mom\u2019s story. I just think that the whole plan isn\u2019t realistic.\" said by Daniel\n\"Okay. You\u2019re just throwing out worst case scenarios. This actually could work.\" said by Summer\n\"Summer.\" said by Daniel\n\"No, we need to find carson. We need to at least talk to him. All he has to do is tell the police that he saw mom act in self-defense.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, that\u2019s all he has to do, huh?\" said by Daniel\n\"Stark paid him to be an accomplice, so clearly, he can be bought. So, what, I\u2013 I find him, I give him a big bag of money and he says what I want him to say.\" said by Summer\n\"I don\u2019t care how damn busy you are. I wanna know what judge is responsible for today\u2019s arraignments. Exactly. Get back to me. All right? Don\u2019t give me a\u2013 what? Get to it.\" said by Victor\n\"How is that going?\" said by Nikki\n\"All I know is that I want our son out of that jail cell. He doesn\u2019t belong there.\" said by Victor\n\"As soon as cameron showed up in town, I think everybody expected this. I mean, there was bound to be a showdown.\" said by Nikki\n\"Of course there was bound to be a showdown. Question is how to resolve it.\" said by Victor\n\"I think we need to let michael do what he does best. He will get nicholas out as soon as possible. In the meantime, have there been any cameron sightings?\" said by Nikki\n\"Uh-uh. And if that punk knows what\u2019s good for him, he won\u2019t show up anywhere near this house or our family.\" said by Victor\n\"We\u2019ve done what we can. Michael will keep us updated. So, in the meantime, why don\u2019t we focus on our work and let him focus on his?\" said by Nikki\n\"I know you\u2019re trying to distract me. Good idea, too. There\u2019s some business I want to discuss with you.\" said by Victor\n\"Oh, the anderson deal. I have it right here.\" said by Nikki\n\"No. I wanna talk to you about nate hastings. How\u2019s he doing?\" said by Victor\n\"You mean since he has started seeing victoria?\" said by Nikki\n\"No, overall.\" said by Victor\n\"I have to say, very well. He has made good decisions for newman media.\" said by Nikki\n\"Good to know.\" said by Victor\n\"I understand you\u2019ve taken him under your wing.\" said by Nikki\n\"My day was productive. Yours?\" said by Nate\n\"Mine was\u2026 it was extremely productive.\" said by Victoria\n\"Really?\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah.\" said by Victoria\n\"Why do you suppose that is?\" said by Nate\n\"I don\u2019t know. For some odd reason, I was just filled with energy.\" said by Victoria\n\"Mm.\" said by Nate\n\"Maybe it was that private meeting that we squeezed in before we went to the office.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, you mean upstairs in the newman corporate suite?\" said by Nate\n\"I think we got a lot accomplished upstairs.\" said by Victoria\n\"An amazing amount.\" said by Nate\n\"We you usually do, though.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, I\u2019m sorry. I meant to turn my phone off.\" said by Victoria\n\"No, go ahead. It\u2019s fine.\" said by Nate\n\"Sure?\" said by Victoria\n\"Problem?\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, my\u2013 my brother got arrested.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, boy. What\u2019s adam done now?\" said by Nate\n\"No, not\u2013 not adam. Nicholas.\" said by Victoria\n\"Are you serious?\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah. Look, sadly we\u2019re gonna have to cut this short. Excuse me. Can I please get the check?\" said by Victoria\n\"I don\u2019t understand how this can happen. That cameron kirsten freak is a criminal who killed a cat and dad is sitting in jail?\" said by Faith\n\"Michael is a very sharp attorney. He will get your father out of there and out of trouble.

How you doing? You hanging in there?\" said by Michael\n\"How do you think I\u2019m doing? Kirsten is lying. These charges are a joke. It\u2019s a setup to get me out of the way so I can\u2019t protect sharon and faith. He\u2019s obviously planning something, which means you have to get me out here now!\" said by Nick\n\"I appreciate the urgency, but you\u2019re not gonna be arraigned \u2019til later today. And frankly, seeing how wound up you are right now, this might be the safest place for you. When migraine strikes, you\u2019re faced with a choice.\" said by Michael\n\"Summer, we are not paying someone to lie to the authorities.\" said by Daniel\n\"I still say\u2013\" said by Summer\n\"No, no, no, no, no. Look, we have broken enough laws already trying to help mom. Let\u2019s not add any more to the list. People have gone to prison for a lot less. You wind up in a cell, how are you gonna help mom do anything?\" said by Daniel\n\"I\u2019m just thinking how mom would think. This is how she would approach things.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah? How\u2019s that working out for her? She has screwed up her life beyond recognition. I mean, even she would tell you not to do this. It\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s crazy, one, and it wouldn\u2019t work.\" said by Daniel\n\"You know what? If that\u2019s your attitude, fine. I don\u2019t need your help.\" said by Summer\n\"What do you mean you think it\u2019s safer for me in here? Are you kidding me?\" said by Nick\n\"Nick! Nick, I am on your side.\" said by Michael\n\"Are you sure about that, michael?\" said by Nick\n\"I know exactly what I\u2019m dealing with. All right? If you\u2019ll recall, I was the first to hear about cameron, how vicious he is. Years ago, sharon told me what happened in denver before she admitted it to anyone else. The man is a disgusting pig, but he\u2019s not stupid. In fact, he\u2019s got you all figured out. You didn\u2019t even touch him, and where are you? In jail. Out of commission. Because cameron anticipated that you\u2019d come for him and he used it like a judo move against you. Pretty damn elegant if you ask me. Now, you are gonna stay in here for an hour or so and calm down while we wait for your arraignment. In the meantime, chance is with sharon, looking out for her. I mean, her own private special forces expert. I\u2019ll even check on her, too, on my way.\" said by Michael\n\"Just make sure that sharon is safe and you keep cameron kirsten away from faith.\" said by Nick\n\"I give you my word. Between chance and me and victor\u2019s security team, there\u2019s gonna be a whole lot of people watching over them.\" said by Michael\n\"And I\u2019m grateful for that, believe me. But I\u2019m afraid that cameron is planning something, and once he puts it in motion, there may be no stopping it.\" said by Nick\n\"Cameron kirsten filed a complaint against your father. His face was beaten. And nick did admit to going to his hotel room, and his hands were bruised, so I had to follow the law.\" said by Chance\n\"Dad punched the wall. It is his word against cameron\u2019S.\" said by Faith\n\"Well, the truth has a way of coming out in court.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, it needs to come out now. Dad shouldn\u2019t be in jail. He shouldn\u2019t have to deal with any of this. And he should be here with mom.\" said by Faith\n\"I understand that this guy is a creep, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.

But if you\u2019re going to catch your flight, you better scoot.\" said by Sharon\n\"I have a plainclothes officer outside in an unmarked car. His name\u2019s officer swift. He\u2019s gonna drive you to the airport and escort you to the gate.

And I do not want you worrying about me. You text me from your seat before you take off. Promise me.\" said by Sharon\n\"I will.\" said by Faith\n\"All right. Give me a hug. Okay. Remember to drink water. Stay hydrated. Those planes are very dry.\" said by Sharon\n\"[ Chuckling ] Okay. Hydrate. Got it.\" said by Faith\n\"Come on. I\u2019ll walk you out.\" said by Chance\n\"I love you. Bye.\" said by Faith\n\"I love you. Safe flighT. And we\u2019re done.\" said by Sharon\n\"I really appreciate you coming by. But shouldn\u2019t you be out there looking for cameron?\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, I got my team and victor\u2019s guys on high alert. I\u2019m gonna stay put, if that\u2019s okay? I\u2019m sure as hell not gonna leave you here alone. Plus i told nick I\u2019d look after you. So, just feel free to ignore me and go back to business.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, I can\u2019t just putter around you like you\u2019re the furniture.\" said by Sharon\n\"Ah, sure you can. I\u2019ll blend right in. You\u2019ll be mistaking me for an old ottoman in no time.\" said by Chance\n\"[ Laughing ] Somehow I doubt that.\" said by Sharon\n\"It\u2019s nice to hear you laugh again.\" said by Chance\n\"Well\u2026 you\u2019re a positive influence. And not just on me. I appreciate you being so reassuring with faith. These past few days have been tough on her.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, she\u2019s a good kid.\" said by Chance\n\"Now that she\u2019s off to college, the time I have with her is really precious. You know, a few short years from now she\u2019ll be graduated and off on her own, and\u2013 and then I\u2019m really gonna miss her.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, I can tell how much you two love each other. I doubt she\u2019ll end up very far away from home.\" said by Chance\n\"I hope not. Having to send her away like this is agonizing. It\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2019m so angry with cameron. You know, I want this house to be a haven for faith.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, I understand that. I kinda wanted something similar at my place for dominic. Didn\u2019t really work out for me.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, it\u2019s tough when you\u2019re trying to keep your kids safe.\" said by Sharon\n\"It\u2019s okay.\" said by Chance\n\"Mom.\" said by Summer\n\"Hey, I\u2019m glad you picked up.\" said by Phyllis\n\"I\u2019m glad that we got you out of there when we did. Kyle brought chance straight to your room.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah, that was a good call. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re still looking for me.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yeah. Everybody wants to know where you\u2019re hiding and they think that I\u2019m keeping the secret.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, that\u2019s why I\u2019m not letting you know. Not that I can\u2019t trust you.\" said by Phyllis\n\"It\u2019s my own fault that kyle found you in the first place and I\u2013 I\u2019m gonna make it up to you.\" said by Summer\n\"What? You have nothing to make up. Are you kidding me?\" said by Phyllis\n\"No, I\u2019m gonna\u2013 I\u2019m gonna find that emt that was in on the plan with you and stark\u2013 carson. I\u2019m gonna find him and I\u2019m gonna make him go to the police and say that he saw stark attack you and that you had to defend yourself.\" said by Summer\n\"No, you are absolutely not going to do that, summer.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Mom\u2013\" said by Summer\n\"No, I mean it, summer. If anyone\u2019s gonna find the emt, it\u2019s gonna be me. You got it? He broke so many laws. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s very far from genoa city right now.\" said by Phyllis\n\"But\u2026 if I paid him enough\u2013\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, I mean it. No! I\u2019m gonna take care of this on my own now. Okay? I\u2019m gonna come up with a plan. Please trust me. I don\u2019t wanna pull you and daniel into any of this mess anymore. What I want you to do is go to kyle and work on your relationship. Fix it. Okay?\" said by Phyllis\n\"I don\u2019t even know if that\u2019s possible.\" said by Summer\n\"Anything is possible. Go try. All right, super girl? Listen, I have so much to make up for. I can\u2019t have your marriage on my conscience.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Hi. So\u2013\" said by Victoria\n\"Hi, guys.\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh, hey.\" said by Victor\n\"What\u2019s the latest? Is nick okay? I\u2019m assuming that cameron is behind this.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah. Who else? As far as we have heard\u2013\" said by Nikki\n\"Your brother is being arraigned momentarily. Michael baldwin will call as soon as he\u2019s finished with the hearing.\" said by Victor\n\"We\u2019re confident he\u2019ll be released on bail.\" said by Nikki\n\"[ Scoffs ] As usual, nick couldn\u2019t help himself. He had to take matters into his own hands. You know this isn\u2019t gonna reflect well for the company.\" said by Victoria\n\"Nicholas denies he attacked the man.\" said by Victor\n\"You know, that is such classic cameron. It\u2019s all based on his twisted vendetta against your brother and sharon.\" said by Nikki\n\"I don\u2019t doubt that\u2019s an element. But we all know how aggressive nick can be when he\u2019s protecting the people that he loves.\" said by Victoria\n\"And if you recall, that helped you a great deal, didn\u2019t it? Anyway, michael baldwin will, I\u2019m sure, solve the problem. He owes me one.\" said by Victor\n\"I trust him implicitly.\" said by Nikki\n\"Michael is one of the best.\" said by Nate\n\"On a personal note, I sympathize. Cameron is a horrible excuse for a human being. But as ceo, I have to be practical. Nick and sharon helped to put him away for murder. All it\u2019s gonna take is a reporter with an ax to grind, to connect the dots in other areas. And that, dad, is the last kind of publicity that we need.\" said by Victoria\n\"What are you talking about?\" said by Victor\n\"Until this conflict is resolved and he clears his name, I\u2019m gonna ask nick to take a leave of absence. Ladies\u2026\" said by Victoria\n\"A leave of absence?\" said by Nikki\n\"What are you talking about?\" said by Victor\n\"Uh, clearly this is a family matter, so I\u2019ll excuse myself, if you don\u2019t mind.\" said by Nate\n\"Thank you, nate.\" said by Victor\n\"I\u2019ll talk to you later.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah.\" said by Victoria\n\"Protecting his family.\" said by [ Nate clearing throat ] Nick has one priority right now\n\"As he protected you from ashland locke.\" said by Victor\n\"Exactly. We don\u2019t wanna draw attention to nick taking the law into his own hands. It\u2019s the right solution for both him and for the company.\" said by Victoria\n\"Sweetheart, it isn\u2019t your call to make.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, what do you think, mom? How do you feel about nick trying to deal with work while getting himself out of this legal trouble, while protecting faith and sharon at the same time?\" said by Victoria\n\"I agree with your father. I mean, yes, he needs to focus on his family, keep them safe. I\u2019m happy to cover for him, but I don\u2019t think we should call it a formal leave of absence. That would just raise more questions.\" said by Nikki\n\"Just personal time off. End of story. No one else\u2019s business.\" said by Victor\n\"Okay. Well, you can call it whatever you wanna call it, but I want nick to be free to focus his energies where they belong right now.\" said by Victoria\n\"I\u2019m gonna do things on my own now, summer. Okay? I made a mistake. I put you in a horrible position. But I\u2019m going to take care of everything now. All right?\" said by Phyllis\n\"But, mom, I can help you. The only thing that I wanna do right now is bring you home. And if getting carson to cooperate is what it takes\u2013\" said by Summer\n\"No! Summer, I mean it. This is non-negotiable. You got it? Drop it.\" said by Phyllis\n\"[ Scoffs ] Fine. You win. What are you gonna do now?\" said by Summer\n\"Um, I\u2019m not quite sure, but you don\u2019t need to worry about me. You know me. I\u2019m gonna come up with something. But what I want you to do is go to your husband. Don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ll be okay.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Nick must be climbing the walls in there.\" said by Sharon\n\"No, he\u2019s just anxious to have this arraignment over and done with.\" said by Michael\n\"I thought that this nightmare was behind us, michael, a long time ago, when cameron got sent to prison.\" said by Sharon\n\"Look, this time, you went straight to the authorities. You did the smart thing.\" said by Michael\n\"I remember you begging me last time. \u201cTell nick, go to the police. Don\u2019t try to handle this maniac on your own.\u201d But I\u2026 I was just too terrified. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it.\" said by Sharon\n\"We\u2019ve handled everything correctly this time. And I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m here to help.\" said by Michael\n\"And we are eternally grateful.\" said by Sharon\n\"Um, detective, I don\u2019t wanna alarm you, but, um\u2026 uh, nick thinks that cameron is up to something. And I\u2019m afraid I have to agree.\" said by Michael\n\"Yeah, I think so, too. Now that he\u2019s got nick out of the way, feels like he might make a move soon. All\u2019s quiet on the ranch so far, though.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, I am so glad that faith is going far, far away from here.\" said by Sharon\n\"Hello?\" said by Daniel\n\"Hey.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Hold on a second. Okay, I think we\u2019re good.\" said by Daniel\n\"I need you to listen to me very, very carefully. You need to protect your sister. You need to protect her before she goes too far. Trelegy for copd.

Don\u2019t worry about it.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, I\u2019d be thrilled if you found a reason to arrest the creep. It\u2019s the waiting that\u2019s killing me.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah. Unfortunately, it\u2019s all part of the process.\" said by Michael\n\"Well, in the meantime, every creak, every gust of wind has me thinking it\u2019s cameron lurking somewhere.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, maybe we\u2019re all mistaken and he\u2019s not gonna pull anything tonight because of the beefed up security.

When I am good and ready, I will leave this room! But not until then! Does everybody have a problem with the truth? You have a problem with that? You don\u2019t, right?

I\u2019m sure that you and lily were very moved.\" said by Amanda\n\"Yeah, we were. And it was very nice. The whole thing put everything into perspective for me, and it made me focus on what neil would actually want if he was here, and it certainly isn\u2019t his kids going at each other. And lily felt the same way.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, so you and lily are \u2014\" said by Amanda\n\"We\u2019re fine, yeah. We talked, and we forgave each other.

Can you hear me?\" said by Summer\n\"Can I get an ambulance to the gcac, please?\" said by Daniel\n\"We need to keep her airway clear.\" said by Sharon\n\"Hey, phyllis, can you hear me? Can you open your eyes?\" said by Kyle\n\"We need a doctor. Is there a doctor here? Mom, please wake up.\" said by Summer\n\"Hey, mom. Mom.\" said by Daniel\n\"Phyllis \u2014 hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.\" said by Kyle\n\"Oh, my god.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah, yeah. Okay, okay.\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, this is a surprise. You two are being civil.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah, devon told me that he dropped his lawsuit and that the two of you have resolved your issues, right?\" said by Amanda\n\"Yes, we have. Very grateful to have my brother back. So was the lawsuit the only thing that you two were discussing?\" said by Lily\n\"No. Devon was telling me all about his journey to finding himself. But, you know, I think what he said made a lot of sense. The only way to move on is to get past the anger and the hurt. So to moving on.\" said by Amanda\n\"Yeah. The good news for you is, now that the lawsuits off the table, you can go back home to your mom and family.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. Well, I actually feel like I have family here, too.\" said by Amanda\n\"Oh, there you are. Nate, we need a doctor.\" said by Victoria\n\"What is it?\" said by Nate\n\"There\u2019s an emergency. You have to come.\" said by Victoria\n\"Why? What happened?\" said by Elena\n\"Phyllis collapsed.\" said by Victoria\n\"Collapsed?\" said by Devon\n\"She\u2019s tried so many times to make things right between us, and I\u2019ve just \u2014 I\u2019ve shut her down every time. How could I do that to her?\" said by Summer\n\"Hey, mom knows you love her.\" said by Daniel\n\"Does she?\" said by Summer\n\"Excuse me.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, my god.\" said by Amanda\n\"What happened?\" said by Elena\n\"She was having a tantrum, and she just passed out.\" said by Nikki\n\"She started talking, she started stumbling around, and then she collapsed.\" said by Daniel\n\"Has she been drinking?\" said by Nate\n\"No, I don\u2019t think so.\" said by Summer\n\"I don\u2019t smell any alcohol.\" said by Nate\n\"The emts are on their way. They should be here any minute.\" said by Daniel\n\"They need to hurry. I can barely feel her pulse.\" said by Elena\n\"I am so excited for this burger. Although, I have to admit, I do feel a little guilty eating a burger beat cheeseburger at crimson lights, but it is absolutely not going to stop me.\" said by Sally\n\"Don\u2019t worry about that. I got a pretty solid in with the owner of this joint.\" said by Nick\n\"Ooh, yes. Extra hot sauce.\" said by Sally\n\"You put hot sauce on your french fries?\" said by Nick\n\"Uh, yeah. If there\u2019s something that you should know about me, it\u2019s that I love my hot sauce.\" said by Sally\n\"So weird. Alright, well, let me try one.\" said by Nick\n\"No, unh-unh. You had a chance to get your own. You said you didn\u2019t want any.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, how about little credit, then, for getting you out of the gala before things went south?\" said by Nick\n\"Fine. Maybe one.\" said by Sally\n\"Just one.\" said by Nick\n\"Mamie had a wonderful time. Isn\u2019t that nice? She\u2019s very tired, though.\" said by Ashley\n\"You seem a little tired yourself.\" said by Tucker\n\"Thank you.\" said by Ashley\n\"Try that. Cheers.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah, cheers. It\u2019s not going to help, but thanks. You\u2019ve been quiet all night long.\" said by Ashley\n\"When did I get an opportunity to speak at that place? It\u2019s just blah, blah, blah, blah, blah from everyone. So how about jack and diane, huh? They sure seem happy.\" said by Tucker\n\"It\u2019s faux happiness because it\u2019s based on a lie.\" said by Ashley\n\"Diane was just radiant.\" said by Tucker\n\"She wasn\u2019t radiant, tucker. She was smug because she thinks she won.\" said by Ashley\n\"Or maybe the two of them have found true love.\" said by Tucker\n\"I liked you a lot better when you weren\u2019t talking, actually.\" said by Ashley\n\"No, but, seriously, she seems to have changed. Really.\" said by Tucker\n\"Are you trying \u2014 listen.\" said by Ashley\n\"No, but if so, who are we to doubt her, to judge?\" said by Tucker\n\"Do you want to annoy me right now? Because you know better than anybody what she\u2019s capable of, so \u2014\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah, and I know what love is capable of.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, I know, because of the time you spent in the ashram \u2014\" said by Ashley\n\"No, because of you. And because I\u2019m selfish.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, that part I completely agree with you.\" said by Ashley\n\"I saw the way they looked at each other when jack was giving that speech. It was there. It was there \u2014 forgiveness. And I selfishly want to believe that forgiveness is possible because that\u2019s what I want from you. And I figure if jack and diane can find a second chance, then maybe we can, too.\" said by Tucker\n\"Breaths are shallow.\" said by Nate\n\"Pulse is thready.\" said by Elena\n\"Pupils are reactive.\" said by Nate\n\"Nate\u2019s a man of many talents.\" said by Audra\n\"Thank god.\" said by Victoria\n\"Does your mother have any allergies?\" said by Elena\n\"No.\" said by Daniel\n\"Is she on any medications?\" said by Nate\n\"Not that I know of.\" said by Summer\n\"Did anything specific happen to prompt this? Did anything unusual happen tonight before she collapsed?\" said by Elena\n\"She was upset about my dad\u2019s engagement announcement. She went off on them, just ranting, and then passed out.\" said by Kyle\n\"Can you tell what\u2019s wrong with her?\" said by Summer\n\"Why isn\u2019t she waking up?\" said by Daniel\n\"Unfortunately, her loss of consciousness can be a sign of a number of things. I\u2019m sorry we don\u2019t have any better answers for you yet.\" said by Elena\n\"The only thing we know is that we need to get your mother to the hospital, stat. Her vitals are deteriorating.\" said by Nate\n\"Here they are.\" said by Elena\n\"This doesn\u2019t make any sense. I mean, phyllis is so strong and healthy, right?\" said by Danny\n\"Well, you know, she was in a coma a few years ago. That couldn\u2019t have lasting effects, could it?\" said by Lauren\n\"Whatever this is, let\u2019s pray she pulls out of it.\" said by Nikki\n\"If anyone\u2019s a fighter, phyllis is. (Geri) I smoked and I have copd.\" said by Michael\n\"I hope you\u2019re not just going to stand there lurking.\" said by Sally\n\"[ Exhales sharply ] I\u2019m not lurking.\" said by Adam\n\"You\u2019re totally lurking.\" said by Sally\n\"Okay, look, I \u2014 i just have to know. Are \u2014 are you and the baby okay?\" said by Adam\n\"We\u2019re fine.\" said by Sally\n\"That\u2019s why you\u2019re here?\" said by Nick\n\"At the gala, I saw you put your hand on your stomach and then leave pretty quickly, so I was worried that something was wrong, but now I know. Cheeseburgers. You were just hungry.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay, well, if you followed us here, then you saw us go through the drive-through, so you didn\u2019t put it together then?\" said by Sally\n\"Well, I thought you might have just been faint, maybe some low blood sugar, and if that\u2019s all it was, I just wanted to make sure that you were okay.\" said by Adam\n\"That\u2019s why you followed us?\" said by Nick\n\"And now you make me sound like a stalker. But I would rather chalk it up to being an overprotective father-to-be.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, I guess i appreciate the honesty.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, honesty\u2019s good.\" said by Nick\n\"Well\u2026 I\u2019m genuinely relieved everything is okay with you and the baby. Pretend I was never here.\" said by Adam\n\"Or you could join us.\" said by Sally\n\"Are you sure?\" said by Adam\n\"No. Mnh-mnh. No, but I just want to find a way for things to be normal, and this is our new normal. And to make it all about me, I really don\u2019t have the greatest tolerance for stress right now. It gives me heartburn. Like, for real. So I would just really like to, you know, figure this out in a way that doesn\u2019t include stalking or family feuds.\" said by Sally\n\"Has there been any changes?\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m sorry, there hasn\u2019t, but your mom\u2019s stable for now, okay?\" said by Nate\n\"We\u2019ll know more after we run some tests.\" said by Elena\n\"Okay, I\u2019m going to follow the ambulance to the hospital. Do you want to ride with me?\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah, I \u2014 I should do that, right, instead of, um, driving myself?\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah.\" said by Daniel\n\"Hey, go to the hospital with your brother, sweetheart. I\u2019ll check in with harrison and the nanny and meet you there.\" said by Kyle\n\"Okay. Thanks.\" said by Summer\n\"She\u2019s going to be okay.\" said by Kyle\n\"Hey, I\u2019m really sorry.\" said by ", "answer": "Lily"}

Is there something in particular that you\u2019re referring to?\" said by Victoria\n\"I saw nicholas tearing out of here looking none too pleased. Wasn\u2019t hard to guess what that was about.\" said by Nikki\n\"And you would be right.\" said by Victoria\n\"You asked him to take a leave from work, didn\u2019t you?\" said by Nikki\n\"It was more than just an ask.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, my god. Why would you do that? I told you it was a bad idea.\" said by Nikki\n\"It was the right thing to do.\" said by Victoria\n\"Hey, dr. Hastings, how are you? Oh. Sorry, it\u2019s, uh, just mr. Hastings now, isn\u2019t it?\" said by Tucker\n\"Hello, tucker.\" said by Nate\n\"How\u2019s the business world treating?\" said by Tucker\n\"Great. Uh, I\u2019m proud of quite a few new accomplishments I\u2019ve managed to pull off at newman media. And I like to think I can take some credit for the increase in the profit margin as a result.\" said by Nate\n\"I\u2019m sure audra charles could take some of that credit too, right?\" said by Tucker\n\"Very. And now, she\u2019s finally being given the opportunity to shine. I know exactly how that feels.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, you mean after what happened to you at chancellor-winters?\" said by Tucker\n\"I wasn\u2019t treated right there. My ideas and opinions weren\u2019t valued, and that was a\u2013 that was a frustrating experience. I get the feeling you clearly didn\u2019t appreciate audra at your former company or she\u2019d still be there.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d go that far.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah, right. Now, if you excuse me, I\u2019ve got work to do.\" said by Nate\n\"Some work to do.\" said by Tucker\n\"Gotta hand it to you, nate.\" said by Nick\n\"Why is that?\" said by Nate\n\"Pretty smooth, man. And you know exactly what I\u2019m talking about.\" said by Nick\n\"Uh, can I get another one please? This could be interesting.\" said by Tucker\n\"Excuse me, nurse. Has miss spectra been released?\" said by Adam\n\"No, she\u2019s been taken for some final tests to be sure she\u2019s ready for discharge.\" said by Nurse\n\"All right, so she could get out possibly today?\" said by Adam\n\"What are you doing here, adam? Why do you keep coming back when I asked you to stay away?\" said by Sally\n\"Please, sally, will you hear me out? Don\u2019t push me away. Not now. Not after everything that has happened.

Okay? I\u2013 I feel the same pain that you were feeling, but please just let me help you get through this. I mean, at least tell me how you\u2019re feeling.\" said by Adam\n\"I\u2019m fine, apparently. At least physically. Doctor encouraged me to walk around as much as I can.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, that\u2019s good. I\u2019m glad that you survived it all, but emotionally, I know that you\u2019re as wrecked as I am. And look, I don\u2019t wanna push, but I feel like what I have to say will help you.\" said by Adam\n\"[ Sighing ] Adam, how many times do I have to tell you?\" said by Sally\n\"Let\u2013 let me just\u2013 let me tell you why everything went down the way that it did. Now that the sad reality has a chance to sink in, let me explain more fully why I made the decision that I did.\" said by Adam\n\"I already know why you did it. I heard everything that you said when you thought that I was asleep earlier. I\u2013 I didn\u2019t miss a word. How much you still love me. And how hard that decision was for you to make. But\u2026 if you were faced with the same situation again, you would make the same decision and honestly, that is the last thing that I want to hear right now.\" said by Sally\n\"What\u2019s going on, nick? Where\u2019s all this hostility coming from?\" said by Nate\n\"Don\u2019t insult my intelligence.\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2019m not insulting your intelligence. Why would I do that, nick? What is the problem?\" said by Nate\n\"You. You\u2019re the problem. I knew day one hiring you was a big mistake.\" said by Nick\n\"Mistake? I brought nothing but success to newman media.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, I don\u2019t deny that. You seem to be a very quick study.\" said by Nick\n\"So what if I am? The numbers don\u2019t lie and I have a great mentor.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, is that what she is? A mentor? Or is she a target? Like what you tried to pull with your families company?\" said by Nick\n\"Really, nick? I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re still throwing that back in my face.\" said by Nate\n\"And I can\u2019t believe you think a betrayal like that could be so easily forgotten. I mean, I gotta wonder how far you would have taken this if elena hadn\u2019t made you come clean. I mean, would you and my sister be running your family\u2019s company? The one you tried to steal from your cousins right now? What I find really interesting about this, nate, is my sister seems to be pretty central to all of your big power moves.\" said by Nick\n\"Believe me, nicholas will get past his initial upset and he\u2019ll realize that he truly needs this little break.\" said by Victoria\n\"I doubt that very much. Why are you forcing this on him? Especially with everything else that\u2019s going on in his life right now? I asked you not to push him, or at the very least, let him make the decision.\" said by Nikki\n\"You know how stubborn he can be. Besides, his ordeal with cameron and sally losing her baby, it\u2019s too much for anyone to handle all at once.\" said by Victoria\n\"Victoria, you should have let him make the call.\" said by Nikki\n\"I made the right decision for nicholas and for the company. He\u2013 he may not see that for himself right now.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, I\u2019m not sure I can see it either. So, what happens next? What\u2019s your next move?\" said by Nikki\n\"Next move? There is no next move. How many times do I have to say it? This isn\u2019t part of some scheme to oust my brother from the company and quite frankly, I am sick and tired of people second guessing my decisions for this company.\" said by Victoria\n\"What\u2019s going on? That\u2019s me before dawn powerwash.\" said by Victor\n\"Victoria has forced nicholas to take a leave of absence.\" said by Nikki\n\"Why would you do that?\" said by Victor\n\"Well, because she decided that with all the trauma, with sally losing her baby and cameron kirsten terrorizing sharon and faith, that he must take a break from the company, whether he wants to or not.\" said by Nikki\n\"Nicholas thinks that he can handle this all. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s wise. And I told him as much. And I\u2013 I brought up the idea of him taking a little time off.\" said by Victoria\n\"Which, if you recall, is exactly what I asked you after the whole ashland locke debacle, but you refused to take time off. You said you needed to focus on work.\" said by Nikki\n\"But\u2013 look, those are completely different situations. You can\u2019t compare the two. Three of the women in nick\u2019s life that he loves the most have been through horrific situations and they need him right now.\" said by Victoria\n\"Nicholas knows what he needs to do to take care of his family.\" said by Nikki\n\"Your brother is perfectly capable of focusing on his job while handling his personal affairs.\" said by Victor\n\"But this is not about his capability. I\u2019m not worried about that. What I\u2019m worried about is him carrying around this heavy burden on top of his workload. And look, newman is in a strong enough position. We can afford for nick to take a little time to himself. He\u2019ll thank me for it later,\" said by Victoria\n\"But who are you to make that decision for him?\" said by Nikki\n\"It\u2019s my decision to make. I am looking out for everyone concerned, including this company.\" said by Victoria\n\"Did you ever stop to think that nicholas needs a distraction like work with everything else that\u2019s going on with him right now?\" said by Nikki\n\"Why is everyone making such a big deal out of this?\" said by Victoria\n\"While I suspect that there\u2019s more at play here than you\u2019re saying. And I believe it has something to do with your relationship with nate hastings.\" said by Nikki\n\"You\u2019re way off the mark here, nick. There is no clandestine plan going on with victoria and me.\" said by Nate\n\"Why should i believe you?\" said by Nick\n\"Look, I know you\u2019re going through a lot of personal issues right now, and I get it. It\u2019s a lot for anyone to handle, so I\u2019m going to give you a break and cut you some slack this time.\" said by Nate\n\"Don\u2019t do that. Don\u2019t use that against me. You and victoria are using my personal issues to shove me aside.\" said by Nick\n\"Nobody is trying to shove you aside.\" said by Nate\n\"Nate, just stop, all right? And don\u2019t act like you didn\u2019t know vic was going to force me into this leave of absence. I mean, how long is it going to be before she makes you interim coo? Or has she done that already?\" said by Nick\n\"I don\u2019t regret that you heard me pour my heart out. Maybe if I\u2019d known you were listening, I wouldn\u2019t have opened up so completely, but I did. You heard it all. You heard the hard, painful truth.\" said by Adam\n\"Please, adam.\" said by Sally\n\"What? What, sally?\" said by Adam\n\"There\u2019s nothing that can change or fix this decision that you\u2019ve made. How can I ever forgive you? Why didn\u2019t you give the word to save our baby\u2019s life?\" said by Sally\n\"Don\u2019t you see? I couldn\u2019T. I had to give the word to save yours. She found it.\" said by Adam\n\"Don\u2019t\u2013 don\u2019t push me away. Just\u2013 just hear me out. How could you think that I could give a blanket permission that could take your life?\" said by Adam\n\"So, instead, you sacrificed our baby.\" said by Sally\n\"I had to make a lifesaving decision. Time was of the essence. Okay, when you\u2013 when you heard me before, you couldn\u2019t look into my eyes, but now you can. Sally, we have never been able to lie to each other with much success, but if you would just look at me, you will know that I mean every word. You will see how much I am grieving our little baby girl and how I will never get over something like that, but at least I\u2019m not grieving you. Even if I had opted to save the baby, there was no guarantee that she was going to live. I couldn\u2019t risk losing both of you. And I\u2019ll never regret saving you because you deserve to live.\" said by Adam\n\"Yes, but ava deserved to live too.\" said by Sally\n\"But you will be a mother again someday. You\u2019ll be the mother that you always wanted to be. And even though I won\u2019t be the father, your next baby will be the luckiest little being in the world. Because she\u2019ll have you as her mother. If I could only save one life for sure, it had to be yours.\" said by Adam\n\"Just go. Please just go.\" said by Sally\n\"Why would you assume that nick\u2019s leave of absence has anything to do with nate?\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, it\u2019s pretty obvious since he\u2019s already delegating newman media work to audra.\" said by Nikki\n\"And? Is there a problem with that? I mean, she is his coo.\" said by Victoria\n\"It\u2019s very presumptuous, victoria.\" said by Nikki\n\"Okay, fine, big deal. What if nate comes in here and helps me to run newman while nick\u2019s taking some time off? Look, he\u2019s already proven himself. He\u2019s smart. He\u2019s forward thinking. He\u2019s loyal. Dad, you said yourself how impressed you are with him.\" said by Victoria\n\"Sweetheart. You also happened to be romantically involved with him, don\u2019t you? Was he part of the decision making process before this started?\" said by Victor\n\"Or was it his idea from the very beginning?\" said by Nikki\n\"I refuse to be interrogated by my parents about this. Have you lost your confidence in my ability to do my job? Look, if you have a problem with the way that I\u2019m running this company, then why don\u2019t you just let me go?\" said by Victoria\n\"We struck a nerve, didn\u2019t we? That troubles me.\" said by Victor\n\"You\u2019ve been through a hell of an ordeal. Victoria thinks you can use this time. She is looking out for you and I\u2019m not looking to take your place.\" said by Nate\n\"All right, so if she asks, you\u2019re gonna say no?\" said by Nick\n\"Come on, nick.\" said by Nate\n\"I\u2019m looking at the big picture, nate. That is the future of my family\u2019s company.\" said by Nick\n\"You honestly don\u2019t believe I\u2019m a danger to this company now, do you? I care too much for victoria. I only want to help her, help newman. I\u2019m not trying to hurt it in any way and if she wants to make me interim coo, that\u2019s her call. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I have no reason to believe that\u2019s even part of her plan, but regardless, it\u2019s her decision to make.\" said by Nate\n\"See, I\u2019m not buying this innocent act of yours for one second, so let me break it down for you.\" said by Nick\n\"Go ahead.\" said by Nate\n\"I\u2019m not upset with vic. I know she loves and cares about me. She may have my best interests at heart, but you? You are the one I worry about. Because I think your plan is to take full advantage of this situation.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, hello there.\" said by Audra\n\"Uh-huh.\" said by Adam\n\"I\u2019ll have a bourbon, neat, please.\" said by Audra\n\"Do I even know you?\" said by Adam\n\"Not yet. But you should.\" said by Audra\n\"The young and the restless will continue.\" said by Announcer\n\"Excuse me, miss spectra? Here are your release papers. It\u2019s been approved. Someone will be in shortly to discuss these forms with you.\" said by Nurse\n\"Thank you.\" said by Sally\n\"Audra charles, coo newman media.\" said by Audra\n\"Whatever it is you want, miss charles, I\u2019m not interested. No matter how flirtatious you try to be.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, um\u2026 no flirtation intended. Look, I was merely curious about my new competition, that\u2019s all.\" said by Audra\n\"Well, yes, that is exactly what I am. I am your newest and most lethal competition.\" said by Adam\n\"Wow, that sounds almost ominous. How afraid should I be? Look, from what I understand here, company du jour, mccall is struggling to get back on its feet and a man with your track record doesn\u2019t help its chances.\" said by Audra\n\"I see you have done your research.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, it\u2019s hard to avoid the many sordid exploits of adam newman in this town.\" said by Audra\n\"Well, I wouldn\u2019t believe half of what you hear. But speaking of exploits, should I believe the one that you\u2019re soon going to be in charge of the whole show at newman media?\" said by Adam\n\"Where did you hear that?\" said by Audra\n\"Oh, I have a pretty good handle on nate hastings. Victoria and he have gotten involved in, what would you say, um, extracurricular kind of affair, but I\u2019m sure you already know that. So, I can only assume that victoria will soon be dragging him into the business of the parent company. Something I\u2019m sure that nate covets.\" said by Adam\n\"Hmm, well, looks like you\u2019ve done quite a bit of research on your own.\" said by Audra\n\"Mm-hmm, enough to know that newman media is going to need somebody that\u2019s perfectly positioned to step up.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, who am i to speculate, but if you are right, I am more than ready.\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah, I just bet you are.\" said by Adam\n\"This is really weighing on you, isn\u2019t?\" said by Nikki\n\"Yeah. I mean, it\u2019s not only nicholas and victoria, it\u2019s the whole family is at odds. I don\u2019t like it.\" said by Victor\n\"I can\u2019t argue with that.\" said by Nikki\n\"Adam lost his child. We almost lost beautiful faith to that cameron bastard. And everyone is going off in all kinds of directions.\" said by Victor\n\"It does seem that way. Faith is going back to school, victoria\u2019s trying to drive nicholas away.\" said by Nikki\n\"And you know, adam\u2026 is clearly on a downward spiral.\" said by Victor\n\"Not to mention noah\u2019s departure. And johnny and katie are going to be heading to boarding school this fall.\" said by Nikki\n\"You know how upsetting that is to me? Considering that I had thought I had imbued everyone with a sense of, \u201cfamily sticks together, whatever problems we have, we resolve it together.\u201d\" said by Victor\n\"And you did an excellent job of that. Believe me, they know it deep in their heart. Sometimes, they just need a little reminding.\" said by Nikki\n\"I guess you\u2019re right. But one thing I can assure you. I bet you nate hastings has something to do with our son\u2019s departure.\" said by Victor\n\"You know, nick\u2026 I remember when we were friends. What happened? When did that stop?\" said by Nate\n\"Maybe it\u2019s when you lied to my face about being with elena while she was with devon. Now\u2026 everybody knows my story. Who am I to throw stones about infidelity? So, it\u2019s probably because you betrayed your family when you tried to sell out neil\u2019s company.\" said by Nick\n\"Man. [ Chuckling ] You really won\u2019t let that go, will you?\" said by Nate\n\"He was my friend. The loyalty that neil showed to the people he cared about, his family and friends was unmatched.

I\u2019m not loyal to the people I love like my uncle was?\" said by Nate\n\"Nate, do you think what you did was loyal?\" said by Nick\n\"Nick, I ultimately did not betray anyone. Yes, I was angry at being overlooked and constantly demoralized, but in the end\u2026 I couldn\u2019t, couldn\u2019t go through with it.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, look at that. Obviously, there\u2019s a conscience in there somewhere.\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2019ve tried to make up for it ever since.

It\u2019s like they\u2019re living separate lives.\" said by Diane\n\"None of this has been easy for either of them. None of this has been easy for us. What with phyllis alive, and you out from under these charges, I\u2019m hoping that life can get back to some semblance of normal. All of the stress will start to slowly go away and that will be better for everyone. Summer and kyle included. And we will be there for them, but until then, tonight, this is about you. About your courage, about your strength. It\u2019s a celebration of you. So, where do we go now?\" said by Jack\n\"I think I\u2019m going back to the bar to get my drink.

Of course you do.\" said by Kyle\n\"I love you.\" said by Summer\n\"I love you, too. And I will always be on your side. And I will be waiting here when you get back. Unless you want me to come with you.\" said by Kyle\n\"No! Uh\u2026 I mean you should\u2013 you should stay here and celebrate with your folks. I mean, your family is healing, and the least I can do is try to do the same for mine.\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m sure you have enough going on without babysitting me. You missed all those calls from sally. Is she okay?\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, uh\u2026 news isn\u2019t great. Apparently, sally\u2019s at risk for pre-eclampsia.\" said by Nick\n\"Nick, that\u2019s serious.\" said by Sharon\n\"I know. So she\u2019s gonna scale back her work, and, uh, try and take it easy. A lot more rest. Get on the meds, and uh\u2026 lot of monitoring.\" said by Nick\n\"Maybe you should go and be with her right now.\" said by Sharon\n\"Ah, she\u2019s home. She\u2019s safe now. I\u2019ll feel a lot better when I get you home. You know, with cameron kirsten on the loose, we all have to be on defcon one right now.\" said by Nick\n\"Still can\u2019t believe he approached faith, and it\u2019s totally my fault.\" said by Sharon\n\"Why would you say that?\" said by Nick\n\"Because when cameron delivered that cigar box to the front porch, faith was there. I could have warned her, right then, what was going on, to be careful. Maybe then, she would have run the other direction when cameron approached her in the park. I thought that I was protecting her. I was\u2026 leaving her to be vulnerable.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, she knows now.\" said by Nick\n\"I told her about everything that happened with cameron after you and chance left.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, I\u2019m sure that wasn\u2019t easy, but faith needed to know. She needed the truth. We all have to have our eyes wide open right now.\" said by Nick\n\"Every time I open the door, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m gonna run into another one of cameron\u2019s sick gifts. And I have a feeling his head games are just getting started.\" said by Sharon\n\"Thank you.\" said by Diane\n\"Shouldn\u2019t leave your drink unattended like that.\" said by Cameron\n\"Excuse me?\" said by Diane\n\"Your martini. It\u2019s been sitting there for a while. You shouldn\u2019t do that. Any kind of creep could come along, drop something in it. No one would notice. You got no idea what some people will do.\" said by Cameron\n\"I think it\u2019s okay.\" said by Diane\n\"Just saying. You can\u2019t trust anybody.\" said by Cameron\n\"Well, I\u2013 I think I can trust anyone here. I come here all the time, with\u2013 with my husband, and between the two of us, we know everyone in this room.\" said by Diane\n\"Do you know me?\" said by Cameron\n\"Excuse me, I\u2019m going back to the table with my husband.\" said by Diane\n\"Smart move. Family is just very important.\" said by Cameron\n\"So, you think this guy touched your drink?\" said by Jack\n\"Well, I\u2013 I don\u2019t know, it was just kind of disturbing.\" said by Diane\n\"You didn\u2019t recognize him at all?\" said by Jack\n\"Well, he looked familiar.\" said by Diane\n\"Incoming.\" said by Jack\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Diane\n\"How\u2019d you do it?\" said by Victor\n\"Yes, how did you do it, diane? I mean, michael is a good attorney, but even he can\u2019t get you off on murder charges. You must\u2019ve lied through your teeth to convince them to let you free.\" said by Nikki\n\"Didn\u2019t need to lie, nikki. I\u2019m innocent.\" said by Diane\n\"Summer!\" said by Jack\n\"What\u2019s she doing here?\" said by Diane\n\"Join us, sweetheart.\" said by Victor\n\"Thank you.\" said by Daniel\n\"I know where she is.\" said by Summer\n\"How is she?\" said by Daniel\n\"She\u2019s not turning herself in. I know that much. Not until we can be sure that she can get her life back.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay. Okay, so, wh\u2013 what\u2019s the plan? What do we do?\" said by Daniel\n\"There\u2019s no \u201cwe,\u201d daniel. I told you that she\u2019s safe. That\u2019s all that you need to know. I\u2019m handling this on my own, without your special brand of help.\" said by Summer\n\"Is this you, mom?\" said by Daniel\n\"The idea of that creep, cameron, being anywhere near faith, or you?\" said by Nick\n\"Nick, promise me that you won\u2019t do anything.\" said by Sharon\n\"You mean like throw his ass out of an airplane again?\" said by Nick\n\"You know I\u2026 blocked all those memories out, for years, but\u2026 lately, they\u2019ve been coming back to me. I know that I was young and stupid, but I\u2019m still ashamed of what I did.\" said by Sharon\n\"You were confused. And hurt.\" said by Nick\n\"My choices brought that madman into our lives. If you hadn\u2019t saved me from cameron\u2019s plane that night\u2026\" said by Sharon\n\"It all worked out. And we\u2019re gonna beat him this time, too.\" said by Nick\n\"I was terrified. I was afraid of you finding out what cameron did. I was afraid of going to the police, and it just made everything so much worse.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah. When I found out what he did to you\u2026 I wanted to break him in half. But not this time. I\u2019m so much smarter now, so we\u2019re gonna\u2013 we\u2019re gonna let the police handle it. Along with chance, they will make sure he ends up back in prison. Speaking of which, have you heard from chance?\" said by Nick\n\"Uh, no.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, you know cameron\u2019s not who he was either. He may have all his millions, but he\u2019s got a record now. That means he\u2019s not untouchable.\" said by Nick\n\"You know what scares me?\" said by Sharon\n\"What?\" said by Nick\n\"I don\u2019t think he cares.

She contacted daniel. She told him everything, that she was in this really vulnerable place and stark manipulated her into marrying him and then faking her death to frame diane for murder.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh! Well, of course he did. He\u2019s a very evil man.\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh, really?\" said by Diane\n\"Where\u2019s phyllis now?\" said by Victor\n\"I don\u2019t know. She\u2019s on the run. She\u2019s the one that killed stark.\" said by Summer\n\"My god!\" said by Nikki\n\"It was self-defense! It was, I mean, mom realized what a huge mistake she mad and she wanted to come home, but stark, he wouldn\u2019t let her. He attacked her and she had to\u2013 and now she\u2019s just\u2013 she\u2019s terrified. She\u2019s afraid of the charges that she might be facing.\" said by Summer\n\"This is unbelievable. I\u2013 I\u2019m so sorry you have to go through this.\" said by Nikki\n\"I have to hold on to the fact that my mom\u2019s alive, you know? And for the rest of it, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here to see daniel. We\u2019ve gotta figure out what\u2013 what comes next.\" said by Summer\n\"What comes next? So, the woman has the guts to come face you and your brother, and then face the music, the consequence of her actions.\" said by Victor\n\"Grandpa, it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s really complicated. I\u2013 look, I gotta go. I gotta go meet daniel, I\u2019m sorry.\" said by Summer\n\"Darling, if there\u2019s anything that we can do, please call.\" said by Nikki\n\"Okay, sweetheart.\" said by Victor\n\"Thank you. Thanks.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, poor summer.\" said by Nikki\n\"Mmm.\" said by Diane\n\"This is stunning. Always alive, while letting her children think that she\u2019s dead. They mourn over her.

Have a good evening.\" said by Jack\n\"Get your card. Good. Good night.\" said by Diane\n\"Ah, there you are. Come in.\" said by Phyllis\n\"How did you know that I was out there?\" said by Summer\n\"Finally! I\u2019ve been waiting for hours, summer.\" said by Phyllis\n\"No, you have not been waiting for hours, and mom, I thought that we agreed that you wouldn\u2019t text me when I would be with kyle.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, there are more important things than tiptoeing around kyle, summer\u2013\" said by Phyllis\n\"Oh, because everything is about you right now?\" said by Summer\n\"No, it\u2019s about you and your brother, actually.\" said by Phyllis\n\"It\u2019s not about me and my brother. This is about you wanting to see daniel, right? But mom, we already had this conversation. I already told you. And I told you why you can\u2019t see daniel, because if he saw you, if he knew where you were, he would go straight to the police, because he is all about the truth, and you would go to jail, so no, you can\u2019t see daniel!\" said by Summer\n\"About that\u2026\" said by Phyllis\n\"Oh, my god, are you serious right now?\" said by Summer\n\"Might be too late.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Hello?\" said by Daniel\n\"Oh.\" said by Phyllis\n\"No, you\u2019ve gotta be kidding me.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay, I didn\u2019t want to make things worse.\" said by Phyllis\n\"How could it get any worse than it is right now?\" said by Summer\n\"You and your brother are at odds. This is my fault, summer. I had to take matters into my own hands.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Hello?\" said by Daniel\n\"I guess I\u2019ll get it.\" said by Summer\n\"Summer. What are you doing here? Wha\u2013 what the hell is going on? Did you send me this weird text?\" said by Daniel\n\"I did.\" said by Phyllis\n\"You know what? I don\u2019t want to talk about cameron anymore. In fact, I\u2019m going to proclaim this a cameron-free zone. So, let\u2019s clean up this place, and then I will take you home.

I reached out to our associates in milano. Thomas and hope, they\u2019re very excited about doing press, so they wanna set up some social engagements.\" said by Carter\n\"The more exposure, the better.\" said by Eric\n\"Yeah. Okay. Uh, but they need to focus on what they\u2019re doing, right? Let\u2019s not have them run around having their picture taken.\" said by Ridge\n\"Eh, that\u2019s part of the fun, isn\u2019t it? I mean, every time you and brooke went over there, you were front page news. Is\u2013 is brooke going with you?\" said by Eric\n\"Is brooke go\u2013 why?\" said by Ridge\n\"Well, hope for the future is her daughter\u2019s line. Shouldn\u2019t she go?\" said by Eric\n\"You know what, dad? You\u2019re not as subtle as you think you are. Thomas is lead designer, so should taylor go as well? Or what do you think?\" said by Ridge\n\"I love this. I like this a lot. I like when we veer from the meeting and we explore your love life.\" said by Carter\n\"My love life?\" said by Ridge\n\"Yeah.\" said by Carter\n\"There\u2019s no love life. Those two women, they\u2019ve sworn off of me for whatever reason.\" said by Ridge\n\"I\u2019m telling you, dad, there\u2019s nothing wrong. I mean, that is the problem. But I\u2019m tired of everybody worrying about me constantly.\" said by Hope\n\"Should I be worried? I\u2013 I mean, am I falling down at the job here?\" said by Deacon\n\"No.\" said by Hope\n\"Hope, listen, you can come to me anytime you want. You know that, right? If you wanna talk. Is that what this is about?\" said by Deacon\n\"No, I don\u2019t wanna talk about this, okay? Liam has already been concerned about thomas and me working together for a while now.\" said by Hope\n\"Can\u2019t say I blame the guy.\" said by Deacon\n\"Except there\u2019s no reason to be anymore, dad. I mean, it\u2019s like I keep trying to reassure him and everybody else that thomas is fine now and no matter how hard I try, no one believes me.\" said by Hope\n\"Define fine.\" said by Deacon\n\"He\u2019s better.\" said by Hope\n\"Better\u2013 better than how crazy he was five minutes ago, better? I mean, it\u2019s a pretty low bar, hope.\" said by Deacon\n\"He is a professional. He has been a gentleman. He\u2019s a better father to douglas now and let\u2019s not forget, he is a very, very valuable part of my team.\" said by Hope\n\"Okay. All right.\" said by Deacon\n\"Okay.\" said by Hope\n\"Great. I\u2013 I\u2019m honestly happy to hear that, you know? I mean, look, I trust you not to put yourself in a tough situation, all right? You\u2013 you get your best qualities from your mother, but you get your street smarts from me, all right? You know your own feelings. I mean, look, if thomas isn\u2019t setting off alarm bells, you know, you\u2019re not getting that weird twisty feeling in your gut, I\u2019m gonna say that you probably don\u2019t have to stress about it. I mean, you know, you\u2019re closer than anyone. Seeing him with new eyes, I guess. I\u2019ll be right back.\" said by Deacon\n\"Hope has logan blood in her? What is that supposed to mean?\" said by Brooke\n\"Let\u2019s see if I can clarify it. Honestly, it just means that hope has logan blood in her.\" said by Taylor\n\"Oh, my god.\" said by Brooke\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Taylor\n\"Seriously?\" said by Brooke\n\"Seriously.\" said by Taylor\n\"Seriously, you\u2019re gonna go there?\" said by Brooke\n\"Come on, brooke. I\u2019m not\u2013 I\u2019m not trying to fight or anything. No. But I will always defend my family and thomas has changed. He\u2019s doing so well. You have nothing to worry about when it comes to him working with hope, unless\u2026\" said by Taylor\n\"Unless what?\" said by Brooke\n\"Well, unless hope is the one having inappropriate feelings for my son.\" said by Taylor\n\"Oh, my god. I\u2013 I thought we were friends.\" said by Brooke\n\"Well, friends can disagree.\" said by Taylor\n\"Respectfully.\" said by Brooke\n\"Right.\" said by Taylor\n\"Right.\" said by Brooke\n\"See, I have been very respectful about the way that you feel about my son. I don\u2019t understand why\u2013 why is it wrong for me to share my feelings with you?\" said by Taylor\n\"It\u2019s not the same thing, taylor.\" said by Brooke\n\"Oh, okay. Okay.\" said by Taylor\n\"You know what? You know what? Our pact meant a lot to me and I don\u2019t want anything to happen to our friendship here, so I\u2019m gonna do the right thing and I\u2019m gonna take myself out before I say something that I\u2019m gonna regret.\" said by Brooke\n\"Well, it\u2019s too late for that.\" said by Taylor\n\"Don\u2019t wanna take you away\" said by Deacon\n\"I knew I came to the right place.\" said by Hope\n\"Any time, kiddo.\" said by Deacon\n\"Well, I, uh, don\u2019t wanna take you away from your customers.\" said by Hope\n\"Are you kidding me? Look, if my daughter wants to come in and talk to me, there\u2019s nothing more important.\" said by Deacon\n\"Well, I actually didn\u2019t, uh, just come for pep talk or delicious food. I\u2013 I do have some news.\" said by Hope\n\"Give.\" said by Deacon\n\"My big press event.\" said by Hope\n\"Uh-huh.\" said by Deacon\n\"It\u2019s happening in rome.\" said by Hope\n\"Oh, you\u2019ve gotta be kidding me. That is so fantastic.\" said by Deacon\n\"I know.\" said by Hope\n\"It\u2019s fantastic. You know how much I love italy.\" said by Deacon\n\"Absolutely. And\u2013 and it is just so exciting to me. The planning and the preparation. I mean, the whole office is buzzing.\" said by Hope\n\"I would say that you\u2019re buzzing.\" said by Deacon\n\"Yeah. Well, you know, I\u2019ve done business overseas in the past, but something about this time, it just feels different.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah. You\u2019re launching a new collection. I mean, you gotta do it up big. I know you\u2019re gonna kill it.\" said by Deacon\n\"Thanks, dad.\" said by Hope\n\"I just want you to know, I\u2019m so proud of everything that you\u2019re doing, all your accomplishments. More than anything, I\u2019m just proud of who you are. Can\u2019t believe you came from me.\" said by Deacon\n\"Um, what was that you were saying a little bit ago about, uh, street smarts?\" said by Hope\n\"Just wish that I\u2019d been around to watch you grow up, you know, watch you grow into this incredible person.\" said by Deacon\n\"Yeah. Hey, you\u2019re here now.\" said by Hope\n\"Damn straight. I\u2019m not going anywhere. I know I messed up a lot in the past, but that part of my life is finished. The best thing that I have ever done with a little help from brooke is make a remarkable woman like you.\" said by Deacon\n\"That\u2019s good. Just a couple of things you need to check on.\" said by Ridge\n\"Yeah. I\u2019ll make sure we photograph all the locked items. And, you know, uh, by the by, I just want you to know I have this phrase book almost totally memorized. Just, you know, in case you need me at the last, uh, at the last, uh\u2026 momento.\" said by Charlie\n\"No, that\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s great. If we have any frogs that need lipstick, we\u2019ll give you a call.\" said by Ridge\n\"Oh, sure. Well, yeah. Yeah. Well, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, fosse, uh, uh, possibilimente, huh?\" said by Charlie\n\"Sure.\" said by Ridge\n\"Yeah.\" said by Charlie\n\"Okay.\" said by Ridge\n\"Are you okay? Well, uh, ciao, ciao.\" said by Charlie\n\"Ciao.\" said by Ridge\n\"Ciao [Indistinct].\" said by Charlie\n\"Okay. No, it\u2019s good. I\u2019ll look at the thing. All right. Almost there.\" said by Ridge\n\"All right. Good. It\u2019s good we have a moment alone together.\" said by Eric\n\"What\u2019s up?\" said by Ridge\n\"Look\u2026 you know how much I love having family around. I love that you\u2019re staying at the house.\" said by Eric\n\"You\u2019re throwing me out right now, aren\u2019t you?\" said by Ridge\n\"I am not throwing you out right now.\" said by Eric\n\"You are politely asking me to get out.\" said by Ridge\n\"No, there\u2019s not a polite way to ask somebody to get out and that\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing. You can stay as long as you want. I\u2019m just surprised that you feel you still need to and that the situation hasn\u2019t resolved itself by now.\" said by Eric\n\"Dad\u2026\" said by Ridge\n\"Look, you and brooke are capable of making your own decision by yourselves.\" said by Eric\n\"She\u2019s made her decision.\" said by Ridge\n\"Yeah. And you know where I stand on that. You and brooke belong together. You always have and you always will.\" said by Eric\n\"Oh, glad you\u2019re both here. I need to confirm some details for the preview.\" said by Brooke\n\"Uh-huh.\" said by Eric\n\"If I\u2019m not interrupting.\" said by Brooke\n\"No, you\u2019re not. In fact, it\u2019s perfect timing. I have some things I have to do and I\u2019m sure the two of you can sort things out on your own. You\u2019re perfectly capable.\" said by Eric\n\"Uh, okay. What is that supposed to mean?\" said by Brooke\n\"Oh, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure. It\u2019s dad. He, um, you know how he feels about us.\" said by Ridge\n\"Hey, forget something?\" said by Deacon\n\"Um, yeah. Ironically, I\u2013 I did. Um, I forgot that brooke logan is brooke logan. I brought in ensure max protein with 30g of protein.\" said by Taylor\n\"Eric\u2019s always been very supportive, very encouraging.\" said by Brooke\n\"Mm-hmm. Yeah. But he did give me a bit of a kick in the pants today, which I wasn\u2019t expecting. He, um, he doesn\u2019t wanna be my landlord anymore.\" said by Ridge\n\"Well, that\u2019s not true. He misses you when you\u2019re not around.\" said by Brooke\n\"Maybe. But, uh, I think he\u2019d rather have me live somewhere else.\" said by Ridge\n\"Oh, so he thinks that we should work things out.\" said by Brooke\n\"Mm-hmm. He\u2019s not subtle about it.\" said by Ridge\n\"No.\" said by Brooke\n\"You know him. He\u2019s got an opinion, it\u2019ll just\u2013 it\u2013 it\u2019ll come out. He\u2019ll tell everybody. His kids, grandkids. He\u2019s always been your champion.\" said by Ridge\n\"Yeah, he\u2019s always had my back.\" said by Brooke\n\"And why wouldn\u2019t he? Look at you. You\u2019re so beautiful, talented, great mom.\" said by Ridge\n\"Okay. Keep going. I could use all the compliments I could get today.\" said by Brooke\n\"You\u2019re kind, you\u2019re caring. You\u2013 you\u2019re great.\" said by Ridge\n\"I\u2019m kidding.\" said by Brooke\n\"Okay. You\u2019re fun at a party. Even more fun after the party.\" said by Ridge\n\"Oh, my god. Okay.\" said by Brooke\n\"I miss you.\" said by Ridge\n\"I miss you.\" said by Brooke\n\"Do I need to remind you that you and brooke are supposed to be friends now?\" said by Deacon\n\"Yes, I know. Do you think maybe you could remind brooke that we are?\" said by Taylor\n\"Okay. Maybe I was getting mixed signals here, but it seemed to me like you were trying to get me and brooke together so that you\u2019d have a clear path to ridge.\" said by Deacon\n\"No. That\u2013 that is not what I was doing. No, that\u2013 that\u2019s not what I was doing. I\u2013 I was just\u2013 I was trying to do what was best for everyone at that point. I\u2013 you know, deacon, you\u2019ve loved brooke for a long time. You\u2013 you have a child together. Your feelings for her have never changed.\" said by Taylor\n\"Pretty sure she doesn\u2019t have the same ones.\" said by Deacon\n\"Well, but I\u2013 I was just saying, hey, give it a chance. You never know. You gotta go for it. And how great would it be if hope had her family together?\" said by Taylor\n\"Taylor, come on. Knock it off. You didn\u2019t come all the way down here to tell me that hope wants to see her parents reunited. What\u2019s going on with you? Just talk to me.\" said by Deacon\n\"Something\u2019s going on. I\u2013 I\u2013 I\u2019m not trusting brooke. I\u2019m not trusting our pact. I\u2019m not trusting anything right now. We had some words.\" said by Taylor\n\"Okay. Look, if the\u2013 the gloves are coming off, maybe I wanna take cover.\" said by Deacon\n\"But deacon, I\u2013 I wasn\u2019t, and I\u2019m not trying to manipulate brooke or stab her in the back. I just really believe that\u2013 well, you are a catch, you know. You\u2019re\u2013 you\u2019re handsome and you\u2019re successful and charming and\u2013\" said by Taylor\n\"All right. I\u2013 I\u2013 I\u2013 stop, dr. Freud. You\u2019re gonna overinflate my ego. It doesn\u2019t need any help.\" said by Deacon\n\"No, I\u2019m serious, deacon. I just wish you could see what I see.\" said by Taylor\n\"Well, you really are good at what you do, aren\u2019t you? \u2018Cause you have got a knack for making people feel good about themselves.\" said by Deacon\n\"Yes. Well, that is why I get paid the big bucks.\" said by Taylor\n\"And because you\u2019re a world renowned psychiatrist.\" said by Deacon\n\"That\u2019s right. And don\u2019t you forget it.\" said by Taylor\n\"How could I?\" said by Deacon\n\"Deacon, after today, I\u2026 oh, I don\u2019t know. I, um\u2026 I think you might be able to help.\" said by Taylor\n\"Okay.\" said by Deacon\n\"You might just be the key, deacon.\" said by Taylor\n\"Me?\" said by Deacon\n\"To ending this toxic, destructive cycle that\u2019s been going on for so long. You need to call brooke. You need to do it, deacon. Do it now.\" said by ", "answer": "Taylor"}

I should get back to work.\" said by Ashley\n\"Hold on. Not until you\u2019ve told me why you\u2019ve been distracted this whole time. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve grown inured to my charms.\" said by Tucker\n\"Is that even humanly possible?\" said by Ashley\n\"No.\" said by Tucker\n\"It\u2019s her.\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, diane?\" said by Tucker\n\"Of course. How did this happen? How is she out on bail and living with us?\" said by Ashley\n\"Karmic payback for something we did in our past life, or this one? Hard to say.\" said by Tucker\n\"You know, I don\u2019t understand. Jack and kyle think she\u2019s so wonderful. They think she\u2019s a saint after everything that she\u2019s done to them and now she\u2019s charged with murder. It doesn\u2019t matter. How does she pull this off?\" said by Ashley\n\"She\u2019s a master manipulator. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re so upset about it.\" said by Tucker\n\"How could I not be upset? Jack thinks I\u2019m unreasonable because I have qualms about sharing a home with somebody who\u2019s been accused of murder. She can\u2019t go anywhere because of her ankle monitor. I\u2019m stuck with her. God, then she\u2019s driven this huge wedge between jack and me.\" said by Ashley\n\"How does any judge allow a flight risk like diane out on bail? The woman knows how to disappear.\" said by Tucker\n\"[ Sighs] I wish she\u2019d do it again.\" said by Ashley\n\"[ Groans] There, are you satisfied? Can I get back to work now?\" said by Sally\n\"Sally, great news. Mccall is officially all mine.\" said by Adam\n\"Congratulations.\" said by Sally\n\"Victor agreed to my terms. No meddling.

But I have been digging into the mess that tucker made and I am eager to get my team in place. There\u2019s so much to do and I think that you\u2019re gonna be as excited by the challenge as I am.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, I have to talk to chloe before I can get back to you about the offer.\" said by Sally\n\"This could be a real opportunity for us to turn a total failure into a major success.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay. I will let you know.\" said by Sally\n\"Sounds like good news. Let me guess, jill loved your pitch and is ready to offer you a lucrative contract.\" said by Nick\n\"Not quite. I need to talk to you about something.\" said by Sally\n\"Okay.\" said by Nick\n\"But I need you to promise me to hear me out and not rush to judgment.\" said by Sally\n\"What\u2019s going on? She\u2019s feeling the power of listerine.\" said by Nick\n\"I realize that having diane under the same roof is a nightmare for you, but let\u2019s not forget that you also invited me into your home.\" said by Tucker\n\"I know, I\u2019m partially to blame for the tension.\" said by Ashley\n\"No, no, no, no, no.\" said by Tucker\n\"I get it.\" said by Ashley\n\"No, what I\u2019m saying is while I\u2019m there, it will be my mission to distract you with more, uh, pleasurable thoughts.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh. Well, I like that. It\u2019s not good for me to be so angry all the time.\" said by Ashley\n\"No, it isn\u2019T. And if it\u2019s any consolation, I\u2019m gonna do my best to make sure that diane\u2019s stay is as unpleasant for her as possible.\" said by Tucker\n\"Okay.\" said by Ashley\n\"Ashley.\" said by Adam\n\"How are you?\" said by Adam\n\"Good.\" said by Ashley\n\"Tucker. Enjoying early retirement? It must be nice to be out from under the burden of a failing empire.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, adam, as the buddha said, sitting under the bodhi tree, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you kiss my ass?\u201d\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, in case you haven\u2019t heard, mccall unlimited is mine. I\u2019m now in charge of trying to salvage your failed company.\" said by Adam\n\"I did hear that. I\u2013 I heard that victor intended to hand it over to you, as a bailout for your failures at jabot and newman.\" said by Tucker\n\"[ Chuckles ] Uh, actually, victor knew that I wanted a challenge. It\u2019s kind of hard to know what to tackle first. I mean, the mismanaged books and the exodus of any talented staff you once had, or just the terrible mccall name. I mean, can I ask you a serious question? How did you let things get so bad?\" said by Adam\n\"I think he was busy becoming a better person, adam, and got a little distracted. Didn\u2019t notice that incompetence had kind of run into the ground.\" said by Ashley\n\"Mm. Well, self-improvement can be a burden.\" said by Adam\n\"How would you know?\" said by Ashley\n\"Uh, luckily, I understand the value of a work-life balance. Although that\u2013 that\u2019s gonna be put to the test trying to make this company better.\" said by Adam\n\"Ooh, that\u2019s hilarious. You should be so grateful that you are allowed to run anything bigger than a lemonade stand.\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, it\u2019s gonna be fun\u2013\" said by Adam\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Ashley\n\"\u2014 Turning this into a major success, something much bigger than you could\u2019ve ever imagined.\" said by Adam\n\"I hope it flourishes.

You\u2019ve reached enlightenment.\" said by Adam\n\"[ Sighs ] Bye, adam.\" said by Ashley\n\"Have a nice lunch.\" said by Adam\n\"[ Whispers ] How did you not just punch him in the face?\" said by Ashley\n\"It\u2019s just mesmerizing watching you come to my defense like that. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m\u2013 if I\u2019m just moved or a little bit turned on right now.\" said by Tucker\n\"Really?\" said by Ashley\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Tucker\n\"I\u2019m frustrated that the adams and the dianes of the world are actually failing upwards.\" said by Ashley\n\"Right here.\" said by Tucker\n\"What are you doing?\" said by Ashley\n\"You can say whatever you want. I\u2019m starting to believe that you actually care for me.\" said by Tucker\n\"Um\u2026\" said by Ashley\n\"It\u2019s good to see you out and about. Nick said that you\u2019ve been spending a lot of your time alone and you haven\u2019t replied to his texts or calls. He\u2019s worried about you.\" said by Sharon\n\"Uh, yeah, I\u2019ve just been trying to conserve my energy for harrison. Trying to keep things as normal as possible for him, which is a challenge.\" said by Summer\n\"I get wanting to conserve your energy right now. But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to go through this alone. You know, there are plenty of people who love you and understand what you\u2019re going through. The grief, the shock, the pain, the anger, whatever it is that you\u2019re feeling, it\u2019s perfectly normal under these circumstances. Just know there is a community of people here for you every step of the way.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah. To be honest, sharon, I mean, all the support, it\u2019s actually just making me feel like I need to take care of other people\u2019s feelings about my well-being. And it\u2019s just easier to be alone. So, thank you for the hug and for the coffee. I promise I will answer my dad.\" said by Summer\n\"Excuse me. Um, sorry, I need to talk to my sister, please?\" said by Daniel\n\"Uh, I was hoping to have some more time to think this through, but now it seems I have to make a decision sooner than I thought.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, I\u2019m ready to be a sounding board.\" said by Nick\n\"So, chloe and I got some not-great news. Jill does not want to lock us into a contract. Maybe down the road, but not right now.\" said by Sally\n\"Really? That is surprising. I thought you had a killer pitch and you guys were gonna close that deal today.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, I mean, I thought it was gonna happen, too, but jill delivered the bad news before we even had a chance to present our newest plans.\" said by Sally\n\"Okay. Uh, good news delayed.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah. I mean, it could still happen, but that would mean hoping for a maybe as opposed to betting on a sure thing.\" said by Sally\n\"You can\u2019t knock a sure thing.\" said by Nick\n\"Right. Which is exactly why I\u2019m giving this serious consideration.\" said by Sally\n\"Does this mean you\u2019re ready to take me up on my proposal to invest in your business? Because, sally, I would love to partner with you on this.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Laughs softly ] Um, it\u2019s actually about another opportunity.\" said by Sally\n\"Why are you being cagey?\" said by Nick\n\"Because it would mean working at mccall. For adam.\" said by Sally\n\"Are you actually considering taking the job?\" said by Nick\n\"Well, I have to make a living, so\u2026 yeah.\" said by Sally\n\"But my offer to help you set up your own business was met with a resounding no. But you\u2019re willing to go and work with adam at this company my father bought for him? In what capacity?\" said by Nick\n\"I don\u2019t know, adam didn\u2019t go into details. And like I said, I don\u2019t even know how I feel about it. I thought I was gonna have more time to think this through, but that was adam on the phone and he\u2019s eager to get his team in place.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, this is clearly his way to insinuate himself back into your life. He saw an opportunity and boom, there you go. I mean, he will do whatever it takes to stay close to you.\" said by Nick\n\"Right. Because it couldn\u2019t possibly be about my skill set you know, I did a pretty great job as C.O.O. And C.E.O. Of newman. So, maybe adam recognizes that?\" said by Sally\n\"That\u2019s why i wanted to invest in you. That\u2019s why I fought so hard for you to stay at newman. Why I went to bat to get you that second meeting with jill, because I believe in your talent. That\u2019s why I advocate for you every day.\" said by Nick\n\"Right. Unless it involves working with adam.\" said by Sally\n\"Look, he just\u2013 he always has an agenda. He and my father are alike in that way. You\u2019re kidding yourself if you don\u2019t think my father\u2019s gonna have a hand in everything that goes on there.\" said by Nick\n\"He\u2019s giving adam carte blanche to run it the way that he wants.\" said by Sally\n\"Is that what he told you? Sally, he bought that company so he could get adam back under control. I\u2019m telling you, you\u2019re walking into a minefield. This is my dad and adam trying to exert control over you, and you and your baby don\u2019t need that.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, well, hello. Are you gonna try to kick me out of the office, too?\" said by Ashley\n\"No, I just came to pick up some work to take home.\" said by Jack\n\"Of course, because the woman who\u2019s in lockdown must be kept company at all costs.\" said by Ashley\n\"Ash, I am too tired to do this with you. Could we just put a pin in this fight over diane and talk to each other? You\u2019re my sister. I care a great deal about you and I\u2013 I\u2013 I miss you.\" said by Jack\n\"Okay. Okay. I have a couple of minutes, sure.\" said by Ashley\n\"Okay.\" said by Jack\n\"So, what did you want to discuss?\" said by Ashley\n\"I want to talk about us, about this. This tension, I hate it.\" said by Jack\n\"I don\u2019t like it very much either, jack.\" said by Ashley\n\"Look, I know diane is not your favorite person, but are you really this bitter and angry?\" said by Jack\n\"I am, unfortunately.\" said by Ashley\n\"I don\u2019t buy that.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, do you want to tell me how I\u2019m feeling?\" said by Ashley\n\"I think you\u2019re using me and diane as a punching bag to avoid some realities in your own life.\" said by Jack\n\"Okay. So, what am I avoiding exactly?\" said by Ashley\n\"The possibility that you are not as tough and in control of your life as you pretend to be. I think these attacks are defensive. I think it\u2019s about self-preservation. I think you\u2019re trying to avoid feelings that you have for tucker that you know you shouldn\u2019t have.\" said by Jack\n\"Hi.\" said by Tucker\n\"You know what I love most about this house? How spacious it is. Don\u2019t you have somewhere else you could be?\" said by Diane\n\"I gotta give you credit. You\u2019re back to the old diane, you know? Tenacious nerves of steel. Although, I\u2019m amazed you\u2019re willing to take this chance.\" said by Tucker\n\"You know, clearly you\u2019re looking to bother me with this conversation. So, why don\u2019t you go ahead and say what you want to say so I can go back to enjoying some fresh air and sunshine? Hmm? Hey, go ahead. You got my attention.\" said by Diane\n\"How can you accept all of sharon\u2019s sympathy and kindness? It\u2019s like every second you stood there, it was like another lie.\" said by Daniel\n\"Oh, my\u2013 why are you being like this?\" said by Summer\n\"Like what?\" said by Daniel\n\"And you want to send your husband\u2019s mother to prison for a crime she didn\u2019t commit. How is that the solution?\" said by Daniel\n\"Oh\u2013 that\u2019s not what I want. And I think you know that. But you weren\u2019t there when mom came to me. You didn\u2019t hear directly from her the hell that she\u2019s been going through.\" said by Summer\n\"That\u2019s one of her own creation.\" said by Daniel\n\"That right there. That judgment. Mom was completely terrified and she didn\u2019t come to you \u2019cause she knew that you wouldn\u2019t look out for her. And I really thought that she was wrong, but clearly, I made a mistake in telling you. I should\u2019ve listened to mom.\" said by Summer\n\"Don\u2019t you\u2013 don\u2019t you dare tell me that I don\u2019t care about what happens to our mother. You know she called me, too? Trelegy for copd.\" said by Daniel\n\"I got a mysterious phone call last night. The person on the other end didn\u2019t speak. But I\u2013 I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that it was mom trying to reach out to me.\" said by Daniel\n\"You\u2019re sure that it was her?\" said by Summer\n\"No, summer. That is the whole point. I mean, it could\u2019ve been a wrong number. It could\u2019ve been a total stranger that I\u2013 I\u2019m talking to like it\u2013 it\u2019s our dead mother. Or it could\u2019ve been someone we know who\u2019s wondering why I\u2019m talking to our dead mother. I mean, don\u2019t you see that this is driving us both crazy?\" said by Daniel\n\"Look, I told you that I just need time. I\u2019m trying to figure this out. I\u2019m trying to learn all the evidence that they have in stark\u2019s murder. And I\u2019m researching what the burden of proof would be for self-defense.\" said by Summer\n\"Are you gonna get a law degree? Are you gonna become a homicide detective?\" said by Daniel\n\"Daniel, I\u2019m struggling here. I\u2019m trying to help our mom and I\u2019m scared for her. God.\" said by Summer\n\"Listen, the longer we wait, the worse this is gonna be for her and for everyone else. I mean, don\u2019t you see what this is doing to us?\" said by Daniel\n\"I hate it, too.\" said by Summer\n\"[ Scoffs ] You know, meanwhile, I\u2019m wondering if she\u2019s halfway around the world somewhere, living a new life, while she\u2019s reveling in the fact that diane\u2019s being convicted for a murder that she didn\u2019t commit.\" said by Daniel\n\"No, mom\u2019s focus is on getting back to us. But she can\u2019t do that if you blow this open. And if you tell kyle and he realizes that I knew, you\u2019re gonna blow up my marriage, too. How can you not see that?\" said by Summer\n\"I think you have real feelings for tucker. I think he has reawakened the flame that the two of you shared together and that makes you feel vulnerable and I know that\u2019s terrifying for you.\" said by Jack\n\"I know you longer than anyone on this earth, ashley. Think about this. Every time you told me to stay away from diane, to not get involved again, you used yourself as an example. You were better than I was because you knew not to get involved with tucker. And here we are, he\u2019s now invited into our home.\" said by Jack\n\"And you did the same thing with diane, jack.\" said by Ashley\n\"Diane and I are getting married! This game you\u2019re playing and tucker lives under our roof and stays in a guest room, that\u2019s so you can control him. You keep him at a distance, but you can still influence things.\" said by Jack\n\"Okay. You know what? I don\u2019t have to listen to this\u2013\" said by Ashley\n\"No, wait, listen to me.\" said by Jack\n\"What?\" said by Ashley\n\"Listen, I know what you\u2019re feeling because I felt it myself when I was falling back in love with diane. I didn\u2019t want to get hurt. I didn\u2019t want to trust that the change I saw in her was real. I know what\u2019s happening to you because it happened to me.\" said by Jack\n\"Okay. If you understand that, then why is it okay for you but not for me?\" said by Ashley\n\"Because tucker hasn\u2019t changed. He is the same manipulative operator he has always been.\" said by Jack\n\"Okay, but diane, who\u2019s actually charged with killing another human being is a brand new woman. Just look at yourself. You\u2019re exhausted. All you do is deal with diane and her issues. She\u2019s turned you into somebody I don\u2019t even know anymore, jack. But you\u2019re making better choices than me. You can take your psych 101 crap and shove it.\" said by Ashley\n\"Hey, wait. Your armor\u2019s already up again. You can\u2019t even be vulnerable with me. The way you\u2019re acting, you could never trust tucker, or anybody else for that matter. And you know what? That gives me an advantage over you. I have something you don\u2019t\u2013 the ability to open my heart. To let someone in, to trust. Don\u2019t pity me too much. Save some for yourself.\" said by Jack\n\"Okay, truth time. Uh, no offense, but I don\u2019t think you have it in you to have killed phyllis.\" said by Tucker\n\"Gee, thanks. None taken.\" said by Diane\n\"But here\u2019s the reality. There\u2019s plenty of proof to convict you. And your past is going to enter that courtroom for sure. Your fake death, the way deacon sharpe helped you frame everyone in town. Everyone you\u2019ve ever crossed is gonna hate you all over again, which is gonna make the proof look even worse.\" said by Tucker\n\"Thanks for trying to cheer me up, tucker.\" said by Diane\n\"I\u2019m trying to help you. This trial will force jack and kyle to live through everything you did to them, all over again. And this time you can add summer and harrison as collateral damage. And how long before this destroys kyle and summer\u2019s marriage? Do you want to be responsible for that? Poor jack. He is going to be crushed when you\u2019re facing life in prison.\" said by Tucker\n\"[ Scoffs ] This is the worst pep talk ever.\" said by Diane\n\"You don\u2019t need a cheerleader, diane. You need a way out of here. I can give you that.\" said by Tucker\n\"This baby is exactly who I\u2019m thinking about. She is the only reason why I\u2019m considering adam\u2019s offer. And like I said, I don\u2019t even know what I\u2019m gonna do, but I have a child to support.\" said by Sally\n\"Your baby will be very well taken care of as a newman.\" said by Nick\n\"This baby is a spectra, and making sure that she\u2019s provided for is my sole purpose now. And I\u2019m not just talking about some job. I need to assure that I have a career. That is important to me. It is a part of my identity and I want to be a strong role model for my daughter.\" said by Sally\n\"You will be. Sally, you are, you don\u2019t need a job from adam to prove that.\" said by Nick\n\"Adam and I worked well together. And I am perfectly capable of being able to separate the professional from the personal.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, you may be, but adam isn\u2019T.\" said by Nick\n\"I need something career-wise, and maybe this isn\u2019t it, but maybe it is. I just need the sense of purpose that comes from having a profession. I have had one failure after another and I don\u2019t know, maybe this is the chance for me to get back in the game.\" said by Sally\n\"And that is exactly what adam wants you to think. Sally, you may not want to hear this, but I\u2019m gonna say it anyway. If you go and work for adam, it\u2019ll be one of the biggest mistakes of your life. Are you tired of clean clothes that just don\u2019t smell clean?\" said by Nick\n\"I didn\u2019t ask for your opinion, nick. In fact, I asked you not to rush to judgment.\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2019m not rushing into anything, all right? I speak from years of experience.\" said by Nick\n\"Okay. Well, then maybe I should\u2019ve also added, please don\u2019t insult me by assuming that I can\u2019t read the situation without your insights into how the newman mind works. I\u2019m becoming an expert and it\u2019s not as complicated as you all might think. It\u2019s all about ego and power.\" said by Sally\n\"Do not lump me in with adam and dad. Look, I\u2019m telling you, if you go and work for adam, he\u2019s gonna chip away at every boundary you set until you have nothing.\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2019m not naive to adam\u2019s motivations. Please give me some credit. Look, I have somewhere to be.\" said by Sally\n\"Please don\u2019t go.\" said by Nick\n\"We will talk about this later.\" said by Sally\n\"Everything good?\" said by Chance\n\"Obviously not, given the circumstances.\" said by Daniel\n\"You know, I\u2019ve seen a lot of families pull together after a traumatic loss like this. But I have also seen a lot fall apart. And I really hope that you and summer can find some way to lean on each other.\" said by Chance\n\"That\u2019s a struggle. Um, so, diane\u2019s out on bail. You know when her trial\u2019s gonna be? It looks like there\u2019s a lot of evidence against her and\u2013 think she\u2019ll be convicted?\" said by Daniel\n\"Look, I\u2019ll, uh\u2013 I\u2019ll be honest with you, man. I don\u2019t think that diane acted alone.\" said by Chance\n\"So, there are other people of interest? Are there any leads that you\u2019re following that could exonerate diane?\" said by Daniel\n\"Look, I can\u2019t make you any promises, but even if we were to find that accomplice, with the case being so strong against diane, I am very confident that there will be justice for your mother\u2019s murder.\" said by Chance\n\"You know how to disappear. You\u2019ve done it before. I can give you anything you want. Money, I.D., Anything stark did to set you up with a new life, I can do. Only with no strings attached.\" said by Tucker\n\"[ Scoffs ] You\u2019d like that, wouldn\u2019t you? Or should I say ashley would like that? And then she might invite you into her bed instead of relegating you to the guest room.\" said by Diane\n\"I\u2019m talking about what you want, diane.\" said by Tucker\n\"That\u2019s right.\" said by Diane\n\"That\u2019s right. I can relate to that.\" said by Tucker\n\"Thank you for your consideration, tucker. This conversation\u2019s over.\" said by Diane\n\"What is this important offer I had to rush over to discuss? Please tell me, did jill reconsider and I get to go buy all those desk lamps because we scored our first big fish client?\" said by Chloe\n\"Unfortunately, no change of heart from jill.\" said by Sally\n\"Okay. So, what has changed since we last saw each other?\" said by Chloe\n\"I was offered a job.\" said by Sally\n\"What? Where?\" said by Chloe\n\"With adam. But before you say anything\u2013\" said by Sally\n\"Absolutely not. No, no, you are not going to dump our plans just so he can suck you back into a black hole. No way.\" said by Chloe\n\"How did nick not talk you out of this?\" said by Chloe\n\"He tried, but it\u2019s not his decision to make.\" said by Sally\n\"So, he obviously thinks it\u2019s a bad idea. And I couldn\u2019t agree more.\" said by Chloe\n\"So, you hate adam so much that you\u2019re ready to ignore an opportunity like this?\" said by Sally\n\"Yes.\" said by Chloe\n\"But we worked with him before.\" said by Sally\n\"And it was excruciating.\" said by Chloe\n\"Okay, look, I-it\u2019s just an option, okay? I\u2013 I haven\u2019t agreed to anything.\" said by Sally\n\"So, if you are willing to consider a job from adam, then will you revisit nick\u2019s offer to invest?\" said by ", "answer": "Chloe"}
{"content": "\"Hi.\" said by Jack\n\"Do you have time to talk?\" said by Kyle\n\"It\u2019s about Marchetti?\" said by Jack\n\"No. Personal stuff. Um\u2026I want to know what\u2019s going on with you and mom.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah. Okay. Um, what is it you\u2019re curious about?\" said by Jack\n\"How serious the two of you are. I know things are going well right now.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yes, they are.\" said by Jack\n\"Do you really think that will last? Because I know you\u2019ve been able to get past the lies and mistakes so far, but I think your relationship may be what finally blows up this family.\" said by Kyle\n\"Summer. Do you have a minute?\" said by Diane\n\"Um, I just came home to check on Harrison really quick, and then I was running back to the office. Is \u2014 is it something Marchetti-related or\u2026?\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, no, no, no. I would save that for the office. This is more personal.\" said by Devon\n\"[ Sighs ] Okay. What\u2019s up?\" said by Summer\n\"Well, I get the sense that you\u2019re less than thrilled that Jack and I are romantically involved again.\" said by Diane\n\"[ Chuckles ] Yeah. I don\u2019t want to see Jack get hurt. And I really don\u2019t want to see Kyle caught in the middle of the fallout when things go wrong, which I\u2019m pretty certain that they will go wrong.\" said by Summer\n\"You know, I just can\u2019t believe we flew all the way to L.A. \u2014 I left Kevin with the kids \u2014 just to be rejected so harshly.\" said by Chloe\n\"Yeah, I mean, what a colossal waste of time.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, I\u2019m not so worried about the time. It\u2019s more about the mess I had to deal with when I got home.\" said by Chloe\n\"I thought Kevin was pretty tidy around the house.\" said by Sally\n\"[ Sighs ] Yeah, he is. But men are just very simple creatures. They can focus on the house and they can focus on the kids, but they cannot do both. You will learn this soon enough.\" said by Chloe\n\"Okay. Well, that seems like a massive generalization. Maybe Nick will be different. I have to text him that I\u2019m back.\" said by Sally\n\"The point is, we could have been rejected just as easily here in genoa city.\" said by Chloe\n\"I know. And as I said before, I-I\u2019m really sorry. I knew that this venture would be a difficult climb, but i don\u2019t understand why Jill would just slam the door in our face without actually hearing our pitch.\" said by Sally\n\"You have no idea?\" said by Chloe\n\"I think she said that she had a change of mind? I got the sense that maybe she learned something unpleasant about my history. But that also doesn\u2019t make sense because the first time i met Jill, she seemed to admire the fact that I left my past behind and changed my life.\" said by Sally\n\"So, she admired you, and then she wouldn\u2019t let us in the door to meet with her. What the hell happened?\" said by Chloe\n\"Business meetings get canceled all the time, son.\" said by Victor\n\"[ Sighs ] Why won\u2019t you just give me a straight answer? Did you convince Jill to call off that meeting with sally and Chloe?\" said by Nick\n\"I talked to Jill, yeah.\" said by Victor\n\"About sally?\" said by Nick\n\"I gave her an honest assessment of sally\u2019s qualifications.\" said by Victor\n\"[ Exhales heavily ] I knew it. You killed that meeting. It\u2019s a meeting that meant nothing to you but everything to them. It\u2019s not enough that sally was fired from Newman Media by Victoria for no good reason. Now you\u2019re sabotaging opportunities for her?\" said by Nick\n\"Jill Abbott is a very clever businesswoman. She\u2019s not gonna get involved with someone that\u2019s not worth the effort. Whatever happened to sally spectra is her own doing.\" said by Victor\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Phyllis\n\"Oh, no. Have the tables finally turned? Has Diane driven you out of town?\" said by Tucker\n\"You\u2019re an ass.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Where are you going?\" said by Tucker\n\"I\u2019m trying to catch a flight.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Oh, yeah?\" said by Tucker\n\"Mm.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Business or personal trip?\" said by Tucker\n\"Uh, a little bit of both. And unlike you, I will be successful at both. [ Chuckles ]\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yep, that\u2019s right, Jill. Look, it\u2019s not gonna be easy, but we\u2019ll come up with a plan. Okay. I\u2019ll talk to you soon. Bye.\" said by Lily\n\"Sounded important.\" said by Daniel\n\"Uh, yeah. If I\u2019m talking to Jill, then it probably is. She doesn\u2019t really chitchat.\" said by Lily\n\"Hmm. So, no resolution yet on Devon taking Hamilton-winters back from chancellor?\" said by Daniel\n\"No. We made him an offer. He declined and won\u2019t budge. And neither will Jill.\" said by Lily\n\"Which means you\u2019re caught in the middle.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah, exactly. And I have to figure out a way to make chancellor functioning and profitable in the meantime.\" said by Lily\n\"That\u2019s unfortunate. It must be incredibly difficult.\" said by Daniel\n\"I feel like what you really want to ask me is, is there a future for your project?\" said by Lily\n\"Why are you trying to destroy sally?\" said by Nick\n\"Son, to be frank with you, I don\u2019t give a damn about sally spectra, okay? So stop this nonsense. I know the kind of woman she is. She has ruined your brother. She\u2019s gonna ruin you.\" said by Victor\n\"She did no such thing.\" said by Nick\n\"What the hell is he doing now? He\u2019s sitting at jabot doing nothing, selling lipstick and perfume, only because he was infatuated with her! She has dragged him down!\" said by Victor\n\"No, it\u2019s the other way around.\" said by Nick\n\"No!\" said by Victor\n\"He dragged her down. Sally\u2019s the one with the work ethic and the ambition who makes the most of every opportunity.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, with the ambition. You\u2019re right.\" said by Victor\n\"Adam has been handed everything over and over again, dad, and he blows them all up, whether it\u2019s career or romance. He fails at everything because of his attitude. And for you to assume I\u2019m gonna end up like Adam for any reason at all is beyond insulting.\" said by Nick\n\"I just can\u2019t believe my past would be an obstacle to starting this company. I\u2019m really sorry. You should not be punished for the things that I\u2019ve done.\" said by Sally\n\"It\u2019s okay. My own sordid past has reared its ugly head once in a while. And Jill is not the only game in town. We just need to find funding somewhere. What about Nick\u2019s offer to loan us the money?\" said by Chloe\n\"No. No, absolutely not. My situation with him is already uncomfortable enough now that he knows that I\u2019m pregnant, okay? So let\u2019s not add the money issue to the situation. I\u2019m already worried that he\u2019s gonna feel obligated to make things more serious than he might have wanted.\" said by Sally\n\"But I thought he cleared all that up.\" said by Chloe\n\"Nick has been sweet and supportive, but it\u2019s not like we, you know, spoke about anything long term. You know, there\u2019s a lot of time between now and the miracle of childbirth. You know, anything could happen. I mean, Nick could decide to up and bail on us altogether.\" said by Sally\n\"Nick would never do that. He is such a good guy.\" said by Chloe\n\"Yeah. He\u2019s the best. I\u2019m just not feeling very secure right now. What Nick and I have is really great. He\u2019s sexy and he\u2019s sweet and he\u2019s honest. But like I said, things could change.\" said by Sally\n\"[ Sighs ] The Adam possibility.\" said by Chloe\n\"What is the Adam possibility?\" said by Adam\n\"And can you please, please tell them to just leave all my mail and the package that I\u2019m expecting back here until i get back from Portugal, please?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Portugal? Isn\u2019t that where Daniel\u2019s partner and daughter are living now? That\u2019s interesting.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, that\u2019s interesting to me, of course. It shouldn\u2019t be interesting to you.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Is Daniel going with you?\" said by Tucker\n\"What I do and what my son does \u2014 it\u2019s none of your business. By the way, I told my son to keep away from you.\" said by Phyllis\n\"So, he\u2019s sticking around in town?\" said by Tucker\n\"[ Sighs ] It\u2019s not your concern.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yeah. He\u2019s sticking around, isn\u2019t he? Gonna work on his gaming platform. Yeah, he\u2019s got a bold vision. When I talked to him, I was really impressed with how creative he is, and yet he\u2019s also savvy, focused. It\u2019s a nice combination.\" said by Tucker\n\"Leave my son alone.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Come on. He\u2019s got the hottest project in town. It would be, uh \u2014 [ Chuckles ] It would be business malpractice if I didn\u2019t try to get a piece of it.\" said by Tucker\n\"Um, you seem desperate, Tucker.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Is that so?\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah, because you\u2019re a billionaire. You own a huge conglomerate. You\u2019re here in this sleepy town trying to poach a gaming platform. I mean, what is that? You\u2019re trying to take it out from under chancellor-winters. That\u2019s your son\u2019s company. What are you doing? You know, I\u2019ll tell you. It seems like you haven\u2019t had a win in a while.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Mm.\" said by Tucker\n\"And you\u2019re just kind of jonesing for one. Just saying.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yeah. Well, Phyllis, you have a nice trip. [ Chuckles ]\" said by Tucker\n\"Damn it.\" said by Phyllis\n\"You\u2019re right. I am concerned about the future of omega sphere. I came to you with a business venture, and you signed on. But I know that that was in part because of our friendship. And, yes, this project means the world to me and I want nothing more than to move forward with it, but I\u2019m also worried about what all this turmoil at your company is doing to you. Are you okay?\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah. I\u2019m fine. I just \u2014 I have a lot going on right now.\" said by Lily\n\"Well, if anyone can handle that, it\u2019s you.\" said by Daniel\n\"[ Sighs ] Thank you. I just \u2014 I \u2014 I feel very overwhelmed, you know, \u2019cause I want to do right by you. I want to do right by Jill, by the company. But it\u2019s like Devon has thrown everything into chaos. I mean, he\u2019s ready to enter a lawsuit with chancellor. And so we have to shelve the IPO again, you know? And I don\u2019t have Billy. I don\u2019t have Nate or Audra. So I just feel like I\u2019m entering this hurricane by myself.\" said by Lily\n\"Well, you\u2019re not totally alone.\" said by Daniel\n\"[ Sighs ] Yeah, I don\u2019t think you can really help me with this one.\" said by Lily\n\"I meant Jill. And you must have some good, smart people at the company that you can rely on.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah, no, of \u2014 of course I do. I just have to be realistic about what could happen because I think being in denial could be a recipe for disaster.\" said by Lily\n\"Look, I appreciate your concerns. I want to alleviate them. What is it that has you worried about my relationship with your mother?\" said by Jack\n\"All of it.\" said by Kyle\n\"Can you be more specific?\" said by Jack\n\"Your past. Look, you\u2019ve tried this before. It has always blown up. I mean, she faked her own death, which I have forgiven her for, but it\u2019s \u2014\" said by Kyle\n\"You\u2019re worried that she\u2019s going to revert to old patterns.\" said by Jack\n\"Yes.\" said by Kyle\n\"Wait \u2014 in fairness, most of that plan was my idea. No, you can\u2019t judge her for that. Look, I don\u2019t think that what she did to get out from under stark\u2019s thumb is indicative of any moral failing.\" said by Jack\n\"There were already shady things happening.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yes, because there were difficult circumstances. Kyle, I would do the same thing again in a heartbeat. It worked. Look, I will take full responsibility. The last thing I want is for my decisions to come between you and your mother.\" said by Jack\n\"You really care about her, don\u2019t you?\" said by Kyle\n\"I really do.\" said by Jack\n\"After all this time, how do you know the two of you will be a good fit now?\" said by Kyle\n\"We are older. We are wiser. We have both mellowed. We are each more accepting of the other\u2019s faults.\" said by Jack\n\"You sure the two of you aren\u2019t in denial?\" said by Kyle\n\"Our eyes are wide open.\" said by Jack\n\"What if she hurts you? What if you hurt her? What if she runs away and leaves us again? There will be no coming back from that, not for me.\" said by Kyle\n\"You\u2019re bound to have doubts. And who knows? Maybe Jack and I won\u2019t last. But I can tell you that I have deep affection for him.\" said by Diane\n\"That I believe.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah, he\u2019s thoughtful and considerate. He \u2014 he makes me happy. And I feel stronger when I\u2019m with Jack, if that makes any sense.\" said by Diane\n\"Sure. I get the same feeling from Kyle.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, I\u2019m going to do whatever I can to make things work. And, really, the only thing i see getting in our way is your mother.\" said by Diane\n\"I really don\u2019t think you should worry about her.\" said by Summer\n\"[ Chuckles ] Really? Phyllis has such deep resentment and anger towards me. She\u2019s determined to cause me not just trouble, but pain. And, frankly, it\u2019s a little disturbing. And, you know, where does that leave Jack?\" said by Diane\n\"What do you mean?\" said by Summer\n\"Well, she claims that she cares about him, but she clearly doesn\u2019t respect his choices.\" said by Diane\n\"[ Laughs ] She might not agree with his choices, but I \u2014 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about respect. And honestly, Diane, if you think that my mom is the only thing that could disrupt your happiness, you\u2019re either naive or you\u2019re just as steeped in those old hatreds as you claim she is.\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m not naive.\" said by Diane\n\"So, you realize that you could really hurt Jack and Kyle and Harrison with all of this. And they care about you. They trust you. And you\u2019re looking for a scapegoat for when things go wrong.\" said by Summer\n\"Not at all.\" said by Diane\n\"So then why would you just randomly bring up my mom?\" said by Summer\n\"There\u2019s nothing random about it. But you know what? Fair enough. I have survived Phyllis so far, and I will continue to do so. I just hope she puts her energy elsewhere because I have had more than enough of her attention, and, sadly, nothing good ever comes from it.\" said by Diane\n\"So, you think sally is the reason Adam is making so many bad decisions lately.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah. What do you think he\u2019s doing? He\u2019s doing that ridiculous job at jabot. He\u2019s sleepwalking through his job. He\u2019s failing because of her \u2014 sally spectra. The same thing will happen to you.\" said by Victor\n\"How do you know how he\u2019s doing at jabot? You spying on him, dad?\" said by Nick\n\"What the hell do you think?\" said by Victor\n\"What are you planning? You know what? I already know. You hope he fails so he has to come crawling back to Newman yet again.\" said by Nick\n\"I want him here. I want him with his family and with my company.\" said by Victor\n\"You are obsessed with bringing him back to the family. When are you going to get it? It never, ever works. This is getting pathetic.\" said by Nick\n\"This is my company, son. I don\u2019t give a damn who\u2019s CEO or coo. This is my company.\" said by Victor\n\"But now your obsession is spilling over to sally, and i won\u2019t stand for it. She doesn\u2019t deserve this kind of treatment. I\u2019m mad at you, and I\u2019m disappointed in Jill. She doesn\u2019t deserve this kind of interference, especially not right now.\" said by Nick\n\"What do you mean, \u201cespecially not right now\u201d?\" said by Victor\n\"She just needs a break, alright? She\u2019s had a rough go of it ever since she was fired from Newman. Now, if I can\u2019t convince you to leave her be for her sake or for mine, then maybe you need to do it for the company.\" said by Nick\n\"What do you mean by that?\" said by Victor\n\"Things are going well here, right?\" said by Nick\n\"Right.\" said by Victor\n\"I love working with mom and Vick. But if you continue down this path and continue to harass sally, given everything, do not force me to choose between her and this company.\" said by Nick\n\"What do you mean by \u201cgiven everything\u201d? What are you not telling me?\" said by Victor\n\"Let me guess. This is about Nick and sally.\" said by Victoria\n\"Eavesdrop much?\" said by Chloe\n\"I just walked in and i heard my name. So maybe try talking a few decibels softer. So, what\u2019s the Adam possibility?\" said by Adam\n\"Chloe was just talking about the possibility of you luring me up onto another rooftop to win me back. Only in this version, you don\u2019t screw it up by insulting me.\" said by Sally\n\"And of course you not screwing up is the worst possibility I could ever imagine.\" said by Chloe\n\"Well, I\u2019m just glad to be in your thoughts, Chloe. Although I do find it odd that you\u2019re speculating on sally and I reuniting. I mean, what would make you think that\u2019s possible? You made it clear that we\u2019re done. Has something changed for you?\" said by Adam\n\"I should have known this would lead to some complicated emotions for you, that you would see any change in your parents\u2019 relationship as leading to a chaos and eventual loss.\" said by Jack\n\"I\u2019m not that pessimistic. But I wanted to let you know it\u2019s on my mind.\" said by Kyle\n\"Of course it is. You can forgive your mother for leaving you, but you can never forget.\" said by Jack\n\"I just think this could end badly \u2014 for all of us.\" said by Kyle\n\"I had the same feelings when I let Dina back into my life. I now regret the time I could have spent with her when I was trying to anticipate the very worst. I hope you can avoid that particular pitfall.\" said by Kyle\n\"Maybe I will. I\u2019m just not there yet.\" said by Kyle\n\"Look, the most important thing for you to know now is that Diane and I are happy. It\u2019s very early, Kyle. Do we want this to lead to more? Do we want it to grow? Yes, but in a happy, healthy way. So, there is nothing dangerous about my relationship with her.\" said by Jack\n\"But that\u2019s the hard part for me. Of course I want the two of you to be happy. Part of me is thrilled you\u2019re back together, but \u2014\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, Kyle, don\u2019t worry. Whatever happens, your family will be okay. It is said that I am a hopeless romantic. Okay. I won\u2019t deny that. I am also very pragmatic. I knew when it was time to end my relationship with Phyllis. Look, I think what I have with your mother is very special, but if this does not work out, we will both be fine. We will both be here for you and your family. That will never change.\" said by Jack\n\"I wouldn\u2019t be too concerned about my mom. I find that she only really goes on the attack when someone she loves is threatened. It\u2019s, um \u2014 it\u2019s the mama bear phenomenon.\" said by Summer\n\"[ Laughs ] So, is that a warning for me to behave myself or risk the wrath of Phyllis?\" said by Diane\n\"No, not at all. Because, actually, I\u2019ve realized recently that I share a lot of those same mama bear qualities. And Kyle and Harrison are my world. Their happiness means everything to me. So if someone hurts them\u2026\" said by Summer\n\"So, that\u2019s the warning.\" said by Diane\n\"I\u2019m glad we had a chance to talk.\" said by Summer\n\"Come on, sally. Tell me what initiated the conversation about us reuniting.\" said by Adam\n\"Ooh! Is that Nick?\" said by Chloe\n\"[ Chuckles ] Yeah. He was just dealing with his dad. He wants to meet.\" said by Sally\n\"Aww. He\u2019s so sweet.\" said by Chloe\n\"Mm.\" said by Adam\n\"Nothing has changed. You know, we both agreed that there is no future for us.\" said by Sally\n\"I seem to recall that conversation. But I also remember the context, where it took place.\" said by Adam\n\"No matter where or when that conversation took place, the point is, is that we both agreed that we don\u2019t belong together.\" said by Sally\n\"And yet you and Chloe are here, talking about us.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, you know me. I love coming up with doomsday scenarios.\" said by Chloe\n\"You two enjoy your lunch, okay?\" said by Adam\n\"How am I gonna deal with nine months of this? I mean, what is he gonna think when I start showing?\" said by Sally\n\"Hey!\" said by Phyllis\n\"Oh, hi.\" said by Summer\n\"Ohh, it\u2019s freezing.\" said by Phyllis\n\"What are you doing here?\" said by Summer\n\"Okay, I wanted to tell you I\u2019m going out of town. Um, I just wanted to let you know.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Okay. Where \u2014 where are you going?\" said by Summer\n\"Portugal. Yes. I\u2019m going to meet with Heather. [ Sighs ] I\u2019m gonna convince her to take your brother back.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Mom, that is a monumentally bad idea. That is between Heather and Daniel. You can\u2019t just jet off to Europe and try to fix it.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, I can. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\" said by Phyllis\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Summer\n\"My relationship with Heather is very, very good. She respects me.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Heather? Really? And Daniel is okay with this?\" said by Summer\n\"He doesn\u2019t know. I need you to keep it quiet. Listen, I need to do this. I need to fix this for your brother. I\u2019ve got to make this right.\" said by Phyllis\n\"There is no one tougher than you. I mean, think of everything that you\u2019ve been through. This is just a bump in the road compared to \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 fighting cancer.\" said by Daniel\n\"[ Chuckles ] Well, thank you for the moral support, but I could use some business nuts and bolts right now.\" said by Lily\n\"I could also contribute support to chancellor\u2019s bottom line once my platform launches to success and acclaim.\" said by Daniel\n\"[ Laughs ] That\u2019s true. That\u2019ll be a big revenue stream for us. Can it be ready this afternoon?\" said by ", "answer": "Lily"}
{"content": "\"[ Laughs ]\" said by Diane\n\"Hey.\" said by Jack\n\"Ah. [ Sniffles ] That was a really good movie.\" said by Diane\n\"You okay?\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah.\" said by Diane\n\"You\u2019re an emotional softie.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Laughs ]\" said by Diane\n\"Your secret\u2019s safe with me.\" said by Jack\n\"I\u2019m a little surprised at myself. I, uh\u2026 I thought I had given up believing in happy endings a long time ago.\" said by Diane\n\"Ah. I think happy endings are overrated. It means the \u2014 the end of a story. I think all the fun is in the journey there.\" said by Jack\n\"Mm. I never want this journey with you to end.\" said by Diane\n\"I am so happy, so grateful to get this new beginning with you.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. Summer? Hello. It\u2019s your mother. Yeah. Your mom. You only have one of those. I gave birth to you in an elevator. An elevator. Call me back. You can\u2019t avoid me forever. Please\u2026call me back.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Oh, she \u2014\" said by Michael\n\"Ohh.\" said by Lauren\n\"She\u2019s drunk. The phyllis train is off the rails.\" said by Michael\n\"If you don\u2019t call me back, I will hunt you down and i will ambush you.\" said by Phyllis\n\"We can pretend we didn\u2019t see her.\" said by Michael\n\"I can\u2019t unsee that.\" said by Lauren\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Phyllis\n\"Okay. We\u2019re going in. Come on.\" said by Lauren\n\"Oh, into the fray.\" said by Michael\n\"Phyllis?\" said by Lauren\n\"Hey.\" said by Michael\n\"[ Chuckling ] Hi.\" said by Lauren\n\"Look at this. Two people who will not ignore me.\" said by Phyllis\n\"[ Chuckles ] Well, we thought about it.\" said by Michael\n\"You want a drink? Can I buy you one?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Oh\u2026\" said by Lauren\n\"No. We\u2019re good. Thanks.\" said by Michael\n\"No. The question is, are you?\" said by Lauren\n\"I can say with good authority I am not okay.\" said by Phyllis\n\"What\u2019s wrong, honey?\" said by Lauren\n\"My life is spinning out. I can\u2019t stop it.\" said by Phyllis\n\"I\u2019ll be right with you!\" said by Sharon\n\"Oh, that\u2019s okay. Take your time. Nothing life-changing to report.\" said by Mariah\n\"Ahh!\" said by Sharon\n\"Ahh!\" said by Mariah\n\"You\u2019re really here!\" said by Sharon\n\"Yes, I\u2019m here! I\u2019m here!\" said by Mariah\n\"Oh, my gosh!\" said by Sharon\n\"Do you have the \u201cnew mom\u201d special?\" said by Mariah\n\"Yeah! Oh, yes, I do. And you have that new mother glow.\" said by Sharon\n\"Is it called exhaustion? Because, yes, I have that.\" said by Mariah\n\"Oh, gosh, those sleepless nights and bleary days. They are wonderful. Tell me everything.\" said by Sharon\n\"Uh, okay. To, uh \u2014 to sum it up, the baby is born, motherhood is magical, our daughter is perfect. I mean, her \u2014 her chubby little legs and the smell of her head. And every time she smiles, i just die like a thousand times.\" said by Mariah\n\"That\u2019s what having a child is.\" said by Sharon\n\"Meaning it\u2019s everything.\" said by Mariah\n\"Always and forever.\" said by Sharon\n\"I didn\u2019t know it was possible to feel this much happiness. Being a parent is already making me see the world so differently.\" said by Mariah\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Sally\n\"Sup?\" said by Nick\n\"Hey, do you have a sec?\" said by Sally\n\"Uh, yeah. Actually, could I just call you back in one minute? I\u2019m just trying to wrap up some work here.\" said by Nick\n\"Um, I\u2019m just really worried. I-I feel like something \u2014 something\u2019s off.\" said by Sally\n\"What do you mean?\" said by Nick\n\"Well, I just have this really splitting headache and it won\u2019t go away and \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 I\u2019m just concerned for the baby.\" said by Sally\n\"Okay. Uh, call the doctor. I\u2019ll be right there.\" said by Nick\n\"Thank you.\" said by Sally\n\"[ Gasps ] She is stunning.\" said by Sharon\n\"I know.\" said by Mariah\n\"Oh, my gosh. I can already see a lot of personality in her sweet little face.\" said by Sharon\n\"Right? Oh, god, I\u2019ve just been gone a few hours, and I already miss them so, so much. I can\u2019t wait to get back to her and tessa.\" said by Mariah\n\"I know. Oh. Hey! Adam. What can I get you? I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t notice you come in \u2019cause I was too busy gushing over mariah\u2019s brand-new baby girl.\" said by Sharon\n\"I heard. I heard. I \u2014 I didn\u2019t want to interrupt. So, congratulations. Having a child \u2014 you know, there\u2019s nothing on earth like it.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh. You got here fast.\" said by Sally\n\"How are you feeling? What did the doctor say?\" said by Nick\n\"[ Sighs ] She said that some women are prone to headaches early in their pregnancy. It could be due to a number of factors, like stress, fatigue, sinuses, caffeine withdrawal. Or it could be related to my blood pressure issue.\" said by Sally\n\"Okay. If it\u2019s the blood pressure thing, um, is that a problem?\" said by Nick\n\"I mean, dr. Chandler didn\u2019t seem concerned, which made me a little less worried.\" said by Sally\n\"What did she say to do?\" said by Nick\n\"Well, call her back if I got any more symptoms, but in the meantime, just try and reduce stress, eat well, rest. She did say that I could try and find if there was, like, a food or an odor that was triggering my headaches, which sounds like a fun little experiment.\" said by Sally\n\"[ Chuckles ] Okay. Um, well, if that\u2019s all it was.\" said by Nick\n\"Wow, you were really worried.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah. Sally, it\u2019s my job to worry. You better get used to that.\" said by Nick\n\"You know, let\u2019s get some food and some coffee in you.\" said by Lauren\n\"No. I don\u2019t want a sandwich and a latte. That\u2019s not gonna fix my problem.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Mm. Strongly disagree. They have a filet mignon panini here that will fix just about anything. And I\u2019m gonna order you one \u2014 and maybe one for myself and you. Hmm!\" said by Michael\n\"So, hey, what caused you to self-medicate with alcohol?\" said by Lauren\n\"[ Inhales sharply ] My children. Children [Gasps] Can break your heart.\" said by Phyllis\n\"You are not wrong there.\" said by Lauren\n\"They think that I\u2019m the cause of their problems and that, um, I\u2019m interfering in their life.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Because you are, aren\u2019t you?\" said by Michael\n\"What the hell kind of question is that? \u201cBecause you are, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Seriously? All I\u2019m trying to do is help my children.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Okay, well, we know you have the best intentions when it comes to daniel and summer.\" said by Lauren\n\"Yeah, yeah, yeah. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s it \u2014 the best intentions. That\u2019s all you have to say. And I do. And I\u2019m trying to help my children. And for some reason, they\u2019re turning it around that all their problems in their life are because of me and I am the cause of all their issues. And I am so tired of it.\" said by Phyllis\n\"We didn\u2019t say that.\" said by Michael\n\"Yeah. We\u2019re here for you.\" said by Lauren\n\"No, you\u2019re not.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Like we always are.\" said by Lauren\n\"No, you\u2019re not. Blah.\" said by Phyllis\n\"So, what do we do now?\" said by Jack\n\"Well, not another movie.\" said by Diane\n\"Oh, I like the sound of that.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah.\" said by Diane\n\"Okay, so, I\u2019ll put on some music, and maybe we could open another bottle of champagne \u2014\" said by Jack\n\"Jack. I don\u2019t want anything but to be here with you, safe in your arms. It\u2019s everything. Type 2 diabetes?\" said by Diane\n\"When I look at her, i just see pure innocence and \u2014 and just endless possibility. She\u2019s got her entire life ahead of her and our life together. And I get to travel through the world with this incredible human being, guiding her and learning from her at the same time.\" said by Mariah\n\"Well, she is very lucky to have you and \u2014 and tessa.\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah. We\u2019re lucky to have her. We are so proud to be her parents and just \u2014 I can\u2019t believe that the three of us, we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re a family.\" said by Mariah\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, um, this is tessa, so I really have to take this.\" said by Mariah\n\"Sure. Go, go.\" said by Sharon\n\"Okay.\" said by Mariah\n\"Well, I should probably be going, too.\" said by Adam\n\"But you didn\u2019t even order any coffee.\" said by Sharon\n\"It\u2019s probably kind of late for that thing anyway, but, um, congrats again, sharon.\" said by Adam\n\"Hey. Wait a minute. What\u2019s going on with you?\" said by Sharon\n\"Nothing. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m good, you know? I\u2019m adam newman. I\u2019m, uh \u2014 I\u2019m a guy without a care in the world.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, sometimes being adam newman isn\u2019t as easy as it looks. Look, if you don\u2019t want to tell me what\u2019s on your mind, it\u2019s fine with me. I\u2019m just not buying this laissez-faire routine.\" said by Sharon\n\"Okay. Um\u2026 [ Chuckles ] Sally\u2019s pregnant. And the baby\u2019s mine.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh.\" said by Sharon\n\"I just\u2026 sharon, I just dropped a bomb on you, and you don\u2019t have that much of a reaction. You already knew, didn\u2019t you? How could you not tell me that i was gonna be a father?\" said by Adam\n\"[ Sighs ] I just feel kind of silly that my first instinct was to call you over what was probably just a standard-issue headache.\" said by Sally\n\"First, I don\u2019t want you to ever feel silly about calling me about something about your health or the baby\u2019s health. Secondly, you absolutely should have called me.\" said by Nick\n\"I guess I just wanted you to tell me that I was overreacting, like you were, like, my husband or something. That was absolutely not a request.\" said by Sally\n\"Look, I love it that you thought to call me when you thought something might be wrong. I really want to be that person for you. I just want you to know there isn\u2019t anything I won\u2019t stop doing or drop to come be with you if you need me.\" said by Nick\n\"God, you were in the middle of something when i called. You shouldn\u2019t \u2014 you should probably get back to the office.\" said by Sally\n\"Psch. Are you kidding me? Forget work. Let\u2019s sit down. Let\u2019s see if we can figure out the source of your headache by going over what you ate and drank.\" said by Nick\n\"Really? \u2018Cause when I said it would be a fun little experiment, I might have been overstating the fun part.\" said by Sally\n\"No way. This is gonna be super fun. Let\u2019s get into it. What\u2019d you have for breakfast?\" said by Nick\n\"Um, two eggs and some toast.\" said by Sally\n\"Okay. Eggs and toast. How about lunch?\" said by Nick\n\"Chicken salad.\" said by Sally\n\"And\u2026?\" said by Nick\n\"Some cashews from the minibar for dinner.\" said by Sally\n\"Are you \u2014 cashews, sally?\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, I know, but the headache made me lose my appetite.\" said by Sally\n\"Are you remembering to take your prenatal vitamins?\" said by Nick\n\"[ Sighs ] I\u2019ve been a little lax about it. I\u2019ve just never really been a vitamin person.\" said by Sally\n\"[ Sighs ] Well, obviously I\u2019m gonna have to stay on top of you. About this situation\u2026\" said by Nick\n\"Mm.\" said by Sally\n\"\u2026So I can keep an eye on you. Obviously, we\u2019re gonna have to spend a lot more time together.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Sally\n\"I did know about sally\u2019s pregnancy, um, but i promised that I wouldn\u2019t tell anyone.\" said by Sharon\n\"Sharon, not even the father?\" said by Adam\n\"Well, it wasn\u2019t my place to tell you. And besides, at the time, she didn\u2019t even know who the father was. It\u2019s not until just now that I\u2019m learning that it\u2019s you.\" said by Sharon\n\"So, when did nick tell you that she was pregnant?\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, it wasn\u2019t nick that told me. It was sally.\" said by Sally\n\"What? I\u2026 I didn\u2019t think you two were exactly close.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, we\u2019re not. I think because she\u2019s a first-time mother and the situation is a little bit confusing and she just needed some guidance.\" said by Sharon\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Adam\n\"Well, part of me was, um, holding out hope that we would find our way back to each other, but now that nick has stepped up, even though the baby\u2019s mine, it\u2019s not gonna happen. You know, he really is mr. Wonderful. And I\u2019m out in the cold.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, I\u2019m sorry. I know how difficult it must be for you to sit back and watch nick with sally. But she did tell you the truth. So, that couldn\u2019t have been easy for her, either.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, uh\u2026I wouldn\u2019t want to have that conversation with me. I\u2019m just still pretty stunned by it all. You know, I\u2019m having a \u2014 I\u2019m having another baby.\" said by Adam\n\"You are going to be a great dad to this kid, just as good as you are to connor.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, I appreciate you saying that, sharon, but having nick in the mix, it\u2019s gonna make things a lot trickier.\" said by Adam\n\"You know, going on a tear is hungry business. Come on. Eat something. Make you feel better.\" said by Lauren\n\"And maybe soak up some of the booze.\" said by Michael\n\"I don\u2019t want to stuff a sandwich down my throat.\" said by Phyllis\n\"You know we love you and we\u2019re here for you. Aren\u2019t we?\" said by Lauren\n\"Phyllis, listen to me. You are family. What can we do to help?\" said by Michael\n\"We\u2019re not family. Go ahead and say it to me. You want to say \u201cI told you so.\u201d That\u2019s what you want to say.\" said by Phyllis\n\"No, we don\u2019T.\" said by Lauren\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Phyllis\n\"Although we did warn you about interfering in daniel\u2019s life behind his back.\" said by Lauren\n\"You two are supposed to be my friends. Do you know what that means? Friends? Hmm? And you. How can you be diane\u2019s friend and be my friend? How can you do that to me?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Diane is not the root of all your problems!\" said by Michael\n\"Shh! Oh, my god, she is. Oh, my god, she is. I wish she\u2019d died. I wish she\u2019d died. I want her dead.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Phyllis \u2014\" said by Lauren\n\"You can only die once, right? It is not too late. I want that bitch dead now.\" said by Phyllis\n\"This feels so right. I don\u2019t ever want to move.\" said by Diane\n\"We could stay here indefinitely.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Diane\n\"We could move here. The view is spectacular.\" said by Jack\n\"Mm.\" said by Diane\n\"But it\u2019s not the only view I like.\" said by Jack\n\"Don\u2019t you think we\u2019d get a little antsy after a couple of months?\" said by Diane\n\"I\u2019ll tell you what. We could travel from one romantic place to the next, an endless adventure around the world.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Chuckles ] Now, that I can picture.\" said by Diane\n\"Of course you are right.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Laughs ]\" said by Diane\n\"Nothing wrong with a little fantasy, but reality is pretty great, too. I promise I will do everything i can to make it as special as it can be for you\u2026for us.\" said by Jack\n\"I\u2019m really sorry for worrying you. I probably just overreacted to something that in the end was probably nothing.\" said by Sally\n\"Come on. You reacted quickly to a potential crisis because you\u2019re worried about that perfect little baby inside of you. That\u2019s what mothers do. I think you\u2019re gonna be an amazing mother, sally.\" said by Nick\n\"Thank you.\" said by Sally\n\"Sally, it\u2019s me.\" said by Adam\n\"[ Sighs ] Did you call him, too?\" said by Nick\n\"No.\" said by Sally\n\"I guess him showing up unannounced is gonna be a regular thing.\" said by Nick\n\"Ugh, I hope not. But I \u2014 I can\u2019t not answer it.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Sighs ] Hi. What are you doing here? Want luxury hair repair that doesn\u2019t cost $50?\" said by Sally\n\"Um, I \u2014 I was just thinking about you, and I \u2014 I wanted to check in.\" said by Adam\n\"I mean, everything\u2019s fine now.\" said by Sally\n\"Now? I mean, was \u2014 was there a problem? I mean, is \u2014 is that why nick\u2019s here? Is everything okay with you and the baby?\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah. I-I just had a pretty bad headache, and I called the doctor, but it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s gone now. There\u2019s nothing for you to worry about.\" said by Sally\n\"It\u2019s all good.\" said by Nick\n\"Look, you shouldn\u2019t feel the need to check in. I mean, there\u2019s really nothing i need from you before the baby\u2019s born.\" said by Sally\n\"So, I noticed you and adam were talking while I was on the phone. It looked intense.\" said by Mariah\n\"Yeah, well, when is something not up with adam?\" said by Sharon\n\"That was purposefully vague.\" said by Mariah\n\"Every single detail about the baby takes precedence here. What did tessa say?\" said by Sharon\n\"Just that she was singing our little sugar plum to sleep.\" said by Mariah\n\"Aww.\" said by Sharon\n\"We will be forever grateful that delphine made us moms.\" said by Mariah\n\"So will I. I\u2019m already so proud of the mother you\u2019ve become.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, I\u2019m not sure that I can ever live up to you, but I will certainly try.\" said by Mariah\n\"Hey, I haven\u2019t asked you the biggest question yet. Have you come up with a name?\" said by Sharon\n\"I wish there was an easy way to deal with jeremy and his threats. I mean, I suppose that stealing something else from victor and nikki\u2019s pied\u2013terre in chicago is out of the question.\" said by Diane\n\"I still stand by that choice. It worked, if only temporarily.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Gasps ] What was that?\" said by Diane\n\"Hey.\" said by Jack\n\"No. What if it\u2019s him and \u2014 and \u2014 and he\u2019s going to find us?\" said by Diane\n\"There\u2019s no way he could possibly know we are here.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack. No, don\u2019t open it.\" said by Diane\n\"It\u2019s okay.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Exhales sharply ]\" said by Diane\n\"A tree branch fell.\" said by Jack\n\"Really?\" said by Diane\n\"Yeah. Come see for yourself.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Exhales sharply ]\" said by Diane\n\"Everything\u2019s okay. We are safe.\" said by Jack\n\"Hmm. I wonder where diane\u2019s tombstone is. I should find it and put it to good use.\" said by Phyllis\n\"For heaven\u2019s sake, phyllis.\" said by Lauren\n\"Making death threats in the middle of a hotel lobby is such a bad idea.\" said by Michael\n\"It\u2019s not my hotel anymore, so \u2014 pbht. You know, it\u2019s the first amendment. Michael, it\u2019s the constitution. I can do what I want.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Except when you\u2019re yelling murder or fire.\" said by Michael\n\"This isn\u2019t helping anyone.\" said by Lauren\n\"Wow.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Just stop it.\" said by Lauren\n\"Oh, stop, please, you two. Enough. Enough. I\u2019m done with the tough love. You\u2019re either with me or you\u2019re against me.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Well, we\u2019re not against you.\" said by Michael\n\"Yeah, sure. Well, I\u2019m done with tough love, and I am done with you. Okay?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Phyllis, hold on.\" said by Lauren\n\"I am suffocating. Let me go.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Go \u2014 go after her.\" said by Lauren\n\"Phyllis. Phyllis! Phyllis! She found it.\" said by Michael\n\"We have not found the perfect name yet.\" said by Mariah\n\"Well, I can\u2019t keep calling her \u201cthe baby.\u201d\" said by Sharon\n\"I know. I know. Trust me \u2014 we\u2019re gonna figure it out soon.\" said by Mariah\n\"Can you at least tell me what names are in the running?\" said by Sharon\n\"I could, but do you really want to talk about it?\" said by Mariah\n\"Of course. Why wouldn\u2019t I?\" said by Sharon\n\"I just didn\u2019t know if you would have any sensitivity, considering\u2026\" said by Sharon\n\"Oh. Wait. You mean because I didn\u2019t get to name you?\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah. I didn\u2019t want to bring up any bad memories.\" said by Mariah\n\"You know, I didn\u2019t get to raise you, but we did find each other again. And you turned out to be a remarkable woman with a beautiful name that fits her beautiful soul.\" said by Sharon\n\"And, see, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re trying to do. We\u2019re trying to find the perfect name that matches our little girl\u2019s essence.\" said by Mariah\n\"When you hear it, you\u2019ll know it.\" said by Sharon\n\"I hate to see you on edge like this.\" said by Jack\n\"I\u2019m just so mad at myself for letting jeremy get to me again. You know, I refuse to be that man\u2019s victim, but I promise you that somehow, some way, I am going to get him out of our lives. I\u2019m just \u2014 I\u2019m just frustrated that our last plan didn\u2019t work.\" said by Diane\n\"Well, that wasn\u2019t your fault.\" said by Jack\n\"No. But I don\u2019t want you or anyone else to take that kind of risk again, like you did last time. Your days of committing larceny are over. But I\u2019m afraid that it\u2019s going to take something extreme like that to get rid of him. And I don\u2019t know \u2014 I don\u2019t know what that something is, but whatever it is, I\u2019m going to be the one who takes the risk. I brought him into our lives, and I will drive him out.\" said by Diane\n\"I love to see that fire in your eyes. I love your devotion to us. But I\u2019m starting to think maybe going on the offensive with stark is not the right solution.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, maybe the problem was we didn\u2019t frame him for a big enough crime.\" said by Diane\n\"I disagree. No, I think maybe the opposite approach is the right way to go.\" said by Jack\n\"I will take care of everything sally needs until the baby arrives.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Sighs ] Look, I-I get that you\u2019re together, and I know that you\u2019re gonna be around. I\u2019m not fighting that. And I will try to resist the urge to spontaneously check in. But, um, I would really like to come to some of your doctor\u2019s appointments or ultrasounds.\" said by Adam\n\"Um, yeah. I\u2019ll think about it.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, uh, I won\u2019t overstay my welcome. I\u2019m glad everything\u2019s okay.\" said by Adam\n\"That was tense. I know adam\u2019s trying to deal with this the best way he can, but it\u2019s gonna be tough for him. And I know that you\u2019re not overly sensitive to his feelings, but they\u2019re gonna affect all of us.\" said by Sally\n\"We\u2019re all in this together. I don\u2019t like it, but it is what it is. I\u2019ve had time to accept that I\u2019m not the father of this baby. So I sympathize with him a bit more.\" said by ", "answer": "Nick"}

Well, aria is a lot more popular than I am these days. As she should be.\" said by Mariah\n\"Look at her sweet little face. She\u2019s just an angel. Can I pick her up?\" said by Sharon\n\"I love you, but no. This angel wailed the whole car ride until she fell asleep. So, just give her a few minutes?\" said by Mariah\n\"No problem. I can wait. I think.\" said by Sharon\n\"I really, really wanna dish, but first I need coffee. Anything before caffeine is just gonna sound like gibberish.\" said by Mariah\n\"Okay. Wow. I hope you\u2019re not pushing yourself too hard. Going back to work. You\u2019re taking care of aria. That\u2019s a lot to take on at once.\" said by Sharon\n\"Tessa has my back.

Who needs sleep?\" said by Mariah\n\"Wait, am I sensing there might be something else going on?\" said by Sharon\n\"Hey, am I interrupting?\" said by Daniel\n\"No, not at all. What is this?\" said by Lily\n\"Well, I thought you could use a little afternoon pick me up.\" said by Daniel\n\"Thank you. It\u2019s very sweet.\" said by Lily\n\"Not totally selfless. I was actually hoping to talk to you about something. Do you have a minute?\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah, of course. What\u2019s up?\" said by Lily\n\"God, I don\u2019t mean to keep leaning on you, but you\u2019re kind of my go-to person when it comes to this.\" said by Daniel\n\"Is it your mom? Did you have another nightmare or?\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah, something like that. Only this one is happening in real life.\" said by Daniel\n\"Listen to me. You\u2019re the only one who can know that I\u2019m alive. I mean it. You\u2019re the only one who can know what happened and what I need to do because of it from this moment forward.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Diane.\" said by Jack\n\"Why do you keep doing this? I told you not to come here. Why don\u2019t you listen to me?\" said by Diane\n\"Because I love you. Because the last time I was here, I left you with a question that you never answered.\" said by Jack\n\"It was a crazy question.\" said by Diane\n\"That is still not an answer. I\u2019ll ask again. Will you marry me?\" said by Jack\n\"Before I go on trial for murder? Is there nothing I can do to drive you away?\" said by Diane\n\"No. No. Now is when you need me most. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\" said by Jack\n\"So that\u2019s why you\u2019re here? To marry me right now? That\u2019s not romance, jack. It\u2019s denial. And it breaks my heart. My moderate to severe plaque psoriasis\u2026\" said by Diane\n\"Additional sponsorship provided by\u2026\" said by Announcer\n\"I was thrown by something that happened today. And I didn\u2019t know how to handle it. And then I got embarrassed that I didn\u2019t know how to handle it better and that\u2019s kind of just how things go in my world sometimes. It\u2019s really\u2013 it\u2019s not a big deal.\" said by Mariah\n\"Well, it\u2019s still on your mind. So, why don\u2019t you just tell me? Was it something at work?\" said by Sharon\n\"No. No. Someone today asked me if aria was my first child and I didn\u2019t really know how to respond.\" said by Mariah\n\"Because of dom.\" said by Sharon\n\"It really flustered me and I was just struggling with all of these different thoughts. And I didn\u2019t wanna say, \u201cyes, I\u2019ve been pregnant before, but not with this baby and the one that I was pregnant with before has a different mom.\u201d But I also didn\u2019t wanna deny dom because that was such an important time in my life and I will always adore dom. But I mean, aria is my first child and I wanna tell the world how amazing she is.\" said by Mariah\n\"It\u2019s complicated, for sure. And I think that I can relate to it because when people ask me how many children I have, I have to stop and think. And I\u2019m sure that must look strange because people think, \u201clady, you don\u2019t know how many kids you have?\u201d But you know, it\u2019s complicated for me too.\" said by Sharon\n\"Because your mind instantly goes to cassie.\" said by Mariah\n\"I\u2019m not really sure where to start.\" said by Daniel\n\"It\u2019s okay. Just take your time.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah. Well, I feel like I need to be careful here \u2019cause I don\u2019t really wanna betray summer\u2019s trust.\" said by Daniel\n\"So, it\u2019s about summer.\" said by Lily\n\"I had this strange conversation with her. I mean, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s probably already regretting most of what she said.\" said by Daniel\n\"Okay. Well, look, I promise you that whatever is said here, it will not leave this room.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah. I mean, I know that.\" said by Daniel\n\"What happened?\" said by Lily\n\"I ran into summer last night. She was a mess. You know, she was hanging out at the park all alone. I\u2013 I don\u2019t know, you know, I\u2019m having a tough time dealing with this, but summer is falling apart. She\u2019s looking for answers that just aren\u2019t there and because she can\u2019t find them in real life, she\u2019s making them up in her head. And it\u2013 I don\u2019t know, scares me.\" said by Daniel\n\"I didn\u2019t mean to startle you. No, I don\u2019t wanna intrude.\" said by Chance\n\"No, you\u2019re not. I mean, it\u2019s a public park, right? It\u2019s open to anyone and plus, it\u2019s named after your family, so you have more of a right to be here than anyone.\" said by Summer\n\"I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how it works.\" said by Chance\n\"I don\u2019t mind the company. Can I ask you though, what are you doing here? Shouldn\u2019t you be out looking for stark\u2019s killer?\" said by Summer\n\"It\u2019s not supposed to be public knowledge yet. Yeah, I guess word must be getting out that his death wasn\u2019t an accident.\" said by Chance\n\"Hard to keep that kind of thing quiet.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah. Well, I am just consulting on this case. His body was found in pheasant lake. It\u2019s outside my jurisdiction.\" said by Chance\n\"You\u2019ll know more about stark than anyone in that area. You know what a disgusting thug he was.\" said by Summer\n\"The guys over there, they\u2019re good and his record speaks for itself.\" said by Chance\n\"So, you\u2019re not here looking for clues or anything?\" said by Summer\n\"You know, that\u2019s not really what detectives do. I don\u2019t just pop up random places, whip out a magnifying glass like sherlock holmes.\" said by Chance\n\"From what I\u2019ve seen, your method is usually to watch. The brooding look in your eye. It\u2019s why I asked you to go to my mom\u2019s memorial service because you watch. You analyze.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah. Most of the time. Today, I just came up here to think through. Same as you, I imagine? Yeah. Yeah, I bet we have a lot of the same things weighing on our minds.\" said by Chance\n\"This is not denial. This is devotion. This is commitment. This is confidence. I would never spring an impromptu wedding on you.\" said by Jack\n\"You know, I\u2013 I believe you.\" said by Diane\n\"Good. You should.\" said by Jack\n\"You\u2019re impossible.\" said by Diane\n\"I am going to get you through this, diane.\" said by Jack\n\"How can you be so certain? How does that even make sense? I am stuck in here for god knows how long. And jack, you have a life to live.\" said by Diane\n\"You are my life. And here\u2019s how we do it. You let me visit every day as long as they\u2019ll let me. I am not going to let you go through this alone. If you need to shut down in order to survive, well, you\u2019ll shut down right alongside of me.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, damn you!\" said by Diane\n\"Damn me? You won\u2019t be pushing me away?\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, I\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019T. Because as good as this moment feels right now, nothing has changed. And I am\u2013 I am not going to drag you down alongside me or the rest of the family. You need to go.\" said by Diane\n\"Don\u2019t do this, diane.\" said by Jack\n\"Guard, I\u2019m ready to leave now.\" said by Diane\n\"There\u2019s something else you need to hear.\" said by Jack\n\"Michael can tell me what it is.\" said by Diane\n\"Jeremy stark is dead. No two bodies are the same.\" said by Jack\n\"I just hate seeing summer like that. And I tried talking her through her feelings, helping her to see reality. She just covered, told me that she got it, but I mean, I could tell she was still hanging onto that fantasy she\u2019d created in her head.\" said by Daniel\n\"Look, what matters is that you were there for her and maybe she needs more time.\" said by Lily\n\"She\u2019s just so angry. You know, I mean, I\u2019m mad about what happened to mom too, but summer, she\u2019s got some serious rage and it\u2019s not helping her cope with the loss.\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, I mean, there\u2019s no right way to grieve or to help someone through it.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah. More than anything, I just want for my sister to be okay. But I don\u2019t really know how that\u2019s possible when I\u2019m barely keeping my own head above water.\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, look, I mean, you\u2019re both in a lot of pain. You know, you need each other right now. You\u2019re going through the same thing.\" said by Lily\n\"We both want mom back so bad. We\u2019re both seeing her in our dreams. And now summer is seeing her while she\u2019s awake.\" said by Daniel\n\"Look, the mind is a powerful thing. It makes sense that you would wanna try to undo her death somehow.\" said by Lily\n\"Unfortunately, that\u2019s not happening.\" said by Daniel\n\"No, but it doesn\u2019t stop the heart from wishing that it was.\" said by Lily\n\"Can\u2019t argue with that.\" said by Daniel\n\"Look, I know from experience that losing someone is soul crushing. And it\u2019s not gonna go away for a long time. So, you know, you and summer, as you\u2019re working through this grief, you guys are gonna do and say more things that you regret.\" said by Lily\n\"Well, I don\u2019t regret anything that I\u2019ve done so far. Most of all, reconnecting with you. I mean, I don\u2019t know what I did to deserve you coming back into my life, but I\u2013 I hope you\u2019re not having any regrets either.\" said by Daniel\n\"Jeremy\u2019s dead? How? When did this happen?\" said by Diane\n\"It happened a few days ago. I tried to tell you the last time.\" said by Jack\n\"How did he die?\" said by Diane\n\"It appears to be murder.\" said by Jack\n\"Do they know who killed him?\" said by Diane\n\"I think the police are looking into his criminal activities and I\u2019m guessing that one or several of his colleagues had a grudge serious enough they wanted him dead.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, I\u2019m sure of it. I\u2019ve met some of those people. They\u2019re no one you would wanna mess with. But, you know, jeremy\u2019s ego always made him feel like he was untouchable.\" said by Diane\n\"Well, he\u2019s not going to be mourned. Certainly not in genoa city. How do you feel about that?\" said by Jack\n\"Well, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m relieved that he\u2019s no longer a threat to our family, but at the same time, this\u2013 this doesn\u2019t exactly work in my favor.\" said by Diane\n\"Because like me, you think stark killed phyllis?\" said by Jack\n\"I know he did. Which makes his death a really bad thing for me. Now that jeremy\u2019s gone, there\u2019s no way to get a confession from him. The only person who could clear my name is now dead.\" said by Diane\n\"Do you have any ideas about who killed stark?\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, we don\u2019t have to talk about that. I know it\u2019s just gonna bring up memories of your mom and all these unanswered questions. I don\u2019t wanna do that to you.\" said by Chance\n\"The memories I can handle. It\u2019S\u2026 it\u2019s the guilt that I can\u2019t stand. I still feel like I owe my mom answers and apparently, there aren\u2019t any.\" said by Summer\n\"Hey. The sheriff\u2019s department that\u2019s handling this investigation, they know what they\u2019re doing, okay? And I will keep you updated as well. I\u2019ll stay on top of this case.\" said by Chance\n\"Chance, is there anything that you can say about stark\u2019s death? I mean, did he drown in that lake? Were there\u2013 were there wi\u2013 witnesses? Is there any other physical evidence?\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, is there anything else going on?\" said by Chance\n\"Other than my mom was murdered? Followed by her new husband being murdered? And the fact that the\u2013 those two things, they\u2013 they must be related.\" said by Summer\n\"I just got a feeling that there might be something else.\" said by Chance\n\"What else is there other than the fact that my mom is gone!\" said by Summer\n\"Summer. Hey, look at me. If you know something or if you\u2019ve learned something new, you can tell me.\" said by Chance\n\"You\u2019re the police. How could I know something that you don\u2019t? We live our lives on our home\u2019s fabrics.\" said by Summer\n\"Are you asking if I regret our night together?\" said by Lily\n\"I thought I was being subtle.\" said by Daniel\n\"You weren\u2019T. Did you hear regret in my voice that night?\" said by Lily\n\"No. Maybe since.\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, we haven\u2019t talked about it since.\" said by Lily\n\"I know. That\u2019s what started me thinking\u2013\" said by Daniel\n\"Okay. Listen, let me be very clear. I don\u2019t regret it. Clearly, it was something that we both wanted and needed. And I think, you know, we just thought that happened and we didn\u2019t talk about it again.\" said by Lily\n\"Okay. Yeah, no, great. I\u2019m sorry that I forced the issue.\" said by Daniel\n\"No, no, no. I\u2019m actually glad you did. \u2018Cause I do think that we moved on from it too quickly, especially after everything that we\u2019ve been through.\" said by Lily\n\"Sure. I mean, you\u2019re dealing with a loss too.\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, I mean, look, I\u2019m not comparing my breakup to your grief, you know. But yeah, I mean, it\u2019s been\u2013 it\u2019s been a lot.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah. You and billy are on the mend. I don\u2019t think either one of us are really in a place of starting anything new right now. I don\u2019t know. I think that we just shouldn\u2019t put any unnecessary pressure on each other. There\u2019s no need to label anything. And I think that the most important thing here is our friendship.\" said by Daniel\n\"I agree. And I don\u2019t wanna do anything to damage that.\" said by Lily\n\"No. What we did the other night didn\u2019t damage anything.\" said by Daniel\n\"[ Laughing ] No, it was lovely.\" said by Lily\n\"It was more than lovely.\" said by Daniel\n\"[ Laughing ] I agree. So, are we good?\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah, why wouldn\u2019t we be good? Hm? Why are we even talking about this? Did I\u2013 I brought this\u2013\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah, you brought it up.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah, I brought this up. Now I\u2019m the idiot. You know, I\u2019m gonna go. I\u2019m gonna let you get back to work.\" said by Daniel\n\"Okay. Well, thank you for the coffee. And I\u2019ll check in with you later.\" said by Lily\n\"Okay.\" said by Daniel\n\"[ Laughing ] Bye.\" said by Lily\n\"Bye.\" said by Daniel\n\"Hey. Hey.\" said by Devon\n\"Hey. I was just heading out.\" said by Daniel\n\"All right, see ya.\" said by Devon\n\"Yep.\" said by Daniel\n\"Hi.\" said by Lily\n\"Hi. How is everything going in the omega sphere? Or do I even have to ask?\" said by Devon\n\"You always talk about cassie with so much love.\" said by Mariah\n\"She was such a shining light. Just like you. And I never wanna stop talking about her because it\u2019s a way of keeping her spirit alive. But when a stranger or a new acquaintance asks about her, I have to weigh how much I wanna say. And there\u2019s no way I can respond to that casually, but if I do say what happened to her, it can get awkward. Hearing about the loss of a child makes people uncomfortable.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, if you ever want to talk to me about cassie, I would love to listen. You know, I think about her a lot too. I do. I wonder if we would\u2019ve had our own language like twins sometimes do, or if we would\u2019ve dressed alike or been the complete opposites.\" said by Mariah\n\"Probably the latter.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s true. I mean, everybody\u2019s happy and healthy. And I know when people are\u2013 are striking up conversations, they\u2019re just trying to find a way to connect. Like, hey, we\u2019re both moms. But I don\u2019t know, it still catches me off guard.\" said by Mariah\n\"You know what, someday, someone is probably gonna say, \u201caria looks just like you or tessa.\u201d\" said by Sharon\n\"Oh, my gosh! That has already happened. I mean, she has no hair and her eyes were closed. But hey, sure. Yeah, we look alike.\" said by Mariah\n\"My last chance for freedom died with jeremy.\" said by Diane\n\"Wait, that is not necessarily true.\" said by Jack\n\"Forget. Forget getting a confession. They can\u2019t even question him now. Now that jeremy\u2019s gone, the only person they\u2019re gonna come after is me.\" said by Diane\n\"Slow down. Look, chances of getting a confession out of jeremy stark was always slim to none. Now that they know it\u2019s a murder investigation, they have to investigate. Here\u2019s what we hope for. In the process of searching for his killer, they find proof that he was behind phyllis\u2019s death.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, my god. That\u2019s an even longer shot than a confession. And I doubt that jeremy left behind any proof.\" said by Diane\n\"Oh, I\u2019m not so sure about that. A guy as cocky as that is going to probably want a few mementos of his accomplishments.\" said by ", "answer": "Jack"}

You are picking up food to bring back to the office because you\u2019re working overtime.\" said by Abby\n\"[ Chuckles ] Yeah, well, there is a lot going on at chancellor-winters these days.\" said by Lily\n\"How are you feeling about everything?\" said by Abby\n\"Well, you were there when devon said he\u2019s ready to go to court over this.\" said by Lily\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Abby\n\"What do you think about it? I mean, I know that you\u2019re loyal to devon, and clearly he trusts you if he said it was fine for you to stay while we were chatting.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah. Well, I just really felt like I found a win-win situation for us. I mean, he gets to keep the name and get paid handsomely, and we get to move forward with the ipo. Anybody clearly, devon doesn\u2019t feel the same way about it.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah, but how do you feel about it? Because, I mean, you were very quiet during our conversation. Do you really think that devon is making the right decision?\" said by Lily\n\"Look who it is.\" said by Devon\n\"Hello, there, devon.\" said by Victoria\n\"Hi, victoria.\" said by Devon\n\"So, how are things going with the ipo?\" said by Victoria\n\"Uh, well, why would I want to talk about that with you after you tried to take my company?\" said by Devon\n\"I may have had some interest initially, but I\u2019ve moved on.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, well, that\u2019s good to hear. You\u2019ve been making some interesting choices lately at newman media. I hope you don\u2019t regret hiring nate and audra, since they both betrayed chancellor-winters.\" said by Devon\n\"I\u2019m sorry there\u2019s a rift between you and nate.\" said by Victoria\n\"Are you?\" said by Devon\n\"Yes, of course I am. I know how important family is, and I know how tricky family business can be.\" said by Victoria\n\"Bet you do.\" said by Devon\n\"Speaking of family, how are things going with tucker?\" said by Victoria\n\"Thank you. I\u2019m willing to sit down with you, but anything we discuss regarding omega sphere is purely hypothetical. You know that I have a deal with chancellor-winters.\" said by Daniel\n\"I do. I was gonna ask you about that.\" said by Tucker\n\"Should have a better idea in a week.\" said by Daniel\n\"I admire your patience [Chuckles] And your loyalty, [Inhales deeply] Especially to a company that seems so in flux.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, lily is a dear and trusted friend.\" said by Daniel\n\"Hmm. Yeah, but she can\u2019t know everything, right? And this is your vision, your future. It\u2019s a possible legacy move for you. Have you ever been involved in anything potentially this big?\" said by Tucker\n\"Nothing of this scale when it comes to business. I was an artist, so I was painting, doing photography. These are all uncharted waters for me, which is why I need to make sure that I align myself with someone that I trust completely.\" said by Daniel\n\"You mean, someone unlike me.\" said by Tucker\n\"Hey, thank you for telling me about your conversation with kyle. I need to speak to him now. You know, I just don\u2019t want his fears about us to fester. And if he felt the need to discuss them with you, then I should do the same with him.\" said by Diane\n\"I\u2019ll call and tell him to join us.\" said by Jack\n\"No, no, no, no. I should talk to him alone. I \u2014 I want him to be able to speak his mind freely without worrying what your reaction would be or wondering if you were going to defend me or not.\" said by Diane\n\"And we both know I would.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Chuckles ] Yeah. This also is not a conversation for the office.\" said by Diane\n\"Okay, you decide what\u2019s best.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. Kyle. Hi. I was wondering if we could talk. Um, can you meet me at the house?\" said by Diane\n\"As misguided as it is for dad to try and create trouble for you at jabot, it does seem like he wants to bring you back in the fold. Hey, is everything alright?\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s fine.\" said by Sally\n\"Doesn\u2019t seem like that.\" said by Nick\n\"I am more interested in what the two of you were discussing. The parts of your body that collagen supports:\" said by Sally\n\"Uh, my brother was just alerting me to a potential land mine set by our father, and I was about to thank him, even though his motives were potentially self-serving.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, adam, I just hope you can use the information regardless of why I shared it. Sly well, I\u2019m just relieved the two of you aren\u2019t battling each other \u2014 at least, not now.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh,no, we\u2019re not ready to throw a fist just yet. We are, um \u2014 what are we doing? How would you characterize this, nicholas?\" said by Adam\n\"Just trying to keep our father from causing trouble.\" said by Nick\n\"Hmm. Good. Uh, you know, I \u2014 I\u2019ve kind of lost my appetite. I-I should get going, but \u2014\" said by Sally\n\"Hold on a second. Alright, you are not acting like yourself. What\u2019s \u2014 what\u2019s wrong?\" said by Adam\n\"It\u2019s nothing, I swear. You know, I just have a lot on my mind, getting this new company going. You know, we\u2019ve hit a few snags, but it\u2019s all gonna work out.\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2019ll leave with you.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Adam\n\"What\u2019s going on? That phone call really seemed to upset you.\" said by Nick\n\"Uh, it was my O.B., Dr. Chandler, but I really don\u2019t want to talk about it in here, so\u2026\" said by Sally\n\"[ Sighing ]\" said by Adam\n\"Why would you ask me about tucker?\" said by Devon\n\"I just know that it must be tense now that you know his true motives for coming to genoa city was to take control of chancellor-winters and jabot. I mean, it must hurt, given that when he first came back, he said that he wanted to connect with you and dominic.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, I didn\u2019t trust him from the day he turned up, so that doesn\u2019t hurt that much. But I imagine that you learned about his true motives from audra?\" said by Devon\n\"No, actually, i talked with tucker about it myself.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, you did? That\u2019s interesting. You seem awfully curious about my relationship with him and the ipo and chancellor-winters, all in the same conversation.\" said by Devon\n\"I\u2019m just asking you as a friend. It\u2019s not business.\" said by Victoria\n\"I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d call us friends, victoria, but I do know that you don\u2019t do anything casually. So why don\u2019t you just come clean about what you really want?\" said by Devon\n\"I know you\u2019re wary of me, and not without good reason, considering my history in this town with some of the folks. But I just wish I could convince you that we share a similar vision.\" said by Tucker\n\"Hmm. I actually do think that we share some common ground. Your pitch earlier struck a chord with me.\" said by Daniel\n\"Really?\" said by Tucker\n\"Mm hmm. So much so that I spoke with my mother about it.\" said by Daniel\n\"Uh-oh.\" said by Tucker\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Daniel\n\"I cannot imagine phyllis was in favor of us going into business together.\" said by Tucker\n\"[ Chuckles ] Oh, you are correct. Well, this is my venture. I\u2019m going to make the final decision as to who we partner with if things do fall apart at chancellor-winters. My mother, well, she\u2019s going to have to deal with whatever decision I make.\" said by Daniel\n\"I like the sound of that, although I know phyllis can be a little, uh\u2026\" said by Tucker\n\"Bossy?\" said by Daniel\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Tucker\n\"Stubborn?\" said by Daniel\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Tucker\n\"Always thinks she\u2019s right?\" said by Daniel\n\"I was gonna say \u201cformidable,\u201d but\u2026\" said by Tucker\n\"Mm-hmm. Well, she works for me, so I\u2019ll handle her. And that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m gonna turn my back on lily \u2014 you know, not without cause.\" said by Daniel\n\"Sure.\" said by Tucker\n\"I just hope that\u2019s something that you can appreciate and, um, maybe back off until things have settled.\" said by Daniel\n\"But you should know, my company is absolutely the most viable place for your dream to come to life. And, uh, [Chuckles] When i set my heart to something, I \u2014 I don\u2019t ever give up, which [Sighs] Has been a problem for me, learning to let go. So I\u2019ve been combating that with the belief that things are going to work out the way they\u2019re meant to. You know, simply trust the universe and all that?\" said by Tucker\n\"I\u2019m sorry, what did you say?\" said by Daniel\n\"Look, I have seen far too many times how business can damage family relationships. And at first, I was trying to nudge devon to accept the buyout.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah, well, too bad it didn\u2019t work.\" said by Lily\n\"I disagree. I mean, after listening to devon, I understand his perspective. Hamilton-winters means so much to him, and it would be awful for him to lose it to some ipo that he never supported in the first place.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah, but do you realize how ugly a lawsuit could become? I mean, you think there\u2019s hurt feelings and resentment now. Imagine what going to court would do.\" said by Lily\n\"Honestly, I don\u2019t know why you and jill don\u2019t just accept devon\u2019s decision. Chancellor industries was huge before it ever merged with hamilton-winters. So why don\u2019t you just go back to that? And why are you willing to fight your brother for something that\u2019s dollars and cents to you, but it means everything to devon? I think it says more about your priorities than anything else.\" said by Abby\n\"[ Chuckles ] How dare you question my priorities? To you, it may just be an elevator.\" said by Lily\n\"Who are you to tell me that I care more about my business than my family? My family has always been a priority to me, and I really resent you saying otherwise.\" said by Lily\n\"I think you\u2019re misinterpreting what I said. I never said you didn\u2019t value your family.\" said by Abby\n\"Abby, I\u2019m only talking to you about this because I\u2019m trying to figure out a way to have devon and I work this out together. I\u2019m not trying to get you to convince him to not fight for his company. I\u2019m trying to convince him to stay at chancellor-winters.\" said by Lily\n\"Devon has made it clear \u2014 drop the ipo.\" said by Abby\n\"Jill is not gonna go for that. She\u2019s not. The whole reason for this merger was to have our family work together. And I\u2019ve already lost nate, and now I feel like I\u2019m losing devon. And he\u2019s saying that he wants to protect our father\u2019s legacy. Like, he\u2019s my father, too. Of course I want to protect his legacy. And he doesn\u2019t realize that if we go to court over this, it could damage hamilton-winters. And I don\u2019t think he\u2019s considering that risk.\" said by Lily\n\"Have you said this to your brother?\" said by Abby\n\"I\u2019ve tried. I have tried, and he just seems so set in doing this. Abby, listen, I would never ask you to go against your instinct, but you said you know what kind of turmoil this could cause to a family. So a legal battle would damage us all. So I\u2019m just asking you if you think that devon might regret walking away. Just tell him that. Please, just tell him that, as one last try.\" said by Lily\n\"I\u2019m not sure what you mean. I don\u2019t really have anything to come clean about.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, really? Okay, well, then I\u2019m gonna go ahead and take off because I need to get back home. Abby is dropping off dominic, so I\u2019ll see you later.\" said by Devon\n\"Devon, uh\u2026\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah?\" said by Devon\n\"[ Sighs ] = You may not see it this way, but I still \u2014 I still see you as a friend. And we are connected by family through abby and dominic. I hope we can find a way to separate the business and the personal. I\u2019ve had to learn to do that as a newman. It\u2019s not easy.\" said by Victoria\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Devon\n\"But if you count everyone that you have a different professional agenda with your enemy, then your circle gets very small.\" said by Victoria\n\"I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m trying to trust the universe?\" said by Tucker\n\"[ Chuckles ] The same exact thing that heather always used to say to me. Sorry. It just caught me off guard, hearing those words.\" said by Daniel\n\"Hmm. You miss her a lot?\" said by Tucker\n\"I do. But I\u2019m following her advice and yours. I\u2019m living my life and I\u2019m having faith that one day we\u2019re gonna be reunited. That\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the reason why this project is so important to me and believe that it\u2019s the path that I\u2019m meant to be on, the one that\u2019s gonna bring me back to lucy and heather. So I\u2019m just trusting the universe.\" said by Daniel\n\"Hmm. I guess you must have a certain amount of trust in phyllis, too.\" said by Tucker\n\"Why would you say that?\" said by Daniel\n\"I assumed she was going to portugal to help smooth things over with your partner and daughter. The universe needs a little boost sometimes.\" said by Tucker\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Diane\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Kyle\n\"Hey, thanks for coming. Um, I-I know you\u2019re busy, but I \u2014 I kind of felt like this conversation couldn\u2019t wait, and, well, I thought we could use some privacy.\" said by Diane\n\"What you want to talk about?\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, I spoke to summer, and she clearly has reservations about jack and i being romantically involved again. I \u2014 I tried to address her concerns, but I-I-I don\u2019t know how effective I was.\" said by Diane\n\"Well, I haven\u2019t had a chance to talk to summer about that yet.\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, I also spoke to jack, and he told me that the two of you talked earlier.\" said by Diane\n\"Thought that was supposed to be a private father-son conversation. Is this how it\u2019s gonna be now \u2014 I say something to one of you and it\u2019s automatically shared with the other?\" said by Kyle\n\"No, no, absolutely not. But, kyle, that\u2019s why I wanted to talk to you. I-I don\u2019t want to hear how you\u2019re feeling from summer or from jack. I want to hear it from you. And [Sighs] I want you to be honest with me. Suffering from sinus congestion, especially at night?\" said by Diane\n\"I am still processing the idea that you and dad are back together. Like I said before, when you broke the news. I\u2019m conflicted.\" said by Kyle\n\"And I want you to tell me why.\" said by Diane\n\"I\u2019m worried things may not work out, which happen way more often than \u201chappily ever after.\u201d\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, I have no intention of messing things up with jack. I love your father\u2019s big heart, and I am not going to break it again.\" said by Diane\n\"I want to believe that. But people make promises and things happen. Things have happened. I know you\u2019ve hurt him in the past, moving us around, cutting us off from him.\" said by Kyle\n\"Alright, well, things were complicated back then.\" said by Diane\n\"Yeah, but dad\u2019s heart is not complicated. And if it is broken, so is the entire abbott family, because we rely on him, we lean on him.\" said by Kyle\n\"I know, and I accept that responsibility.\" said by Diane\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Sally\n\"[ Sighs ] Alright, now that we, uh, have some privacy, do you want to tell me what your doctor said?\" said by Nick\n\"Um, yeah, I\u2019m \u2014 I, um\u2013 I just went in for some routine prenatal testing, and \u2014 and everything\u2019s fine, but, um, they want me to come back in because my blood pressure is high.\" said by Sally\n\"Has that been an issue for you in the past?\" said by Nick\n\"No, not at all. And I mean, dr. Chandler assured me there was nothing to worry about at this point. I\u2019m in good physical shape. They said they\u2019d just keep an eye on it and treat it if need be.\" said by Sally\n\"Okay, well, it sounds like your doctor\u2019s just being cautious.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah. Yeah, but it still threw me. It just got me thinking about this massive responsibility coming my way and all the ways that my life is gonna change, in the ways that I\u2019m gonna have to adjust \u2014 ways that I-I can\u2019t predict and ways I-I never even planned for. And just got me thinking, how \u2014 how am I gonna navigate all of it?\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, phyllis told me about her trip to portugal. You seem surprised. Did you not know?\" said by Tucker\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Daniel\n\"Oh, man, I\u2019m sorry I-I overstepped. Pretend I didn\u2019t say anything.\" said by Tucker\n\"No. No, no, I-I appreciate the information. Not a big fan of surprises, especially ones concocted by my mother.\" said by Daniel\n\"Mm. Yeah, I\u2019m \u2014 again, I\u2019m sorry if I caused you any trouble. Listen, I got to get going, but I\u2019m really looking forward to continuing this conversation. So, alright, man? Give me a call anytime you want. Okay?\" said by Tucker\n\"Thank you.\" said by Daniel\n\"Alright. See you.\" said by Tucker\n\"[ Clears throat ] I don\u2019t know what you think you\u2019re doing, but you better stop. You better not have gotten on that plane.\" said by Daniel\n\"[ Sighing ] Oh, yeah. Oh.\" said by Devon\n\"Hey, you.\" said by Abby\n\"Hey.\" said by Devon\n\"I just got here. Dominic had a busy day at the play gym, so I put him down for a nap.\" said by Abby\n\"Oh, nice.\" said by Devon\n\"Is everything okay? What\u2019s on your mind?\" said by Abby\n\"Um, I just ran into victoria at the coffeehouse, and now I can\u2019t shake the feeling that she\u2019s up to something with tucker.\" said by Devon\n\"Why would victoria be involved with tucker in any way?\" said by Abby\n\"I have zero idea. But she seemed oddly curious about my relationship status with him, and I don\u2019t know if it had anything to do with chancellor-winters or not, but\u2026\" said by Devon\n\"Weird. Um\u2026 [ Chuckles ]\" said by Abby\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, I actually had an interesting run-in with your sister, and she said some things that surprised me.\" said by Abby\n\"How so?\" said by Devon\n\"I thought that lily was fighting you over hamilton-winters because she wanted to hang on to the winters half of chancellor-winters.\" said by Abby\n\"If she\u2019s not, why is she fighting me at all and refusing to sell me my company back?\" said by Devon\n\"She painted a very different picture today. I\u2019m managing my high blood pressure,\" said by Abby\n\"What exactly did lily say to you?\" said by Devon\n\"[ Sighs ] That she\u2019s a sister who wants nothing more than to work alongside her brother.\" said by Abby\n\"Right. Well, yeah, I know that. That was the whole original motive for merging the companies together. But I don\u2019t think she wants it anymore, since she\u2019s siding with jill and wanted to hold on to my company.\" said by Devon\n\"Or maybe that\u2019s her way of getting you to stay on.\" said by Abby\n\"How does she figure that\u2019s gonna work? Getting me to stay on board? What, she wants to unify our family by not listening to my concerns and refusing to sell me back hamilton-winters?\" said by Devon\n\"Look, I know that it sounds crazy, but I saw lily\u2019s pain. I could hear it in her voice. And, yes, maybe for jill, it\u2019s about the bottom line. But for lily, I think she just wants to hang on to her dream. The dream of you two working together. She doesn\u2019t want to hang on to hamilton-winters. She wants to hang on to you.\" said by ", "answer": "Abby"}

It\u2019s not what you want. I\u2013 I get it. You\u2019re afraid that adam is working some angle and he\u2019s trying to edge you out of the picture. But nick, I promise you that is not what\u2019s happening. I just really hope on top of everything else that this hasn\u2019t gotten to be too much for you. Tide is busting laundry\u2019s biggest myth\u2026\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2019m okay with adam coming to the appointment.\" said by Nick\n\"Really?\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, really. He is the father of that little boy or little girl. Nobody is pretending like that isn\u2019t happening.\" said by Nick\n\"True.\" said by Sally\n\"I told you I will follow your lead when it comes to this baby. And I know I\u2019m gonna have to share him or her with adam when it comes. But I want to make sure we\u2019re all on the same page, that I will not be sharing you.\" said by Nick\n\"This baby may be adam\u2019s, but I am all yours.\" said by Sally\n\"Good. How long \u2019til your appointment?\" said by Nick\n\"Um, it\u2019s not \u2019til this afternoon, plenty of time. Is there any special reason why you\u2019re asking? Is there something that you would like to do in the meantime?\" said by Sally\n\"Don\u2019t you tempt me.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, why not?\" said by Sally\n\"[ Sighs ] Very interested in your offer, but I really need to run by the office and see vic. And I will meet up with you and adam at the coffeehouse.\" said by Nick\n\"All right. Works for me.\" said by Sally\n\"Okay.\" said by Nick\n\"Adam, look at you, you\u2019re beaming. What\u2019s your big news?\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, it\u2019s not news yet, but it will be by this afternoon.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay, well, don\u2019t keep me in suspense. What is it?\" said by Sharon\n\"Today is the day that sally and I find out if our baby\u2019s a boy or a girl.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, wow. I am so excited for you. I know what a big day that is.\" said by Sharon\n\"Thank you. Thank you.\" said by Adam\n\"So, um, when\u2019s the appointment?\" said by Sharon\n\"Uh, it\u2019s a couple hours from now. I\u2019m, uh, meeting nick and sally here before we head to the ultrasound.\" said by Adam\n\"Nick and sally? The three of you?\" said by Sharon\n\"That\u2019s right.\" said by Adam\n\"Wow. Aren\u2019t you the modern family? So, no more resentment?\" said by Sharon\n\"[ Chuckles] Not on my part. And nick is being open-minded.\" said by Adam\n\"I\u2019m glad to hear it.\" said by Sharon\n\"It\u2019s not ideal. We\u2019re all doing the best we can. Even nick, which I have to say surprises me, in a good way.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, that\u2019s the right attitude to have, so good for you.\" said by Sharon\n\"Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. No, I\u2019ve been thinking about what connor means to me and after seeing mariah and tessa with their newborn, it\u2019s a great reminder that children are something to be grateful for. And it doesn\u2019t matter what the circumstances are and how they were brought into your lives. They\u2019re not responsible for those circumstances. They deserve to come into this world with a clean slate and receive unconditional love.\" said by Adam\n\"Summer told me about sally\u2019s pregnancy in confidence and I didn\u2019t want to violate her trust. And I also knew that you wouldn\u2019t take this news well.\" said by Nikki\n\"Of course, I wouldn\u2019T. For heaven\u2019s sake, sweetheart. This whole thing is an outrage.\" said by Victor\n\"And the third reason I didn\u2019t say anything is because the first trimester of pregnancy is stressful enough without having victor newman on your case.\" said by Nikki\n\"Are you defending this woman?\" said by Victor\n\"No, I am not defending her. I am protecting her child. I mean, lord knows I don\u2019t agree with most of the choices sally makes, but that doesn\u2019t negate the fact that her child will be a newman.\" said by Nikki\n\"Ah, look at you turning the tables on your old man. Way to go.\" said by Daniel\n\"Way to sidestep the question.\" said by Lucy\n\"[ Scoffs] Can you ever let me get away with something? Just once?\" said by Daniel\n\"Have you ever let me get away with anything?\" said by Lucy\n\"Okay. You can\u2019t stay. But yes, you are right, I am having a tough time. It\u2019s like my whole life, even when I moved away, mom was just always a phone call away, and, um, well, now she\u2019s not. So, I\u2019m just trying to, you know, figure out my way through this world that she\u2019s not a part of.\" said by Daniel\n\"I\u2019m so sorry, dad.\" said by Lucy\n\"Look, I\u2019m gonna\u2013 I\u2019m gonna get through this, okay? It\u2019s just weird. You know, growing up you see other people lose their parents, but\u2026 and you figure for yourself it\u2019s gonna be decades away. I thought I had all those years left with her. Now that\u2019s just gone. The virus that causes shingles is sleeping\u2026\" said by Daniel\n\"Okay. So, we\u2019re agreed that we each will head up our own divisions and have autonomy within them.\" said by Lily\n\"Yes. And we will be both open to each other\u2019s advice as well as jill\u2019s, right?\" said by Devon\n\"Yes, of course. But I do think that we each should have final say within our own division.\" said by Lily\n\"I think so, too. It sounds good so far.\" said by Devon\n\"Good.\" said by Lily\n\"When you talk about, though, us maintaining boundaries, I agree on a professional level, but I don\u2019t want you to stop talking to me like we\u2019re family when we\u2019re here, or sharing your thoughts with me. \u2018Cause I always need you to do that.\" said by Devon\n\"No, of course. You know I have your back and I know that you have mine. You know, and\u2013 and before, I did feel beholden to jill because she\u2019s the head of board of directors. But I promise you, if I feel like what you\u2019re saying is correct, then I will definitely have your back.\" said by Lily\n\"And what about when you think that what I\u2019m saying is wrong?\" said by Devon\n\"[ Laughs ] Then I will respectfully tell you what a terrible idea it is.\" said by Lily\n\"Okay. Well, it\u2019s good to know that we\u2019re on the same page, then.\" said by Devon\n\"I\u2019m just so happy you\u2019re back. I missed you. And it has been a rough few months, but here we are.\" said by Lily\n\"I haven\u2019t given much thought to what it would be like if you, or mom\u2026 if I didn\u2019t have you in my world anymore. And, um\u2026 now you\u2019re going through that. How do you handle it?\" said by Lucy\n\"I\u2019ll be okay.\" said by Daniel\n\"Dad, I know you. Sometimes you just forget and you don\u2019t take care of yourself.\" said by Lucy\n\"I promise, I will this time. There\u2019s no way I\u2019m gonna spiral back to that place that I was stuck in. And\u2013 and\u2013 I have this as a reminder that I have a terrific daughter who loves me and needs me to be okay for her.\" said by Daniel\n\"It\u2019s good to know you\u2019ll be thinking of me, but dad\u2026 we both know you need more than just me and your life.\" said by Lucy\n\"I\u2019m really proud of you, adam. You know, this is a delicate situation and you\u2019re handling it with grace.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, thank you. It means a lot. But it\u2019s still early. I could turn this whole thing to an epic disaster by dinner time.\" said by Adam\n\"That\u2019s true. But I don\u2019t think you will. It feels like you\u2019re making all the right decisions, for the right reasons.\" said by Sharon\n\"Hmm. Well, it\u2019s not like I was given much of a choice.\" said by Adam\n\"True. Does that mean that you\u2019ve given up your feelings for sally?\" said by Sharon\n\"Honestly? No, I\u2013 I haven\u2019T. I still love sally and I wish that we could be a family.\" said by Adam\n\"Understandable.\" said by Sharon\n\"But those feelings are separate from this kid that is on the way.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, I have seen you with connor and you are a really wonderful father to him. So, I\u2019m sure when this baby gets here you will be just as great to him\u2013 or her.\" said by Sharon\n\"That\u2019s the plan. But I have to remember this is sally\u2019s first child. I\u2019ve been a parent for a while. She has no idea what to expect.\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah, the experience you get from raising the first one\u2013\" said by Sharon\n\"Right, it\u2019s huge.\" said by Adam\n\"There\u2019s no substitute.\" said by Sharon\n\"So, my focus is on sally and it\u2019s on helping her prepare for these first few weeks and accepting whatever place I have in that until the birth. And from that point, I\u2019ll be a 50/50 parent.\" said by Adam\n\"Amen\" said by Sharon\n\"Sally may think she doesn\u2019t need me, may not want me, but this baby is gonna get all the love that I have to give.\" said by Adam\n\"So, what are you hoping for? Girl or boy?\" said by Sharon\n\"I\u2019ll tell you later, uh, sally\u2019s here.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, okay, have fun.\" said by Sharon\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Adam\n\"I guess, uh, we both beat nick here, huh?\" said by Sally\n\"Uh-huh.\" said by Adam\n\"That spectra woman can never be trusted. Yet here she is reeling in both of my sons. To tie herself closer to our family. Why on god\u2019s green earth would I ever approve of that?\" said by Victor\n\"You wouldn\u2019t?\" said by Nikki\n\"Then why the hell did the rest of you decide to keep this from me?\" said by Victor\n\"No, that\u2019s not it. It\u2019s about letting things play out on their own. I mean, someday soon nicholas is going to wake up and realize that sally is totally wrong for him. And then it will be his decision to break up with her. If we interfere, I worry that it could blow up in our faces.\" said by Nikki\n\"Baby, what if that never happens? What if she decides to carry this charade on indefinitely?\" said by Victor\n\"And what charade would that be?\" said by Nick\n\"A charade that you are involved with, son. The hell is the matter with you? You carry on with a woman that\u2019s pregnant with your brother\u2019s child. Are you mad? Why are you doing this? You torment your brother. For bathroom odors that linger.\" said by Victor\n\"You don\u2019t have to worry about me, lucy.\" said by Daniel\n\"You\u2019re my dad. I\u2019m always gonna worry about you. You just\u2013 you need other people close by you that you can trust and depend on. Friends, like lily.\" said by Lucy\n\"Hmm. You wouldn\u2019t happen to be trying to play matchmaker, would you? Because you are not that subtle.\" said by Daniel\n\"Subtlety is for cowards.\" said by Lucy\n\"Mm. You and lily are great together, don\u2019t you think?\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah, we\u2019re great friends. Is that okay?\" said by Daniel\n\"You used to be more, though.\" said by Lucy\n\"Yes, once upon a time, we used to be more. But, you know, things are different when you grow up. Your friends, they\u2013 they can move away, you can drift apart. Sometimes it\u2019s not worth really going out on a limb and trying to force something or make something more of a relationship when it\u2019s not there. Because, you know, if you blow it, you run the risk of losing that person forever.\" said by Daniel\n\"I get it. It\u2019s very ross and rachel. And if that\u2019s the real reason that you\u2019re holding back, then I get it.\" said by Lucy\n\"Oh, the real reason.\" said by Daniel\n\"Look, I\u2019m not saying you need to fall madly in love with lily, or anyone else. I just\u2026 you and mom aren\u2019t together anymore and I go to school in europe. And phyllis is\u2013 is gone, too. I just hate the thought of you being alone.\" said by Lucy\n\"I promise, honestly, I\u2019m not gonna be alone. I\u2013 I have plenty of other friends besides lily, and I have, you know, acquaintances.\" said by Daniel\n\"Okay. Just don\u2019t lock out the people you\u2019re close to who already are there for you. Because pushing away people like that, it\u2019s just weird. And it\u2019s exactly how you blow things with a woman like lily. By not seeing and appreciating what\u2019s right in front of your face.\" said by Lucy\n\"[ Sighs ] I mean, where could nick be? There\u2019s no way he\u2019d miss this, at least not willingly.\" said by Sally\n\"Um, it\u2019s mariah.\" said by Sharon\n\"Uh, take it, we\u2019ll be fine.\" said by Adam\n\"Hey, sweetie, what\u2019s going on?\" said by Sharon\n\"I\u2019m sure that nick will be here any minute.\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah. I mean, the last time, you know, I saw him, he was on his way to newman. Maybe he got hung up or something. I don\u2019t know.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s not a problem. If nick got held up, we can just meet him at the doctor\u2019s appointment, but we won\u2019t start without him, okay? Just try to relax. Think positive thoughts. Everything is gonna work out how it\u2019s meant to.\" said by Adam\n\"All right. All right. Why don\u2019t we all take a deep breath before something is said that cannot be unsaid.\" said by Nikki\n\"As I have told you many, many times before, my personal life is none of your concern.\" said by Nick\n\"Son, it is my concern. For heaven\u2019s sake, don\u2019t you see what\u2019s happening? That woman is playing odds with both my sons. It\u2019s embarrassing. She can\u2019t hold on to adam, so she latches on to you. Making fun of both of you.\" said by Victor\n\"You have no idea what you\u2019re talking about and I understand that isn\u2019t gonna make you stop.\" said by Nick\n\"Doesn\u2019t this bother you at all? Don\u2019t you realize what this looks like to people?\" said by Victor\n\"You know, I did see some of what you were dealing with from the sidelines and I\u2019m sorry that I wasn\u2019t there to support you through it.\" said by Devon\n\"No, it\u2019s fine. I mean, we were barely speaking.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah, I know, but I still wish things played out differently.\" said by Devon\n\"I am just glad you\u2019re back and that we\u2019re okay again.\" said by Lily\n\"Me too. I also noticed though, that when, uh\u2013 after you and billy split and we were going through everything, that daniel stepped in as a really big support for you. I\u2019m very grateful to him for that. So, I\u2019ll let him know next time I see him.\" said by Devon\n\"Please do. I\u2019m sure some kindness can go a long way for him right now.\" said by Lily\n\"How is he dealing with his mom\u2019s passing?\" said by Devon\n\"I mean, he\u2019s struggling, you know, obviously. And unfortunately, it\u2019s going to get worse before it gets better. And I think if anyone knows that\u2013\" said by Lily\n\"It\u2019s you and me.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah, I\u2019m pretty worried about him right now.\" said by Lily\n\"It\u2019s bad enough that you and your sister, victoria, have done everything in your power to keep him out of the family business. Now, you\u2019re showing callous disregard for your brother.\" said by Victor\n\"First, I had nothing to do with victoria blocking the acquisition of mccall unlimited. I was okay with us buying it so that adam could go off and run it on his own.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, yeah. I bet. Out of sight, out of mind.\" said by Victor\n\"Second, I\u2019m not doing anything to prevent adam from raising his kid. Neither is sally, far from it.\" said by Nick\n\"You\u2019re standing in their way to raise that child as a family.\" said by Victor\n\"So you\u2019re not opposed to adam being involved with the chaotic, destructive person?\" said by Nikki\n\"Of course, I am. I don\u2019t approve of any of this dumb nonsense. Son, you just need to bow out of all of this for everyone\u2019s sake, especially for your own.\" said by Victor\n\"You know, you are conveniently forgetting that adam is not a child. He\u2019s a grown man. He\u2019s made his own choices. He\u2019s gonna have to live with the repercussions. He pushed sally away before sally or anyone else knew about the pregnancy. He has blown up his own family multiple times and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s some hapless victim that I need to coddle just because there\u2019s a baby on the way.\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2019m not talking to adam now, I\u2019m talking to you. How the hell long do you intend to carry on like this? What do you want to raise that child and marry her and raise him as your family? It\u2019s nuts. That choice should be adam\u2019s, not yours.\" said by Victor\n\"Keep drinking all this tea, we\u2019re gonna have to name our son, earl gray.\" said by Adam\n\"Or our daughter, chamomile.\" said by Sally\n\"Uh, I don\u2019t know about that.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay, you do better.\" said by Sally\n\"A girl\u2019s name? Mm\u2026 I\u2019d rather not.\" said by Adam\n\"How come?\" said by Sally\n\"I have ideas, of course, but look, we have time. We should name our\u2013 our little one together. Our child\u2019s name is the start of his or her own journey, their own legacy.\" said by Adam\n\"I like that thought. Of course, newman will be a part of that legacy.\" said by Sally\n\"The name definitely comes with its own history. But hopefully, the baby will find a new way to breathe life into it.\" said by Adam\n\"When did you get so wise?\" said by ", "answer": "Daniel"}

Um, amelia just left with hayes.\" said by Finn\n\"Oh, a nice day at the, uh, aquarium. Big day for our little guy.\" said by Steffy\n\"Yeah. It would\u2019ve been fun to take him myself, but it\u2019s looking like I\u2019m having an extra jam-packed day.\" said by Finn\n\"Why? What\u2019s happening?\" said by Steffy\n\"I\u2019m going to prison.\" said by Finn\n\"So, where\u2019s that beautiful smile? Not happy to see your old flame, mike?\" said by Mike\n\"No offense, but when they told me I had a visitor, I\u2013 I just didn\u2019t expect to see you again.\" said by Sheila\n\"Surprise. I still got a few connections in here.\" said by Mike\n\"Yeah. Well, I wish it had been my son or his father.\" said by Sheila\n\"Finn, or the guy who knocked you up.\" said by Mike\n\"His name is jack.\" said by Sheila\n\"Hm. So he was the mysterious visitor you had a while back. So, what are you up to with jack?\" said by Mike\n\"Nothing.\" said by Sheila\n\"No, no, no, no, no, no. Give me that.\" said by Eric\n\"What?\" said by Rj\n\"You really are like your father in so many ways, you know?\" said by Eric\n\"Well, they don\u2019t call me ridge jr. For nothing.\" said by Rj\n\"You really are a chip off the old block, aren\u2019t you?\" said by Eric\n\"Thank you, granddad.\" said by Rj\n\"So what is it? What did you wanna see me about?\" said by Eric\n\"I wanna talk to you about my mom. I just wanna make sure that she\u2019s really doing okay.\" said by Rj\n\"Don\u2019t worry. Hollis isn\u2019t working today.\" said by Taylor\n\"Oh, I\u2013 no, I\u2019m not worried.\" said by Brooke\n\"No?\" said by Taylor\n\"No.\" said by Brooke\n\"I didn\u2019t want you to think that I was gonna, you know, try to set you guys up again.\" said by Taylor\n\"No, I didn\u2019t\u2013 I didn\u2019t think that. Look, hollis is a great guy. He\u2019s sweet and he\u2019s handsome and he\u2019s very young, so I didn\u2019t think it was gonna work out.\" said by Brooke\n\"I wasn\u2019t expecting you guys to get married. I just wanted you to have some fun, you know.\" said by Taylor\n\"Okay.\" said by Brooke\n\"At least you, you know, you shared a nice kiss.\" said by Taylor\n\"Mm. Well, it\u2019s a good kiss.\" said by Brooke\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Taylor\n\"I just think if I\u2019m gonna be with somebody, it needs to be somebody that I know, somebody that I trust and somebody that I\u2019ve had a history with.\" said by Brooke\n\"Okay. When I heard the bus boys talking about the two beautiful women at table five, of course, I had to come see it for myself, right? But i was not prepared for the absolute bellezza that\u2019s before me.\" said by Deacon\n\"Bellezza?\" said by Brooke\n\"Bellezza.\" said by Taylor\n\"You like that? Yeah. It\u2019s italian.\" said by Deacon\n\"I mean, you and mom have always been close. You\u2019re one of her biggest supporters, right?\" said by Rj\n\"I adore your mother. I\u2019m always, uh, I always have been one of her biggest fans.\" said by Eric\n\"Granddad, tell me this, you know, my parents have been broken up for a few months now and I know, you know, my mom\u2019s out there trying to embrace the single life, but do you think that she\u2019s really happy with that?\" said by Rj\n\"You know, you two are become regulars. I like it.\" said by Deacon\n\"Well, the food is a ten outta ten. You\u2019re killing it.\" said by Taylor\n\"Aw, thank you. And listen, all kidding aside, it really is wonderful having two beautiful, accomplished women like you in my humble establishment. And I still gotta tell you, it is kinda weird seeing the two of you getting along.\" said by Deacon\n\"Well, it was, uh, it was a surprise. Becoming friends with taylor, a wonderful surprise. You know, I can\u2019t ever imagine us being rivals again.\" said by Brooke\n\"Don\u2019t tell me.\" said by Steffy\n\"Sheila\u2019s been reaching out to me.

You\u2013 you\u2019re hoping finn\u2019s daddy was gonna help spring you from the slammer?\" said by Mike\n\"He\u2019s an attorney, mike. A very influential criminal defense lawyer.\" said by Sheila\n\"He must have some dough.\" said by Mike\n\"Better. He\u2019s got clout. Power.\" said by Sheila\n\"Oh. So that\u2019s why you\u2019re putting on the lipstick, the perfume. You\u2019re hoping to work your magic on the poor sap. Did it work?\" said by Mike\n\"No.\" said by Sheila\n\"Well, I guess you\u2019re stuck in here with me, angel\" said by Mike\n\"Not for long. Hmmm! Twix with cookie and cookie dough?\" said by Sheila\n\"I can\u2019t tell if my mom is living a life of her own choosing or not.\" said by Rj\n\"What do you mean?\" said by Eric\n\"Like, her and dad were going pretty steady until a lie tore them apart. And it was a lie that my mom had nothing to do with. And I know that that\u2019s all been cleared up now, but they\u2019re still apart.\" said by Rj\n\"Well, your mom took a very strong stand with ridge.\" said by Eric\n\"It\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s nice that she and taylor are friends now and I\u2019ve heard all about the pact that they\u2019ve made and that\u2019s great, but I\u2019m left to wonder if my mom will ever truly be at peace with her life until she\u2019s reunited with my dad.\" said by Rj\n\"You think it\u2019s strange seeing brooke and me as friends? What about you two? I\u2019ve never known you two to get along so well.\" said by Taylor\n\"Brooke\u2019s my queen. And she always will be.\" said by Deacon\n\"You could have any woman in here.\" said by Brooke\n\"They just want me for my pasta sauce and you know it. Besides, you and I, we have a very special connection. The\u2013 the best kind of bond any two people could share.\" said by Deacon\n\"Our sweet hope.\" said by Brooke\n\"She is pretty terrific.\" said by Deacon\n\"Yeah. You know, she is the best of both of you. You have a lot to be proud of.\" said by Taylor\n\"Yes, we do.\" said by Brooke\n\"We did one pretty incredible thing, didn\u2019t we? We made an awesome human being.\" said by Deacon\n\"We certainly did.\" said by Brooke\n\"Cheer up. Life can be worse. At least you still got me.\" said by Mike\n\"I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s really no consolation for being chained up like an animal.\" said by Sheila\n\"Do the crime, you do the time. Think any of us convicts wanna be in here?\" said by Mike\n\"Yeah. But I don\u2019t deserve to be in prison, mike.\" said by Sheila\n\"That\u2019s what we all tell ourselves. Sheila, you gotta accept your fate. Sooner you do, the easier life will be, you know?\" said by Mike\n\"No. You know, no. I don\u2019T. And I won\u2019t accept that this is my future. I never will. Now I\u2013 I need to be free. I need to connect with my son and my grandson again.\" said by Sheila\n\"So sheila wants you to visit her because you were her attending doctor for one night.\" said by Steffy\n\"When she went into cardiac arrest.\" said by Finn\n\"So then why doesn\u2019t she want the entire hospital team or the prison doctor?\" said by Steffy\n\"Oh, she\u2019s requesting me personally.\" said by Finn\n\"So it\u2019s a blatant manipulation.\" said by Steffy\n\"Without a doubt. Listen, sheila is nothing if not transparent.\" said by Finn\n\"And you\u2019re gonna go?\" said by Steffy\n\"Well, I didn\u2019t want to. I thought I was done with her. We\u2019re never gonna have to see her again. But obviously, she\u2019s under the illusion that it\u2019s okay to contact me, have some type of relationship. Look, it\u2019s time I pay sheila a visit and make it absolutely clear to her that she has no place in our life. I used to pre-rinse dishes cause my old detergent\" said by Finn\n\"Yes. I\u2019ll have katie send that press packet out to you as, uh, soon as we hang up. Thanks for everything, klaus. Bye. Uh, sorry. Sorry about that.\" said by Eric\n\"Oh, no problem. You\u2019re a busy man.\" said by Rj\n\"Never too busy for my grandson. And as far as you asking about brooke, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m the person to ask about that. As she seems to be happy. Uh, but, uh, I think if you wanna talk to anybody about brooke, I think brooke is the person to ask.\" said by Eric\n\"You\u2019re right. I just\u2013 I thought it couldn\u2019t hurt to talk to you first.\" said by Rj\n\"I\u2019m glad you did. Very impressed with how, uh, sensitive you are to your mother\u2019s feelings. You\u2019re a good soul, my boy. You always have been. Oh, look at this. My two favorite grandkids in the room at the same time.\" said by Eric\n\"Aw! With our favorite granddad.\" said by Steffy\n\"That\u2019s me.\" said by Eric\n\"Of course.\" said by Steffy\n\"Well, your favorite granddad has to get to a meeting downtown. Sorry.\" said by Eric\n\"Oh, okay. So, I get my, uh, little brother all to myself?\" said by Steffy\n\"Yeah. Lucky you.\" said by Eric\n\"Yeah.\" said by Steffy\n\"Thank you for talking.\" said by Rj\n\"Yeah.\" said by Eric\n\"Appreciate it.\" said by Rj\n\"I\u2019ll see you, buddy.\" said by Eric\n\"I\u2019ll see you.\" said by Rj\n\"Bye. So, did I see a someone going to the clubs last night?\" said by Steffy\n\"Was my big sis spying on me?\" said by Rj\n\"I saw it on your stories. Looked like fun.\" said by Steffy\n\"It was.\" said by Rj\n\"So, uh, how was your meeting with granddad? Seemed like I just walked in on something.\" said by Steffy\n\"I don\u2019t know. I was just actually talking to him about my mom. I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m a little worried about her.\" said by Rj\n\"Oh, wait. Did hope tell you about her trip to san francisco?\" said by Brooke\n\"Yes. It sounds like they killed it, right?\" said by Deacon\n\"They scored a number of pre-orders.\" said by Brooke\n\"I mean, way to turn it around at the end, right? And\u2013 and\u2013 look, I know I\u2019m very protective of hope, but props to your son too.\" said by Deacon\n\"Thank you. Yes. He\u2019s just\u2013 he is so happy to be back designing with the team.\" said by Taylor\n\"I give them both a lot of credit. They worked really hard to overcome their past. And now, they have this really healthy working partnership.\" said by Brooke\n\"Well, you know, when\u2013 when hope puts her mind to something, there\u2019s really nothing she can\u2019t do.\" said by Deacon\n\"That\u2019s true. She\u2019s very determined. She\u2019s been like that ever since she was a little girl.\" said by Brooke\n\"She gets that from her mother.\" said by Deacon\n\"Come on. Don\u2019t sell yourself short. I mean, look around. Look at what you did. You had a vision and you\u2019d brought it to life. That\u2019s amazing. Ii giardino is a hit because of you.\" said by Brooke\n\"And there are no lies detected there. This place is packed for a reason.\" said by Taylor\n\"And I\u2019ll bet that deacon sharpe is going to be the next hot los angeles restaurateur.\" said by Brooke\n\"Did I\u2013 I heard hot. Was that\u2013 it\u2019s loud in here, but heard hot, yeah?\" said by Deacon\n\"Oh, yeah. I did say that.\" said by Brooke\n\"I like it.\" said by Deacon\n\"Guard! I\u2013 I have been sitting here forever. Is there a reason why you\u2019re not taking me back to my cushy cell?\" said by Sheila\n\"You have another visitor.\" said by Guard\n\"I do. Well, who?\" said by Sheila\n\"My son, you came. Kayaking is my thing.\" said by Sheila\n\"You got my letters. I\u2013 I wrote you over and over since\u2013 since they\u2019ve put me in here and\u2026 I started to lose faith that you would come and here you are.\" said by Sheila\n\"Well, I wasn\u2019t\u2013 I wasn\u2019t sure I even wanted to or if I even should.\" said by Finn\n\"There\u2019s so much that I have to say to you. I\u2019d be dead if you hadn\u2019t shown me the compassion that you did.\" said by Sheila\n\"I\u2019m a doctor. Sheila, I was just doing my job.\" said by Finn\n\"No. No, it was so much more than that. I\u2013 I flatlined. My heart stopped beating and you could have just left me there. Left me on that table to die.\" said by Sheila\n\"I wouldn\u2019t do that to my worst enemy.\" said by Finn\n\"You fought for me. No one has ever fought for me before. But you did. I\u2013 I don\u2019t know what\u2013 what you did or how, but you\u2013 you brought me back. And that has got to say something to the two of us, right? Mother and son. That the spiritual connection that we share. I mean, I gave you life and you gave me life. Thank you, son. I thank you for saving my life.\" said by Sheila\n\"You\u2019re concerned about brooke?\" said by Steffy\n\"It\u2019s not con\u2013 I\u2019m just\u2013 you know my mom. She\u2019s\u2013 she\u2019s always acting like everything\u2019s fine and that she\u2019s carefree, but\u2026 come on. She\u2019s been through a lot recently, right?\" said by Rj\n\"You\u2019re not wrong about that.\" said by Steffy\n\"I mean, you know the full story. You know everything.\" said by Rj\n\"Yeah. Yeah. I lived it.\" said by Steffy\n\"I know I was gone for all of the drama, but, you know, I don\u2019t wanna bash thomas. He\u2019s our brother.\" said by Rj\n\"Hey, rj, you have a right to your feelings. Thomas did hurt brooke, and you\u2019re protective of her. I love that about you.\" said by Steffy\n\"I told thomas that I\u2019m gonna give him the opportunity to prove that he\u2019s actually changed.\" said by Rj\n\"Well, that\u2019s good. No, that\u2019s really good. If it helps, I\u2013 I believe him.\" said by Steffy\n\"I know you do, steffy. I hope you\u2019re right.\" said by Rj\n\"He\u2019s\u2013 he\u2019s just in therapy now and he\u2019s working on himself and I really feel like he\u2019s a change man.\" said by Steffy\n\"Yeah. But that\u2013 that\u2019s the key. How he\u2019s acting now, that doesn\u2019t erase everything that he put my mom through. How he completely upended her entire life.\" said by Rj\n\"Because she\u2019s not with dad.\" said by Steffy\n\"Hey, I hope you guys saved some room for dessert because chef just pulled out a batch of our world-famous wedding cookies. I mean, wedding cookies.\" said by Deacon\n\"I can\u2019T. I\u2019m stuffed.\" said by Brooke\n\"It\u2019s good.\" said by Deacon\n\"God, it sounds\u2013\" said by Taylor\n\"Oh.\" said by Brooke\n\"What is it?\" said by Taylor\n\"Uh, work wants me to come back and help pick out some fabrics, so.\" said by Brooke\n\"Oh.\" said by Taylor\n\"I\u2019m sorry. I hate to cut this lunch short.\" said by Brooke\n\"No, it\u2019s okay. Work is work. I got this. Yes. I\u2019ll catch up with you later.\" said by Taylor\n\"Okay. Deacon, great to see you. And thanks again for such a wonderful meal. I gotta go.\" said by Brooke\n\"Well, I hate to see you go, but I\u2019d love to watch you leave. I know. Cheesy, right? I\u2019ve been waiting to try that one out. Seriously, come back soon. Okay? Please?\" said by Deacon\n\"Oh, I most certainly will.\" said by Brooke\n\"Okay.\" said by Deacon\n\"Okay. Okay. Deacon, you need to sit.\" said by Taylor\n\"I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m sorry that\u2013 I\u2013 I know that was boring for you to listen to us talking about our daughter and our history.\" said by Deacon\n\"No. No, it wasn\u2019t\u2013 it wasn\u2019t boring. It was sweet and fascinating. You know, that\u2013 that brooke and I have\u2013 have become very close, right?\" said by Taylor\n\"I\u2019ve seen that.\" said by Deacon\n\"Yeah. And I\u2013 I feel like\u2013 I\u2013 I feel like I know her finally, you know. For the first time ever, she respects you, admires you. She knows you.\" said by Taylor\n\"I mean, brooke\u2019s approval means a great deal to me. It really does. She doesn\u2019t judge me for being a screw-up back in the day.\" said by Deacon\n\"Well, of course not. There\u2019s a\u2013 there\u2019s a reason that the two of you got together all those years ago. Created hope together.\" said by Taylor\n\"Okay. I see the little hamster wheel going on. What are you getting at here?\" said by Deacon\n\"You know, that brooke and I made a\u2013 a pact.\" said by Taylor\n\"Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Put forrester in time out.\" said by Deacon\n\"Well, you know, it\u2019s more about, you know, looking out for each other and\u2013 and putting our friendship first.\" said by Taylor\n\"I think that\u2019s a great idea. I\u2019m just not getting what it has to do with me.\" said by Deacon\n\"Well, you\u2019ve made some\u2013 some huge strides in your life recently.\" said by Taylor\n\"I\u2019d like to think so.\" said by Deacon\n\"And brooke sees that. I know she does. She respects that. What if\u2013 what if the timing is\u2013 is\u2013 is just right. You know, especially now that\u2013 now that ridge is out of the picture?\" said by Taylor\n\"And?\" said by Deacon\n\"I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just thinking that this could be\u2013 this could be a opportunity, if you will, mr. Sharpe. You know, to have a shot at a life\u2026\" said by Taylor\n\"With brooke.\" said by Deacon\n\"With brooke.\" said by ", "answer": "Taylor"}
{"content": "\"Jill, there you are. How nice to see you.\" said by Victor\n\"Nice to see you, too.\" said by Jill\n\"Have a seat.\" said by Victor\n\"Thank you. Thank you. So you sounded like it was urgent on the phone, so I made the ranch my first stop, but I am late for the arbitration.\" said by Jill\n\"Oh, is that today?\" said by Victor\n\"Yes, victor, that is today and I\u2019ve got to get going and I\u2019m sure you\u2019d like to cut to the chase anyway, yes?\" said by Jill\n\"Well, then, I have to say, my timing is perfect.\" said by Victor\n\"Oh, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. It\u2019s like you read my mind.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, yeah?\" said by Nate\n\"I was hoping to go over some budgetary issues regarding newman media\u2019s next quarter.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay, well, I\u2019m happy to do that, but I was hoping we could discuss something else first.\" said by Nate\n\"Sounds like something\u2019s bothering you. Is there anything that I can do to help?\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah, look, um\u2026\" said by Nate\n\"It\u2019s fine. You can talk to me about it.\" said by Victoria\n\"Amanda.\" said by Devon\n\"Devon.\" said by Amanda\n\"I was surprised to hear that you agreed to come back and represent chancellor-winters \u2019cause i figured you\u2019d never want to see me again.\" said by Devon\n\"Well, when lily reached out to me, it made perfect sense to take this case, since I was instrumental in solidifying the merger in the first place. No one knows the ins and outs better than I do.\" said by Amanda\n\"Except for maybe me and lily.\" said by Devon\n\"I don\u2019t think now is a time or place for this.\" said by Lily\n\"No, no, it\u2019s okay. See, devon, you were more about the big picture. I was the one in the trenches dotting the \u201cI\u2019s\u201d and crossing the \u201ct\u2019S.\u201d But I simply see this as a natural extension of what I was already doing for jill and lily.\" said by Amanda\n\"Well, sure, but you know that sometimes a case is about more than just \u201cI\u2019s\u201d and \u201ct\u2019s,\u201d and it\u2019s about right and wrong.\" said by Devon\n\"I couldn\u2019t agree more.\" said by Amanda\n\"And about knowing the history and how much time I\u2019ve put into a company like hamilton-winters.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, I know. Do you not remember all of the long conversations we had about neil? The fact that you are here touting your history and loyalty is a joke\" said by Amanda\n\"Joke? So is this, like, revenge, then, for you?\" said by Devon\n\"Don\u2019t flatter yourself. I am here to win an arbitration. Having a front-row seat to watching you lose? That\u2019s just a perk. Not flossing well?\" said by Amanda\n\"Good morning.\" said by Christine\n\"Hey.\" said by Devon\n\"Everyone\u2019s exchanging pleasantries. That\u2019s nice to see. Devon, why don\u2019t we go inside?\" said by Christine\n\"Sure.\" said by Devon\n\"If you want any shot of walking away with your company, you can\u2019t let them get under your skin.\" said by Christine\n\"I \u2014 abby gave me the same advice. I know how to handle myself.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay, it\u2019s just, you seem a little rattled. Clearly, that\u2019s part of their strategy.\" said by Christine\n\"Maybe I\u2019m letting them think that they\u2019ve gotten to me.\" said by Devon\n\"Then you\u2019re doing a good job.\" said by Christine\n\"Are both sides ready to proceed?\" said by Arbitrator\n\"We are, ms. Shannon.\" said by Christine\n\"I don\u2019t think we are yet, as we\u2019re missing someone important. Is jill not meant to be here?\" said by Devon\n\"Why don\u2019t you let me speak on our behalf?\" said by Christine\n\"Ms. Winters is here on behalf of chancellor-winters. These legal proceedings are of the utmost importance to both ms. Winters and ms. Abbott, but they still have a company to run. The massive reach of their conglomerate necessitates that someone be available at nearly all times, but I assure you ms. Abbott will be joining us as soon as she\u2019s able to step away from her professional obligations.\" said by Amanda\n\"Very well. Then let\u2019s begin.\" said by Arbitrator\n\"Audra, hey. Nate around?\" said by Elena\n\"I think he\u2019s in a meeting.\" said by Audra\n\"[ Chuckles ] Let me guess, with victoria.\" said by Elena\n\"I believe so. Is everything okay?\" said by Audra\n\"Honestly, I don\u2019t even know.\" said by Elena\n\"Hey, maybe we could have a chat \u2014 away from this place. You up for a cup of coffee?\" said by Audra\n\"I think we need to address what happened the other night.\" said by Nate\n\"I thought that we were pretty clear with one another.\" said by Victoria\n\"Saying everything is fine is one thing, but is it really? Victoria, I don\u2019t want what happened to change our work dynamic, and I hope it doesn\u2019t alter the trust and comfort we have with one another.\" said by Nate\n\"Nate, don\u2019t give it any more thought. Really, it bears little to no weight on my end.\" said by Victoria\n\"I hope that\u2019s the case.\" said by Nate\n\"Look, if it would make you feel better, I will willingly admit that i overstepped, and I\u2019ll apologize. I apologize if I made you feel uncomfortable.\" said by Victoria\n\"No apologies necessary\" said by Nate\n\"Excuse me?\" said by Victoria\n\"You don\u2019t feel like you overstepped, now, do you?\" said by Nate\n\"No, I don\u2019T.\" said by Victoria\n\"Would you please stop being so cryptic? You have my attention.\" said by Jill\n\"Ooh, I\u2019m being cryptic now.\" said by Victor\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Jill\n\"Well, to be honest with you, I was surprised to learn that you\u2019re willing to go to war with devon over hamilton-winters.\" said by Victor\n\"Why would that surprise you.\" said by Jill\n\"And put lily against her brother?\" said by Victor\n\"Look, if there had been a more amicable option, I would have taken it. You of all people know there isn\u2019t always one. And when you\u2019re dealing with family, things can turn very ugly.\" said by Jill\n\"Only too true.\" said by Victor\n\"I take no pleasure in this battle with them. I can already see the emotional toll it\u2019s taking on lily and devon. But he accepted this merger with the full knowledge that I would retain the majority interest in chancellor-winters.\" said by Jill\n\"Right.\" said by Victor\n\"And as open as I am to listening to other people\u2019s opinion, in the end, the decision\u2019s mine, and I like the company the way it is.\" said by Jill\n\"You bet. Hi. I keep my home fresh with febreze fade defy plug.\" said by Victor\n\"Now, you must remember that I do understand that you have a certain vision for your company, as you should. You\u2019re the decision-maker.\" said by Victor\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Jill\n\"Let me ask you, how do you think katherine would feel? She realized you drew a very hard line with devon. I mean, devon is her grandson.\" said by Victor\n\"You\u2019re playing the katherine card, aren\u2019t you? Look, katherine had a lot of opinions, a lot of opinions about a lot of things, and most of them I did not agree with. But make no mistake, there are times when I miss her like crazy.\" said by Jill\n\"Yep.\" said by Victor\n\"What I don\u2019t miss is when she harped at me on how to run the company all the time. She and I can discuss that in the afterlife.\" said by Jill\n\"[ Chuckles ] Well, that\u2019s fair enough.\" said by Victor\n\"Just so you know, lily and I did try to come to an agreement with devon, okay? We offered him a really, really generous settlement, we offered to let him retain the hamilton-winters name, but he shot all that down. He\u2019s trying to make some sort of a point. I don\u2019t think it can be made in the time he has left. The trouble is, he\u2019s playing with a really weak hand. I mean, he\u2019s got the emotion and the sentiment, but he has no legal standing.\" said by Jill\n\"Yeah, you\u2019re correct about all of that, I think. However, I think your personal relationship with him is going to suffer some damage, and that would be a shame, you know? I mean, I asked you to come here knowing full well what the complications can be, but instead of a lawsuit and all those legal entanglements and hostilities, I\u2019m willing to offer you an alternative.\" said by Victor\n\"Hamilton-winters was founded on one core principle \u2014 family. Created by neil winters and his son devon, it was the culmination of familial love and devotion. Neil and his wife, drew, adopted devon when he was a teenager and brought them into their loving home and helped mold him into the successful man he is today. The company they started and built, grew was and continues to be a shining symbol of neil\u2019s legacy, a living monument of a man who wanted to become a father, a son who loved him, and the importance of family. Unfortunately, it\u2019s that sentiment that ms. Abbott and ms. Winters preyed upon when they convinced mr. Hamilton to merge hamilton-winters with chancellor industries. They used devon\u2019s deep regard for family bonds, the role that neil played in his and his sister\u2019s lives, and they coerced him into merging. And their argument? To create a family-run company that would make neil proud. Well, shortly after they convinced him to merge, ms. Abbott and ms. Winters insisted on opening up the company to an ipo. Okay, so that\u2019s taking a family-run company and letting in outside money and influence, taking the power out of their hands and putting it in to others. Immediately, devon objected to this and after multiple attempts to try and stop the ipo and amicably dissolve the merger, ms. Abbott and ms. Winters flexed their collective muscle and made it very clear they had no intention of bringing this dream that they sold to devon to fruition. You see, my client\u2019s not asking for money or stock or some sort of windfall. All he is asking for is to walk away with the company that he and his father created.\" said by Christine\n\"[ Sighs ] I hope you don\u2019t think I\u2019m jealous or insecure, because, trust me, I\u2019m not.\" said by Elena\n\"No, I don\u2019t think you are.\" said by Audra\n\"It\u2019s just, I\u2019m struggling with the amount of time nate is spending at work.\" said by Elena\n\"Well, a business like newman media, the demands are intense.\" said by Audra\n\"Which I completely understand.\" said by Elena\n\"But I think you have some legitimate questions about what\u2019s going on between nate and victoria.\" said by Audra\n\"You do?\" said by Elena\n\"It\u2019s probably not my place to say anything, but I\u2019m a little troubled by it.\" said by Audra\n\"I understand that nate and victoria have a tight working relationship. He\u2019s always been good in groups. That\u2019s part of what made him such a great surgeon, his ability to flow with all the people around him.\" said by Elena\n\"I don\u2019t want to cross any lines, elena, you know, or across any issues in your relationship with nate, but I think, um\u2026\" said by Audra\n\"Just say it.\" said by Elena\n\"Well, I think maybe nate and victoria\u2019s relationship is a little deep, but this could also just be me talking from my own biased point of view, because sometimes I feel a little out of the loop, but at times, you know, it just doesn\u2019t feel like a normal employer/employee dynamic.\" said by Audra\n\"In what way?\" said by Elena\n\"Well, they\u2019re together constantly, and I\u2019m sure that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s great for nate. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s learning a lot. But I\u2019m not sure they\u2019re always focused on the business at hand.\" said by Audra\n\"So what are you saying? There\u2019s something more going on?\" said by Elena\n\"I\u2019m sensing there\u2019s a lot more.\" said by Audra\n\"We\u2019re adults. Clearly, there is a chemistry between us. And would I have liked to have explored that chemistry and how explosive it might be? Yes. That\u2019s why I invited you to my hotel suite.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, yeah, you did.\" said by Nate\n\"You made your choice. I respect that.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay. I\u2019ll just assume you mean that.\" said by Nate\n\"We are smart, sophisticated, successful, and I\u2019m sure that we can control ourselves somehow. This attraction that we have for each other, I mean, it doesn\u2019t have to be acted on, right? No matter how powerful it is.\" said by Victoria\n\"It\u2019s difficult to hear. I know.\" said by Audra\n\"It is, but I appreciate your honesty. So, what, you think they\u2019re having an affair?\" said by Elena\n\"Well, I\u2019m not sure if anything physical has happened, but if not, I sense it\u2019s heading in that direction. I know you\u2019re probably skeptical. I\u2019m just telling you what I\u2019ve seen.\" said by Audra\n\"No, I don\u2019t doubt it. I just don\u2019t know what to do with this information. It doesn\u2019t make sense to me. Yes, nate and I struggled last year, but we also fought really hard to get through it, so I don\u2019t see why he would jeopardize us.\" said by Elena\n\"Some men are just like that.\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah, you know, when we first got together, we were both in relationships.\" said by Elena\n\"That\u2019s concerning.\" said by Audra\n\"[ Chuckles ] Yeah, I guess it is, but we are adults, and we made a choice. Now I guess I have a choice to make. What, do I just wait to catch them in the act? Do I trust nate when he says nothing\u2019s going on? Or, what, do I fight for him?\" said by Elena\n\"That\u2019s a decision you\u2019re going to have to make, but if you\u2019re asking for my opinion, look, I\u2019m not one to sit back and do nothing. I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re the same way.\" said by Audra\n\"Well, yeah, I\u2019m willing to fight for my relationship, but what makes this difficult is nate loves his job. He\u2019s so passionate about it. And victoria is a part of that. So she has him right where she wants him.\" said by Elena\n\"I may have an idea that could change up the status quo in a way that helps you.\" said by Audra\n\"Now, jill, I think i know why devon is so adamant about getting hamilton-winters back.\" said by Victor\n\"Yes, he misses his autonomy.\" said by Jill\n\"That\u2019s one of the reasons. The other reason is that he\u2019s worried about you wanting to take the company public.\" said by Victor\n\"Look, he can blame the ipo all he wants, but at best, that was the last straw for him.\" said by Jill\n\"Come on. You and I know what it means when you take a company public. That means you invite all kinds of strangers who are shareholders who interfere in your decision-making process. If that\u2019s the reason devon wants hamilton-winters back, I understand him, okay? I have a feeling you didn\u2019t think this through.\" said by Victor\n\"You said you had an alternative for me.\" said by Jill\n\"Right.\" said by Victor\n\"Is that it? That I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing?\" said by Jill\n\"Whoa, whoa, whoa. There\u2019s no reason to get defensive, okay? I think you will like what I have to propose.\" said by Victor\n\"There is no doubt that the work that mr. Hamilton put into building hamilton-winters along with his late father was admirable. The success of the company was a large part of why my clients proposed the merger in the first place. That being said, the reasons behind why mr. Hamilton decided to merge his company with chancellor industries are irrelevant. Whatever he claims was implied to him during private conversations are not germane to these proceedings. He entered into a contractual agreement period, and nowhere in that contract was there a promise that the newly merged company would remain private throughout its tenure. Effectively, he has come to arbitration to request that the courts assist him in a breach of contract. He wants to break the agreement that he entered into of his own volition. He wants to break his promise. He doesn\u2019t want to hold up his end of the bargain. He wants to throw it all away. But in doing so, he may potentially cause irreparable damage to the existing company. (Terrie) if you\u2019re a smoker.\" said by Amanda\n\"Whenever I start a new job, I always do my research, which means I\u2019ve done a deep dive into victoria\u2019s life. That woman has led a colorful life. No lack of romantic partners, to put it politely. Did you follow the drama with her last husband, um, ashland locke?\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah, he and nate used to be close.\" said by Elena\n\"Really? I\u2019m not sure I want that guy as a friend.\" said by Audra\n\"Nate found out pretty quickly that he was manipulating him. Yeah, that \u2014 that man was a piece of work.\" said by Elena\n\"Seems like victoria\u2019s married a few of those, including, uh, billy abbott \u2014 more than once. But, apparently, she had one former partner with a particularly interesting story. From what I\u2019ve learned, he may have been the love of her life. You know, they break up, reunite, and so on. And then one day he disappeared. He was gone for a really long time, and when he came back, he\u2019d changed. He was violent, dangerous.\" said by Audra\n\"Are you talking about J.T. Hellstrom?\" said by Elena\n\"The foundation of the contract between chancellor industries and hamilton-winters was based on fairness for all parties involved. Because jill abbott was given the largest stake in the merged company. Other terms were put in that were more favorable to mr. Hamilton. This was the compromise that both parties agreed to. In fact, I personally reviewed the documents for mr. Hamilton during various stages of the merger. I found the terms to be quite fair to him. Initially, I was not formal counsel for either party, so I could view things with an impartial eye, and nowhere did I see terms that were purely one-sided without a caveat to level the balance. Nothing has changed throughout the process except for mr. Hamilton\u2019s desires. Now that he wants to move in a new direction, he\u2019s regretting the deal that he signed, calling foul and pointing his fingers at my clients.\" said by Amanda\n\"We knew it was going to be like this. Just keep it together.\" said by Christine\n\"[ Chuckles ] Okay. Would anybody mind if we took a recess?\" said by Devon\n\"Uh, perhaps an early lunch?\" said by Christine\n\"Okay.\" said by Arbitrator\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Devon\n\"Well, look, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re offering me, but there is one thing I want you to know, that this ipo was not unvetted nor impulsive on my part, and I don\u2019t appreciate the insinuation.\" said by Jill\n\"I didn\u2019t mean to imply any wrongdoing on your part, okay? But I\u2019ve known you long enough and know you well enough to know that you share one characteristic of all moguls. You want to keep control.\" said by Victor\n\"I care about the bottom line and the health of my company.\" said by Jill\n\"Yes. Now, for your information, I have often thought \u2014 well, not often, but sometimes thought of taking newman public. But the notion of shareholders coming in, strangers coming in, interfering with my decision-making process? To hell with it. Okay? Unless, of course \u2014 unless I needed the money, and public offering brings an influx of capital. And I suspect that this is what it\u2019s all about, right?\" said by Victor\n\"Well, business is about making money.\" said by Jill\n\"There are more creative ways of raising funds, you know? Not an ipo. Keep all the shareholders, all the strangers away. That would allow you and devon to maintain control of the company.\" said by Victor\n\"I am aware of the other options, okay? Could you be more specific?\" said by Jill\n\"I\u2019m talking about private investor who would stay out of any decision-making process that you and devon would be involved in, and they would guarantee that in writing.\" said by Victor\n\"And I assume you have someone in mind.\" said by Jill\n\"You\u2019re exactly right. J.T. Hellstrom. Did you know him?\" said by Audra\n\"No, but I did hear a lot of stories about when he came to town. Everyone thought he was dead, but when he returned, something was off. Well, he ended up almost killing victoria, nikki, and sharon. And when all was said and done, they actually found out that J.T. Had a brain tumor. So that was the reason he was spiraling, and it actually wasn\u2019t his fault.\" said by Elena\n\"That\u2019s obviously awful for all involved, but maybe with your medical background, J.T. Might be an interesting case study.\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah, maybe in a purely medical sense, but I don\u2019t see what that has to do with nate and victoria.\" said by Elena\n\"Thanks. So, this case is going as well as expected. How are you feeling?\" said by ", "answer": "Amanda"}

Well, come on in.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Okay. Thanks.\" said by Chloe\n\"Hey, chloe.\" said by Billy\n\"Hi. Um, look who\u2019s here. I \u2014 I\u2019m so sorry. I didn\u2019t realize that you had company. Is this a bad time?\" said by Chloe\n\"I was so happy to get your invitation. We haven\u2019t been able to catch up in a while.\" said by Nikki\n\"I know. That\u2019s my fault. Um, things have been really hectic lately.\" said by Summer\n\"Hectic? What\u2019s bothering you, honey? Or do I already know?\" said by Nikki\n\"It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s dad and the situation with sally.\" said by Summer\n\"That makes two of us. I don\u2019t understand why he wants to get mixed up with a person whose life is so chaotic. I mean, what does he see in her? Everything else in the rest of his life is great. But leave it to sally spectra to bring on the trouble.\" said by Nikki\n\"Especially now, with a baby on the way.\" said by Summer\n\"Baby? What baby?\" said by Nikki\n\"So, I basically laid down the law with summer. I told her she needs to have an open mind about our relationship.\" said by Nick\n\"I hate to cause friction between you and your daughter.\" said by Sally\n\"Ah, don\u2019t worry about it. She and I are crazy close. We\u2019re strong enough to get through it.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, I don\u2019t doubt that. Must be nice to be so strong.\" said by Sally\n\"It is a heavy burden at times.\" said by Nick\n\"Mm-hmm, of course it is.\" said by Sally\n\"What do you mean?\" said by Nick\n\"Well, I was just waiting in limbo for so long to, you know, tell adam about the baby. And now that I have, I need to focus on other things in my life, like my career. You know, chloe and I are prepping for a follow-up meeting with jill. Of course, we\u2019re just \u2014 you know, it\u2019s more about jill\u2019s schedule right now, unless victor decides to tank us again.\" said by Sally\n\"Don\u2019t you worry about that. I\u2019m planning on using my legendary strength to make sure he stays the hell out of that.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, thank you.\" said by Sally\n\"It would be nice to lock in a contract with chancellor-winters, though.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, yeah. They would be a huge client. I mean, they have tons of offices and restaurants and hotels, all kinds of properties that could use interior design. And I really actually want to tour some of them so I could start to have an idea about, like, the function, the colors, the textures. That way, chloe and I have specific recommendations we can give to jill and impress her all over again.\" said by Sally\n\"That\u2019s excellent thinking. Where are all these properties? And would you like to use the newman jet to get to them?\" said by Nick\n\"[ Laughs ] Yeah, I\u2019m sure that would go over really big with victoria.\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2019m the coo. I can reserve the jet whenever the hell I want.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, that is very generous of you. I really appreciate the gesture. But no thank you. We are gonna fly commercial.\" said by Sally\n\"Are you sure?\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah. I mean, our research has absolutely nothing to do with newman, so we\u2019re not entitled to the newman perks, and that includes riding on a fancy corporate jet, especially from you. I mean, our\u2026 we\u2019re not in that stage of our relationship yet.\" said by Sally\n\"Fair enough.\" said by Nick\n\"Uh, hope I\u2019m not interrupting.\" said by Adam\n\"Uh, adam, we were actually having a private conversation.\" said by Sally\n\"Ah, okay. Well, this will just take a few minutes of your time. Um, I have not been able to stop thinking about the baby, and i have a proposition for you, one that I hope you will seriously consider.\" said by Adam\n\"[ Chuckles ] I\u2019m gonna get out of here.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, it was sweet of you to stop by.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, please do not leave on my account.\" said by Chloe\n\"No, no, it\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t want to overstay my welcome.\" said by Billy\n\"You could never overstay your welcome. But since chloe\u2019s here\u2026\" said by Chelsea\n\"I got errands to do. I\u2019m gonna pop downstairs, grab a coffee, and then go do what I need to do.\" said by Billy\n\"Oh.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Good to see you.\" said by Billy\n\"You too.\" said by Chloe\n\"You\u2019re amazing. I\u2019ll, uh \u2014 I\u2019ll be in touch.\" said by Billy\n\"Okay.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Okay.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, what exactly are you suggesting?\" said by Sally\n\"Um, look, I just want to make things as easy as I can for you.\" said by Adam\n\"In what sense?\" said by Sally\n\"Look [Sighs] It\u2019s important that you and our child are settled and you\u2019re comfortable from the very beginning, so\u2026 I would like to buy you a house.\" said by Adam\n\"A house?\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah. I mean, you weren\u2019t planning on staying in this hotel forever, were you?\" said by Adam\n\"Well, no. I mean, obviously, I would like more room. I just haven\u2019t gotten around to, you know, beginning the process, calling realtors, looking at properties.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, yeah, I mean, i understand it\u2019s the beginning stages. Feels like you have all the time in the world, but, you know, time is gonna start flying by before you know it. I mean, doesn\u2019t it make sense to find a house and move in and get ready before the baby arrives? I mean, you could use your design skills to put your own stamp on it.\" said by Adam\n\"[ Sighs ] Adam \u2014\" said by Sally\n\"Please let me do this for you. I know your folks moved around a lot when you were a kid and they never gave you a place to call home. But you and our child \u2014 you can have a nursery to read bedtime stories. You can have a yard to play in, a wall with pictures and happy memories. You know, everything that you dreamed of as a child. I want to help make that happen.\" said by Adam\n\"Sally is pregnant? Oh, my god. I had no idea.\" said by Nikki\n\"Yes, sally is having a baby, but it\u2019s not dad\u2019S. It\u2019s adam\u2019S.\" said by Summer\n\"[ Gasps ] Hallelujah! No. No, no, this is still a mess.\" said by Nikki\n\"It\u2019s what she does best.\" said by Summer\n\"I have seen nicholas almost every day at the office, and he hasn\u2019t said anything. And I\u2019ll bet victor doesn\u2019t know. He would have said something.\" said by Nikki\n\"Um, here\u2019s the thing, grandma. I know that it\u2019s a lot to ask, but could you please not tell grandpa about this? At least, until dad or adam gets a chance to tell him.\" said by Summer\n\"That he\u2019s having another grandchild? I-I don\u2019t know. I mean, for me to know and not tell him\u2026\" said by Nikki\n\"I know. I know. I know. It was really unfair for me to dump all of this on you, but i just \u2014 I needed to talk to somebody who would be just as horrified as I am, but the thing is, if grandpa confronts dad about this before he\u2019s ready, it\u2019s gonna cause this huge conflict. And nobody wants that, right?\" said by Summer\n\"Wow. As rationalizations go, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s a bit of a stretch, summer. But\u2026alright. For the sake of the baby. It\u2019s not healthy to have stress during pregnancy.\" said by Nikki\n\"Thank you.\" said by Summer\n\"I wish that nicholas would tell victor already, but he\u2019s probably too embarrassed and upset, doesn\u2019t want to talk about it.\" said by Nikki\n\"This is the thing, grandma. He\u2019s not wallowing in self-pity. Dad is actually still seeing sally.\" said by Summer\n\"They\u2019re not breaking up?\" said by Nikki\n\"[ Exhales sharply ] I guess this thing with adam was a one-time occasion and sally doesn\u2019t have any desire to get back together with him.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, no, sure. Why should she? She can have nicholas.\" said by Nikki\n\"I actually think that I\u2019m the most upset about all of this. And I kind of blew up at sally. I told her how selfish I thought she was being and how she\u2019s using my dad. And then dad came over and told me how wrong I was and how this hasn\u2019t changed his feelings for sally at all.\" said by Summer\n\"Unbelievable. He is too noble for his own good.\" said by Nikki\n\"I know, right? It\u2019s like he can\u2019t see what\u2019s going on, and it kills me.\" said by Summer\n\"Trust me. I know exactly how you feel.\" said by Nikki\n\"I wish that this could all work out for dad. I really do but when I play it out in my head, there\u2019s really only one word that could sum it up.\" said by Summer\n\"\u201cDisaster.\u201d I mean, how can he think that they can stay together when she is having his brother\u2019s child? And I can only imagine what adam thinks about all of this.\" said by Nikki\n\"Maybe there is.\" said by Summer\n\"I would dearly love to get nicholas out of this, but i worry that any kind of maneuver would backfire. I mean, in the past, whenever i told him I had issues with the woman in his life, he just digs in his heels. I mean, if he feels so strongly about sally, in spite of this situation, I think it\u2019s gonna be very hard to change his mind.\" said by Nikki\n\"I agree. But what if something in their relationship were to drastically change and he realized that it would be better to end it sooner rather than later?\" said by Summer\n\"Change how?\" said by Nikki\n\"Like if sally fell back in love with adam.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay. And then what?\" said by Nikki\n\"Sally was heartbroken when adam dumped her. I mean, that\u2019s the reason why she glommed on to dad in the first place. And we all know that adam\u2019s not over her. So, maybe deep down, she still cares for him, too.\" said by Summer\n\"I wouldn\u2019t doubt that.\" said by Nikki\n\"So, if I could pull this off, it would be sort of a service to two people who belong together.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, my god, yes. I mean, that would be ideal. But there are two obstacles that you need to consider.\" said by Nikki\n\"What are they?\" said by Summer\n\"Whatever lingering feelings sally may have for adam, she has decided to keep him at arm\u2019s length. So that tells me that her walls are up pretty high.\" said by Nikki\n\"Walls can be climbed. You just have to have the right tools and motivation. What\u2019s the other one?\" said by Summer\n\"No one is more charming than your father when he is infatuated with someone. So it\u2019s unlikely that adam would be able to win her heart without a lot of help and a whole lot of luck.\" said by Nikki\n\"Adam, your offer is very generous, but\u2026 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m gonna have to say no.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, I\u2019m sorry to hear that.\" said by Adam\n\"This is what she was worried about, you overstepping.\" said by Nick\n\"Uh, no, I was just trying to provide for my child and his or her mother. It\u2019s what any decent person would do.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay, you know what? You actually are both just thinking a little bit too big today, too grandiose, and worse yet, you\u2019re actually thinking for me.\" said by Sally\n\"No, no, no, sally, that\u2019s not \u2014\" said by Nick\n\"No, hey, look, I don\u2019t hold it against you \u2014 really. I know you\u2019re both trying to be supportive, and you\u2019re actually being very sweet in your own way, but I would like to make my own decisions about how I travel and where I live and, you know, everything else in my life. In fact, I actually insist on it, so\u2026 anyway, if you guys will excuse me, I-I really have work to do.\" said by Sally\n\"Lemon?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Um, no.\" said by Chloe\n\"Sugar?\" said by Chelsea\n\"I\u2019m good. Though I do appreciate you being such a gracious host when i clearly interrupted something when I showed up.\" said by Chloe\n\"What are you talking about?\" said by Chelsea\n\"The second I walked in, I picked up on a very strong vibe.\" said by Chloe\n\"A vibe?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Yeah. Between you and billy. You were all flushed. You\u2019ve never been a very big blusher.\" said by Chloe\n\"What? No, that\u2019s \u2014 no. Um, billy and I were excited because we were talking about the new video game idea.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Oh, yeah. That\u2019s what got you all flustered.\" said by Chloe\n\"Chloe! It\u2019s true.\" said by Chelsea\n\"You can be honest with me. There\u2019s no judgment. Is there something going on with you and billy?\" said by Chloe\n\"[ Sighs ] I honestly don\u2019t know how to define it. And I don\u2019t know if I want to. There are these feelings that have been growing between us. Strong feelings.\" said by Chelsea\n\"You know what? Make it a double. Gonna live life dangerously.\" said by Billy\n\"I\u2019ve heard that about you.\" said by Sharon\n\"[ Chuckles ] My secret\u2019s out.\" said by Billy\n\"I noticed that you came from the direction of chelsea\u2019s place. Is she well?\" said by Sharon\n\"She is. She\u2019s very well, actually. She\u2019s working on a new project.\" said by Billy\n\"Oh, really?\" said by Sharon\n\"Have you heard of, uh, what daniel romalotti\u2019s putting together?\" said by Billy\n\"The gaming platform. Yeah, that sounds really intriguing.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, it is. She, uh \u2014 she pitched him an idea, and he\u2019s looking into developing it.\" said by Billy\n\"Oh, wow! Well, that sounds wonderful. I\u2019m sure that\u2019ll give her a boost.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, definitely. Among other things.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah? Like what? The two of you? Having diabetes can raise a lot of questions.\" said by Sharon\n\"Thank you for lunch.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, you are so welcome.\" said by Nikki\n\"Hello.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, sally. What a coincidence. Summer was just telling me your big news.\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh, but don\u2019t worry. My grandma will keep it in the circle of trust.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, yes. For the baby\u2019s sake. Frankly, uh, it was not news that I expected.\" said by Nikki\n\"Yeah, I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019T. I was caught off guard myself.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, I have so many things to say, but I would have no idea where to begin.\" said by Nikki\n\"It\u2019s okay. I have a feeling I know what you\u2019re thinking.\" said by Sally\n\"Good. That saves us both some time. I have to be leaving. Summer, darling, I will see you later.\" said by Nikki\n\"Bye, grandma. Thank you again for meeting me.\" said by Summer\n\"Of course.\" said by Nikki\n\"[ Sighs heavily ]\" said by Sally\n\"Are you, um, on your own?\" said by Summer\n\"Uh, no. I\u2019m meeting chloe in a little bit, but I just thought I\u2019d get some work done.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, hey, um, why don\u2019t I stay and you join me?\" said by Summer\n\"[ Sighs ] Why? So you can go on more about what a tramp and a chaotic mess I am?\" said by Sally\n\"So I can apologize.\" said by Summer\n\"You know, just to be clear, I\u2019m not ignoring the advice you gave me earlier about, you know, what could be potentially developing between chelsea and me. I\u2019m on board. Slow and steady, proceed with caution, all of that. And she\u2019s, you know, talking to her therapist throughout this whole time, so she\u2019s on top of it.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, I\u2019m relieved to hear that because chelsea needs to navigate this very carefully for herself and for your sake, for connor and johnny and katie.\" said by Sharon\n\"I agree. We\u2019re not an island. And if \u2014 if we take this relationship to the next level, it\u2019s gonna affect the people we love. And most importantly, we\u2019ve got to make sure that the kids are okay with it.\" said by Billy\n\"You know, I didn\u2019t mean to sound negative.\" said by Sharon\n\"No, no, no, no. I appreciate everything you do for us \u2014 really. And I respect your professionalism. I know you only want what\u2019s best for us.\" said by Billy\n\"I really do. And my opinion doesn\u2019t just come from my training. I\u2019ve been in a similar situation myself. After I had my breakdown, I clung to adam. And what we experienced, the things that he did for me \u2014 it created a very intense bond between us. That didn\u2019t mean that we were supposed to be together. But for a while there, the emotional lines were very blurred for me and it was hard to let go of him, even though i knew that was what was best for both of us. So, the last thing that I would want to see happen is for chelsea or you to go through that kind of pain.\" said by Sharon\n\"Billy saved your life. And not like \u201cthanks for the help, you\u2019re a life-saver\u201d kind of way. I mean \u2014 I mean he actually saved your life. So I can understand why the two of you have developed some feelings for each other.\" said by Chloe\n\"Yeah. And he\u2019s been there for me every single day since. An incredible source of comfort. But this isn\u2019t just gratitude. He \u2014 he makes me hopeful. He makes me excited about the future. And I feel like I can be myself around him, knowing that whatever I say, he understands.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Look, I\u2019m really glad that he can be that person for you. I am, but\u2026you know, you and billy were together years ago.\" said by Chloe\n\"Mm. We were engaged.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Yeah, I know, um\u2026 but you were both coming off of tragedies. You know, you \u2014 you found each other. You found strength in each other. And things ended badly. And if I could be frank, I think it\u2019s because you didn\u2019t love billy with your entire heart and soul.\" said by Chloe\n\"You\u2019re right. Back then, I thought adam was the love of my life, and i thought I had lost him forever. I wasn\u2019t over him, not by a long shot.\" said by Chelsea\n\"So, as incredible as billy has been with you, I have to ask, as your friend \u2014 is it really what you think it is? (Vo) oh look! Glorious progresso soup.\" said by Chloe\n\"Look, sally, the last time I saw you, I was really upset and I crossed some lines. What I said to you was cruel and wrong and just plain mean. And I\u2019m sorry.\" said by Summer\n\"Thank you.\" said by Sally\n\"Now that I\u2019ve had time to cool down, I\u2019ve realized that I\u2019ve got to just accept that you\u2019re an important part of my dad\u2019s life. And if that\u2019s the case, then i need to find a way for you and i to get along. And, look, I\u2019m not saying that it\u2019s gonna be easy or that we\u2019re gonna be besties anytime soon, but I have no interest in an ongoing battle that\u2019s just gonna hurt all of us.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah. I mean, I would love to find a way to, you know, make things work. And since you are extending yourself, I will meet you halfway.\" said by Sally\n\"I appreciate that.\" said by Summer\n\"Look, I-I know that this must have been really jarring for you. And I know that you just want to protect your father.\" said by ", "answer": "Sally"}

I\u2019m not even gonna ask because I\u2019m sure you\u2019re sick of it.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah, it doesn\u2019t help. What am I supposed to say? My mother\u2019s being charged with killing my mother-in-law.

Can you tell me what the hell is going on with marchetti\u2019s operation budget from last quarter?\" said by Billy\n\"Hi, welcome.\" said by Abby\n\"Hello. Wow, greeted at the door. Don\u2019t we feel special?\" said by Mariah\n\"Sorry. We were a little late. Somebody was feeling fussy.\" said by Tessa\n\"Mm, guilty as charged.

But we have the best reason in the world for staying in.\" said by Mariah\n\"Oh, let me see her. Let me see her. Oh, my gosh. Look at this little sleeping beauty. Oh, she\u2019s a little angel.\" said by Abby\n\"Aria was such a party animal before we left, but we put her in the stroller and it put her right out.

Shall we?\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah.\" said by Tessa\n\"All right, let\u2019s go.\" said by Mariah\n\"Perfect.\" said by Abby\n\"Surprise!\" said by All\n\"Oh, my gosh.\" said by Tessa\n\"Welcome to your baby shower.\" said by Abby\n\"Oh, my gosh.\" said by Tessa\n\"This is incredible.\" said by Mariah\n\"How are you?\" said by Jack\n\"I\u2019m okay.\" said by Diane\n\"How can you possibly be okay? Wrongly locked up, the press having a field day with wild speculations. The other inmates giving you a hard time?\" said by Jack\n\"No, jack. It\u2019s all right. I, um, I can take care of myself. You don\u2019t need to worry about me.\" said by Diane\n\"Whatever you need, I will use every connection I have to make this easier for you.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack.\" said by Diane\n\"We\u2019ll get you more outdoor time. We can get you better accommodation.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, please. Please just stop. There\u2019s only one thing you can do for me.\" said by Diane\n\"Okay, name it.\" said by Jack\n\"Don\u2019t come back.\" said by Diane\n\"I don\u2019t think diane acted alone. She may have been the one that poisoned phyllis, but I think stark was in on the murder with her.\" said by Chance\n\"What has you so convinced?\" said by Christine\n\"Well, think about it. We don\u2019t have a trace on this guy. He transferred all of the money that he got from phyllis out of our accounts, checked out of the grand phoenix, vanished into thin air. Does that sound like an innocent guy to you?\" said by Chance\n\"No, it doesn\u2019T.\" said by Christine\n\"If he\u2019s trying this hard to cover his tracks, I guarantee you he\u2019s up to something.\" said by Chance\n\"I mean, it looks suspicious and I\u2019m willing to consider the fact that diane and stark were co-conspirators, but I need more than your gut feeling to pursue charges against this guy.\" said by Christine\n\"Our only link to stark is diane. So, let\u2019s put some pressure on her, you know, see what she knows. Give her a big enough incentive to flip, get her talking.\" said by Chance\n\"That would require a deal for leniency. And given the nature of the crime, it\u2019s a non-starter.\" said by Christine\n\"But it might be worth it if we can get stark.\" said by Chance\n\"Diane has been locked up since before stark disappeared. So phone calls, visits, letters, they were all monitored. There\u2019s no way they\u2019ve been in contact.\" said by Christine\n\"What if they plan to split the inheritance? He makes an escape with the funds, they meet up later. If that\u2019s the case, diane would know exactly where that guy\u2019s hiding.\" said by Chance\n\"Did somebody mention my client\u2019s name? Okay everyone, our mission is complete balanced nutrition.\" said by Michael\n\"Marchetti\u2019s operating expenses rose because the employee headcount increased when we acquired those textile factories from newman. If you had looked carefully, you would have noticed\u2013\" said by Kyle\n\"That wasn\u2019t at all condescending, was it?\" said by Billy\n\"If you had looked carefully, you would have noticed that those costs are more than offset by the contractor fees. Not to mention all the other added benefits of bringing manufacturing in-house.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah, see the problem with that is that historically deals between jabot and newman haven\u2019t worked out very well for jabot.\" said by Billy\n\"I made that deal with victor with my eyes wide open and it led to adam\u2019s departure. Paved the way for your return. So, how about a thank you, instead of criticizing?\" said by Kyle\n\"No, I\u2019m not criticizing, kyle. My issue is with victor. I wouldn\u2019t put it past the guy to force a bunch of troubled properties on jabot.\" said by Billy\n\"Targeting those factories was my idea, not victor\u2019S. I knew exactly what I was doing. The numbers are high right now, as expected, but everything is going according to plan.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah, I still think we need to pay attention\u2013\" said by Billy\n\"Billy, billy! I don\u2019t need your opinion. I have complete autonomy over marchetti, so whatever you think about my business decisions doesn\u2019t really matter.\" said by Kyle\n\"Just trying to get the lay of land before I actually dig in.\" said by Billy\n\"The land is just fine.\" said by Kyle\n\"Good to know. Since you are in the office today, I do have an idea on how to bring jabot and marchetti together. If you\u2019re willing to listen.\" said by Billy\n\"Thank you. Guys, this is awesome. You\u2019re\u2013 you\u2019re crazy. You\u2019re crazy.\" said by Mariah\n\"You tricked us.\" said by Tessa\n\"Well, this was all sharon\u2019s idea.

I just, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m so grateful and I\u2019m floored given everything that\u2019s going on that\u2013 that you guys wanted to come together for us.\" said by Mariah\n\"Well, we could all use a little joy right now. A reminder of how wonderful life can be and there is nothing happier than a brand-new baby.\" said by Sharon\n\"That is for sure. Well, we have all sorts of ways to welcome baby aria to genoa city. We have games, we have crafts, we have food. But first, a toast. To the new mamas, from mariah\u2019s mama. Cheers.\" said by Abby\n\"Cheers. Cheers.\" said by All\n\"So, what did I miss?\" said by Michael\n\"Well, we were just wondering how diane was getting along in prison.\" said by Chase\n\"Ah. Sure you are.\" said by Michael\n\"Has she been in contact with anyone on the outside?\" said by Chase\n\"Well, just come out and ask your questions, detective. Don\u2019t beat around the bush. Not one for subtlety, is he?\" said by Michael\n\"Answer the question, michael, has she?\" said by Chase\n\"I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about and even if I did, I would never violate attorney-client privilege. However, if this was a preview of something you\u2019ll be presenting at my client\u2019s trial, I appreciate the heads up. Not that there should even be a trial.\" said by Michael\n\"Oh, wow. Finally, something we agree on. Diane could save everyone so much trouble if she just pled guilty. Is that something you and your client are ready to consider?\" said by Christine\n\"What do you mean don\u2019t come back? There is no way I am going to abandon you.\" said by Jack\n\"You wouldn\u2019t be abandoning me. You would be honoring my request.\" said by Diane\n\"I am not gonna let you do this, diane. I\u2019m not gonna let you push away the people that love you.\" said by Jack\n\"I could be here a very long time.\" said by Diane\n\"No, no, you are innocent and kyle and I are going to help michael prove it.\" said by Jack\n\"There\u2019s so much evidence against me.\" said by Diane\n\"It is manufactured evidence, planted by a criminal. We\u2019re gonna prove that stark framed you and murdered phyllis himself. Look, it may take some time, but sooner or later\u2013\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, stop it. I\u2019m not getting out of here any time soon and you know it. I\u2019ve been denied bail.\" said by Diane\n\"I know.\" said by Jack\n\"And a murder trial takes a really long time to prepare and my court date could be in ages.\" said by Diane\n\"However long it takes, I will be by your side. So will kyle. You can\u2019t do this alone. Let us support you.\" said by Jack\n\"I love you for wanting to come to my rescue, but the only way I\u2019m going to be able to survive this is if I just keep my head down and just forget about life outside this\u2013\" said by Diane\n\"No, no. Absolutely not.\" said by Jack\n\"You know why? Because seeing your face and your eyes and hearing your voice, it\u2013 it doesn\u2019t bring me comfort. It\u2019s just a reminder of everything I\u2019ve lost.\" said by Diane\n\"You have not lost me. I love you.\" said by Jack\n\"And I love you, but we need to do this my way.\" said by Diane\n\"Darling, listen to me\u2013\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, please. If you love me, then you have to stay away. Having diabetes can raise a lot of questions.\" said by Diane\n\"My client is not pleading guilty to a murder she didn\u2019t commit.\" said by Michael\n\"As her attorney, you\u2019re duty-bound to advise her that it\u2019s highly unlikely she\u2019ll beat the charges given the weight of the evidence against her.\" said by Christine\n\"You are forgetting two critical factors. Diane has a brilliant attorney and she\u2019s innocent.\" said by Michael\n\"Oh, well, of course, she is. But on the off chance that she\u2019s not, if she would just cooperate with law enforcement\u2013\" said by Christine\n\"We want stark.\" said by Chance\n\"I would consider recommending the judge impose a shorter sentence.\" said by Christine\n\"Not interested.\" said by Michael\n\"Really? Even if that means the difference between diane having the freedom to see her grandchild again or spending the rest of her life in prison?\" said by Christine\n\"Hey, it\u2019s too soon to make any big decisions. It\u2019s been a tough day. You know, being denied bail is a big deal and you need time to process that.\" said by Jack\n\"I\u2013 I think I\u2019m dealing with this a little more realistically than you are.\" said by Diane\n\"By deciding to cut everyone out of your life? No, I mean that may sound fine today but tomorrow\u2013\" said by Jack\n\"Tomorrow, what? What, jack? The sun\u2019s going to come out and\u2013 and somehow things will be different than they are right now.\" said by Diane\n\"I am asking you to reconsider.\" said by Jack\n\"Listen to me. When I went on the run after faking my death, the only way I could survive was by shutting down. I\u2013 I had to clear my mind of any thoughts of my old life. No memories because if I allowed myself to, you know, to remember or to feel anything, it\u2013 it destroyed me.\" said by Diane\n\"This is a completely different situation.\" said by Jack\n\"No, it isn\u2019T. Just like then, I am facing the very real possibility of spending the rest of my life away from everyone and everything that I care about. I know how this works. I know what I have to do.\" said by Diane\n\"Cut everyone out of your life? Try to forget everyone?\" said by Jack\n\"No, I\u2019m not doing this because you and kyle and harrison aren\u2019t the most important things in the world to me. I\u2019m doing this because I love you too much to\u2013 to put you through what\u2019s ahead. I mean, look, this is a terrible place. I don\u2019t want you here. I don\u2019t want kyle here and I certainly don\u2019t want harrison here. What are we gonna do, huh? We\u2019re just gonna sit around and try to act like everything\u2019s normal when it\u2019s not? I\u2019m not going to put you through that. No, this is what I need to do to survive.\" said by Diane\n\"What\u2019s your idea?\" said by Kyle\n\"We integrate jabot\u2019s and marchetti\u2019s ad campaign.\" said by Billy\n\"No.\" said by Kyle\n\"You\u2019re not even gonna hear me out? We brand jabot and marchetti as a single fashion and beauty entity. Tessa has been a knockout as a spokesmodel for marchetti. She can work for both brands.\" said by Billy\n\"No stands. Not gonna happen.\" said by Kyle\n\"You\u2019re not even gonna think about it?\" said by Billy\n\"Don\u2019t have to. Jabot offers a wide range of lines at various price points, each designed to appeal to a different demographic. The idea is that there is something different for everybody. In contrast, marchetti is exclusively a luxury brand. Two very different entities.\" said by Kyle\n\"See, I don\u2019t see a problem in that.\" said by Billy\n\"Okay. Customers pay a premium for our quality, our exclusivity. Linking jabot and marchetti could dilute the brand\u2019s reputation.\" said by Kyle\n\"You\u2019re missing the genius part. We tailor the ad campaigns to emphasize the connection between jabot and marchetti\u2019s top-end products. It\u2019s aspirational. It brings more customers to marchetti and it works better for both brands. What\u2019s not to love about that?\" said by Billy\n\"Where to begin, billy?\" said by Kyle\n\"Wasn\u2019t corporate synergy the whole reason jabot acquired a fashion brand in the first place? This idea does exactly that.\" said by Billy\n\"Wow, you\u2019ve really been here a couple of hours and you think you have the expertise to upend our entire advertising strategy.\" said by Kyle\n\"It means so much to me that aria is my first grandchild. Years ago, I was the young, biological mom who made the difficult choice of adoption. And here we are, full circle. And I\u2019m just profoundly moved that mariah and tessa connected with aria\u2019s birth mother, delphine, and they created a bond that honors their journey together. There\u2019s so many different ways to be a family and aria is learning that already.\" said by Sharon\n\"Free babysitting.\" said by Noah\n\"We\u2019re gonna take you up on that.\" said by Mariah\n\"I know that your path to motherhood wasn\u2019t easy. I saw your joy and your determination and your discontentment, but I am so thrilled to see how happy you are now that your dreams of having a family have now come true with this sweet little baby girl. And I\u2019m so looking forward to late nights, diaper changes, first steps and then, in the blink of an eye, aria will be all grown up. I\u2019m really honored to have the three of you in my life. To family.\" said by Sharon\n\"To family.\" said by All\n\"To family. My celebrity colorist?\" said by Mariah\n\"As someone who hasn\u2019t been a mom much longer than the two of you, I have learned a few things. Like every single day, in 100 different ways, your child is gonna remind you of what\u2019s important. And there will be good days and not-so-good days and days where you feel overwhelmed, but it\u2019s okay because it\u2019s all part of being a mom. And you will see the world in a completely different way and the joy that it will bring you will be like nothing you\u2019ve ever felt before.\" said by Abby\n\"We are pretty blissed out.\" said by Tessa\n\"I mean, we could use a little bit of sleep, but it\u2019s no biggie.\" said by Mariah\n\"Okay, my turn. Allie wishes she could be here but she got stuck in the lab, so this is from us.\" said by Noah\n\"Thank you. Let\u2019s see. Aw.\" said by Tessa\n\"Oh, noah, this is awesome. Free babysitting and a library. You guys are our favorite couple.\" said by Mariah\n\"Oh, I cannot wait to read these to her.\" said by Tessa\n\"So, it\u2019s mostly classics, but some of my favorites. I always remember my mom reading those books to me when I was a kid. I loved those moments. It kind of felt like we were on some kind of adventure, you know. Now that I think about it, I mean, our life kind of was an adventure. I had my wonderful mom there to guide me every step of the way.\" said by Noah\n\"I didn\u2019t tell him to say that.\" said by Sharon\n\"I know how lucky I am. You know, most kids don\u2019t get that. But, aria here, she hit the jackpot. She has two of the coolest, most amazing moms in the entire world.\" said by Noah\n\"This is not my first stint at jabot.\" said by Billy\n\"No kidding. You\u2019ve been ceo how many times? Co-ceo, your mom fired you, my dad fired you. Everybody has fired you.\" said by Kyle\n\"But there\u2019s a positive there, I\u2019ve learned from my mistakes. And I\u2019m also bringing the experience that I have from working at chancellor-winters when they went through their merger. I know how to bring two companies together. And under the current configuration, jabot is not maximizing the potential of having marchetti under its umbrella.\" said by Billy\n\"Thanks for your input, but our strategy of keeping marchetti and jabot separate from the beginning has proven successful. I see no reason to change course.\" said by Kyle\n\"Sometimes, you gotta think outside the box, kyle.\" said by Billy\n\"And what about the jaboutiques? Weren\u2019t those another one of your failures?\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019m gonna let that one slide because you\u2019re under tremendous personal pressure.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah, I know you pride yourself on being that guy, the innovator, the idea guy, but sometimes, outside the box is just outside of the box.\" said by Kyle\n\"And sometimes, it\u2019s exactly what you need. And because this idea involves both marchetti and jabot, you can\u2019t unilaterally veto it.\" said by Billy\n\"And by the same token, you can\u2019t unilaterally implement it. It\u2019s my dad\u2019s call.\" said by Kyle\n\"Great. I\u2019ll talk to jack, see what he has to say.\" said by Billy\n\"Fine by me.\" said by Kyle\n\"Wonderful.\" said by Billy\n\"I\u2019m going to lunch. I know what you\u2019re trying to do, distract me with stupid business ideas. Thanks.\" said by Kyle\n\"You\u2019re welcome.\" said by Billy\n\"Whatever you wish for and hope will happen, there\u2019s a very good chance that I\u2019m going to be found guilty of murder. And I will be moved to some prison, god knows where. So, not seeing each other now, it\u2019ll just make it easier for you to move on once I\u2019m sentenced.\" said by Diane\n\"To move on? You honestly think I can just forget about you after everything we have been through to find our way back to each other? I have no intention of living my life without you.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, it\u2019s for the best.\" said by Diane\n\"You can\u2019t do this.\" said by Jack\n\"I\u2019m not being selfish. I\u2019m thinking about you and kyle.\" said by Diane\n\"Kyle? Kyle spent decades of his life thinking his mother was dead. Can you really imagine yourself putting him through that kind of pain again?\" said by Jack\n\"Well, if he spends any time with me now, then it will be that much harder for him once I move to some maximum security facility. Kyle needs to get used to the idea that I\u2019m not going to be around.\" said by Diane\n\"And what about harrison? How is that little boy supposed to understand his deedee suddenly disappearing? She doesn\u2019t write, she doesn\u2019t call.\" said by Jack\n\"I want to go back to my cell. Guard!\" said by Diane\n\"Diane. Diane, wait. Wait.\" said by Jack\n\"Come in.\" said by Billy\n\"Hey.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Excuse me, how did you get past security?\" said by Billy\n\"I bribed them with dumplings. I hope it\u2019s okay I stopped by.\" said by Chelsea\n\"It\u2019s okay and not only because I know that that bag is coming from yang chow\u2019S.\" said by Billy\n\"How could you tell?\" said by Chelsea\n\"\u2018Cause I can smell the slippery shrimp from here.\" said by Billy\n\"Ah. Well, I figured since it\u2019s your first day back, you weren\u2019t thinking about lunch. So, I thought about it for you. If you have time?\" said by ", "answer": "Chelsea"}
{"content": "\"I take it billy hasn\u2019t brought the boys back from skating yet?\" said by Adam\n\"No, he\u2019s meeting me back here once the rink session ends.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Ah.\" said by Adam\n\"You want to wait with me?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Thank you.\" said by Adam\n\"How\u2019s work?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Hmm? Excuse me?\" said by Adam\n\"I didn\u2019t mean to pry.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Uh, work is work. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s fine.\" said by Adam\n\"Are you okay? You seem a little tense.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Turns out dear old dad is up to his usual treachery again. So I\u2019m gonna have to watch my back at jabot.\" said by Adam\n\"I\u2019m sorry to hear that.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Yeah. Except for jack, none of the abbotts want me there. I mean, that is so typical for victor to try to sabotage me.\" said by Adam\n\"And let me guess. Victor now wants to punish you for turning your back on the family and going to work for \u201cthe enemy.\u201d\" said by Chelsea\n\"Oh, well, according to nick, he\u2019s doing it to save me.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, my goodness.\" said by Victor\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Summer\n\"My sweet granddaughter.\" said by Victor\n\"Hi, grandpa.\" said by Summer\n\"How are you, my darling?\" said by Victor\n\"I\u2019m doing just fine. How are you?\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m doing well.\" said by Victor\n\"Good.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah. Been a while since you and i have talked. How\u2019s harrison?\" said by Victor\n\"Ah, he is a constant bright spot, even when things get challenging.\" said by Summer\n\"Mm. I think I know what you\u2019re alluding to.\" said by Victor\n\"Do you?\" said by Summer\n\"Diane jenkins? Yep. Stunning how that woman was able to insinuate herself into our lives here in genoa city after all that she has done before, not only to jack and kyle\u2019s lives, but considering what she has done in this town. My goodness. Anyway\u2026\" said by Victor\n\"She\u2019s entrenched, alright.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah, and i understand that jack is doing all kinds of things for her, cleaning up her messes all over the place.\" said by Victor\n\"There\u2019s not much i can do about that. Not that I have to like it.\" said by Summer\n\"No, but it\u2019s complicated for you, isn\u2019t it? Considering how much your mother loathes diane jenkins.\" said by Victor\n\"You want to know what\u2019s even more frustrating?\" said by Summer\n\"Hmm?\" said by Victor\n\"It\u2019s all of these plots and schemes that are constantly going on in both of our families. I mean, honestly, machiavelli had nothing on the newmans or the abbotts.\" said by Summer\n\"Machiavelli? That\u2019s a renaissance man who wrote a book called \u201cthe prince\u201d about how to rule people. You know? I mean, very flattering to be brought up in the same sentence with machiavelli, but I think it\u2019s exaggerated, right?\" said by Victor\n\"I don\u2019t think so.\" said by Summer\n\"You don\u2019t?\" said by Victor\n\"I\u2019ve been working really hard to convince kyle that we just need to avoid all the intrigue that is swirling around us, including yours, grandpa.\" said by Summer\n\"Hmm.\" said by Victor\n\"Oh! Hello, nikki. You\u2019re looking well.\" said by Diane\n\"Save it.\" said by Nikki\n\"[ Scoffs ] Excuse me?\" said by Diane\n\"Don\u2019t waste your breath with friendly chitchat. We are not friends, and we never will be. Could I have some water, please?\" said by Nikki\n\"Alright.\" said by Diane\n\"I know that you and jack were behind the break-in at our apartment in chicago. You stole my necklace and framed jeremy stark for it.\" said by Nikki\n\"[ Scoffs ] What a bizarre accusation. Do you have any evidence to back it up?\" said by Diane\n\"Kyle. You got a minute?\" said by Jack\n\"Sure. I assume this is about what we discussed before, you and mom and where that\u2019s headed? I just had a long talk with her.\" said by Kyle\n\"No, it\u2019s another subject entirely. I heard a rather disturbing rumor I\u2019m hoping you can dispel.\" said by Jack\n\"What rumor\u2019s that?\" said by Kyle\n\"Victor is plotting against adam, trying to undermine his work here, and you\u2019re helping him to implement it.\" said by Jack\n\"Where is this coming from?\" said by Kyle\n\"It doesn\u2019t matter. Just tell me it isn\u2019t true. Technically when enamel is gone,\" said by Jack\n\"Victor did approach me, but I haven\u2019t committed to anything specific.\" said by Kyle\n\"Then you have considered it. Look, I know you had misgivings about my hiring adam to pick up the slack here when you moved over to marchetti, but \u2014\" said by Jack\n\"Look, you\u2019re the guy\u2019s only real friend, which should tell you something, but that\u2019s your call. However, when you make him co-ceo of the family company, I get to have an opinion.\" said by Kyle\n\"You think adam is trying to take over jabot?\" said by Jack\n\"No, no, no. I don\u2019t know what his motives are, but I can tell you what he\u2019s done since he\u2019s been here. Not much. The guy is coasting, dad, calling it in from the bar at society most days and drawing a big, fat paycheck with primo perks while he sorts out that mess he calls a life. Am I wrong? How would you rate his job performance?\" said by Kyle\n\"I have gone over status reports on the different divisions that adam oversees. I have spoken to division managers.\" said by Jack\n\"Just like I have. And?\" said by Kyle\n\"And you are right. While he started strong, he has been slipping lately.\" said by Jack\n\"More like M.I.A. Totally dropping the ball. It\u2019s pretty unacceptable from a guy at his \u2014\" said by Kyle\n\"That is still something for adam and I to work through.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Kyle\n\"Not you, not anyone else. Victor certainly doesn\u2019t have a place in this conversation. Frankly, neither do you.\" said by Jack\n\"So, my beautiful granddaughter, what\u2019s on your mind?\" said by Victor\n\"There\u2019s no point in talking around this, so I\u2019m just gonna come right out and say it.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay.\" said by Victor\n\"Please stop trying to get kyle to help you with your plan to punish adam.\" said by Summer\n\"You seem upset.\" said by Victor\n\"I am upset. Things with kyle were going great. We were running marchetti. We were raising harrison. It was total bliss.\" said by Summer\n\"Sweetheart, the last thing I want to do is disturb that bliss.\" said by Victor\n\"The thing is, grandpa, is people in both of our families are involved in all of these secret maneuvers. It\u2019s causing a lot of friction in our family.\" said by Summer\n\"So, where\u2019s all this coming from?\" said by Victor\n\"[ Sighs ] Grandpa, my husband and I don\u2019t keep things from each other.\" said by Summer\n\"Mm.\" said by Victor\n\"Kyle told me that you were looking for a way to push adam out of jabot and that you offered up some textile mills in exchange for his assistance. I mean, kyle doesn\u2019t love having adam in the mix over there, but thankfully he turned you down. He told me that he didn\u2019t want any part of it. So, what I\u2019m asking you is to please stop asking him about it because he is not gonna change his mind.\" said by Summer\n\"Tell me something, sweetheart. Do you, um, think adam is where he belongs?\" said by Victor\n\"Victor\u2019s plan du jour is to get me fired from jabot, after which he\u2019ll dangle some irresistible position at newman, and then he will follow it up with a hearty welcome home. I mean, only \u2014 only victor newman would view trying to tank my career as an act of paternal affection.\" said by Adam\n\"Is he succeeding? Is your job in jeopardy?\" said by Chelsea\n\"No, not yet. I mean, at least not that I know of. Do you wanna hear what the punch line is? I\u2019M\u2026not happy at jabot.\" said by Adam\n\"Really? Why?\" said by Chelsea\n\"[ Sighs ] I don\u2019t fit in there. As much as I try to, I just \u2014 I don\u2019t connect to the work or the products that we sell there or the people\u2026\" said by Adam\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Chelsea\n\"\u2026That I supervise.\" said by Adam\n\"That\u2019s frustrating.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Yeah. As much as I hate to admit it and as much as my father\u2019s methods are infuriating and wildly inappropriate\u2026 his instincts are dead on. Skin feeling dry? Swipe it away.\" said by Adam\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Diane\n\"You know, there have been such incredible advances in security technology \u2014 cameras so small they can be hidden anywhere. And the image quality? Ooh, so sharp.\" said by Nikki\n\"I saw your reaction when it occurred to you that jack might have let himself into your apartment and maybe borrowed your necklace. And for a second, I thought you were going to suggest it to chance, but you didn\u2019T. So I suspect that if you did have proof and you wanted to use it, you would have done so by now.\" said by Diane\n\"Keep telling yourself that.\" said by Nikki\n\"Mm-hmm, yeah. And as much as you hate me, i really don\u2019t believe you\u2019d put jack in that position just to get back at me. Besides, I also think you\u2019re glad jeremy\u2019s gone, however it happened, because your family was in danger, just like mine, thanks to phyllis and her recklessness.\" said by Diane\n\"You seem quite confident that you\u2019ve gotten away with another crime, as if everything is working out just as you planned. But you and I both know that\u2019s an act because deep down, even you don\u2019t believe it.\" said by Nikki\n\"I haven\u2019t done a thing to adam. I haven\u2019t needed to. He has done a great job sabotaging himself.\" said by Kyle\n\"I understand why you might think that you, but \u2014\" said by Jack\n\"Dad, you went so far out on a limb for that guy, knowing there wasn\u2019t a single person in our family who would support him being co-ceo. You risked alienating everyone because you believed so strongly in adam. He claimed he wanted to redeem himself, he want to turn his life around, like he always does. And this is how he repays you, doing mediocre work and dragging the company down?\" said by Kyle\n\"You can\u2019t say he\u2019s dragging jabot down \u2014\" said by Jack\n\"No, this isn\u2019t about whether victor has a plan to undermine adam or not. Who cares? The point is, he doesn\u2019t deserve the position of authority you gave him. He shouldn\u2019t be at jabot, full stop. Hell, the guy doesn\u2019t even want to be here. So, what is this about, dad? Why not cut him loose and call it a day?\" said by Kyle\n\"This is the first time I\u2019m hearing you\u2019re dissatisfied working at jabot.\" said by Chelsea\n\"[ Sighs ] Well, it\u2019s the first time that I\u2019m admitting it out loud. I mean, you know \u2014 I left newman because I was fed up with being disrespected, being strung along, being told that I\u2019m valued but never being part of the inner circle. I mean, victoria has never missed a chance to remind me of that.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah, but jack is finally giving you the status, the respect that you deserve, along with trust and responsibility. Why isn\u2019t that enough for you?\" said by Chelsea\n\"That is a great question. And jack\u2019s a true friend. He handed me a terrific opportunity. Trust me \u2014 I know how selfish and ungrateful I sound right now.\" said by Adam\n\"I\u2019m not judging you. I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s going on with you.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Yeah. Well, me too.\" said by Adam\n\"You know, when I was doing two fashion jobs at once and I wasn\u2019t feeling passionate about either one of them, you gave me some good advice. You told me to step back instead of burning myself out, even though I didn\u2019t want to listen to you.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, the last thing i think I am is overworked. To be honest with you, I\u2019ve been slacking big time.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, that\u2019s not like you.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Yeah. Well, maybe when I\u2019m not up to something devious or trying to prove myself to someone who doubts me, I lose motivation.\" said by Adam\n\"Hmm. Well, maybe you need to make some enemies around the office.\" said by Chelsea\n\"I think besides jack, nobody wanted me to work there, so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the issue. I have plenty of haters. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me.\" said by Adam\n\"You know, another upside to working at jabot \u2014 you\u2019re free from all that newman drama, which is something you\u2019ve said you\u2019ve always wanted.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Yeah. That is a good point.\" said by Adam\n\"However, on the other hand, jabot is a different kind of company than you\u2019re used to working at, for sure. It\u2019s a lot more laid-back, narrowly focused on cosmetics, definitely, you know, not as much of a challenge to run.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, I\u2019m certainly not in any danger of running newman ever again.\" said by Adam\n\"If victor made you a great offer \u2014 I mean a great offer \u2014 where you could thrive, show off your talents, finally get the respect you deserve, you\u2019re telling me you wouldn\u2019t do it? Did you know, some ordinary cold medicines can raise your blood pressure?\" said by Chelsea\n\"I can\u2019t imagine a scenario where I would be tempted to go back to newman. Last time I was there, they treated me like crap. \u201cYou\u2019re ceo. Now you\u2019re not.\u201d And like you said, I have no desire to get sucked into their constant drama.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, that\u2019s not really an answer. Just because you can\u2019t imagine a scenario doesn\u2019t mean it couldn\u2019t exist.\" said by Chelsea\n\"[ Sighs ] Well, you got me there.\" said by Adam\n\"And you admitted yourself you don\u2019t think that victor is trying to punish you with this little scheme of his. So, then why go to all the trouble? Do you think maybe, just maybe, deep down, he believes that you belong in his family, that you belong to be a part of this big newman empire, and maybe, in your heart of hearts, that\u2019s what you want, too?\" said by Chelsea\n\"He might believe that. I guarantee you none of the rest of them care what I want.\" said by Adam\n\"That might be true. But victor is the only one who matters. Hi!\" said by Chelsea\n\"Hey. Connor, it\u2019s your fan club.\" said by Billy\n\"Where?\" said by Connor\n\"No, he means us, silly. How was skating?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Totally great.\" said by Connor\n\"Except for all the times dad fell on his butt.\" said by Johnny\n\"Alright, I was little rusty.\" said by Billy\n\"I thought you were billy.\" said by Connor\n\"Good one.\" said by Johnny\n\"Alright, who wants hot chocolate?\" said by Billy\n\"Ooh, I do!\" said by Johnny\n\"Me!\" said by Connor\n\"Okay, good. So, go order whatever you want. Grab me a small coffee, please. Anybody else want anything?\" said by Billy\n\"I\u2019m good, thanks.\" said by Chelsea\n\"I thought you were chelsea.\" said by Johnny\n\"Ohh!\" said by Chelsea\n\"You stole my joke.\" said by Connor\n\"No, I didn\u2019T.\" said by Johnny\n\"Yeah, you did.\" said by Connor\n\"It had to be funny to be a joke.\" said by Johnny\n\"Ha ha.\" said by Connor\n\"Okay.\" said by Billy\n\"Only jack and adam can answer that question.\" said by Summer\n\"I want to hear it from you. You think that adam deserves to be co-ceo at jabot?\" said by Victor\n\"I think\u2026 I think it\u2019s problematic. I mean, not everyone is a fan of his, and, honestly, I don\u2019t really know why jack ever made that choice. And I don\u2019t see how it ends well for anyone.\" said by Summer\n\"So, you don\u2019t think adam has changed?\" said by Victor\n\"Is that a serious question?\" said by Summer\n\"Mm-hmm. You know, your father thinks that he deserves more of a chance.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, that\u2019s because adam gave faith a kidney. And even that wasn\u2019t enough to keep up the goodwill. I think my dad has realized with the rest of us always have known \u2014 that these flashes of humanity, they never last. Whenever adam does something good or heroic, it\u2019s always calculated. It\u2019s transactional. It\u2019s because he wants something in return.\" said by Summer\n\"A lot of truth to what you say. But adam is my son.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, you know what, grandpa? It\u2019s not even really about what my dad thinks or my opinion or even what adam does. This is about you trying to convince kyle to facilitate adam\u2019s return to newman, which could cause a huge conflict between him and jack. And that\u2019s the last thing my husband needs.\" said by Summer\n\"My darling, i appreciate your honesty, okay? And I will give what you said a lot of thought.\" said by Victor\n\"[ Sighs ] The last thing I want to do is be upset with you, grandpa.\" said by Summer\n\"You know that I adore you, okay?\" said by Victor\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Summer\n\"You criticize adam all you want. His role at jabot is not up for debate. He answers to me, not you, not victor. And his work does not affect you or marchetti.\" said by Jack\n\"Dad, listen to me \u2014\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019ve listened to you! Now you listen to me. I stand by my decision to hire adam, and I will address his performance the same way I do any valued executive in this company. What I won\u2019t do is fire him to please victor or to satisfy you. I am delighted that you are not involved in victor\u2019s manipulations, but I will speak to him very soon.\" said by Jack\n\"No, I really \u2014\" said by Kyle\n\"No, I think I\u2019m done on this particular subject. I\u2019d like to change the subject. There\u2019s something else I\u2019d like to talk to you about.\" said by Jack\n\"What\u2019s that?\" said by Kyle\n\"You said you had a conversation with your mother. How did that go? Did you find it reassuring, her devotion, her commitment to you and the family, despite anything that might happen between the two of us?\" said by Jack\n\"I\u2019m trying to be open to this, dad, for your sake. I want you to be happy, both you and mom. But\u2026 look, just be careful, alright? Protect yourself.\" said by Kyle\n\"What in particular is prompting that warning?\" said by Jack\n\"The best part \u2014 there was a hockey game on the second rink and connor played it.\" said by Johnny\n\"You did? Like a pickup game?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Yeah.\" said by Connor\n\"Ah.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, how was it?\" said by Adam\n\"Epic. I wish you guys would have come.\" said by Connor\n\"If I got back on skates right now, I would end up entirely black and blue.\" said by Chelsea\n\"[ Gasps ] You two could have matching bruises.\" said by Johnny\n\"Oh, come on. I did not fall that often.\" said by Billy\n\"He\u2019s getting old. It happens.\" said by Johnny\n\"[ Laughs ]\" said by Connor\n\"You know what? You\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re now grounded.\" said by Billy\n\"Oh, just like you were when you hit that ice and just absolutely sprawled out?\" said by Johnny\n\"Alright, already! Enough is enough.\" said by Billy\n\"I think the grown-ups are better off sitting on the benches and talking about old movies or whatever, like they always do.\" said by Connor\n\"Well, that sounds about right. That\u2019s pretty much our speed. Yeah.\" said by Chelsea\n\"[ Laughs ]\" said by Connor\n\"Cheers to old people.\" said by Billy\n\"Cheers to old people.\" said by Chelsea\n\"On the whole, it was a good talk. I felt like we were both being honest, and I got a lot off my chest.\" said by Kyle\n\"Good. I\u2019m glad to hear that.\" said by Jack\n\"Mom was adamant there would be no more surprises from her past.\" said by Kyle\n\"That\u2019s a good thing. Or you doubt that?\" said by Jack\n\"I don\u2019t want to see you get hurt again. You\u2019ve had your heart broken enough. I told her that.\" said by Kyle\n\"And you think that\u2019s inevitable?\" said by Jack\n\"I hope not. God knows we\u2019ve all been through enough trauma, but, dad, she has a history of making promises she can\u2019t keep. Then we get surprised by people like jeremy stark.\" said by Kyle\n\"He is no longer a threat.\" said by Jack\n\"You took a big risk handling that. I appreciate it, and I know mom does, too. Although I\u2019m still upset you handled it on your own and wouldn\u2019t let me in.\" said by Kyle\n\"You know what? That\u2019s over. It\u2019s taken care of.\" said by Jack\n\"This time.\" said by Kyle\n\"There will not be a next time, not if I have anything to say about it.\" said by Jack\n\"And to answer your question\u2026 I am cautiously optimistic.\" said by Kyle\n\"Good. Kyle, I am taking this next step with my eyes wide open. I hope you can see the positive aspects in all of this. I am happy. Diane is happy.\" said by Jack\n\"That counts for a lot, dad.\" said by Kyle\n\"Your parents have worked through the trauma of the past and are looking to a bright new future together. That is a very good thing.\" said by Jack\n\"I\u2019m feeling optimistic about the future. Very optimistic.\" said by Diane\n\"Well, you have nothing to fear from me. I\u2019m not going to inject myself into the police investigation. And you\u2019re right. Jeremy stark should never have been lured to town. It\u2019s just as well for everybody that he has been arrested.\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh. So, you\u2019re acknowledging that i was right. That\u2019s a first.\" said by Diane\n\"Don\u2019t get too excited. It\u2019s merely another case of you using deception to get what you want, making jack do your dirty work.\" said by Nikki\n\"Mm. Hypothetically speaking, if jack\" said by Diane\n\"Well, I\u2019m sure he enjoyed playing the hero. And given your optimism, perhaps this little brush with danger brought the two of you even closer. All that heightened emotion. Tell me \u2014 have you moved in with jack yet? Ah, not yet. Mustn\u2019t appear too eager. But I\u2019m sure you will make him think it\u2019s his idea and he\u2019ll jump into it with such enthusiasm and hope \u2014 because that\u2019s the kind of person he is. But you have to know how ugly things will turn out because that\u2019s just the natural course of things where you are concerned and that\u2019s the kind of person you are.\" said by Nikki\n\"You know, you\u2019re behind the times, nikki. I haven\u2019t moved in, but jack and I are back together already.\" said by Diane\n\"Ugh. That\u2019s unfortunate. He\u2019s such a smart man, except when it comes to you.\" said by Nikki\n\"No, he\u2019s wise not to let other people\u2019s opinions keep him from being happy.\" said by Diane\n\"I guess jeremy stark\u2019s sojourn to genoa city worked out well for you. It gave you the opportunity to play the damsel in distress, which a man as chivalrous as jack will find very appealing. You really should be grateful to phyllis.\" said by ", "answer": "Nikki"}
{"content": "\"Ever since your mother got a promotion and I went back to work, it\u2019s tough to catch up with you. I don\u2019t get to spend as much time as I\u2019d like to with you.\" said by Neil\n\"Well, it\u2019s okay. It seems like I haven\u2019t had much time for myself these days too, so. School is so much harder this year.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah, we all get caught up with our busy routines sometimes, don\u2019t we?\" said by Neil\n\"Yeah.\" said by Lily\n\"Hey, you know, I was thinking\u2013\" said by Neil\n\"Uh, oh. Well, I know how dangerous that can be.\" said by Lily\n\"Very funny, young lady.\" said by Neil\n\"Yeah.\" said by Lily\n\"What are your plans for the rest of the day?\" said by Neil\n\"Um, usual stuff. Nothing special.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah. Nothing special. I like that, because I cleared all the work off my desk, I was hoping that we could spend the rest of the day together.\" said by Neil\n\"Just you and me?\" said by Lily\n\"Of course, you and me, bozo. What are you talking about? I figured we could go to the genoa city athletic club, get a quick workout in. And then, maybe grab a bite, a movie. How about it?\" said by Neil\n\"All right, let\u2019s do it.\" said by Lily\n\"Okay. Come on.\" said by Neil\n\"Hey.\" said by Lily\n\"Hey.\" said by Daniel\n\"What are you doing here?\" said by Lily\n\"I\u2019m coming to the event tonight. Celebration of your dad\u2019s life.\" said by Daniel\n\"No, daniel. You\u2013 you shouldn\u2019t be here.\" said by Lily\n\"Hey.\" said by Devon\n\"Hi. Mission accomplished.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah, everything set?\" said by Devon\n\"Yes, I told the lounge exactly how he wanted everything.\" said by Abby\n\"Oh, perfect.\" said by Devon\n\"It\u2019s gonna be a phenomenal party.\" said by Abby\n\"Oh, I know it\u2019s gonna be phenomenal because all of your parties are phenomenal.\" said by Devon\n\"Well, this is in neil\u2019s honor, so it has to be extra special. You sure you\u2019re ready for all of this? I mean, I know it\u2019s a celebration, but it\u2019s still the anniversary of neal\u2019s passing. So, there\u2019s bound to be some difficult moments.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah, I know that. It comes with the territory, but I\u2019m more than ready for it. I am. I\u2019m very happy with everything we\u2019ve put together. I think it\u2019s perfect exactly the way it is.\" said by Devon\n\"Did someone suggest otherwise?\" said by Abby\n\"No. But, uh, tucker came by earlier with a big idea for a tribute that he wanted to pay for and produce and announce tonight.\" said by Devon\n\"What kind of tribute?\" said by Abby\n\"It was an international jazz festival with neil\u2019s name attached to it.\" said by Devon\n\"Wow.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay. Yeah, that\u2019s a major overstep.\" said by Abby\n\"Well, it\u2019s just his way of trying to make amends with me, which I appreciate. It\u2019s just awkward timing.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah.\" said by Abby\n\"I know.\" said by Devon\n\"I agree.\" said by Abby\n\"I did invite him to the party though.\" said by Devon\n\"That\u2019s a surprise.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah, I just hope he listened to me and remembers that the night is not about him. It\u2019s about neil and nothing else.\" said by Devon\n\"[ Whispers] Yes.\" said by Abby\n\"So, this big \u201csurprise\u201d you\u2019ve got going tonight. No going back.\" said by Ashley\n\"No. It\u2019s sad. You don\u2019t have a problem with it, do you?\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, I would probably have handled things a little differently. I understand why you did what you did though, and I hope it works out for you the way you want it to. And that devon realizes that you\u2019re serious about wanting to reconnect.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah, I hope so too. I just want him to be happy. What impact this will have on how he views me remains to be seen, but I think it\u2019s worth the chance.\" said by Tucker\n\"I\u2019m curious as to why you wanted to meet. Everything all right?\" said by Chelsea\n\"It\u2019s just peachy. Well, other than dad causing his usual drama, but, uh, it\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t mitigate. I, uh\u2013 I wanted to talk to you about the baby.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh? I hope everything\u2019s going well with the pregnancy.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Yeah, sally is doing great. She, um, and our little girl.\" said by Adam\n\"Adam\u2026 you\u2019re having a daughter.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Um, yeah, it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s incredible. It\u2019s get, uh\u2013 getting more real by the second.\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah. I know the feeling.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Which brings me to why I\u2019m here. Um, I think it\u2019s time that we tell connor about the baby.\" said by Adam\n\"Woo. Hello to you too, baby girl.\" said by Sally\n\"I do. I want her to grow up on my ranch, surrounded by uncles, aunts, cousins, anything she wants would be hers.\" said by Victor\n\"But not me. My baby stays and I go.\" said by Sally\n\"You\u2019re very ambitious. You\u2019re very gifted. You can build a company of your own wherever you want to. I\u2019ll fully finance it. I leave you with that thought. Okay? And I have a feeling you will make the right decision, not only for yourself but for your baby.\" said by Victor\n\"Hi.\" said by Sally\n\"Hey.\" said by Nick\n\"Wow. I did not expect you to come by.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, I just wanted to see if you were okay.\" said by Nick\n\"Uh, generally speaking or?\" said by Sally\n\"I understand my father summoned you to meet with him. I can only imagine how it went.\" said by Nick\n\"It was not what I expected.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, if you\u2019re up for it, I\u2019d like to hear everything he said to you. Up at 2:00am again?\" said by Nick\n\"Additional sponsorship provided by\u2026\" said by Announcer\n\"Daniel, you really should leave. I did not think that you were gonna come here tonight.\" said by Lily\n\"Why wouldn\u2019t I?\" said by Daniel\n\"Because this is where your mom collapsed.\" said by Lily\n\"Lily, it\u2019s fine. I can deal.\" said by Daniel\n\"Are you sure?\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah. You know, I can\u2019t stay away from this place just because of a bad memory. And it\u2019s the coolest, most inspirational place in town. I gotta be able to come here.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah, I, I understand that, but maybe not tonight.\" said by Lily\n\"Especially tonight. I wasn\u2019t there four years ago for neil\u2019s funeral. I\u2019m just glad that I get to honor his memory tonight.\" said by Daniel\n\"It\u2019s very generous of you to invite tucker tonight.\" said by Abby\n\"Well, I just thought, what would neil do?\" said by Devon\n\"The classy thing.\" said by Abby\n\"Exactly. And plus, it seems like, uh, tucker may be sticking around town for a little longer.\" said by Devon\n\"Was there a chance he could be leaving?\" said by Abby\n\"I mean, I thought so. Maybe after I didn\u2019t buy his company and he sold it to victor.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, I\u2019m sure my dad is very pleased with himself for getting tucker\u2019s company.\" said by Abby\n\"Oh, I\u2019m sure he is. That\u2019s what he wanted. And then tucker said that he thought about starting fresh in a new place, but decided to stay here for me and dominic.\" said by Devon\n\"Hmm. Well, I\u2019m gonna bet that he\u2019s being sincere.\" said by Abby\n\"Only time will tell that.\" said by Devon\n\"It must mean a lot to you. You know, that he\u2019s making an effort. Maybe he could actually step up and be a father figure. Not like neil, not even close. But maybe he does deserve a second chance.\" said by Abby\n\"Would be nice. And you\u2019re not the only one who thinks that tucker is redeemable.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh?\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah. Have you talked to your mom lately?\" said by Devon\n\"No. I mean, she texted me that she wanted to talk to me, but I just figured I\u2019d see her at the party tonight.\" said by Abby\n\"Uh. She has invited tucker to move in with her at the abbott house. I didn\u2019t want to be the one to tell you this. I just didn\u2019t want you to get blindsided in front of everybody tonight.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay. Please, uh, tell me everything that you know.\" said by Abby\n\"He didn\u2019t tell me any details, but I think that you should probably talk to your mom.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, yeah, I intend to.\" said by Abby\n\"So, when I bought your debt and then I wanted devon to buy mccall, you know, it was because I wanted to bring the two of you closer and that didn\u2019t work out. But I just wanted to tell you that I\u2019m really, really proud of you for taking the steps to make it happen now.\" said by Ashley\n\"Thank you. Your fingers crossed about tonight?\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah, for both of us.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah. Any response from abby?\" said by Tucker\n\"No. I have all these scenarios going off in my head. You know, that she got the text, but she\u2019s too busy or she got the text and she\u2019s angry and\u2013\" said by Ashley\n\"She knows.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yep. She knows. Diabetes can serve up a lot of questions,\" said by Ashley\n\"Look, there\u2019s no need to panic. As you can tell, I\u2019m not drowning in a puddle of tears.\" said by Sally\n\"The fact that you even have to say that means I was right. He obviously gave you a hard time, which he had no business doing.\" said by Nick\n\"Would you mind telling me how you found out about our little heart to heart? Because I\u2019m guessing victor did not advertise it to you, so it must have been adam?\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, it was adam. He tracked me down. He thought I should know what was going on. We\u2019re both very concerned about you, sally.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah. Well, I can\u2019t blame either of you. I\u2019m actually surprised that you did not come storming down to society.\" said by Sally\n\"I wanted to. That was my first impulse, but adam advised against it.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, thank you both for staying out of it. You know, I\u2013 I didn\u2019t need rescuing. I can handle victor all on my own. Although, I will admit it was definitely not the most fun conversation I\u2019ve ever had. Your father has a real gift for intimidation. He just stares at you, and you want to run and hide. It\u2019s like a superpower.\" said by Sally\n\"Did he threaten you? Go off on you?\" said by Nick\n\"No, it was actually all quite civil. Actually, was a little bit friendly when I first joined him.\" said by Sally\n\"Putting you at ease.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah. But I\u2019m not stupid. So, I stayed on my guard, and it didn\u2019t take long for him to drop the act. I knew it was coming because he started talking about how important family was and you know, eventually he laid out his real agenda.\" said by Sally\n\"Which was what?\" said by Nick\n\"Your father will do whatever it takes to keep me away from you, adam and the rest of his precious family.\" said by Sally\n\"Obviously, we need to tell connor about the new baby at some point. Um, I\u2019ve been wondering when that should be.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, I guess I picked the right time to bring it up then.\" said by Adam\n\"Is sally on board with this?\" said by Chelsea\n\"She encouraged me to share the news. Give connor some time to get used to the idea.\" said by Adam\n\"Smart thinking.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Mm-hmm. But also, she\u2019s in her second trimester. She\u2019s starting to show. Word is starting to spread and I sure don\u2019t want connor to figure it out by seeing sally or finding it out from somebody else.\" said by Adam\n\"You\u2019re absolutely right. He needs to hear it from us.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, good. I\u2019m glad you agree.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay. So\u2026 how do we approach the topic? I mean, even if he\u2019s okay with this, it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s gonna be a shock to him.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Yeah, and he\u2019s been in such a great place. With us, at school. He\u2019s comfortable with johnny being his brother. Um, we do not want to rock the boat.\" said by Adam\n\"So, what do you suggest?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Before I called, I remembered what you said to me when I told you that I was gonna be a dad again. You said that connor would be an amazing big brother and that this could be something really beautiful for our family.\" said by Adam\n\"And I meant that. This isn\u2019t what any of us expected, you know, but it\u2019s gonna be great. It\u2019s gonna be great. We just have to make sure connor knows that it\u2019s not gonna make us love him any less.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Mm-hmm. So, what do you think? How soon would you be comfortable doing this?\" said by Adam\n\"Well, connor should be back from soccer practice any minute. No time like the present.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Come in.\" said by Abby\n\"Hi, honey.\" said by Ashley\n\"Hi.\" said by Abby\n\"Is devon here?\" said by Ashley\n\"No, he thought we could use some privacy.\" said by Abby\n\"Oh. So, I take it, he passed on tucker\u2019s news.\" said by Ashley\n\"He told me the basics and now I want to hear from you. What could you possibly be thinking?\" said by Abby\n\"Hello?\" said by Lily\n\"Hey, what\u2019s up?\" said by Devon\n\"You look nice. Thank you. So do you.\" said by Lily\n\"How are you doing?\" said by Devon\n\"Good.\" said by Lily\n\"This is gonna be a great night tonight.\" said by Devon\n\"I know. I\u2019m so glad we\u2019re doing this. You ready?\" said by Lily\n\"I am. I\u2019m ready. I get emotional a little bit from time to time. It\u2019s gonna be a\u2013 a lot of love in the neil winters jazz lounge tonight. I just can\u2019t believe how much time has gone by. You know?\" said by Devon\n\"I know. Our lives were so different from back then and yet it still feels like it happened just yesterday.\" said by Lily\n\"There\u2019s still so much that I wanted to say to him that I never got a chance to.\" said by Devon\n\"Well, you can do it tonight. I know he\u2019s listening. And I know that he\u2019s looking down on us and he is very proud of us.\" said by Lily\n\"Amen. Good checkup?\" said by Devon\n\"I\u2019m just gonna be very honest with you. All right? He was serious about leaving town and I knew that he wanted to be close to devon and dominic and frankly, abby, I wasn\u2019t ready to see him go.\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, my god.\" said by Abby\n\"So, I came up with this idea that maybe we could work it out.\" said by Ashley\n\"So, it was you. You were the one who convinced tucker to stay.\" said by Abby\n\"I\u2019ve got my eyes wide open.\" said by Ashley\n\"I have to tell you, mom, I think this is ridiculous and honestly, a little pathetic.\" said by Abby\n\"Abby, I\u2019m still your mother. Watch your mouth.\" said by Ashley\n\"And you can\u2019t change him.\" said by Abby\n\"I\u2019m just giving him a little room to give it a shot.\" said by Ashley\n\"To give it a shot.\" said by Abby\n\"That\u2019s it. All right. Now, are you angry because devon invited tucker to neil\u2019s tribute tonight?\" said by Ashley\n\"I think that\u2019s a little bit different, don\u2019t you? I mean, that\u2019s a father and son thing, asking him to come to an event for one night, but you, you are asking him to move into our family\u2019s home. Are you serious? Oh, my gosh.\" said by Abby\n\"What?\" said by Ashley\n\"I know what this is about. This is about uncle jack.\" said by Abby\n\"Oh, lord.\" said by Ashley\n\"It is, isn\u2019t it? Because I told you, you should move out because you guys are arguing over diane. But no, you doubled down and you asked tucker to move in.\" said by Abby\n\"It\u2019s not about jack. Okay? That wasn\u2019t the primary reason. The reason was tucker.\" said by Ashley\n\"Okay. Well, I think you\u2019re gonna regret this. I hope I\u2019m wrong, but I think you\u2019re gonna regret this in so many ways.\" said by Abby\n\"I hope you\u2019re wrong too. And I also hope this doesn\u2019t come between the two of us.\" said by Ashley\n\"Of course, it won\u2019t, mom. I love you.\" said by Abby\n\"I love you too.\" said by Ashley\n\"And it\u2019s your life. You can make your own decisions. I\u2019m just\u2013\" said by Abby\n\"I know, you\u2019re concerned. I get it. Can I please say hello to my grandson?\" said by Ashley\n\"Well, dominic is sleeping right now, and I really have to get ready. Louise is on her way to watch dominic tonight.\" said by Abby\n\"All right. Okay. I\u2019ll see you at the tribute.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah.\" said by Abby\n\"Okay.\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, thank you so much for coming. I know it\u2019s hard to get away when you\u2019re working and you have a new baby.\" said by Lily\n\"No, no. Tonight was worth the effort.\" said by Mariah\n\"And congratulations on aria. I know you and tessa are excited.\" said by Lily\n\"We are. It was just so weird. We came back and we were so joyous and everyone\u2019s dealing with this tragedy. I know that we\u2019re not well acquainted, but everyone here seems to love you and I just wanted to say that I am so, so sorry for your loss.\" said by Mariah\n\"Thank you. It\u2019s very kind.\" said by Daniel\n\"I know it\u2019s been a lot of years, but, um, is it so weird to look at me and be reminded of cassie?\" said by Mariah\n\"Well, it does make me think of her every time I see you, but I wouldn\u2019t say that\u2019s weird.\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, it took us a while to get used to it, so.\" said by Lily\n\"You know, why don\u2019t I make myself useful? Would either of you ladies\u2019 care for a drink?\" said by Daniel\n\"Oh, no, no. I\u2019ll get one a little bit later.\" said by Mariah\n\"Lily?\" said by Daniel\n\"Uh, yeah. I\u2019ll do a glass of wine.\" said by Lily\n\"One glass of wine coming up.\" said by Daniel\n\"Thank you.\" said by Lily\n\"Lily, I\u2019m so sorry about moses.\" said by Sharon\n\"Oh, thank you.\" said by Lily\n\"What? What happened to moses?\" said by Mariah\n\"Uh, well, he and faith were supposed to be here tonight.\" said by Sharon\n\"But they\u2019re busy studying for finals and they couldn\u2019t make it, so.\" said by Lily\n\"Oh. Thank, goodness. Mom, you really shouldn\u2019t phrase things like that. I mean, we got back from our trip and phyllis and uh, just\u2013 I\u2019m glad moses is okay.\" said by Mariah\n\"Yeah, I understand. I\u2019m sorry, sorry.\" said by Sharon\n\"Uh, on that note, I am gonna join daniel for that drink.\" said by Mariah\n\"They certainly bring back a lot of memories, don\u2019t they?\" said by Nikki\n\"Yeah, certainly does. One of the few guys I ever trusted, you know? He\u2019s a good friend.\" said by Victor\n\"You know what? The feeling was definitely mutual.\" said by Devon\n\"Hey, devon.\" said by Victor\n\"Mr. And mrs. Newman.\" said by Devon\n\"How the hell are you, bud?\" said by Victor\n\"Hi, devon.\" said by Nikki\n\"Thank you so much for being here tonight.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, we wouldn\u2019t have missed it.\" said by Nikki\n\"So nice of you and lily to do this.\" said by Victor\n\"Yeah. Well, thank you to you both for making this lounge so special. \u2018Cause he would have just loved every bit of it.\" said by Devon\n\"He certainly would have. Not the same without him, is it?\" said by Victor\n\"Not at all.\" said by Devon\n\"I\u2019m okay telling you what happened with victor, but will you be okay listening to it?\" said by Sally\n\"What did he say?\" said by Nick\n\"Okay, nick, please calm down. I can literally feel the tension rolling off of you.\" said by Sally\n\"No, I\u2019m cool.\" said by Nick\n\"You promise?\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, I promise. I\u2019m good. Please continue.\" said by Nick\n\"Okay. So, during the initial ingratiating phase, he congratulated me on having the baby, sweet as pie. He actually seemed genuinely excited about having a granddaughter.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, I\u2019m sure he meant that. You know, family is everything to him. Although at times, he has a warped way of showing that.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah. Um, anyway, so far so good. Right? Then he asked me about my past.\" said by ", "answer": "Sally"}

But, do you think kyle and summer will have resolved their problems by then?\" said by Diane\n\"Well, they have managed to weather a number of challenges in the past and survived.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. Every hurt leaves a scar.\" said by Diane\n\"Yeah, but that scar tissue is sturdy stuff. It\u2019ll make them stronger. It\u2019ll make them champions. Don\u2019t worry. Look, they\u2013 they\u2019re not kids. They can solve their own problems. You and I have to focus on each other. I wanna lavish you with all the love you deserve.\" said by Jack\n\"Hmm.

I\u2019m your girl.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, I was just about to get myself something sweet. I\u2019ll grab you an espresso. I\u2019m looking forward to the movie night.

But you know that already.\" said by Adam\n\"What do I know?\" said by Sally\n\"The whole story. What happened with ashland. And the news article you refused to run in newman media\u2019s publication.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, yeah, I know that.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah. I\u2019m just saying that nick can be his own worst enemy, even when when there\u2019s a hint of danger surrounding someone he loves, he can take it to an extreme.\" said by Adam\n\"You promised me that faith would be safe. You swore to me!\" said by Sharon\n\"We are doing everything that we can to find her, sharon. I promise.\" said by Chance\n\"Great. Call me when you find something.\" said by Sharon\n\"Whoa! Whoa! Where are you going? Where are you going? Stop. Stop.\" said by Chance\n\"To find my child!\" said by Sharon\n\"We have people out there doing their jobs. Let them do their jobs.\" said by Chance\n\"No, I have to go. I have to go. I have to go.\" said by Sharon\n\"Listen to me. Listen to me, before you go. I cannot imagine how terrified you are right now. And yes, faith does need you, but she needs you to be smart.\" said by Chance\n\"I know. I know. I am. I am.\" said by Sharon\n\"Okay, take a breath. All right? Think about this. What happens if you run out there without a clue what\u2019s going on and no backup?\" said by Chance\n\"I put myself in danger.\" said by Sharon\n\"Let me do my job. Okay? Trust me.\" said by Chance\n\"I just made bail. What\u2019s going on?\" said by Nick\n\"It\u2019s faith. He took her.

He knew I would die before I would ever allow him to touch a hair on faith\u2019s head.\" said by Nick\n\"Nick, it doesn\u2019t matter! We have to find her now!\" said by Sharon\n\"How did he even know where she would be?\" said by Nick\n\"I mean, he\u2019s gotta have someone on the inside.\" said by Chance\n\"You think my family had something to do with this?\" said by Nick\n\"Who had access to that information? Who knew she was on that flight?\" said by Chance\n\"No one. I booked that flight myself today. No one on the outside knew anything about it.\" said by Sharon\n\"It was cameron. He was here. He poisoned the cat.\" said by Nick\n\"You said that he never came into this house, but that cat, remember, never went outside. It was in here the whole time until faith found him dead on the doorstep.\" said by Sharon\n\"I know what you did! You hear me? I know what you did. You had me set up so you can grab my kid because you\u2019re not man enough to come out here and face me! So you hurt a defenseless kid and hurt her cat. I will find you. Do you hear me? I\u2019m going to find you! And when I do, there\u2019s not gonna be enough left of you for the cops to arrest. Do you hear me? Are you still listening?\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, my god. You wanted my attention. You got it. You bring my daughter home, you bastard. You bring her back home!\" said by Sharon\n\"Champagne\u2019s on us. Enjoy.\" said by Jack\n\"Yes. We should toast to true love. The kind that never dies.\" said by Diane\n\"Ugh. So morbid. Sounds like a rotting corpse dragging itself out of the cemetery. You know what I mean?\" said by Ashley\n\"No. No. And no one ever does. And yet everyone continues to listen to your opinions.\" said by Diane\n\"Ugh. How about we switch to a fun little rose from 2000? It\u2019s a little bouncy for my taste, but can\u2019t have everything.\" said by Tucker\n\"Some of us can.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah.\" said by Diane\n\"I think that\u2019s a great idea, honey. So, we haven\u2019t decided what to toast to.\" said by Ashley\n\"Righting old wrongs.\" said by Tucker\n\"Wow. There\u2019s a cherry toast. How about rekindling old flames?\" said by Jack\n\"Hmm.\" said by Diane\n\"Oh!\" said by Ashley\n\"What? What\u2019s so amusing?\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, well, kinda reminds me when diane burnt down the pool house.\" said by Ashley\n\"Why would you bring\u2013\" said by Jack\n\"No, no, no. Let\u2019s not let anything spoil our celebration. To the abundance of love that\u2019s found its way into the abbott family. May we all be so lucky.\" said by Diane\n\"Oh, I like that.\" said by Jack\n\"Hmm.\" said by Diane\n\"This is an entirely different case than what went down with ashland.\" said by Sally\n\"Show your work.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, he protected his sister from a mad man.\" said by Sally\n\"He protected sharon from a lunatic.\" said by Adam\n\"Who shouldn\u2019t even be out on the streets after all of the crimes he\u2019s committed. And ashland fell. That was an accident.\" said by Sally\n\"And after a round in the ring with nick, what befell cameron was probably a left hook.\" said by Adam\n\"Is this a conversation you really wanna be having with a woman whose borderline pre-eclampsia?\" said by Sally\n\"It is all part of the plan to get you to expose and expunge those sticky feelings so we can get to the candy coated core. Lighthearted topics. Eating, for instance.\" said by Adam\n\"I\u2019m still not hungry.\" said by Sally\n\"Okay. Okay. Then we will simply sit here in silence. No, that\u2019s too awkward. Um, we could, let\u2019s see. Let\u2019s see. Ooh, we could listen to an audiobook.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, that\u2019s fun.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, not me and you. Me and the kid. Ah-ha! Sun tzu\u2019s art of war or machiavelli\u2019s the prince.\" said by Adam\n\"Wow.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, she\u2019s gotta learn somehow. I want our girl to be ready like a warrior.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, she\u2019s ours, so she has no choice.\" said by Sally\n\"Grow up watching her old man work day and night to build mccall from bones to something valuable.\" said by Adam\n\"Why are you working so hard? It\u2019s not like you have to prove anything to yourself or anyone else.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, I\u2019m doing it all for the love of a girl who potentially could be the greatest love of my life.\" said by Adam\n\"Adam\u2013\" said by Sally\n\"Some as of yet, unnamed beauty, who has a mind for business and a heart as big as a kansas cornfield.\" said by Adam\n\"So what\u2019s the plan? Polish mccall until it sparkles, and then you pass it along to connor and the unnamed beauty?\" said by Sally\n\"Ooh, this is the best part. Is once I make it a contender again, I\u2019m gonna take back what\u2019s mine. Newman media.\" said by Adam\n\"He was here. He found a way into my home. Took my daughter. He took my sense of security. He knows our plans. He knows our fears. And\u2013 and we thought we were being so careful.\" said by Sharon\n\"With a guy like this it doesn\u2019t matter how cautious you are. He\u2019s probably been planning this for a long time now.\" said by Chance\n\"He knows what we\u2019re doing. He knows why. And\u2013 and we have no information. We still have no idea what he wants.\" said by Sharon\n\"I know what he wants. He told me when I confronted him at the athletic club.\" said by Nick\n\"What\u2019d he say?\" said by Chance\n\"He wants sharon. He thinks that he and her belong together and that he\u2019s gonna make her fall in love with him again.\" said by Nick\n\"I was never in love with him! He is deranged, okay?\" said by Sharon\n\"But if he wants sharon\u2013\" said by Nick\n\"He took faith as leverage.\" said by Chance\n\"She\u2019s the bait.\" said by Nick\n\"To get you to him.\" said by Chance\n\"Where could he be keeping her? Where is he keeping her?\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, if he wants you, he knows he has to be close, right? I mean, he\u2019s still gotta be in the area.\" said by Chance\n\"What should we do?\" said by Nick\n\"Stay put. He\u2019s gonna try to contact you and set up a time and a place to meet, okay?\" said by Chance\n\"Okay. Where will you be?\" said by Sharon\n\"I\u2019m gonna leave some guys on the property, but I wanna go check out his room at the athletic club, see if he left anything behind that might tell us where he is now or what he\u2019s gonna do next.\" said by Chance\n\"Chance, please find our faith. Find her.\" said by Sharon\n\"I don\u2019t know. What do you think of this rose?\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, it\u2019s delightful, honey.\" said by Ashley\n\"All right. Maybe we should serve it at the wedding.\" said by Tucker\n\"Don\u2019t stop there. Why don\u2019t you buy the vineyard, become vintners and move far, far away?\" said by Diane\n\"Oh, we can\u2019t do that. We love genoa city too much, don\u2019t we?\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah.\" said by Tucker\n\"We love it here. Could never move. Although, we could probably do some modifications on the house.\" said by Ashley\n\"Wait, my house?\" said by Jack\n\"Our house. Because sometimes it\u2019s a little inconvenient to run into certain people when you just wanna grab a quick snack from the kitchen.\" said by Ashley\n\"Certain people?\" said by Diane\n\"Yeah. I don\u2019t wanna point fingers, but\u2013\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah. Well, what do you propose we do about it? What? Build a wall down the center of the house?\" said by Diane\n\"How stupid is that building a wall? Come on. No. I mean, a fence would do perfectly fine.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yes.\" said by Tucker\n\"Don\u2019t be absurd.\" said by Jack\n\"No. An electric fence.\" said by Tucker\n\"Right.\" said by Ashley\n\"You know what though? The increase in the utility bill makes it impractical.\" said by Tucker\n\"We can\u2019t afford that.\" said by Ashley\n\"When will you two stop acting so childish?\" said by Diane\n\"Oh, maybe when your bus leaves the station out of town.\" said by Ashley\n\"Could we just have one evening that doesn\u2019t involve sniping and bickering?\" said by Jack\n\"She started it.\" said by Both\n\"Well, apparently not.\" said by Jack\n\"How can you say this started with me? You\u2019re the one who moved tucker into the house. You\u2019re\u2013 you\u2019re the one who started this asinine wedding charade.\" said by Diane\n\"Why is my wedding asinine and yours is perfectly normal?\" said by Ashley\n\"Because you\u2019re about to marry that ass.\" said by Diane\n\"Wow. Are you gonna let her talk to me like that?\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, she\u2019s not really talking to you. She\u2019s talking about you. And no, I\u2019m not. You know, I could throw this perfectly beautiful glass of rose in your face, but that would be a waste of a very expensive glass. But still I\u2019m somehow tempted to maybe just\u2013\" said by Ashley\n\"Can we get a less expensive rose?\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, really, ashley? I dare you. I dare you.\" said by Diane\n\"You dare me?\" said by Ashley\n\"Calm down!\" said by Jack\n\"What fresh hell is this?\" said by Abby\n\"I left a message for sharon. She still hasn\u2019t gotten back to me.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, devil\u2019s advocate, kids go through things. We know that.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah. This just feels different, billy. What if it\u2019s the start of something hereditary, that connor\u2019s gonna have to struggle with his entire life?\" said by Chelsea\n\"That\u2019s possible, okay? That\u2013 that could be true, but we don\u2019t know yet. Okay? So one step at a time. Yeah? I\u2019ll go talk to him.\" said by Billy\n\"Oh. Uh, just, uh, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s a good idea.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Hmm. I can handle a moody teenager. I was one not that long ago.\" said by Billy\n\"Hmm\u2026 it\u2019s kinda long ago.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Okay. Watch yourself. Uh, look, we get along well. Let me go talk to him. And who knows? This might be about some girl he doesn\u2019t wanna talk to his mom about.\" said by Billy\n\"That kid would talk to me.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Let me go upstairs. See what I can do.\" said by Billy\n\"You\u2019re quite confident.\" said by Chelsea\n\"I got this.\" said by Billy\n\"Good luck.\" said by Chelsea\n\"I should have been there. I should have been with faith.\" said by Nick\n\"Nick, you can not blame yourself.\" said by Sharon\n\"I should have driven her to the airport.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, then he would\u2019ve gotten both of you. Or waited until she was alone someplace else and taken her then. This is not your fault, okay? She had a police escort and that maniac still managed to take her.\" said by Sharon\n\"I cannot stop thinking about how bad I\u2019m gonna hurt this guy.\" said by Nick\n\"All right. Well, we need to focus on the problem. We need to wait for a phone call or some other kind of communication from him.\" said by Sharon\n\"Nick, are you all right?\" said by Sally\n\"Better now that I get to hear your voice.\" said by Nick\n\"It\u2019s really sweet of you to say. Please tell me everything. What\u2019s going on?\" said by Sally\n\"Well, I got outta jail, so things are working themselves out.\" said by Nick\n\"Are you being vague for medical reasons?\" said by Sally\n\"What do you mean?\" said by Nick\n\"It\u2019s like there\u2019s something going on and you don\u2019t wanna tell me. Look, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m\u2013 I am serenity itself.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, I intend to keep it that way.\" said by Nick\n\"Do you know why I was so good at newman media? Because I suffer from fomo. Chronic fear of missing out. I need to know things.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, you\u2019re gonna have to get used to taking a backseat for the next few months. Listen, can you do me a favor? Can you put adam on the phone? I need to talk to him and promise me that you\u2019re gonna take care of yourself until I get there and do it for you.\" said by Nick\n\"I can\u2019t wait. And same to you.\" said by Sally\n\"Anyone that\u2019s spent 20 seconds with you will know that. Before you ask, she\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll make sure she eats her veggies. How are things?\" said by Adam\n\"Is this on speaker phone?\" said by Nick\n\"Of course not.\" said by Adam\n\"All right. I need you to pretend like you\u2019re not hearing bad news and definitely keep this to yourself.\" said by Nick\n\"I can do that.\" said by Adam\n\"Cameron has faith. He took my little girl.\" said by Nick\n\"I see. Um, what now?\" said by Adam\n\"I\u2019mma take care of this. That\u2019s what\u2019s now.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, don\u2019t worry about sally. I will take care of her, um, while you handle that issue.\" said by Adam\n\"Thank you.\" said by Nick\n\"Mm-hmm. What are brothers for? Do what you have to do.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, I will. Count on that.\" said by Nick\n\"You have been attacking me since I came back to genoa city.\" said by Diane\n\"Who asked you to come back, diane?\" said by Ashley\n\"Okay. Wait, wait. Stop. Just stop whatever this is.\" said by Abby\n\"Hey. Look who\u2019s here.\" said by Jack\n\"Hi, honey.\" said by Diane\n\"Just in time\" said by Tucker\n\"For what? World war iii?\" said by Abby\n\"Actually, we were celebrating.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, is that what you call this? Because it looks like you were trying to resolve this great wedding conflict by attempting to smash each other\u2019s heads in.\" said by Abby\n\"Oh, no. There\u2019s no conflict. Your uncle jack and I were just mulling over the idea of a september wedding.\" said by Diane\n\"[ Fake coughing ] Oh, no, not september.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah, we had our eyes set on august.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah. \u2018Cause we just, we can\u2019t wait.\" said by Ashley\n\"Please put an end to this ruse. You could save face and walk away from the whole thing.\" said by Jack\n\"I think what uncle jack is trying to say is that august just seems so soon.\" said by Abby\n\"Well, I would marry her tomorrow if she\u2019d have me.\" said by Tucker\n\"Isn\u2019t it tremendous news, jackie? I mean, really, isn\u2019t it? We have a couple months here of just, oh, it\u2019s just gonna be filled with planning and fittings and all the excitement that goes into new beginnings.\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, I can\u2019t wait.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah. Me neither. I can\u2019t wait. I mean, really it\u2019s more than just a wedding though, don\u2019t you think tucker? It\u2019s more of like a wedding experience.\" said by Ashley\n\"Experience.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah. And I think\u2013 I mean, I hope that the people on your guest list aren\u2019t wedding-ed out after all the events that we have planned. I mean, it\u2019s truly an extravaganza.\" said by Ashley\n\"Extravaganza. Truly.\" said by Tucker\n\"Jack, why don\u2019t we find a table closer to the music?\" said by Diane\n\"Excellent idea.\" said by Jack\n\"Bye.\" said by Ashley\n\"You\u2019re children, you know that, right? Worse than children.\" said by Abby\n\"It could have gone better. At least, now I know my sense of humor works better on his mother.\" said by Billy\n\"What happened?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, um, I did my best and, uh, he wasn\u2019t really having it. He used homework as an excuse, asked me to shut the door while I was on the other side of it. But he was very polite about it.\" said by Billy\n\"What do you think this is?\" said by Chelsea\n\"I don\u2019t know.\" said by Billy\n\"I don\u2019t think this is just the usual dark cloud that\u2019s gonna blow over. I really don\u2019T. I mean, why would it? Between my genetics and adam\u2019s weird self-loathing, me against the world thing, I mean, it\u2019s no wonder this kid wants to lock himself in his bedroom.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Okay. I\u2019ve known you for a long time. You\u2019ve been many things, but licensed physician, not one.\" said by Billy\n\"I\u2019m his mom.\" said by Chelsea\n\"I know. I get it. And as a parent, you think you know all the right answers. Best thing you can do is love him, continue to support him, and know that sometimes, a professional is the best person to ask about stuff like this.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah, you\u2019re right. You\u2019re right. I\u2019m just gonna tell him, \u201clisten, if you, you know, sprained your ankle, you\u2019d go see a doctor. Depending on your unique genetic makeup, some of us are more prone to sprained ankles than the rest of the world.\u201d\" said by Chelsea\n\"Look, the best thing he can do to take care of himself is allow the people that love him to help him.\" said by Billy\n\"And if sharon can\u2019t help, I will find someone who can.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Sounds like a plan.\" said by Billy\n\"You know, when faith was born, they told me she didn\u2019t make it. That never felt right to me. Sometimes, I could feel her out there, like my missing part needing me.\" said by Sharon\n\"Then, she was in your arms like cassie predicted.\" said by Nick\n\"Someone\u2019s been looking out for her. She has a guardian angel.\" said by Sharon\n\"She does. Everything about that girl is a miracle\" said by Nick\n\"From the very beginning. And that\u2019s not gonna end now.

I must say, it sounds intriguing.\" said by Tucker\n\"Really?\" said by Daniel\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Tucker\n\"What have you heard and from whom?\" said by Daniel\n\"Mm. Word around town, you know. Plus, I had an interesting conversation with your mom about it.\" said by Tucker\n\"Hmm. Yeah, well, my mom can\u2019t help but brag about my new idea.\" said by Daniel\n\"Mm.\" said by Tucker\n\"Still in the very early stages, though, so got to be protective of my intellectual property. I\u2019m sure if anyone can understand that, it\u2019s you.\" said by Daniel\n\"She didn\u2019t divulge any secrets or anything. But I did gather that you are looking for a new backer. So, as long as we\u2019re here, why don\u2019t you let me refill your coffee and \u2014 and make you a pitch as to why that backer should be me?\" said by Tucker\n\"Regina is a fireball. I told you she knows her stuff.\" said by Audra\n\"[ Chuckles ] And you. You said all the right things to get her on board with helping us to launch our showcast initiative.\" said by Nate\n\"You were pretty savvy, too, nailing a few of the key details that, you know, could be beneficial to newman media if the deal goes through. I think we just might have hooked her.\" said by Audra\n\"I got that sense, too.\" said by Nate\n\"Listen, I appreciate you giving me the chance to dive in like this.\" said by Audra\n\"Of course. That\u2019s the kind of collaboration I want to see around here. Speaking of which, I have a meeting now that I\u2019d like you to sit in on. It\u2019s with daniel romalotti. He has a new gaming concept that sounds like it might be promising.\" said by Nate\n\"Hey. I\u2019m a little early. Is that okay?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Of course. Of course. Come in.\" said by Nate\n\"Okay, great.\" said by Phyllis\n\"I asked my new coo, audra charles, to sit in on this pitch. Audra, this is phyllis summers, daniel romalotti\u2019s mother.

There was a time that that was my job, right? Make sure that your day ran smoothly.\" said by Billy\n\"Yes. When you were my coo.\" said by Lily\n\"That, too.\" said by Billy\n\"I know, chloe. I cannot believe that jill did that to us, either. I mean, we came all this way to meet her, and she just canceled on us with no explanation? I mean, who does that?\" said by Sally\n\"Sally, I\u2019ve been through this a few times. Is there a chance this is morning sickness?\" said by Nick\n\"I just didn\u2019t want to say anything until I was sure.\" said by Sally\n\"Are you sure?\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2019m pregnant.\" said by Sally\n\"[ Breathes deeply ]\" said by Sally\n\"S\u2019up?\" said by Sally\n\"S\u2019up?

Everything feels so right.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah.\" said by Diane\n\"What is that smile on your face all about?\" said by Jack\n\"[ Laughs ] Oh, I bet you can guess.\" said by Diane\n\"Yeah, probably the same thing that put a smile on my face this morning.\" said by Jack\n\"Mm. Wait, jack. We \u2014 we really shouldn\u2019T.\" said by Diane\n\"Good morning. Diane, you\u2019re here awfully early.\" said by Summer\n\"Because she spent the night\u2026again.\" said by Jack\n\"Really? Why? Are you still worried about mom\u2019s safety? Does that mean harrison\u2019s in danger also?\" said by Kyle\n\"No, no, nothing to worry about. Stark is still being held without bail. Our plan worked. We are all safe from that criminal.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, that\u2019s a relief.\" said by Kyle\n\"There\u2019s something the two of you should know.\" said by Jack\n\"Good news for a change, I hope?\" said by Kyle\n\"We think it is, yes. Hopefully you\u2019ll agree. Um, my relationship with diane has taken a turn\u2026 romantically speaking.\" said by Jack\n\"So, you were thinking of me here in L.A. And didn\u2019t want to send a text like a normal person?\" said by Sally\n\"Me? No way. I\u2019m old school. I wanted to hear your voice. In fact, I\u2019m so old school, I\u2019m calling you from a rotary phone built in 1973.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Laughs ]\" said by Sally\n\"Hey, what\u2019s that groan about? Is that because of the joke, or are you still having morning sickness?\" said by Nick\n\"A little of both.\" said by Sally\n\"You okay?\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah. I\u2019m actually doing better than last week. I\u2019m just a little shaky this morning.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, you might also just be a little nervous because you\u2019re meeting with jill. Sally, you and chloe \u2014 you\u2019re prepared. You\u2019re going to kill it.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah. We\u2019ve been working hard. Uh\u2026I\u2019m just a little distracted. I\u2019m sure you are, too.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah. It\u2019s, uh \u2014 it\u2019s been on my mind a lot.\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2019m sorry.\" said by Sally\n\"For what?\" said by Nick\n\"Well, I feel like i just dropped this huge news on you and then I just a minute later jumped on a plane to california.\" said by Sally\n\"No, I don\u2019t want you to worry about that, alright? You\u2019re the one who has a lot on your plate right now. Speaking of which, are you eating healthy?\" said by Nick\n\"Yes.\" said by Sally\n\"Okay. Also getting a lot of rest, drinking water, taking your vitamins?\" said by Nick\n\"Yes, yes, and yes, dr. Newman.\" said by Sally\n\"Good \u2014 \u2019cause that\u2019s all you should be worrying about right now, is taking care of yourself and the baby.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, is that all I have to worry about?\" said by Sally\n\"Well, the baby and your meeting with jill.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Sally\n\"Uh, well, you know, daniel and I are partners. Um, he\u2019s the creative, and i handle all business matters. Um, so I\u2019m just here as, um, the advance team, um, here to gauge interest.\" said by Phyllis\n\"I see.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah. And if this goes well and you are, in fact, interested, I\u2019ll set up a meeting with daniel.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Okay.\" said by Nate\n\"Okay?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Proceed.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah. Okay. Well\u2026how do I start? My son has created a new gaming platform. It\u2019s, uh, innovative. It\u2019s obviously creative. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s gonna change gaming, quite honestly. And it has the potential to be incredibly lucrative. It appeals to adults and young people alike. Not only that \u2014 it is emotionally and psychologically productive.\" said by Phyllis\n\"I sense a mother\u2019s pride.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, I mean, of course, but, I mean, you know I\u2019m a gamer, right? So I know when something works and when something is good. I mean, I wouldn\u2019t be here if i wasn\u2019t passionate about this project.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Well, your enthusiasm is contagious.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, thank you. Thank you. Well, it is a game changer, pun intended.\" said by Phyllis\n\"[ Chuckles ] I get it. And I love what I hear.\" said by Nate\n\"If this is as good as you say it is, I\u2019m guessing there are other corporations interested. Are we the first to hear this pitch, or are you trying to start a bidding war?\" said by Audra\n\"Are you really serious about this?\" said by Daniel\n\"I wouldn\u2019t be sitting here with you wasting my time or yours if I wasn\u2019T.\" said by Tucker\n\"Do you know any of the details about my project?\" said by Daniel\n\"I know enough. And I\u2019m pretty sure mccall is a match in a lot of ways. Why don\u2019t you tell me more about what you\u2019re looking for?\" said by Tucker\n\"Deep pockets, creative freedom.\" said by Daniel\n\"Of course.\" said by Tucker\n\"But you obviously heard enough from your conversation with my mother to be interested already. So, why don\u2019t we just skip to the part where you dazzle me? I\u2019d like to thank our sponsor liberty mutual.\" said by Daniel\n\"You both know how the gaming field works, right? Usually when there\u2019s a lot of interest about a project, yeah, people talk and it becomes a hot commodity. So, that\u2019s why I came to you. I, you know, just wanted to make sure that you wanted in quickly, on the ground floor.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Well, look, um, I pride myself on being bold and decisive, but before I can make a move on an investment of this magnitude, I would have to have further discussions with daniel involved.\" said by Nate\n\"I agree with nate. I would like to hear from someone other than the creative\u2019s proud mother before making an investment.\" said by Audra\n\"Great. Well, I will set up a meeting with daniel, but that\u2019s why I\u2019m here. He\u2019s the creative, and creative geniuses \u2014 they need their energy and their time protected. And that\u2019s what I do. I protect him, so\u2026 well, if there\u2019s truly interest in daniel\u2019s project, then I will set up a meeting with him. Thank you for your time.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Thank you, phyllis.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah.\" said by Phyllis\n\"I like what I heard. But I get the feeling you\u2019re somewhat reticent.\" said by Nate\n\"I heard that you got the venture set up at chancellor-winters, but that phyllis has also pitched it to newman. If creative control is what you\u2019re after, both those companies are a very bad fit.\" said by Tucker\n\"How would you know that?\" said by Daniel\n\"I know how the newmans work. And I know jill very well. So, if you think you\u2019re gonna have any autonomy at either of those places, think again. I, on the other hand \u2014 I know how you\u2019re feeling. I know \u2014 I know the hunger and the drive you have. I know what it\u2019s like to build something from nothing \u2019cause I\u2019ve lived that. There\u2019s a sense of ownership, that it\u2019s hard to let go of, right?\" said by Tucker\n\"Mm. Well, this is more than, you know, just being about ownership or ego. My platform isn\u2019t just a game. It has a bolder mission to transform people\u2019s lives.\" said by Daniel\n\"Terrific. As someone whose, uh, spiritual soul was reborn at an ashram, I can get behind any platform that\u2019s, uh, life-affirming, as well as entertaining and, uh, lucrative. Hey, I got to tell you, I did a little research on you. Um, it\u2019s led to a couple assumptions.\" said by Tucker\n\"Like what?\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, I know that your partner and daughter are now living in portugal. Is that right?\" said by Tucker\n\"That\u2019s right.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah.\" said by Tucker\n\"I\u2019m not really sure how details of my personal life are really any of your business. But you know what? You want to know what I\u2019m looking for in a corporate partner? It\u2019s, um\u2026 it\u2019s one who doesn\u2019t pry where he\u2019s not welcome.\" said by Daniel\n\"You know, if chloe and I make a deal with chancellor-winters, I might have to move out here.\" said by Sally\n\"[ Sighs ] Really?\" said by Nick\n\"I mean, it\u2019s a possibility. How would you feel about that?\" said by Sally\n\"Um, I guess the, uh \u2014 the bigger question is, how would you feel about that? Could you live there again?\" said by Nick\n\"I mean, it\u2019s nice when the sun is shining. And it\u2019s always shining. It\u2019s vibrant and exciting. It might be the best thing for me, professionally.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, if that is the best thing for you, sally, then, um\u2026we\u2019ll make it work.\" said by Nick\n\"So, you would support me if I had to pack up and move back to california?\" said by Sally\n\"I would.\" said by Nick\n\"But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves, alright? You and chloe still need to make your pitch, and then we will take it from there. But whatever happens, I will support your decision. We\u2019re gonna make this work, sally.\" said by Nick\n\"You\u2019re right. Yeah. We will make it work.\" said by Sally\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2019ve been thinking about you. How did everything go with devon?\" said by Billy\n\"Well, I would love nothing more than to talk shop with you\u2026\" said by Lily\n\"Ah, yeah.\" said by Billy\n\"\u2026\u2019Cause I really miss those days. But I think I shared a little more than I should have.\" said by Lily\n\"You always led with integrity. Just one of the things that i admire about you.\" said by Billy\n\"How are you? Have you figured out your next life move?\" said by Lily\n\"No. No. But that shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to you. Although I do have a few ideas that I miss running by you, too.\" said by Billy\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Lily\n\"What do you say? You want to grab coffee? We can talk about anything but chancellor-winters. That\u2019s me before dawn powerwash.\" said by Billy\n\"I would love to. I \u2014 I really would. But I have such a crazy day ahead of me.\" said by Lily\n\"Hey, it\u2019s okay. No problem.\" said by Billy\n\"But thank you for helping me with my coat.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s what I\u2019m worried about. I\u2019m actually gonna steer clear of my mother right now. I don\u2019t feel like putting myself in the line of fire.\" said by Billy\n\"I hope you know that nothing I\u2019m dealing with at chancellor winters is because of you.\" said by Lily\n\"Thank you. Appreciate that. And I\u2019m sorry about everything you\u2019re going through. But I do know that you\u2019ll figure it out.\" said by Billy\n\"Thank you. I hope you find what you\u2019re looking for, too. Bye.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah. Bye.\" said by Billy\n\"How do you feel about this? I know there\u2019s been a lot going on around here, and, well, this is another change to take in.\" said by Diane\n\"We wondered if this might be coming. We\u2019ve seen the signs of the two of you growing closer, but to be honest, we never thought it would actually happen.\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, it kind of took us by surprise, as well. Look, I-I want you to know this was not my intention. I came back to town solely for the purpose of connecting with you. I mean, I never expected jack to forgive me for the past. But, kyle, you know more than anyone what a special man your father is. And I\u2019m beyond grateful that he was able to appreciate the changes that I\u2019ve made in my life, changes I\u2019ve made for you.\" said by Diane\n\"Look, it may be premature to analyze all this right now, but I thought it was very important that you and summer both know. The last thing I want is for diane to feel she has to sneak around. She\u2019s every bit as welcome here as you are. She\u2019s family.\" said by Jack\n\"I-I don\u2019t know how i feel about all this. So I apologize if I\u2019m not ready to fully embrace the idea of the two of you being back together. But you two seem happy. And of course I\u2019m all for that.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019d like to think you could be pleased for us. That\u2019s all I can ask. Oh, and to your point \u2014 yes, we are very happy.\" said by Jack\n\"Okay. Well, um, kyle and I actually have to get going. We\u2019ve got that, um, breakfast meeting that we\u2019ve got to get to, remember?\" said by Summer\n\"Right, right. Um\u2026 we\u2019ll see you later.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Sighs ] I don\u2019t think kyle was very pleased at all.\" said by Diane\n\"Daniel already has his project set up at chancellor-winters. I wasn\u2019t privy to the details of the deal since it wasn\u2019t pertaining directly to the ipo, but lily and devon talked of plans of building an entire gaming division around his idea.\" said by Audra\n\"Then why is phyllis coming to us?\" said by Nate\n\"[ Scoffs ] It doesn\u2019t make any sense. Unless, you know, she and daniel are double-crossing lily and devon or trying to inflate their offer with a counteroffer.\" said by Audra\n\"Or\u2026things are in flux at chancellor-winters. I\u2019ve heard enough to be interested, but I don\u2019t want to waste my time on it if we\u2019re being used in some sort of chess match.\" said by Nate\n\"And I have to wonder about phyllis\u2019 involvement. She strikes me as a bit of a loose cannon. But whatever it is, I am confident we can get to the bottom of this.\" said by Audra\n\"If you feel i overstepped, I apologize. I certainly didn\u2019t mean to be intrusive by looking into your personal life. I just feel like it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s important to understand the whole person, you know, their state of mind, especially people that I might be doing business with.\" said by Tucker\n\"And you think by digging up dirt on my family, you can do that?\" said by Daniel\n\"[ Clears throat ] Well, I\u2019ve come to believe that it\u2019s nearly impossible, if not impossible, to separate the personal from the professional. And so, given your circumstances with your family, um, there\u2019s bound to be some sadness and some feelings of loss. So, that might affect your decision making. But, hey, I\u2019ve been alienated from family, as well. And, uh, unfortunately, it was due to my own actions. But I know that, at the same time, that pain you feel from the past can be a strong motivator to set things right. Really, all I\u2019m saying is I can tell that, for you, this venture is not about money. It\u2019s not about subscriptions. It\u2019s about trying to do something meaningful, important for you and your family, and showing to them that you can learn from your mistakes. And that\u2019s \u2014 pfft. That\u2019s what I am all about these days. So I would like to help you achieve that goal. I think together we could really achieve something meaningful.\" said by Tucker\n\"Hello.\" said by Lily\n\"Hello.\" said by Tucker\n\"Sorry to interrupt. I just \u2014 I happened to hear your not-so-subtle pitch. Well, I\u2019m sorry to disappoint you. I don\u2019t know if you knew this, but daniel\u2019s actually under a contract with me. Trelegy for copd.\" said by Lily\n\"Thanks. Two coffees, please. I\u2019ve got to admit, I was pretty thrown, even more than I let on.\" said by Kyle\n\"[ Sighs ] I guess my mom was right. Diane\u2019s had her sights on jack all along.\" said by Summer\n\"You think my mom came back for him?\" said by Kyle\n\"No, of course not. She came back to reconnect with you. Her love for you and harrison isn\u2019t in question, but you got to admit, reuniting with jack is a perk.\" said by Summer\n\"I know, in theory, kids are supposed to want their parents to get back together, but given their history, i just \u2014 I can\u2019t root for that.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah, every time my parents reconnect, they end up crashing and burning. So I understand. On the other hand, diane is a bit of a step up from the last woman your dad fell for \u2014 sally spectra.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s an extremely low bar to clear. And my dad\u2019s way more invested in my mom. So, if things fall apart, he\u2019ll be devastated. I just wish they\u2019d kept things platonic.\" said by Kyle\n\"That would have been a lot more simple for everyone. I guess, even after all this time, they still have chemistry.\" said by Summer\n\"Maybe it was inevitable, given everything they\u2019ve been through since my mom came back to town, bonding over being parents and grandparents to working together to get rid of this threat with stark. I saw the signs, but, still, this is too fast.\" said by Kyle\n\"It\u2019s possible that the adrenaline from pulling off that caper against stark actually escalated things. There\u2019s nothing more intoxicating than a little danger.\" said by Summer\n\"You know, I just feel like I\u2019d already lost so much ground with kyle after this whole jeremy stark mess that he\u2019s become wary of my motives. I just get the feeling that he\u2019s afraid that I\u2019m going to hurt you again. And I hate that.\" said by Diane\n\"I just wish he could know I would never be standing here if I thought there was any chance of that.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, I want you to know that I would never do anything to drive you away again.\" said by Diane\n\"Oh, god \u2014\" said by Jack\n\"No, after everything I\u2019ve been through and \u2014 and all those years, I \u2014 I know what it\u2019s like to lose you. And kyle. To be alone. And I will \u2014 I will never put myself at risk for that again.\" said by Diane\n\"Hey, you two. Sorry to interrupt, but I was just hoping that you could clear something up for me.\" said by Billy\n\"What?\" said by Kyle\n\"Jeremy stark\u2019s arrest. How did that come about?\" said by ", "answer": "Billy"}

We\u2019re all just waiting for word on phyllis.\" said by Victoria\n\"Hey. How hard is it to track down an ambulance? Why don\u2019t you know where my wife is yet?\" said by Jeremy\n\"His wife?\" said by Summer\n\"The hell is he talking about?\" said by Daniel\n\"Stark, why are you referring to my mother as your wife?\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, we got married three days ago. Didn\u2019t phyllis tell you?\" said by Jeremy\n\"You\u2019re a liar.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, I shared the marriage license with the rest of the nonbelievers. Here you go.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Is this for real?\" said by Summer\n\"While you and daniel were at the hospital, he shared this charade with the rest of us.\" said by Michael\n\"Sorry, I forgot to tell you. There\u2019s been a lot going on.\" said by Kyle\n\"This makes no sense. I don\u2019t believe this.\" said by Summer\n\"Why is it that gcpd can\u2019t give timely updates? It\u2019s an ambulance. It\u2019s red. It has flashing lights. It can\u2019t be that hard.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Hey, there\u2019s enough anxiety in this room without you making it worse. Now, I have dispatched a team \u2014\" said by Chance\n\"Was my wife in that accident?! That\u2019s all I know want to know.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Okay, hey. Hey, hey. Enough with the \u201cmy wife\u201d stuff. Shut your mouth.\" said by Daniel\n\"Chance is right. You\u2019re just making this worse. You\u2019re enjoying this, aren\u2019t you?\" said by Summer\n\"Hardly. I\u2019m surprised that phyllis didn\u2019t fill you in on such wonderful news. But then again, you haven\u2019t been on speaking terms with her lately, have you?\" said by Jeremy\n\"Hey, daniel, daniel.\" said by Danny\n\"Whoa, whoa, whoa, no.\" said by Kyle\n\"He\u2019s not worth it. Let it go. Let it go.\" said by Danny\n\"You got that right. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on here, but my mother would never marry a lowlife like you, not of her own free will.\" said by Daniel\n\"And she wouldn\u2019t have hid it from us either. I don\u2019t care what you say. \u2013 Bedtime!! \u2013 Bedtime.\" said by Summer\n\"J.T. Hellstrom. Wow. There\u2019s a blast from the past. Why do you want to find him?\" said by Tucker\n\"I take it you know each other?\" said by Audra\n\"Very well. He used to work for me.\" said by Tucker\n\"Interesting.\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah. He pleaded guilty to attempted murder of victor newman. Went to prison for it. What do you want with him?\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, I find mr. Hellstrom\u2019s case fascinating.\" said by Audra\n\"His criminal case?\" said by Tucker\n\"Medical. He suffered a brain tumor that altered his personality and led him to violence. I\u2019d love to feature him on a medical podcast hosted by dr. Elena dawson. It\u2019d be a surefire hit.\" said by Audra\n\"Well\u2026 [ Sighs ] I just realized that anything featuring J.T. Would have a profound effect on victoria. He attacked her, too, you know.\" said by Tucker\n\"I do know that. And again, it was a tumor that made him act that way. Before that, it was a love story for the ages. Compelling, no?\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah, but she\u2019s your boss. It just seems to me that victoria would prefer not to have that chapter of her past on the internet in perpetuity. Not to mention victor and nikki. Have you thought about their reaction?\" said by Tucker\n\"Of course.\" said by Audra\n\"I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know, you got this good thing going in newman media. Why would you do anything to jeopardize it?\" said by Tucker\n\"I assure you, I\u2019ve thought of everything.\" said by Audra\n\"Hey.\" said by Nick\n\"Dad, thank god.\" said by Summer\n\"I got your text about the ambulance crashing. Your mom marrying stark? How is that even possible?\" said by Nick\n\"I have no idea, but I\u2019m convinced that she is in serious danger. I mean, there\u2019s got to be some sort of connection.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah, I agree.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Sighs ] I\u2019m just glad that you\u2019re here.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, there was no point waiting at the hospital. I needed to be here with you if news came in.\" said by Nick\n\"Mom wasn\u2019t in that accident. S-she wasn\u2019t, and somebody should be at the hospital because that ambulance is going to arrive there are any minute.\" said by Summer\n\"Look, there are lots of doctors there to care for her if it does.\" said by Nick\n\"When it does. When.\" said by Summer\n\"So there\u2019s no new information?\" said by Nick\n\"No. Nothing.\" said by Daniel\n\"What the hell is going on?\" said by Nick\n\"Okay, you two are besties with phyllis. What did you think of her rant at diane before she collapsed? What could have provoked it?\" said by Leanna\n\"You know what? Get away from us, leanna, alright?\" said by Lauren\n\"Okay. You want a quote on the record?\" said by Michael\n\"Yeah.\" said by Leanna\n\"Write this down \u2014 \u201cno comment.\u201d\" said by Michael\n\"You okay?\" said by Kyle\n\"Oh, yeah, I-I\u2019m fine. How was summer doing?\" said by Diane\n\"Holding on to hope. I was glad to see nick return. She needs him.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah. You know, I-I\u2019m thinking that maybe I should leave and just wait for everybody at the house.\" said by Diane\n\"Why?\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, everyone here is really concerned about phyllis, understandably so. But after all those hateful things that she and jeremy said to me, I just don\u2019t want to cause any more pain by being here.\" said by Diane\n\"Mom, none of this is your fault. Don\u2019t let his lies drive you away. My dad and summer need your support right now. And so do I.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019m so sorry, jack. This must be really hard for you. As frustrating as phyllis can be, I know there\u2019s all this history.\" said by Traci\n\"Yeah, there is. I\u2019m also worried about summer and daniel and diane.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, darling, talk to me.\" said by Leanna\n\"I don\u2019t think so.\" said by Jack\n\"Phyllis and diane \u2014 a feud that\u2019s been going on for years, over you, mostly.\" said by Leanna\n\"Alright, that\u2019s enough. Stop badgering these people. Don\u2019t you have a shred of human decency?\" said by Traci\n\"What kind of a question is that?\" said by Leanna\n\"The last one you\u2019re going to hear before you\u2019re marched out the door.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, my gosh. Why is everyone so rude? I\u2019m just doing my job.\" said by Leanna\n\"Find different work. Nexgard is the flea and tick protection\" said by Jack\n\"I want that woman out of here.\" said by Victor\n\"I\u2019ll take care of it.\" said by Nick\n\"Thank you, son.\" said by Victor\n\"Look, you know what? It\u2019s been quite a night. We could all use some rest. Why don\u2019t we take off?\" said by Victoria\n\"No, sweetheart, i want to know \u2014 I want to know exactly what happened. I want to be here for summer.\" said by Victor\n\"Darling, can\u2019t you put your team on that?\" said by Nikki\n\"I sent someone there. They\u2019re going to report back to me, okay? Just be patient.\" said by Victor\n\"[ Sighs ] Well, rest does sound tempting, but I want to stay here for summer\u2019s sake.\" said by Nikki\n\"Well, I\u2019m going to be here. I think vic has the right idea. You all should go home.\" said by Nick\n\"Thank you. Yes. All we can do now is wait, and we don\u2019t have to do that here.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s late, and I promise you, I will keep you updated.\" said by Nick\n\"Thank you, son.\" said by Victor\n\"Mom?\" said by Nick\n\"I guess I\u2019m outnumbered.\" said by Nikki\n\"Yes.\" said by Victor\n\"You\u2019ve had enough stress for one day. So\u2026 will you call me if anything happens?\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, my darling. We\u2019re going to head home. If there is anything that your grandfather and I can do for you.\" said by Nikki\n\"You\u2019re just a phone call away.\" said by Summer\n\"Yes, that\u2019s right.\" said by Nikki\n\"Yes.\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m praying for a positive outcome.\" said by Nikki\n\"We all are.\" said by Victoria\n\"Take care, okay? Daniel.\" said by Victor\n\"Thank you.\" said by Daniel\n\"I, uh \u2014 I guess I picked a bad night to forget my tissues.\" said by Diane\n\"Oh, here. That\u2019s what handkerchiefs are for.\" said by Jack\n\"Thank you.\" said by Diane\n\"Um, diane. Can I get you something? Would you like some water or tea?\" said by Traci\n\"No, no, I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m okay, traci. Kyle, honey, thank you for checking on me, but I \u2014 I know you want to be with your wife, as you should be.\" said by Diane\n\"Honey, I can stay here with your mom and dad. Summer needs you. You go ahead.\" said by Traci\n\"Thank you. I know she\u2019s terrified. I mean, phyllis has to be okay. She\u2019s caused a lot of grief for all of us, but this can\u2019t be how it ends, right?\" said by Kyle\n\"Jeremy stark. I\u2019m leanna love.\" said by Leanna\n\"I know who you are.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Oh. That streamlines things.\" said by Leanna\n\"What can I do for you?\" said by Jeremy\n\"I know this has been a very scary night for you, and I\u2019ll understand if you\u2019re too distraught to speak with me. But if you\u2019re up for a chat, I\u2019d like to hear more about your side of the story.\" said by Leanna\n\"Sure. Why not.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Oh. Okay, um, mind if I record this?\" said by Leanna\n\"Absolutely.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Fabulous.\" said by Leanna\n\"Time for you to leave.\" said by Nick\n\"Says who?\" said by Leanna\n\"Everyone in this room.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Scoffs ] Please.\" said by Leanna\n\"This is no longer a press event. This is a private family matter. Now you have two choices \u2014 you can either allow me to escort you out, or we\u2019ll get club security, and I promise you, I\u2019ll be far more of a gentleman.\" said by Nick\n\"Okay, fine. So much for genoa city being a welcoming place. I\u2019ll be in touch. I\u2019d, um, love to continue our conversation.\" said by Leanna\n\"Oh, we will.\" said by Jeremy\n\"I\u2019m so glad we stopped. I\u2019m too rattled to go home.\" said by Nikki\n\"I don\u2019t blame you one bit. What a shocking ending to an evening.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, I for one, am glad that you all agreed to call it a night, because that stark guy was starting to creep me out, hovering like a vulture.\" said by Victoria\n\"Really?\" said by Victor\n\"I am so sorry I even considered bringing that man to town. Although it was phyllis. It was her idea.\" said by Nikki\n\"We all have very complicated feelings about phyllis, but seeing her on the floor like that\u2026\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, I know. And se seemed so helpless. Nobody ever thinks that of her.\" said by Nikki\n\"Sweetheart, who i feel sorry for the most is summer.\" said by Victor\n\"Oh, I know. And poor daniel.\" said by Nikki\n\"I can only imagine how nicholas is feeling right now. I know they\u2019re not together anymore, but I know they still care about each other.\" said by Victoria\n\"If I could go back in time, I would never have urged phyllis to go after diane. It only escalated their conflict.\" said by Nikki\n\"Sweetheart.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, if my involvement in any way led to phyllis being in that ambulance tonight\u2026\" said by Nikki\n\"You can\u2019t blame yourself. Phyllis does what she wants to do. She always has. She doesn\u2019t care what anyone thinks.\" said by Victor\n\"What happened tonight was very unfortunate, but you\u2019re not responsible for any of it.\" said by Victoria\n\"I suspect your interest in J.T. Hellstrom has nothing whatsoever to do with his medical history.\" said by Tucker\n\"What makes you say that?\" said by Audra\n\"The hours I just spent watching you and victoria and elena vie for nate\u2019s attention.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, don\u2019t be ridiculous. Okay, I\u2019m the C.O.O. Of newman media. I live for content that draws ratings, and so does nate.\" said by Audra\n\"Okay. You\u2019re playing with fire.\" said by Tucker\n\"That never seemed to bother you.\" said by Audra\n\"Oh, so you admit it?\" said by Tucker\n\"Alright, honestly, you are reading too much into this.\" said by Audra\n\"So where is this, uh \u2014 this podcast going to take place, in J.T.\u2019S jail cell?\" said by Tucker\n\"He, uh \u2014 he was released early.\" said by Audra\n\"Was he really?\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah.\" said by Audra\n\"Oh. What, good behavior?\" said by Tucker\n\"That and, uh, the tumor. The parole board deemed it a mitigating circumstance.\" said by Audra\n\"That\u2019s convenient for you.\" said by Tucker\n\"Trouble is, I haven\u2019t been able to locate him. That\u2019s where you come in. You know, you know people who can find people. Will you help?\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah. I\u2019ll find him for you. It\u2019s going to cost you, though. My advice, in this one very specific case\" said by Tucker\n\"So you expect something in return if you\u2019re able to deliver J.T.?\" said by Audra\n\"\u201cDeliver?\u201d No, no, no. That\u2019s your problem. I\u2019ll just tell you where to find him.\" said by Tucker\n\"Fair enough. So my quid pro quo, what\u2019s it going to be?\" said by Audra\n\"I don\u2019t know. But you\u2019re going to have to consider yourself in my debt.\" said by Tucker\n\"And what, I\u2019m supposed to just agree to some unknown marker you can call in at any time? No, thanks. I\u2019ll find him myself.\" said by Audra\n\"Suit yourself. Even if I were able to track him down, I can\u2019t see him wanting to talk to you.\" said by Tucker\n\"Really? Why?\" said by Audra\n\"Some complete stranger shining a big, bright light on his past \u2014 you don\u2019t see a problem with that picture?\" said by Tucker\n\"I mean, you know him. I don\u2019T. I guess I\u2019ll just take my chances.\" said by Audra\n\"Although he might be willing to hear me out, considering our past. So\u2026 it might be useful after all.\" said by Tucker\n\"I\u2019m not so sure I like those two with their heads together.\" said by Victor\n\"Oh, well, they\u2019re old friends.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, why do I not find\" said by Nikki\n\"Now, you say nate vouches for her loyalty? But where in the world does a loyalty lie?\" said by Victor\n\"Wherever they lie, I haven\u2019t forgiven her for breaking noah\u2019s heart.\" said by Nikki\n\"Mom, you can\u2019t hold that against her. Relationships end. We don\u2019t know the whole story. Besides, it has nothing to do with her business instincts, which nate and I trust, with good reason.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay, well, I\u2019ll have to take your word for it.\" said by Nikki\n\"You know, she is the one who told tucker about our plans to acquire mccall, which galvanized him to some degree. That was your thought also, so you must be able to appreciate her level of gamesmanship.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah, that works both ways, especially when you\u2019re dealing with somebody like tucker.\" said by Nikki\n\"I am curious to learn more about that woman and her skill set.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, what do you want to know?\" said by Victoria\n\"Here you go.\" said by Nick\n\"Thank you. I saw you showing leanna the door.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah. She didn\u2019t need to be here anymore. It\u2019s just an added layer of stress.\" said by Nick\n\"Amen. How are you doing? Is there anything I can do to help? This situation with phyllis has got to be rough on you, too.\" said by Sharon\n\"The only thing that matters is daniel and summer.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah. I hear you. Phyllis and I have a complicated past.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, to say the least.\" said by Nick\n\"You know, there was a time when I wouldn\u2019t have felt the slightest pang if she\u2019d have dropped dead. And I think the feeling was mutual.\" said by Sharon\n\"That sounds about right.\" said by Nick\n\"We had a lot of reasons to hate each other. But, you know, when I was battling cancer, phyllis dropped the animosity overnight, and I don\u2019t know who was more surprised by that, her or me. But I\u2019m glad that phyllis found it in her heart to be friends to me when I really needed one.\" said by Sharon\n\"You two have come full circle.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, I guess we have. Because the last thing that I want to have happen tonight is for chance to give us terrible news. I want phyllis to be okay. But there\u2019s nothing we can do until we know everything. We have to just hope for the best.\" said by Sharon\n\"I just don\u2019t get it. I mean, how did this beautiful event turn into such a catastrophe? I feel like \u2014 I feel like I could have prevented this.\" said by Lauren\n\"How?\" said by Michael\n\"By continuing to make phyllis understand that this obsession she has with diane is just \u2014 it\u2019s no good for her.\" said by Lauren\n\"We asked her to back off. We warned her how many times?\" said by Michael\n\"I know, so many times. And now \u2014\" said by Lauren\n\"Listen to me. I have never met anyone more determined than phyllis. Nobody can take her down. I got a feeling in my gut we\u2019re going to hear good news soon.\" said by Michael\n\"Can you imagine how upset she\u2019s going to be when she finds out that we were worried?\" said by ", "answer": "Lauren"}
{"content": "\"And by bringing Jeremy the necklace, I proved my loyalty, as well as my desire to resume a life of crime with him \u2014 or so he believed.\" said by Diane\n\"How can you be so sure of what he was thinking? I mean, for all you knew, he was setting you up.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, because \u2014 how can I put this delicately? \u2014 Um, Jeremy also thought that we were going to reconnect physically, seal the deal. But I wasn\u2019t about to let that happen.\" said by Diane\n\"Yeah, I would sure as hell hope not.\" said by Kyle\n\"No, but it gave me a chance to get him out of the room to take a shower. And while he was in the bathroom, I planted the rest of the evidence that Jack had given me, and then I got out of there quickly.\" said by Diane\n\"So, when chance showed up to execute the search warrant, Diane was long gone, he found the necklace, he found the other things, and he was arrested.\" said by Jack\n\"Yes, which Jack and I arrived in time to see and enjoyed immensely.\" said by Diane\n\"And he turned them over to the very capable hands of the Chicago Police Department, and they will take it from there.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Sighs ] We are finally rid of that horrible man. You and Harrison \u2014 you have nothing to fear. We\u2019re safe. We can go back to our lives as normal.\" said by Diane\n\"I know you\u2019re expecting a pat on the back, but I\u2019m still not happy about how all this went down.\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, I\u2019ve explained to you \u2014\" said by Jack\n\"No, you changed the plan at the last second, adding a ton of risk.\" said by Kyle\n\"The risk of any complications at this point are very slim.\" said by Jack\n\"You hope.\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, now that Jeremy has violated his parole and committed this new crime, he will go back to prison.\" said by Diane\n\"Can you guarantee that? I mean, do we even know how good his lawyer is? What if he has a solid alibi for the time of the burglary?\" said by Summer\n\"It was still worth the risk. Look, I had to do this. Diane was continuing this charade with Stark and getting in more and more danger. Look, the only way this would work is if we moved fast. And we managed to protect the entire family.\" said by Jack\n\"[ Sighs ] You also broke more laws and you lied to the police. I\u2019m sorry, but are we really supposed to be happy about that?\" said by Summer\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Diane\n\"Is everything okay?\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah. Yeah. I\u2019m just thinking about a case. Nikki and Victor\u2019s apartment in Chicago was broken into.\" said by Chance\n\"[ Gasps ] What?\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah.\" said by Chance\n\"Is everyone okay?\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah. No one was there at the time. A necklace was taken, though.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, if this happened out of the state, why were you involved?\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, the perp is a man named Jeremy Stark. He\u2019s a paroled ex-con, and he has connections to certain people here in Genoa City, most notably Diane Jenkins.\" said by Chance\n\"[ Gasps ] You know, there\u2019s been a lot of speculation about what she was doing those years in California.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, because Stark was staying here, Chicago PD reached out for assistance. He\u2019s considered a flight risk, so they wanted him picked up ASAP. So I went to the hotel, searched his room, arrested him, and took him back to Chicago.\" said by Chance\n\"And when did this happen?\" said by Sharon\n\"Last night.\" said by Chance\n\"Did he have the necklace?\" said by Sharon\n\"Yep. Along with other evidence in the room that linked him to the crime.\" said by Chance\n\"Sounds pretty cut and dried.\" said by Sharon\n\"Doesn\u2019t it, though?\" said by Chance\n\"Except something\u2019s not sitting right with you.\" said by Sharon\n\"No, it\u2019s not.\" said by Chance\n\"Hey, son. I\u2019m looking for Kyle.\" said by Victor\n\"Why?\" said by Adam\n\"What do you mean, why? To finish the discussion about Summer and Harrison.\" said by Victor\n\"No, you\u2019re not.\" said by Adam\n\"What do you mean, I\u2019m not?\" said by Victor\n\"After I saw you at Society with your heads together, you already admitted that I was the topic du jour.\" said by Adam\n\"You were mentioned in passing, son.\" said by Victor\n\"You know, when we were talking, you actually said you were interested in how I\u2019m doing here at Jabot. So, why don\u2019t you level with me for once and just tell me what is really going on?\" said by Adam\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Sally\n\"Good morning!\" said by Chloe\n\"Mnh, no, it isn\u2019t.\" said by Sally\n\"Wow. This pregnancy is really laying you out today.\" said by Chloe\n\"Oh, my god. Morning sickness is no joke. Does everyone feels this bad?\" said by Sally\n\"I did. Every time. And I think with Bella, it was worse. But I got through it, and so will you, which is why I brought some tried-and-true remedies that worked for me when I was pregnant. And hopefully they\u2019ll get you back on your feet in time for this meeting with Jill so you look a little less\u2026green.\" said by Chloe\n\"Oh, my god, I cannot believe I feel this rotten, on today of all days. We\u2019ve been working so hard on this pitch.\" said by Sally\n\"You are tough. You can do this. I know you can.\" said by Chloe\n\"Hey, Sally, it\u2019s me!\" said by Nick\n\"[ Sighing ]\" said by Sally\n\"I know that Diane\u2019s been trying really hard to make a fresh start, so to have this guy show up from her past and threaten all that\u2026\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, Stark\u2019s a bad guy. There\u2019s no question there. I mean, the guy just got paroled after serving 6 years of a 10-year sentence for large-scale money laundering. He\u2019s never been charged with burglary, though. There we are.\" said by Chance\n\"So, it\u2019s his change in M.O. that\u2019s giving you pause?\" said by Sharon\n\"I mean, the pieces fit. You know, on paper, this is a solid arrest, and everybody in Chicago seems satisfied.\" said by Chance\n\"But you don\u2019t.\" said by Sharon\n\"I don\u2019t like how easily all this fell into place. I don\u2019t like that he only took one piece of jewelry, either.\" said by Chance\n\"You know, you\u2019re right. If you\u2019re gonna go to the trouble, why not haul off with everything you can carry?\" said by Sharon\n\"Exactly. And also, why Nikki Newman, hmm? What\u2019s the connection there?\" said by Chance\n\"She\u2019s wealthy and high-profile. Presumably, there\u2019d be a lot there worth stealing.\" said by Sharon\n\"On the way to Chicago, Stark was ranting the whole time about Diane and Jack Abbott. He said they framed him for something he didn\u2019t do to run him out of town. Now, normally, I wouldn\u2019t pay any attention to this, right? Every crook\u2019s innocent. Everyone\u2019s being framed. Everyone has an excuse. But there was something in this guy\u2019s voice. It was like a \u2014 a certain bitterness. I don\u2019t know. It just keeps eating away at me. On top of which, this whole thing feels contrived. It reminds me of when I was dealing with the Newmans after Locke\u2019s death. And everyone has an explanation for everything, all neat and pat.\" said by Chance\n\"I can understand why you\u2019re concerned. It does all sound a bit convenient.\" said by Sharon\n\"Hey, let\u2019s be honest here. Jeremy Stark was a genuine threat to all of us. We had to eradicate him from our lives as quickly as possible.\" said by Jack\n\"Assuming the charges stick. What if he posts bail and comes after Mom in retaliation?\" said by Kyle\n\"Wait. This is Nikki. I called her last night, asking her to talk with me. Please let me handle this.\" said by Jack\n\"Of course.\" said by Diane\n\"Hi, Nikki. Come on in.\" said by Jack\n\"Hi. I got your voicemail, but I thought I would just come on by.\" said by Nikki\n\"Hi.\" said by Summer\n\"What\u2019s going on?\" said by Nikki\n\"I assume you\u2019ve been apprized of what happened in Chicago?\" said by Jack\n\"Of course. Our housekeeper notified us as soon as she realized that my jewelry safe had been opened.\" said by Nikki\n\"Then I assume you also know that the man who broke into your apartment was Jeremy Stark.\" said by Jack\n\"No, I did not know that. Why on earth would he do that?\" said by Nikki\n\"I assume he planned to use the necklace to set Diane up.\" said by Jack\n\"Since he\u2019d somehow gotten it in his head that I had worked with the authorities to turn him in six years ago.\" said by Diane\n\"Well, I knew the Chicago police were following a lead, something about reading glasses being left behind. I did not know that it was tied to Stark. Or you, Diane.\" said by Nikki\n\"You know what? Um, we need to get to work.\" said by Summer\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Kyle\n\"Bye-bye.\" said by Nikki\n\"See you, Nikki.\" said by Kyle\n\"Okay.\" said by Nikki\n\"How is it you know so much about this?\" said by Nikki\n\"Diane and I went to speak with Stark just as chance was taking him into custody.\" said by Jack\n\"Huh. That\u2019s interesting timing. I mean, I have to say, I am very curious why a convicted felon would go all the way to Chicago to steal from me. Do the police have any theories about that? Because I certainly do.\" said by Nikki\n\"Nick. How you doing?\" said by Chloe\n\"I\u2019m good. How are you?\" said by Nick\n\"Just peachy. Um, what can I do for you this fine, beautiful morning?\" said by Chloe\n\"Well, I know you have your big pitch coming up, so I just wanted to come by and wish you both luck.\" said by Nick\n\"Hi.\" said by Nick\n\"Hey.\" said by Sally\n\"Uh, please don\u2019t take offense to this, but you\u2019re not looking your best.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Sighs ] None taken.\" said by Sally\n\"Is it your stomach bug again?\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, you know, that norovirus is going around. It\u2019s a real killer. Ugh, there have just been a few kids in Miles\u2019 class who have had it two or three times already.\" said by Chloe\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s what, uh, Christian\u2019s teacher said, too.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s probably just all the, um, junk food and late nights, you know, getting ready for the meeting.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, but I brought her a bunch of home remedies that should perk her right up. So, um, I think we got it covered. But it was very sweet of you to come by.\" said by Chloe\n\"What are your symptoms?\" said by Nick\n\"You know, I \u2014 I really don\u2019t mean to be rude, but, um, would the two of you mind taking off for a little bit? I really have to get ready.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah. So, uh, just pop an antihistamine and two of those ginger chews I gave you. And don\u2019t worry about today. I\u2019ve got everything dialed in for our pitch, and I will make sure to hit all of our selling points. You just need to get through this for just a very short time, okay?\" said by Chloe\n\"Yeah. I\u2019m on it.\" said by Sally\n\"Okay. Um, let\u2019s, uh, give the girl some space, yeah? Nick, you coming?\" said by Chloe\n\"Yeah, you, uh \u2014 you go ahead. I need to talk to Sally for a minute.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Sally\n\"Is there more to this bug than you\u2019re telling me?\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2019m sure you handled that arrest by the book.\" said by Sharon\n\"Oh, I absolutely did. But is that enough? I mean, what do I do now? Am I supposed to walk away and ignore my doubts, trust that the legal system\u2019s gonna do its job? I mean, is Stark gonna get a fair trial with an adequate defense in front of an impartial judge? I don\u2019t know. And the fact that I\u2019m even asking these questions is making me sick, Sharon. It makes me have a lot less respect for myself and my job.\" said by Chance\n\"Hmm. Well, I\u2019m sorry.\" said by Sharon\n\"It\u2019s bringing up all these things again, how I put this job above everything else at such a huge personal cost. You know, and it\u2019s \u2019cause I believe so much in what I\u2019m doing. At least, I used to.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, I hate to hear you talk like this.\" said by Sharon\n\"I hate it, too. But am I wrong?\" said by Chance\n\"You know, I\u2019ve seen a lot of rules bent and laws broken by people who I love and respect. And sometimes it was done for my own benefit. And I\u2019m no saint. But you\u2019ve worked with the legal system and government bureaucracies for a very long time. You know that compromises are made and that things are not always black and white, as much as you would like them to be. That\u2019s the reality that you\u2019ve had to internalize so that you can carry on doing your job, so you can carry on doing what you know is right. That\u2019s the only thing you can control. The rest of it is out of your hands.\" said by Sharon\n\"That\u2019s true.\" said by Chance\n\"You know, people change over the years. I\u2019m not the same person I was 20 years ago. You know, maybe you can no longer stuff down things that disturb you the way that you once were able to. And like you were saying the other day, maybe you\u2019re in a situation that you no longer want to be in. Only you can determine that.\" said by Sharon\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Chance\n\"If you were to consider changing things up, what do you suppose you would do?\" said by Sharon\n\"What, as in a job? Oh\u2026 no idea. My whole life has been public service \u2014 soldier, federal agent, detective. Never been outside that arena. Not sure what it would look like.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, maybe I could help you with that.\" said by Sharon\n\"The good news is Stark was arrested, and he had your necklace on him at the time.\" said by Jack\n\"How very lucky for you.\" said by Nikki\n\"Unfortunately, that necklace is now evidence, and I doubt the police are gonna be giving it back to you till after a trial, uh, presuming there is one.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, I don\u2019t care about the necklace. I\u2019m sure the authorities will keep it safe. I\u2019m just relieved that that horrible man is off the streets.\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh, believe me, Jeremy Stark\u2019s arrival in this town and the threat he posed were catastrophic. This could have been a lot worse than this.\" said by Jack\n\"Isn\u2019t it ironic that your misfortune turned out to save me? Imagine that.\" said by Diane\n\"I\u2019m here to talk to Kyle about Harrison, alright? He\u2019s part of the next generation of Newmans.\" said by Victor\n\"Mm-hmm. I have no doubt that you\u2019re already planning the kid\u2019s future. Are you hoping he\u2019ll stick to the program better than I did?\" said by Adam\n\"For your information, he is being given the same opportunities that you were.\" said by Victor\n\"[ Chuckles ] So, he\u2019ll succeed where I failed. Is that it?\" said by Adam\n\"Son, why does everything have to be an argument between us?\" said by Victor\n\"Look, I know that you hate that I am here at Jabot\u2026\" said by Adam\n\"Uh-huh.\" said by Victor\n\"\u2026Working for Jack.\" said by Adam\n\"Right.\" said by Victor\n\"And Kyle feels the same way. He would love it more than anything if I wasn\u2019t here. I know you also believe Jack only gave me this job to stick it to you.\" said by Adam\n\"You\u2019re correct about all the above. But I\u2019ve often told you \u2014 and don\u2019t ever forget it \u2014 that you are a very talented businessman.\" said by Victor\n\"And yet here you are. You\u2019re gathering intelligence. Are you hoping to hear that I\u2019m crashing and burning?\" said by Adam\n\"Son, what the hell are you doing here selling lipstick and makeup, for heaven\u2019s sake? What\u2019s the matter with you?\" said by Victor\n\"What are you trying to do? Are you trying to strong-arm Victoria into giving me some rinky-dink position so I can be under your thumb at Newman? It\u2019s not gonna happen, okay?\" said by Adam\n\"Hi, sweetheart.\" said by Victor\n\"Grandpa, hi.\" said by Summer\n\"Hello, Kyle.\" said by Victor\n\"Good to see you, sir.\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, before you start your day, would you give me a minute?\" said by Victor\n\"There\u2019s a lot riding on this pitch. I\u2019ve just been going really hard to get everything prepared.\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2019ve seen you deal with pressure before. Seems like a lot more than just nerves. And last night, you didn\u2019t want to have a drink with me.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, I mean, I already explained that. I just wanted to have a clear head this morning.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, but, uh, looking at you now\u2026\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, well, I kind of wish you wouldn\u2019t \u2019cause I know I look terrible.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, I like looking at you. Sally, I\u2019ve been through this a few times. Is there a chance this is morning sickness?\" said by Nick\n\"My stomach \u2014 it just won\u2019t quit. And then it does and I get cocky and I think I\u2019m fine and then it just happens all over again and I just\u2026 I\u2019m just really tired. I just didn\u2019t want to say anything until I was sure.\" said by Sally\n\"Are you sure?\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2019m pregnant.\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2019m sure there are all kinds of fields that you could explore. I mean, for instance, take all those quick, precision moves that you learned, you know, in the military. Just give them a little tweak, and soon you could be a \u2014 a dance instructor.\" said by Sharon\n\"[ Laughs ]\" said by Chance\n\"No, really!\" said by Sharon\n\"Nice. That was nice. Good job.\" said by Chance\n\"Or you know how you can drop from the ceiling on a wire? Cirque du Soleil would hire you in a heartbeat. And I can just see it now. You\u2019d be juggling a ping-pong ball and a sledgehammer and a chainsaw.\" said by Sharon\n\"Wow. Hmm. Would I have to wear sequins?\" said by Chance\n\"Well, yeah. I mean, otherwise no one in the back would be able to see you.\" said by Sharon\n\"No, that\u2019s where I draw the line. I can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t do it.\" said by Chance\n\"That\u2019s where you draw the line?\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, no sequins for me. [ Sighs ] Thank you.\" said by Chance\n\"For what?\" said by Sharon\n\"Making me laugh, distracting me. You are remarkably good at getting me out of my head.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, I\u2019m glad that you feel comfortable enough being silly with me.\" said by Sharon\n\"Mm, it\u2019s easy. It feels natural.\" said by Chance\n\"Sorry. It\u2019s Chicago PD. It\u2019s about Stark\u2019s arrest. I need to follow up on this. I, um\u2026 I wish I didn\u2019t have to leave, though.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, go. Take care of business. I\u2019ll be here thinking about all the new career paths you can consider.\" said by Sharon\n\"I cannot wait to hear what you come up with. See you.\" said by Chance\n\"How sad is this. Letting my father pull your strings. Oh, and making my life more difficult, just maybe take me down a peg or two.\" said by Adam\n\"I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about.\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m gonna wait for you inside.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, you must be proud. Husband does whatever Victor says.\" said by Adam\n\"[ Chuckles ] Sorry to deflate that massive ego of yours, but if you must know, Kyle is making Valentine\u2019s Day plans and he asked grandpa for a favor. So, thanks for ruining the mood.\" said by Summer\n\"I hope you\u2019re satisfied.\" said by Kyle\n\"Oh, poor you, Summer, you being dragged into the family machinations yet again.\" said by Adam\n\"So, why have you not returned my calls?\" said by Victor\n\"What puzzles me is how Stark got into our apartment so easily. I mean, there were no signs of a break-in. It was as if he knew the code to the alarm. And Victor and I haven\u2019t changed that alarm in years. In fact, now that I think about it, it\u2019s the same as when you and I spent time there.\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh, sounds like we have more company.\" said by Diane\n\"Excuse me. Chance. Uh, I assume you\u2019re here on official business?\" said by Jack\n\"I am.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, please come on in.\" said by Jack\n\"Good morning, Chance.\" said by Nikki\n\"Nikki.\" said by Chance\n\"I\u2019m glad I get to thank you in person for your work on my behalf last night.\" said by Nikki\n\"I\u2019m just doing my job.\" said by Chance\n\"And just so you know, Victor and I are definitely going to be changing our security system. We\u2019ll be upgrading it. I was just telling Jack that we haven\u2019t been very diligent in changing the codes. But I am very curious as to how Stark was able to figure it out.\" said by Nikki\n\"That is a very valid question.\" said by Chance\n\"I was gonna tell you. Obviously. I just\u2026 I didn\u2019t want to say anything yet.\" said by Sally\n\"I mean, that\u2019s some pretty big news. How do you feel about it?\" said by Nick\n\"Stunned, mostly. I mean, really, I\u2019m just trying to wrap my head around it, like, being pregnant and expecting a baby. I\u2019m just wondering how it all happened. I mean, obviously, I \u2014 I know how, but\u2026\" said by Sally\n\"[ Chuckles ] [ Sighs ] I\u2019m still not sure why you waited. I mean, why didn\u2019t you tell me about this before?\" said by Nick\n\"I see your paranoia is working overtime.\" said by Summer\n\"[ Scoffs ] It\u2019s a very nice cover story. Phyllis taught you well. But I happen to know what\u2019s going behind those closed doors has nothing to do with Valentine\u2019s Day or any kind of romantic surprise that Kyle\u2019s cooking up for you. See, dear old Dad \u2014 he wants to humiliate me, so he\u2019s capitalizing on Kyle\u2019s animosity for me.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, yeah? How exactly is he doing that?\" said by Summer\n\"By making it seem like they both want the same thing, by working together to give me the heave-ho, when in reality, Victor is manipulating Kyle. He\u2019s an expert at it.\" said by Adam\n\"I apologize for not getting back to you. My mother\u2019s been going through some serious issues the past couple days, so I\u2019ve been focused on that.\" said by Kyle\n\"Uh-huh. I bet that has something to do with that fellow Stark, right? Now, Kyle, when you became aware of the connection between your mother and Stark, that should have rung some alarm bells, right? You should have severed all ties with your mother. But I guess that\u2019s never easy when it comes to family, is it?\" said by Victor\n\"Do you have any theories on how Stark accessed the apartment? You know, did you find any fancy electronic gadget that he could have used to bypass the alarm?\" said by Nikki\n\"No, I didn\u2019t. I still can\u2019t explain it. Mr. Stark is still very loudly proclaiming his innocence.\" said by Chance\n\"Oh, pl\u2013 he is anything but innocent. He is a convicted criminal that can\u2019t be trusted.\" said by Jack\n\"You mean unlike the upstanding citizens of Genoa City who always play by the rules?\" said by Chance\n\"Well, I need to be going.\" said by Nikki\n\"I\u2019ll walk you out.\" said by Jack\n\"I\u2019ll keep you updated about your necklace.\" said by Chance\n\"Thank you.\" said by Nikki\n\"I wanted to come by here and tell you two that Jeremy Stark was arraigned this morning in Chicago. Now, given his previous conviction and his parole status, the fact another crime violates the terms of his release, and that he\u2019s considered a strong flight risk, the judge has denied bail.\" said by Chance\n\"Oh, thank god.\" said by Diane\n\"Yeah, Stark\u2019s a menacing guy, been involved in very high-stakes criminal activity. I mean, the guy\u2019s no amateur. Having been granted parole, he sure has a hell of a lot to lose. And that is why him breaking into an apartment, stealing a necklace, and being so careless about it just doesn\u2019t make sense to me. I mean, the guy left his reading glasses behind while committing grand larceny. Who does that?\" said by Chance\n\"I don\u2019t begin to know how his mind works.\" said by Jack\n\"Is there anything else that you need to tell me about this incident?\" said by Chance\n\"Well, I\u2019m sorry that you feel like things aren\u2019t as they should be, but I don\u2019t know how you think Diane or I could shed any more light on the situation.\" said by Jack\n\"So, you\u2019re saying you can\u2019t?\" said by Chance\n\"No, I\u2019m saying he repeatedly threatened her since he got to Genoa City. Thank god she had the courage to stand up to him. She wouldn\u2019t play his game, and I\u2019m sure that infuriated him.\" said by Jack\n\"It is my job as law enforcement to handle men like Stark, not people who think their wealth and their position give them carte blanche to maneuver any situation to their benefit.\" said by Chance\n\"Obviously, the Chicago police and the arraigning judge found everything aboveboard and are proceeding accordingly.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, Jack, that is how it looks. I\u2019ll see myself out. Thank you for your time.\" said by Chance\n\"Kyle, I understand your conflict, okay?\" said by ", "answer": "Victor"}
{"content": "\"We\u2019re focused strictly on work for now. I can only imagine how conflicted you must be, and I just want you to take time before you figure out what comes next.\" said by Victoria\n\"So, this is what traveling on a business trip alone looks like? Looks like it\u2019s been very productive.\" said by Elena\n\"Refill?\" said by Sharon\n\"Sure. Um, thanks, sharon.\" said by Nate\n\"Wasn\u2019t that a beautiful celebration of neil\u2019s life tonight? Just all the memories, the people gathering to honor him, and devon\u2019s mother made an appearance. That was a nice surprise.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah.\" said by Nate\n\"Okay. What\u2019s wrong?\" said by Sharon\n\"I wanna get back to what we had. Everything was so right. But we both have to be willing to try.\" said by Nate\n\"I came here to congratulate and support you. And I know I have to let go of my suspicions about your motives. And I want to believe that you\u2019re back on the right path.\" said by Elena\n\"I am. If you give me the opportunity, I\u2019ll show you. Let me prove to you I am still the man you fell in love with. Stop worrying. Okay? You will never lose me. I love you. Yes, I lost my way for a little while there. But now I am here, okay? The man you love is back. And yes, I\u2019ve been working hard, but I\u2019ve been doing that for us, for our future, together.\" said by Nate\n\"I wish we could stay like this forever. Just wrapped in each other\u2019s arms. Not worrying about what the next day might bring.\" said by Diane\n\"I will tell you your being home has made this day the best I\u2019ve had in a long time.\" said by Jack\n\"It\u2019s wonderful for me, too. Although, I drove our poor daughter-in-law from the house.\" said by Diane\n\"No, don\u2019t blame yourself. She was shocked to see you. She just needs time to process.\" said by Jack\n\"You know, if it would make things easier on her, I would move out. But, you know, my options are limited.\" said by Diane\n\"We\u2019ll find our way through this. I promise.\" said by Jack\n\"I hope kyle found her. And then we can convince her that we can all live under one roof. Happily might be a stretch, but civilly.\" said by Diane\n\"Oh, my god. What are you doing here?\" said by Ashley\n\"Summer, it\u2019s me. Uh, call or text me back. The way you ran off, it\u2019s got me worried.\" said by Kyle\n\"Hey, stranger.\" said by Mariah\n\"Hi.\" said by Kyle\n\"Hi, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m just here picking up takeout. But do you want to get a drink with me while I wait?\" said by Mariah\n\"I can\u2019t stay.\" said by Kyle\n\"I was just at neil\u2019s memorial and it was so beautiful. It was so moving. It really reminds you what\u2019s important in life, you know? Family. And now I can\u2019t wait to get back to mine. And because I am an excellent wife, I decided to stop by and pick up tessa\u2019s favorite spicy noodle bowl.\" said by Mariah\n\"That\u2019s sweet.\" said by Kyle\n\"And because I am an excellent friend, I\u2019m gonna stop talking now so you can tell me exactly what\u2019s going on with you.\" said by Mariah\n\"We can\u2019t tell people that mom is alive. That would destroy her.\" said by Summer\n\"No, it won\u2019T. We will help her get through whatever is ahead.\" said by Daniel\n\"What, like life in prison? Forever on the run? In hiding? No, until we have a plan that guarantees mom\u2019s safety, we can\u2019t risk announcing to the world that she didn\u2019t die.\" said by Summer\n\"It\u2019s the right thing to do, summer.\" said by Daniel\n\"What, because you say so? Why do you get to decide?\" said by Summer\n\"If you didn\u2019t want me to have a say in this, why did you tell me?\" said by Daniel\n\"Because the secret was too big for me. I had to tell you for my own sanity. And seeing you grieving like that, I\u2013 I couldn\u2019t take it, daniel. I had to tell you that mom was alive, but I am not gonna let you blow everything up. Strong enamel is your best defense\" said by Summer\n\"I know that you want to protect mom, but this isn\u2019t the way. We need to tell the truth.\" said by Daniel\n\"No, I\u2019m not gonna let you do that.\" said by Summer\n\"You can\u2019t really stop me, summer.\" said by Daniel\n\"Don\u2019t be so sure about that.\" said by Summer\n\"[ Sighs] I would prefer if we agreed that this was the right decision.\" said by Daniel\n\"It\u2019s not. Daniel, mom faked her own death. She framed diane and she killed stark. What if the police don\u2019t see that as self-defense and she goes to prison forever? Do you really want that on your head?\" said by Summer\n\"Of course not.\" said by Daniel\n\"Okay. We\u2019re gonna tell the truth. We will. We just need to figure out a way to keep mom safe first.\" said by Summer\n\"Sitting on a lie never solves anything. I was talking to lily earlier tonight\u2013\" said by Daniel\n\"You didn\u2019t say anything to her about this, did you?\" said by Summer\n\"No, of course, I didn\u2019t say anything to her. But something she said to me just really resonated. It\u2013 it was something about the decisions you make, the ones you can live with and the ones that you can\u2019T. I can\u2019t live with this secret, knowing how many people it\u2019s hurting.\" said by Daniel\n\"So, you\u2019re willing to jeopardize our mom\u2019s entire future because of\u2026 your conscience?\" said by Summer\n\"Yes, summer. My conscience. That thing that helps guide me through life and determining right from wrong.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, my god. Get over yourself. This isn\u2019t about you. This is about mom and what she needs and what she needs is us. We have to help her. We are the only chance she has at coming back home.\" said by Summer\n\"Look, I understand that you are angry about\u2013\" said by Daniel\n\"Oh, don\u2019t do that condescending big brother thing to me because it\u2019s not like you have all this wisdom. You blew up your own family, remember? So, what makes you think that you can make the smart, sensible choice in all of this\u2013\" said by Summer\n\"You\u2019re right, summer. You\u2019re right. I blew up my own family. You know why? \u2018Cause I was so damn busy worried about my own pain that I forgot to put heather and lucy first. But you know what, I fixed it and I learned from it.\" said by Daniel\n\"Wow. Good for you.\" said by Summer\n\"You really sound like mom, you know that? You really do. Let me ask you something. What\u2019s it like when kyle holds you in his arms and he\u2019s trying to comfort you because he thinks that you\u2019re grieving and he loves you.\" said by Daniel\n\"Don\u2019t do that.\" said by Summer\n\"No, no, no, no. And what\u2019s it like knowing how upset he is about his mother? His mother that he just started to rebuild a relationship with. How can you look him in the eyes knowing that you could take all that pain away? But instead, you just keep choosing to lie to him.\" said by Daniel\n\"Thanks, but I\u2019m good. I gotta go.\" said by Kyle\n\"No, no, no. The hell you are. Your life is a mess. I say that with love. But this thing that you\u2019re doing, kyle, this stiff upper lip thing, it\u2019s not good. You need to be able to get this out and not with another abbott. There\u2019s plenty of stiff upper lips in that family. So, spill.\" said by Mariah\n\"There is some good news. My mom got out on bail today.\" said by Kyle\n\"That is amazing. So, why don\u2019t you look happier? And why are you here instead of with diane?\" said by Mariah\n\"Well, summer walked in the front door, saw her, there was a confrontation, and she couldn\u2019t get out of the house fast enough. I\u2019ve been looking everywhere for her.\" said by Kyle\n\"Ah. Uh, well, I gotta say, I think that I\u2019m team summer on this one. It\u2019s gotta be hard living under the same roof as the person who was accused of killing your mom. Not that I think diane did it.\" said by Mariah\n\"No, my mom is innocent. Summer just can\u2019t see it. Even worse, I swear that when she looks at me, she doesn\u2019t see her husband, she sees the son of her mother\u2019s killer.\" said by Kyle\n\"As sure as you are of your mother\u2019s innocence, you have to understand that summer sees it differently. Her mom was killed. She is grieving and she\u2019s angry and she has to have a place to put all of this blame. And who better than the person that all of the evidence points to?\" said by Mariah\n\"No, I\u2013 I get why summer feels the way she does. But I don\u2019t know how much longer I can stand having my wife believe I am defending a murderer. Just the idea that she thinks that of me, it hurts like hell.\" said by Kyle\n\"How the hell did you get out of jail?\" said by Ashley\n\"Calm down, okay?\" said by Jack\n\"What\u2019d you do, jack? Did you dig a tunnel? Did you blow a hole in the wall?\" said by Ashley\n\"Don\u2019t be ridiculous, you knew this was a possibility.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, she\u2019s already got you committing grand larceny. What\u2019s a little jailbreak? Right?\" said by Ashley\n\"Would you keep your voice down? My grandson is with his nanny right now\u2013\" said by Jack\n\"You should be more concerned with exposing him to a murderer than the tone of my voice.\" said by Ashley\n\"This place is crazy, man.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah.\" said by Jack\n\"I heard you joined the household.\" said by Diane\n\"Yeah, the more the merrier, right, jack?\" said by Tucker\n\"I\u2019m finding it increasingly claustrophobic.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, I wonder why? You invite whoever you want to come live here. I can, too, right? At least my guest hasn\u2019t killed anybody, though.\" said by Ashley\n\"Tucker, I suppose a welcome is in order. And congratulations. You must have redeemed yourself if ashley\u2019s giving you another chance.\" said by Diane\n\"She has given me another chance.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, that\u2019s wonderful. You know, it\u2019s just great knowing that ashley has the same big, warm heart that her brother does.\" said by Diane\n\"So, how\u2019d you do it, jack? How did you manage to get this homicidal flight-risk fianc\u00e9e of yours out of jail? \u2013 \u201cBest thing I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\" said by Ashley\n\"Luckily for us, michael was able to get us another judge.\" said by Jack\n\"Uh-huh.\" said by Ashley\n\"One that leaned toward fairness.\" said by Jack\n\"Fairness? Or bribery? Because I can\u2019t imagine any judge letting her go. I mean, you\u2019ve gone on the run before.\" said by Ashley\n\"Why would I want to leave my home, when I have everything I could possibly want right here?\" said by Diane\n\"You had everything you could want before and you still walked away.\" said by Ashley\n\"That was a completely different situation and you know damn well.\" said by Jack\n\"So, what if she gets bored and she wants to leave again? It won\u2019t be just kyle who\u2019s left with a broken heart. It\u2019ll be you left holding the bag for a, what, seven-figure bail payment? Not to mention the fortune you\u2019re spending on her defense.\" said by Ashley\n\"Enough, ashley.\" said by Jack\n\"You\u2019re so quiet, diane. What\u2019s up with that?\" said by Ashley\n\"[ Sighs ] Ashley, I know you hate me, but we need to figure this out if we\u2019re going to be under the same roof.\" said by Diane\n\"Why don\u2019t you find your own roof? The two of you. Find something you can move into. A little love nest maybe. Let the rest of us live our lives in peace. No chaos.\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, trust me, I would love to be as far away from you as possible. But\u2026\" said by Diane\n\"Ankle monitor.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s a condition of my bail agreement. I\u2019m forbidden to leave the grounds.\" said by Diane\n\"You are both so disgusting and incredibly selfish. Can you imagine what damage you\u2019re doing to poor summer? You\u2019re forcing her to live with the woman who\u2019s charged with murdering her mother. Have you no shame? [ Sighs ]\" said by Ashley\n\"I can\u2019t imagine how hard this is for you and summer. But I know how much you love each other.\" said by Mariah\n\"What if love isn\u2019t enough?\" said by Kyle\n\"You\u2019re gonna find a way, you know, with\u2013 with patience and faith.\" said by Mariah\n\"No, patience isn\u2019t an option. I\u2019m losing summer a little bit more each day and talking isn\u2019t enough. I have to find proof that my mother is innocent. That is the only way I will get summer back. Even if I have to find the evidence myself, there is no way in hell I\u2019m losing my wife.\" said by Kyle\n\"I wish there was something I could do to help.\" said by Mariah\n\"You already have. By listening. Being a good friend.\" said by Kyle\n\"You know, earlier when I said that I was team summer, the truth is, I\u2019m just team love. So, I hope you find her and I hope you find the proof that you need to clear your mom.\" said by Mariah\n\"So do I.\" said by Kyle\n\"That isn\u2019t fair.\" said by Summer\n\"You\u2019re lying to him.\" said by Daniel\n\"Only until we can help mom.\" said by Summer\n\"[ Scoffs ] While we\u2019re waiting to help mom, his mom is rotting in a jail cell for something that she didn\u2019t do.\" said by Daniel\n\"Diane\u2019s out.\" said by Summer\n\"How? How is that possible?\" said by Daniel\n\"I don\u2019t know. Uh, michael did some sort of lawyer move, I guess. And she\u2019s home. So, see? Diane\u2019s okay.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah, but she\u2019s still charged with murder.\" said by Daniel\n\"For now. Only until we come up with a plan.\" said by Summer\n\"And you\u2019re okay with it? Even at the risk of losing your marriage?\" said by Daniel\n\"There\u2019s gotta be a way to protect everybody, including mom. And I know if we just have some time, we\u2019ll be able to find a way.\" said by Summer\n\"No, summer. Kyle deserves to know the truth. Mom is alive and diane is innocent.\" said by Daniel\n\"I saw you speaking with devon and lily earlier tonight. That must have been encouraging.\" said by Sharon\n\"In some ways it was. You know, for the first time in months I felt like I might have a real shot at reconciling with my family.\" said by Nate\n\"But?\" said by Sharon\n\"The tension. It\u2019s still there. And maybe it always will be. It\u2019s a reminder that success sometimes comes at a cost. But I won\u2019t apologize for being ambitious. I just didn\u2019t realize how much I\u2019d\u2013 I have to give up. Especially recently.\" said by Nate\n\"I\u2019m well acquainted with the difficulties of working at newman. Victoria puts in 110% and she expects everyone else at the company to do the same. And it makes it hard to find balance.\" said by Sharon\n\"It\u2019s more than the work itself. I haven\u2019t managed my priorities as well as I should have. And I\u2019ve made some real mistakes. And now my personal life is suffering as a consequence.\" said by Nate\n\"You came to the party alone tonight. Um, is everything okay with elena?\" said by Sharon\n\"Thank you so much.\" said by Mariah\n\"Hi. Can I get a whiskey, neat?\" said by Elena\n\"Hey, you.\" said by Mariah\n\"Hey.\" said by Elena\n\"I missed you at the party.\" said by Mariah\n\"What party?\" said by Elena\n\"Uh, the one for neil\u2019s celebration? I\u2019m surprised that nate didn\u2019t tell you.\" said by Mariah\n\"He was there?\" said by Elena\n\"Uh, yeah, the whole winters family showed.\" said by Mariah\n\"Hmm. Devon, lily, and nate. They actually got along?\" said by Elena\n\"Seemed to. No punches were thrown. I\u2019m surprised nate didn\u2019t tell you about it.\" said by Mariah\n\"Yeah. We\u2019re not really on speaking terms right now.\" said by Elena\n\"Speaking terms? What happened?\" said by Mariah\n\"You know, nate and his lies. I got played. I just really wanted to believe that nate was still the man that I loved.\" said by Elena\n\"I\u2019m so sorry.\" said by Mariah\n\"One day he\u2019s trying to take me on a romantic getaway. And the next, I learn that he\u2019s just manipulating me. Trying to keep me quiet. Well, I\u2019m done being quiet.\" said by Elena\n\"[ Sighs ] There you are.\" said by Kyle\n\"Did you talk to daniel?\" said by Summer\n\"Daniel? I haven\u2019t heard from him.\" said by Kyle\n\"How\u2019d you find me?\" said by Summer\n\"Looked all over town. And I\u2019m beginning to realize this is one of your favorite spots.\" said by Kyle\n\"You didn\u2019t have to go searching for me.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, but I did. You see, I\u2026 am crazy in love with you. So, I can\u2019t help but worry when you take off.\" said by Kyle\n\"I didn\u2019t mean to worry you. I just\u2026 ooh, I had to get out of that house.\" said by Summer\n\"The way you keep running away scares me.\" said by Kyle\n\"I love you.\" said by Summer\n\"What I said earlier\u2026 there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t tell me. You understand that, right? I know you want your space to grieve on your own terms. I have tried to honor that, but all I want to do is hold you and tell you everything is gonna be okay because we\u2019re in this together. So, please, talk to me, summer. Whatever it is, we\u2019ve got this.\" said by Kyle\n\"It\u2019s just\u2026 seeing diane at home like that, out on bail, it\u2019s just\u2013 it was the last thing I expected.\" said by Summer\n\"I wanted to give you a heads-up about that.\" said by Kyle\n\"I saw how happy you were that she\u2019s free. I\u2019m happy for you. But I can\u2019t\u2013 I can\u2019T\u2026\" said by Summer\n\"Hey, hey, hey, hey. You\u2019re upset mom\u2019s back in the house. I get that. But I swear we will find a way through it.\" said by Kyle\n\"What if that isn\u2019t possible? She found it.\" said by Summer\n\"Power and success. It\u2019s all nate cares about now. It\u2019s all about winning.\" said by Elena\n\"Oh, no. I can\u2019t believe that.\" said by Mariah\n\"Oh, believe it. And the part that kills me is that we worked so hard to get through things after he screwed over devon and lily at chancellor-winters. And I was the idiot who believed him when he said he wanted to change. That he wanted to be the compassionate man that I fell in love with.\" said by Elena\n\"Maybe this is just a phase.\" said by Mariah\n\"I don\u2019t think so. I think this is who nate is now. And I just have to accept it.\" said by Elena\n\"Are you really ready to do that?\" said by Mariah\n\"I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any coming back from this. Nate made a decision and now I have to make mine.\" said by Elena\n\"You\u2019re really good at this therapist gig. Spotted my issue right away.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, you were out tonight without the woman you love by your side. And now you\u2019re here alone with nothing but a sad face and a cup of coffee to keep you company. So, it doesn\u2019t take a professional to put those thoughts together. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through a rough patch.\" said by Sharon\n\"It\u2019s more than a rough patch, and it\u2019s all on me.\" said by Nate\n\"Why do you say that?\" said by Sharon\n\"I\u2019ve changed a lot since elena and I met.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, I imagine losing your ability to perform surgery had something to do with that.\" said by Sharon\n\"It does. I struggled to\u2013 to redefine myself. To find work I could be passionate about. Now, I found that passion and business. It\u2019s created\u2026 issues in our relationship.\" said by Nate\n\"Makes sense. You and elena bonded over your shared careers in medicine, now you\u2019ve lost that common ground.\" said by Sharon\n\"And it seems we\u2019ve been moving in different directions ever since.\" said by Nate\n\"Hmm. When you look in the mirror, do you like the man you see?\" said by Sharon\n\"Not tonight.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, in general?\" said by Sharon\n\"I do. I feel an excitement I haven\u2019t felt in a long time. I look forward to every day, every challenge. You know, in the past, uh, I could share my excitement with elena. She would encourage me. We encouraged each other. But now it\u2019S\u2026\" said by Nate\n\"How does that make you feel?\" said by Sharon\n\"I never resented elena. I love her too much. But, um, I hurt her, very deeply, and I feel terrible about it.\" said by Nate\n\"Look, summer, if it\u2019s too hard for you to be at the house, I understand. We don\u2019t have to be, we can go on a trip. It might be good for us all. Look, any place you want to. Back to milan. You love costa rica, and so did harrison. Any place you feel safe and can heal.\" said by Kyle\n\"That sounds good.\" said by Summer\n\"Then let\u2019s pack our bags.\" said by Kyle\n\"I can\u2019t\u2013 we can\u2019T. It\u2019s not fair to you. I know how important it is to you to be here for your mom.\" said by ", "answer": "Summer"}
{"content": "\"You know, you are upsetting my routine because I don\u2019t normally get back into bed after having my morning coffee.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh. The last thing I wanna be is a bad influence.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, I wouldn\u2019t\u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s bad. But now, it\u2019s time to attack the day. We have an empire to build, right?\" said by Victoria\n\"Mm. Sounds like you have a target in mind.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, I can\u2019t stop thinking about how fun it would be to obliterate adam\u2019s chances of succeeding at mccall before it even gets started.\" said by Victoria\n\"So, tell me about your plans.\" said by Victor\n\"I haven\u2019t decided yet between the fruit and granola or the, um, eggs benedict.\" said by Adam\n\"Son, this is no joke. I\u2019ve offered you an enormous opportunity. You have a chance to do a turnaround of a company that was run into the ground by tucker mccall.\" said by Victor\n\"Mm-hmm. Which is why I agreed to take control of it without interference.\" said by Adam\n\"This has nothing to do with my wanting to interfere. This has to do with the fact that I\u2019ve done turnarounds like this before. Why wouldn\u2019t you take advantage of my expertise?\" said by Victor\n\"Yeah.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, I am very proud of myself. I got connor to school on time without any drama over screen time.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Good job. You\u2019re a better parent than I am.\" said by Billy\n\"No.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Johnny was up an hour early playing away on that thing. I had to pry the controller out of his hands to get him out to school. Katie, dressed, ready to go, fully annoyed that were making her late.\" said by Billy\n\"Is it terrible that once I get through morning drop off, i just wanna blast the radio and sing at the top of my lungs?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Not at all. I think that should be a requirement. The only downside is that we\u2019re not in the car together singing the duet.\" said by Billy\n\"I know it sounds silly, but I missed you yesterday. It was the first day in a while we hadn\u2019t seen each other.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Yeah, I was gonna call you about half a dozen times, but I thought maybe you wanted a little bit of space.\" said by Billy\n\"No, I thought the same thing about you. But honestly, this is all the space I need.\" said by Chelsea\n\"I\u2019ve gotten pretty good at the flight from portugal. I was the first at baggage claim, and I even knew where you\u2019d be waiting for me before I even got your text.\" said by Lucy\n\"Yeah, you\u2019re growing up fast. Just wish you could stay my little princess forever.\" said by Daniel\n\"Dad. You\u2019ve been a little weird on our calls and texts lately. I know you miss phyllis. I do too.\" said by Lucy\n\"I have to tell you something and it\u2019s a little confusing. It\u2019s a little out there. I don\u2019t wanna upset you, but, um, you need to know. It\u2019s only fair.\" said by Daniel\n\"Has michael checked in yet?\" said by Diane\n\"Yeah, I spoke to michael last night. He\u2019s up to speed on what we found and figuring out how to handle it from his end.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. Chance will be here any minute.\" said by Kyle\n\"All right. And once the police confirm the dna evidence, then we can get christine to drop the charges.\" said by Diane\n\"We hope so. But we\u2019re going to have to be very patient.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, I just can\u2019t wait to lose this ankle monitor. I feel like I\u2019m dragging around a ball and chain.\" said by Diane\n\"I want these charges dropped. I want this nightmare to be over.\" said by Kyle\n\"I feel exactly the same way, but we\u2019re all going to have to allow for the possibility that this may not be enough.\" said by Jack\n\"What more could they need?\" said by Diane\n\"Hey, how are you doing?\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019m sure it must be hard to process this latest news.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s pretty overwhelming. When kyle told me that you found proof that my mom is alive, I didn\u2019t even know what to think.\" said by Summer\n\"I can\u2019t imagine what a shock it must be for you to realize what your mother\u2019s capable of. But please know I don\u2019t hold you responsible for any of it. You\u2019re an innocent victim here as well. My moderate to severe plaque psoriasis\u2026\" said by Diane\n\"Additional sponsorship provided by.\" said by Announcer\n\"Do you think I\u2019m callous for wanting to destroy adam\u2019s chances at mccall unlimited?\" said by Victoria\n\"Not at all. I know what he\u2019s capable of. I haven\u2019t forgotten how he tampered with victor\u2019s meds when your father was under my care.\" said by Nate\n\"So you don\u2019t blame me for wanting to put him in his place?\" said by Victoria\n\"It\u2019s ruthless. But I\u2019m finding that trait a necessary asset in my new career. But I do have to\u2013 I do have to wonder.\" said by Nate\n\"Yes?\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, now that I have a ringside seat to seeing how your mind works, did you have this planned all along? When you decided not to go after mccall and let victor and adam take it, just how many moves ahead are you in this game?\" said by Nate\n\"The how and why of acquiring mccall may have changed, but I\u2019ve always wanted that company. And yes, I do have concerns about what a battle over it might do to newman media.\" said by Victoria\n\"How so?\" said by Nate\n\"Well, mccall\u2019s greatest strengths are media and entertainment and that is the business that adam has the most experience with. So, he could be planning to build on that. And if it did come to an all-out war, he could focus all of mccall\u2019s assets and strengths on coming after newman media.\" said by Victoria\n\"I\u2019m not worried about that. If you wanna use newman media to wipe out mccall, I\u2019m right there with you.\" said by Nate\n\"You would do that for me?\" said by Victoria\n\"There\u2019s nothing I wouldn\u2019t do for you.\" said by Nate\n\"Dad, it seems like you have forgotten our arrangement. I wasn\u2019t kidding when I demanded autonomy.\" said by Adam\n\"Son, I\u2019m not looking to interfere, all right? I\u2019m simply offering you my help. Do you know how much someone would pay me for my advice in a situation like this? I\u2019m offering it to you for free.\" said by Victor\n\"Ooh, lucky me. I know your help comes with strings or ulterior motives and quite frankly, dad, I don\u2019t have the time or the energy to figure out your hidden agenda.\" said by Adam\n\"Son, stop the nonsense, okay? I have no hidden agenda. Are you forgetting how well you and I worked together when we built newman media?\" said by Victor\n\"Yes. And now that company\u2019s, uh, my main competitor.\" said by Adam\n\"Why? Mccall has many divisions that need rescuing.\" said by Victor\n\"Because it\u2019s a shadow of its former self due to mismanagement. So my first order of business is gonna be to refocus mccall and its original mission, which is entertainment and media. I\u2019m gonna sell off the rest and reinvest the capital into the core divisions and it\u2019s gonna be a strong competitor to newman media.\" said by Adam\n\"Why would you go up against newman media?\" said by Victor\n\"I know that you won\u2019t wanna hear this, but I see newman media as a threat to my success in mccall. So, you\u2019ve heard it from me first. Our old company is in my crosshairs.\" said by Adam\n\"I don\u2019t see myself as a victim.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, I just meant I\u2019m not putting you on the spot for an apology or anything.\" said by Diane\n\"What would i be sorry for?\" said by Summer\n\"Nothing. Nothing at all. You are not responsible for your mother\u2019s actions. And as far as frame jobs go, phyllis and jeremy\u2019s was terribly convincing. But now at least you know that I am not to blame for what happened to your mother.\" said by Diane\n\"You\u2019re obviously shaken up. It\u2019s a lot to process, but I can\u2019t help but think how lucky we are that you wanted to hold off on telling harrison.\" said by Kyle\n\"Absolutely. Thank god harrison didn\u2019t have to unnecessarily grieve phyllis\u2019s death and then hear this news and be totally confused. It\u2019s confusing enough for the rest of us. It would be devastating for him.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. Your mom instincts are right.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yes. I just can\u2019t wait for this to all be behind us. When is chance getting here?\" said by Diane\n\"Chance is coming here?\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah. He\u2019s stopped by last night and I was talking with michael.\" said by >>Ack\n\"I actually was here when he came by to see you last night. But I\u2013 I got rid of him as quickly as I could. I\u2013 I kept on hearing what daniel was saying about, uh, not involving the authorities until we can figure out a way to help my mom, but apparently, you changed your mind about that.\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, how else can we clear my name?\" said by Diane\n\"I\u2019m sorry. There might be charges against phyllis, but we can\u2019t protect her at diane\u2019s expense.\" said by Jack\n\"And you agree, I take it.\" said by Summer\n\"Shall we head to the office and take on the world?\" said by Nate\n\"Yes. I\u2019m looking forward to it. Almost as much as I\u2019m looking forward to our next night together.\" said by Victoria\n\"Both sound intoxicating.\" said by Nate\n\"Okay. I just need one more minute though.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay. Why don\u2019t I go on ahead? It\u2019s probably best if we head out separately.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, you wanna keep us a secret?\" said by Victoria\n\"No, not at all. I would just hate it if elena happened to be in the dining room and saw us together.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, that\u2019s really wise and sensitive. It\u2019s a good plan.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, I will see you at the office. And I\u2019m on board for whatever move you wanna make against mccall. In fact, I will come up with some ideas of my own.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, really?\" said by Victoria\n\"And we can have a strategy session later.\" said by Nate\n\"I love it when you talk strategy.\" said by Victoria\n\"Mm.\" said by Nate\n\"Jack is clearly overwhelmed by diane\u2019s case. Kyle and summer are basically out of commission, and yet jabot and marchetti still need to keep on chugging away, so I\u2019m there shoveling coal into the engine. You know, making sure it all keeps running.\" said by Billy\n\"Look at you. The stable one in your personal and professional lives.\" said by Chelsea\n\"I know, right? How did that happen? Sometimes, I don\u2019t even recognize myself. I look in the mirror and think, \u201cwho\u2019s that guy?\u201d\" said by Billy\n\"Mr. Reliable.\" said by Chelsea\n\"[ Laughs ] And yet nobody\u2019s gonna throw me a parade for keeping things going.\" said by Billy\n\"That\u2019s too bad.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Right? I love parades. It feels good though. You know, I\u2019m enjoying being good at my job again. And I\u2019m doing what I think my father would want me to do, protecting the family company. Stepping up in a crisis. It\u2019s good. Feels good.\" said by Billy\n\"I know what you mean. I\u2013 I have those moments working with daniel. Like my ideas and work ethic are valued and respected.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Daniel\u2019s a good guy, even if he\u2019s not my number one fan.\" said by Billy\n\"I know you two have had some issues, but he\u2019s pulled himself out of some rough times. I give him credit for that.\" said by Chelsea\n\"It\u2019s good. It\u2019s good for him.\" said by Billy\n\"Speaking of rough times, connor is so much less angry these days.\" said by Chelsea\n\"How can you tell?\" said by Billy\n\"Well, he\u2013 I don\u2019t know. I mean, we can have conversations that don\u2019t include what he wants to eat or when he is doing his homework.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Looks like we both deserve a pat on the back for making it through yet another day without screwing up too badly. By the way, you still owe me an embroidered pillow with that cute little saying that you promised.\" said by Billy\n\"I\u2019m on it.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Okay, I\u2019m waiting.\" said by Billy\n\"So you think phyllis is alive?\" said by Lucy\n\"I know how it sounds. No, I am not losing it.\" said by Daniel\n\"It just doesn\u2019t make any sense. Phyllis just flew to portugal to try and help us fix things.\" said by Lucy\n\"She did.\" said by Daniel\n\"Then why would she just turn around and pretend to die? She had to know that we\u2019d be devastated.\" said by Lucy\n\"I don\u2019t have a good answer for that.\" said by Daniel\n\"And she set someone up to take the blame for the murder? Dad, are you sure this is true?\" said by Lucy\n\"If you wanna talk to your aunt summer, you know, just to confirm that\u2013 that I\u2019m not imagining this.\" said by Daniel\n\"No. No, I believe you.\" said by Lucy\n\"Look, I know\u2026 I know this is hard to hear. And my mother, she has\u2026 she has a good heart. She just fell into a dark place.\" said by Daniel\n\"Like you did.\" said by Lucy\n\"Sort of. You know? But she spiraled a different way. And then this guy, jeremy stark, he took advantage of that. He took advantage of her. I mean, he\u2019s the one that forced her to do this crazy thing. And phyllis isn\u2019t blameless here, but you know, she never would\u2019ve done anything like this if she was in the right state of mind.\" said by Daniel\n\"So what happens next?\" said by Lucy\n\"That\u2019s a really good question.\" said by Daniel\n\"Thanks for coming.\" said by Kyle\n\"Sorry I missed you last night, chance.\" said by Jack\n\"Can I get you some coffee or tea?\" said by Diane\n\"Oh, I\u2019m good. Thank you.\" said by Chance\n\"I told them that we spoke last night briefly and that I had to excuse myself to attend to harrison.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah, we chatted briefly. Since you weren\u2019t here, jack, I figured whatever this new evidence was could wait \u2019til morning.\" said by Chance\n\"I wasn\u2019t aware you were here that long.\" said by Jack\n\"Or that you two spoke.\" said by Kyle\n\"It was before you told me about the new evidence, so I didn\u2019t know that chance was here for something so important.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, that is the big news I asked you here to discuss.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. So, uh, what is this new evidence?\" said by Chance\n\"This. We discovered jeremy stark booked a motel room after phyllis supposedly died. In that room, we found strands of red hair and had them compared and tested against strands of summer\u2019s hair. Dna tests say it\u2019s a match. The dna proves that phyllis was there, which means phyllis is alive.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, it\u2019s hair. It could have been there before stark checked in.\" said by Chance\n\"So phyllis stayed in the very same room beforehand.\" said by Jack\n\"Maybe she stayed there the night before she died to keep her marriage quiet. I mean, they were married. I got a license that proves that.\" said by Chance\n\"Believe me, this is not where stark and phyllis would honeymoon.\" said by Jack\n\"Hair, jack. It could have been on his clothing, his luggage\u2013\" said by Chance\n\"No, I found it in the drain. And why would stark go back there alone after phyllis died? He still had a room in town. Why would he need another? Especially this down-and-out motel? Unless it was a place for phyllis to hide. Look, this is the kinda place you would go if you wanted to disappear.\" said by Jack\n\"Sure. And, uh, you supposedly found this when?\" said by Chance\n\"Not supposedly.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yesterday.\" said by Jack\n\"And this motel room hasn\u2019t been cleaned since stark died.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, not well. But look, you can interview the cleaning staff all you want. There\u2019s something here, you have to admit.\" said by Jack\n\"Phyllis fooled everyone. She\u2019s alive and she\u2019s probably living it up somewhere laughing at her victory.\" said by Diane\n\"That\u2019s not true! That\u2019s not how daniel described her. He\u2013 he said that she\u2019s a wreck.\" said by Summer\n\"Regardless, this is proof that phyllis isn\u2019t dead.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, how do I know you got this from the motel room? How do I know you didn\u2019t pull this off phyllis\u2019s hairbrush? Surely, you knew this wasn\u2019t gonna be enough to clear her name.\" said by Chance\n\"But it should be enough for you to reopen the investigation. For you to do your job instead of having us do it for you.\" said by Kyle\n\"Can\u2019t you see what this horrible lie is doing to the people I love? To all of us?\" said by Diane\n\"Yeah, I see that. But I also see two people who are not above faking evidence.\" said by Chance\n\"When is phyllis coming back? I mean, she can\u2019t be on the run for the rest of her life.\" said by Lucy\n\"Well, we\u2019re doing our best to find her, bring her home so she can tell her side of everything.\" said by Daniel\n\"So you have to tell the police what she did?\" said by Lucy\n\"Yeah. I\u2019m afraid so.\" said by Daniel\n\"I\u2019m af\u2013 I\u2019m worried.\" said by Lucy\n\"Hey, we\u2019re gonna try and protect her.\" said by Daniel\n\"No, dad, I\u2019m worried about you. You have that look you had before back in savannah when things got bad. Like you\u2019re somewhere else.\" said by Lucy\n\"Honey, I appreciate that you\u2019re concerned, but the last thing I want is for you to be worried about me. I mean, no matter what, you\u2019re still the kid in this relationship. I promise you I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m gonna be okay. And I am nowhere else right now. I\u2019m right here with you.\" said by Daniel\n\"All right. Well, if I\u2019m gonna keep up with this mr. Responsible act, I gotta head back to the office. But not before I figure out when I get to see you again.\" said by Billy\n\"I volunteered to help out at connor\u2019s school for their big field trip. Dinner?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Dinner could work. Yeah. Katie has ballet. As long as you\u2019re not adverse to a crowd, we could have dinner with the boys.\" said by Billy\n\"Is katie gonna feel left out that she\u2019s never a part of any of these family dinners?\" said by Chelsea\n\"She is not, no. In fact, she takes any opportunity she can get to steer clear of johnny. And her parents, at this point. She\u2019s kind of at that age. Yeah. She just can\u2019t wait to get back to summer camp and be with her friends.\" said by Billy\n\"Okay, then. Dinner with the boys it is.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Okay.\" said by Billy\n\"Son, going after newman media is a big mistake.\" said by Victor\n\"Oh, yes. And here comes your wisdom and experience, um, whether I want it or not.\" said by Adam\n\"Let me put it this way. I have a feeling you\u2019re basing your decision making now on emotion. You are pissed off at your sister for getting rid of sally spectra and putting nate hastings in her\u2013 in her place.\" said by Victor\n\"No.\" said by Adam\n\"Let it go.\" said by Victor\n\"I disagree. It\u2019s a solid move.\" said by Adam\n\"It\u2019s a stupid move. Why don\u2019t you let me help you rebuild the entire company that mccall ran to the ground? How\u2019s that?\" said by Victor\n\"No. This is the right play to make, okay? Mccall\u2019s days as a big, fat conglomerate are over. The damage has been done. And I don\u2019t wanna throw good money at bad to try to fix it. But if I sell off the dead weight and I reinvest that capital to shore up our media businesses by going after newman media, we\u2019ll be unstoppable.\" said by Adam\n\"I am warning you.\" said by Victor\n\"And nothing you say is gonna stop me from taking this shot.\" said by Adam\n\"I am warning you. Newman media is a very strong, solid company. Lot of deep pockets. Do you understand? You\u2019ll knock out your teeth. Go after some smaller fish.\" said by Victor\n\"I\u2019m not interested in playing it safe. I\u2019m gonna squash newman media. Oh, and there is my competition now. But he doesn\u2019t have a gym bag with him. What\u2019s he doing at the club so early? \u2013 The company goes to the firstborn, audrey.\" said by Adam\n\"The young and the restless will continue.\" said by Announcer\n\"Hmm. Oh, I have a feeling nate wasn\u2019t here for a morning workout. And he definitely wasn\u2019t here for breakfast.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, yes. On his way to his office. I think you should do the same if you\u2019re serious about out-maneuvering newman media.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m gonna take any work cues from a neophyte like dr. Nate, but if that means that your advice session is over, I think I\u2019m gonna try the eggs benedict another time. Good chat.\" said by Adam\n\"All right, son. Hello, my darling.\" said by Victor\n\"Hello, dad. Good morning.\" said by ", "answer": "Victoria"}

The only thing you\u2019re gonna find at the bottom of that coffee cup is a case of the jitters.\" said by Lily\n\"Is it that obvious?\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, only to the trained eye.\" said by Lily\n\"Do you want a cup?\" said by Daniel\n\"Um, no, I\u2019m good. I\u2019m gonna be charged and centered.\" said by Lily\n\"Yoga?\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah. You wanna join me?\" said by Lily\n\"Would you, um, would you actually come up to my room for a minute? I gotta tell you something.\" said by Daniel\n\"Every slug leaves a trail. Where\u2019s your trail, stark? And will it help clear my name?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Summer, where are you sneaking off to and what\u2019s in all the bags?\" said by Diane\n\"Good morning, detective.\" said by Victor\n\"Morning.\" said by Chance\n\"How are you?\" said by Victor\n\"I\u2019m all right. How\u2019re you doing?\" said by Chance\n\"All right. You know, I often thought about our last few conversations and I now have a deep understanding of what happened between you and abby. So, if I said things to you that were hurtful, I apologize. You got every reason to raise a fist against me.\" said by Victor\n\"At you? I\u2019d be foolish to try.\" said by Chance\n\"Anyway, I think you\u2019re a good man. You do well. All right?\" said by Victor\n\"I appreciate that.\" said by Chance\n\"Okay. Before you go, let me ask you something else. The accusations against diane jenkins regarding the murder of phyllis summers, are they true?\" said by Victor\n\"I know this is not what you wanna hear, victor, but I am not at liberty to divulge any information about an open investigation.\" said by Chance\n\"So, this is your polite way of saying you won\u2019t keep me in the loop?\" said by Victor\n\"It\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying.\" said by Chance\n\"All right. Have a good day.\" said by Victor\n\"You too.\" said by Chance\n\"Nate. Very good. Have a seat, old boy.\" said by Victor\n\"Thank you.\" said by Nate\n\"What a beautiful day outside. Now, I\u2019m starving. What are you having?\" said by Victor\n\"Uh, just curious as to why I\u2019m here. Is this a meeting about newman media or is this a barbecue and I\u2019m what\u2019s on the grill?\" said by Nate\n\"Good morning, billy.\" said by Victoria\n\"Ooh, la, la! What do we have here? Who the heck are you?\" said by Billy\n\"Same me I\u2019ve always been.\" said by Victoria\n\"No, this is a decidedly different ms. Newman than I\u2019ve seen in a very long time. You got a little pep in your step.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, it could be the shoes. I had them flown in from milan.\" said by Victoria\n\"I noticed the shoes. It\u2019s not your shoes. No, this is\u2013\" said by Billy\n\"A woman on the top of her game. So, how\u2019s everything going at jabot?\" said by Victoria\n\"You\u2019re trying to change the subject and I can\u2019t let that happen because it\u2019s me.\" said by Billy\n\"You know, I was having such a lovely morning until I ran into you.\" said by Victoria\n\"Just tell me what I wanna know and I\u2019ll go away.\" said by Billy\n\"Quietly?\" said by Victoria\n\"You know me too well, just like I know you. So, this pep in your step, when do I get to meet the guy? I used to wait to run my dishwasher\" said by Billy\n\"Additional sponsorship provided by\u2026\" said by Announcer\n\"All right. As a matter of fact, yes, I am seeing someone.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, now, look at you. That\u2019s great. I\u2019m very happy to hear that.\" said by Billy\n\"Thank you.\" said by Victoria\n\"Look, you went through hell with he-who-shall-not-be-named. Those shenanigans are enough to put anyone off of love and romance. So, who is the guy?\" said by Billy\n\"It\u2019s nate hastings.\" said by Victoria\n\"That\u2019s funny. Same name as the guy who\u2019s living with elena dawson.\" said by Billy\n\"He\u2019s not anymore.\" said by Victoria\n\"I should hope not.\" said by Billy\n\"And before you say anything, billy, I have no intention of introducing him to the kids in the near future, so.\" said by Victoria\n\"I hadn\u2019t even gotten there yet, vic.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, what happened to all of your support? The \u201cway to go, victoria?\u201d Am I about to get a ticket from the billy abbott morality police?\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, um, I was just getting donations together for the clothing drive at the women\u2019s center.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, how charitable of you? I\u2013 I wish I would\u2019ve known. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a few things I could have added.\" said by Diane\n\"Well, they do it a few times a year, so. Uh, and this one actually is just for kids\u2019 clothes, so.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, I see.\" said by Diane\n\"I\u2019ll let you know next time.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, please do. You know, I wish I could go with you and help out. I\u2019m going crazy stuck in this house.\" said by Diane\n\"It\u2019s just as well, because I\u2013 I think I\u2019m gonna go for a long drive afterwards to clear my head, you know.\" said by Summer\n\"Of course. Summer, I don\u2019t mean to keep you.\" said by Diane\n\"What\u2019s up?\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re wondering what I\u2019m apologizing for, but I\u2019m sorry that my situation is causing so much stress between you and kyle.\" said by Diane\n\"Kyle and I are gonna be fine.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, just know that I want this case resolved as much as you do. More even.\" said by Diane\n\"I\u2019m sure that you do, diane.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah. And while I have my own issues with your mother and the horrible position that she\u2019s put us all in, especially you, I want you to know that I\u2013 I do still care for you. And I am here for you and kyle, whatever you need, just let me know.\" said by Diane\n\"Thanks.\" said by Summer\n\"Thank you for giving me a minute. I don\u2019t even know how to say this.\" said by Daniel\n\"That\u2019s okay. Is it about lucy?\" said by Lily\n\"No, she couldn\u2019t be better.\" said by Daniel\n\"Okay. Good. Is it work? And I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m asking as your friend, not your boss.\" said by Lily\n\"We are on schedule and under budget.\" said by Daniel\n\"Okay. Good. I love hearing that.\" said by Lily\n\"That\u2019s the one. Yeah. That whole general area right there.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah. What\u2019s going on?\" said by Lily\n\"Did you notice that I haven\u2019t been grieving as much as I was when we first heard about what happened?\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, I mean, everyone grieves differently. That\u2019s natural.\" said by Lily\n\"No, there is nothing natural about it and that\u2019s the whole point. There are things that have happened that I had no control over, but I did not do something and I regret it.\" said by Daniel\n\"What did you not do?\" said by Lily\n\"I did not tell you the truth. And it\u2019s only because I was sworn to secrecy and I don\u2019t know. The whole thing is just driving me crazy.\" said by Daniel\n\"Okay, daniel, what\u2019s going on? What happened?\" said by Lily\n\"My mother is alive.\" said by Daniel\n\"So that\u2019s, um, that\u2019s the whole story for now. Can you say something please?\" said by Daniel\n\"I\u2013 I don\u2019t think I can, \u2019cause I think if I do, you\u2019re gonna end up hating me.\" said by Lily\n\"No, never.\" said by Daniel\n\"Daniel, like what? Like what\u2013 what world does your mother think it\u2019s okay to fake her own death?\" said by Lily\n\"I mean, in her defense\u2013\" said by Daniel\n\"Are you\u2013 are you being serious right now?\" said by Lily\n\"She wanted to end the charade, but stark stopped her. I mean, he tried to kill her, so she had to stop him first.\" said by Daniel\n\"Sorry. Stop him how?\" said by Lily\n\"It was self-defense.\" said by Daniel\n\"Wait, are you telling me that she killed jeremy stark?\" said by Lily\n\"He attacked her first. He attacked her first.\" said by Daniel\n\"I\u2013 I\u2013 I\u2013 I\u2013 I don\u2019t even know what to say. Nope. Not gonna say anything. It\u2019s your mother. You thought she was gone and you\u2019re happy she\u2019s back and that\u2019s your priority.\" said by Lily\n\"Listen, I brought you here because I wanna hear what you have to say.\" said by Daniel\n\"Daniel, this is not what a mother does. A mother protects her children and behaves in a way to show her children how to behave in the world, whether you\u2019re an adult or a child. She let you think that she was dead. She let you grieve and then she kills jeremy\u2019s stark? She frames diane. She won\u2019t come home to clear diane until she\u2019s sure that she\u2019s off scot-free. I am sorry, but your mother is selfish and she\u2019s a coward.\" said by Lily\n\"Now, this is not a grilling, it\u2019s a friendly catch up. It\u2019s been a while.\" said by Victor\n\"It has.\" said by Nate\n\"You\u2019ve seen our family go through ups and downs. We have known you for a while.\" said by Victor\n\"Things were, uh, complicated then.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s putting it mildly. So, you\u2019ve learned how our family operates.\" said by Victor\n\"I\u2019m gonna take a stab in the dark. I\u2019m here because nick is opposed to me on every level. Not only does he want me out of newman media because of sally, now, he\u2019s questioning my character.\" said by Nate\n\"I form my own opinion about people, nate.\" said by Victor\n\"I appreciate that about you.\" said by Nate\n\"So, it\u2019s no secret that your relationship with my daughter, victoria, has gone beyond the professional.\" said by Victor\n\"This is true.\" said by Nate\n\"But as her father, you can imagine that I would like to know a bit more about you personally. What do you think?\" said by Victor\n\"I like that very much.\" said by Nate\n\"So, I\u2019m a hypocrite for having an opinion about nate?\" said by Billy\n\"Oh, having it is one thing, but sharing it with me, that\u2019s another thing.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay, fair enough. The view from my glasshouse is legendary. So, how about this? I\u2019ll put down my sticks and stones if you do the same thing. No talk of romance or relationships or any of that. We\u2019ll talk about the kids. How about them kids, huh?\" said by Billy\n\"Let\u2019s talk about the kids, yeah. You know, johnny, he, um, he\u2019s been going on and on about this big family dinner that you had the other night.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah. Crazy times.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah. You wanna remind me of that eclectic guest list again? It was your ex and her current and your girlfriend and johnny and connor and daniel\u2019s daughter.\" said by Victoria\n\"All came out of the blue.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah. Well, I can\u2019t see anybody wanting to plan that on purpose.\" said by Victoria\n\"It was the spur of the moment and we went with it.\" said by Billy\n\"That\u2019s nice.\" said by Victoria\n\"You actually sound like you mean that.\" said by Billy\n\"I do. I\u2019ve heard lucy\u2019s name mentioned around the house a few times, so i guess she\u2019s made a real impression on our son.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah. Felt like there was a little something in the air. How about that? We\u2019re all following our hearts, as it should be. \u2018Cause you never know who life is gonna throw your way.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s true. God knows I didn\u2019t\u2013 I didn\u2019t see this coming\u2013\" said by Victoria\n\"Careful. This is a risky conversation. But since you brought it up, are you happy?\" said by Billy\n\"I\u2019m very happy.\" said by Victoria\n\"Then, I\u2019m happy for you.\" said by Billy\n\"Thank you. Because at this point I would hate to have to hide anything in my life. And work and family and personal, it just\u2013 it keeps getting better and better.\" said by Victoria\n\"What\u2019s new in the lab? Please tell me you\u2019re calling about that miracle I asked you to work? Yeah. What do you got? Walk me through it. Okay. Yeah. What do you know? Okay. Yeah. Thank you. I, uh, I owe you big time. Dinner it is. Absolutely. Yeah. You\u2019re the best. We\u2019ll see you.\" said by Chance\n\"Everybody leaves breadcrumbs, stark. Everyone. There\u2019s gotta be some sketchy search or some email you forgot to encrypt. Something that gives me proof that I did the right thing by defending myself. I\u2019ll find it.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yeah, I\u2019ve been better.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, all right. Good. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay. So, so\u2026\" said by Phyllis\n\"No, I took the stairs.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay, good.\" said by Phyllis\n\"What have you found out?\" said by Summer\n\"Um, I\u2019m trying to find out something about that emt guy.\" said by Phyllis\n\"The one that stark paid off?\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah, his name is carson.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Oh, I\u2019m sure that stark paid really well. He\u2019s probably living on a tropical island by now.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, I mean, it\u2019s not a lost cause. We can still find some proof.\" said by Phyllis\n\"She restrains herself.\" said by Summer\n\"Hm. Does she? There are other ways to be awful. Trust me. What about christine? She still doesn\u2019t buy daniel\u2019s story that I\u2019m alive?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Oh, my god, daniel. I\u2013\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, my god, daniel what?\" said by Phyllis\n\"I don\u2019t wanna talk about him, okay? He opened his big mouth to the wrong people.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay. Well, I mean, I understand what you\u2019re saying and I have a problem with him doing that too. I mean, I would\u2019ve loved to have more time to come up with a plaN.\" said by Phyllis\n\"What we needed was an ironclad justification for what you did. That was supposed to be step one.\" said by Summer\n\"Let\u2019s look at things from daniel\u2019s perspective, okay? Let\u2019s just\u2013\" said by Phyllis\n\"No. I don\u2019t wanna look at it from daniel\u2019s perspective. I don\u2019t\u2013 I don\u2019t understand his perspective and I\u2019m never going to. Ultomiris is for adults with generalized myasthenia gravis\" said by Summer\n\"All right. Sorry. I don\u2019t wanna tell you how to think or feel. You\u2019re an adult. I just hate it that my kids are at odds, that\u2019s all.\" said by Phyllis\n\"I just don\u2019t\u2013 I don\u2019t understand why he\u2019s so infuriating. I\u2013 I literally asked him to do the simplest thing.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, it\u2019s because he\u2019s danny\u2019s son. And danny has a moral compass that\u2019s just stuck at do the right thing.\" said by Phyllis\n\"What does that say about ours?\" said by Summer\n\"Well, our moral compass is sort of like, uh, you know, do what you have to do. Do what\u2019s necessary to get the job done. Listen, if you both had been raised by me, daniel would be, you know, more like us. You know, more shoot from the hip, more flexible.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Didn\u2019t turn out that way, did it?\" said by Summer\n\"No. But you know what? We\u2019re a family. We are a family, summer. And sometimes we disagree and we fight and we do the wrong thing, but we make up. I mean, look at me. I came back from the dead. Anything can happen, so.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Mom, I sincerely hope that you have a backup plan.\" said by Summer\n\"Obviously, I have a backup plan.\" said by Phyllis\n\"One that doesn\u2019t involve you disappearing if things don\u2019t go your way?\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah. You know what I wanna do? I wanna repair what\u2019s been broken. I did this. I ruined the relationship between you and your brother, okay? I wanna repair that. I mean, I cannot believe that I\u2019ve put you guys in this position, all right?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Mom, what you need to do is focus on clearing your name so that you can come back to us for real. My relationship with him, it\u2019s not a priority.\" said by Summer\n\"Look, I\u2019m sorry. That came out a lot harsher than I meant it to.\" said by Lily\n\"No. No. I mean, if we can\u2019t be honest with each other, why even bother, right?\" said by Daniel\n\"Look, I understand your mom\u2019s instinct to wanna run away from what\u2019s coming for her, but at some point, you have to face your fears. And what she\u2019s doing is she\u2019s taking the easy way out.\" said by Lily\n\"She\u2019s not gonna stay gone forever.\" said by Daniel\n\"No. Just until she faces zero consequences.\" said by Lily\n\"She\u2019s coming back one way or the other.\" said by Daniel\n\"Really? Are you sure?\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah. I have to be sure because, you know, the alternative is\u2026 it\u2019s unthinkable.\" said by Daniel\n\"God, I\u2013 I hate what her choices are doing to you.\" said by Lily\n\"What was it like for you? After the accident with hilary. Going to prison.\" said by Daniel\n\"It was awful, you know. I didn\u2019t wanna go, but I knew that I wouldn\u2019t be able to look at myself or look devon in the eyes again if I didn\u2019t pay for what I did. Like someone died because of my actions. There has to be consequences to that.\" said by Lily\n\"Prison must have been brutal.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah, of course, but, you know, there\u2019s a silver lining to everything. And I met a lot of amazing women. You know, I got to help a few and\u2013 and I came out stronger for it.\" said by Lily\n\"Not many people would\u2019ve done what you did.\" said by Daniel\n\"I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true, daniel.\" said by Lily\n\"Look at my mother. I mean, she\u2019s willing to frame an innocent woman and let her go to prison for murder, and summer, summer\u2019s not much better. She\u2019s following right behind mom in her footsteps.\" said by Daniel\n\"Absolutely. I agree with you. And I do not respect their choices, but I support you and I know that you love them.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah, I do love them, but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s enough anymore. I mean, how the heck are we supposed to ever be a family again?\" said by Daniel\n\"If I hadn\u2019t seen that with my own eyes, I wouldn\u2019t have believed it.\" said by Victor\n\"That is an incredible story.\" said by Nate\n\"I know, right? Another example of how life can surprise you when you least expect it, you know?\" said by Victor\n\"Truer words were never spoken.\" said by Nate\n\"That\u2019s right.\" said by Victor\n\"You know, um, I know you\u2019ve heard this a thousand times, but you\u2019re the reason I enrolled in business courses in college.\" said by Nate\n\"You serious?\" said by Victor\n\"Yes. I\u2013 I picked up a copy of your biography, man and myth.\" said by Nate\n\"That was from another lifetime.\" said by Victor\n\"I wanted to learn more about the company and the man that meant so much to neil.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah, well, neil was one of the few men I trusted, you know?\" said by Victor\n\"Yeah.\" said by Nate\n\"He was a good friend.\" said by Victor\n\"Yeah. Deeply missed. And, uh, as I got deeper and learned more about your life, what struck me was how you managed to create so much, build so many companies from practically nothing\" said by Nate\n\"Got lucky.\" said by Victor\n\"[ Laughs ] I\u2019d say it\u2019s more than that.

Did you sleep at all?\" said by Jack\n\"No, I kept on\u2013 I just kept thinking about you. How\u2013 how good it would feel to have your arms around me. Take a\u2013 take a shower, put on some clean clothes. You know, if I had known I was going to be arrested at phyllis\u2019s memorial, I might have worn something more sensible.\" said by Diane\n\"I cannot imagine how hellish this has been for you.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, my secret is I\u2019m just pretending it\u2019s not happening. I keep telling myself that they\u2019ve made a mistake and that they\u2019ll realize I\u2019m not a murderer and then they\u2019ll just let me go.\" said by Diane\n\"As much as I want to believe that, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s time to face some difficult truths.\" said by Jack\n\"I woke up around three. Where\u2019d you go? Still couldn\u2019t sleep?\" said by Kyle\n\"I went to check on harrison. His room is so peaceful, you know. I crawled into bed with him and before I knew it, I was out.\" said by Summer\n\"Good. You needed it.\" said by Kyle\n\"What about you? Part of the reason I left was so that I wouldn\u2019t keep you up.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, uh, for a while, I was in that hazy place. Not quite asleep, but not awake. And the rest of the night, I was going down rabbit holes online and torn between giving you your space and checking to see if you were okay.\" said by Kyle\n\"How could I be okay? I just keep replaying my mom\u2019s last moments. I mean, she was lucid enough to say poison. Was she lucid enough to be afraid, to feel pain? And did she think about me or daniel?\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, don\u2019t\u2013\" said by Kyle\n\"What were you\u2013 what were you researching online?\" said by Summer\n\"I was looking up names of criminal defense lawyers because today\u2019s my mom\u2019s arraignment. And we still don\u2019t know if michael baldwin\u2019s gonna be our guy.\" said by Kyle\n\"Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a little heartless or, I don\u2019t know, perverse asking him to defend diane in my mom\u2019s murder?\" said by Summer\n\"Summer?\" said by Noah\n\"Noah. Oh, my god.\" said by Summer\n\"You filed the criminal complaint against diane?\" said by Chance\n\"Bright and early?\" said by Christine\n\"All right. What do you need from me?\" said by Chance\n\"Talk me through the evidence.\" said by Christine\n\"Okay. Well, there is phyllis\u2019s toxicology report and that proves there was poison in her blood. There\u2019s a vial of poison that I found in her room and I have evidence that links diane to the purchase of that poison. Of course, there are witnesses to a threat that night, as well as a very long history of antagonistic behavior.\" said by Chance\n\"I just don\u2019t want any surprises at the arraignment.\" said by Christine\n\"I can\u2019t promise you that. We\u2019re dealing with a lot of people who haven\u2019t shown any kind of respect for the legal system.\" said by Chance\n\"Yeah. I talked to jack.\" said by Christine\n\"Oh, yeah. What\u2019s his game plan?\" said by Chance\n\"They\u2019re gonna plead not guilty and ask for bail.\" said by Christine\n\"I mean, any judge would have to deny that.\" said by Chance\n\"Yeah. With her history, his money, forget it. Flight risk.\" said by Christine\n\"I hope the judge sees it that way. Who did they get for a lawyer?\" said by Chance\n\"As far as I know, that job\u2019s still open.\" said by Christine\n\"Well, if it isn\u2019t the man who restored my faith in attorneys.\" said by Nikki\n\"What could I possibly have done to be worthy of that compliment?\" said by Michael\n\"Ah, it\u2019s what you didn\u2019t do. Now, I know you have a soft spot for diane and I will never understand why, but the way you refused to rush to her rescue at phyllis\u2019s memorial, trust me, we all got the message, loud and clear. If the best attorney in genoa city thinks she\u2019s guilty and won\u2019t go near her with a 10-foot pole, well\u2026\" said by Nikki\n\"Well, yeah. Well, have a seat, please. Nikki, our constitution assures all citizens are innocent until proven otherwise, even the ones who don\u2019t measure up or haven\u2019t earned your seal of approval.\" said by Michael\n\"According to the constitution, yes. But the founding fathers never met diane. We know what she\u2019s capable of. She\u2019s dangerous and now phyllis is dead.\" said by Nikki\n\"Correlation doesn\u2019t equate causation.\" said by Michael\n\"Your clever tone has me a little worried. Please tell me I don\u2019t need to be.\" said by Nikki\n\"Last night, I got a call from jack asking me to represent diane.\" said by Michael\n\"Oh, my god. That is outrageous. Michael, you can\u2019t defend the woman who killed one of your best friends. I used to pre-rinse dishes cause my old detergent\" said by Nikki\n\"I\u2019m so sorry that I wasn\u2019t here.\" said by Noah\n\"We flew back from london as soon as we could.\" said by Allie\n\"Well, you\u2019re here now and that\u2019s all that matters.\" said by Summer\n\"It just\u2013 it doesn\u2019t make sense to me. I mean, phyllis and then diane got arrested.\" said by Noah\n\"Yeah, she was charged with murder. They found poison in my mom\u2019s system and they tied it back to diane.\" said by Summer\n\"I thought this was all an accident, right? Wasn\u2019t there an ambulance?\" said by Allie\n\"No, it was murder. My mom was poisoned. It was a premeditated act at the G.C.A.C. It wasn\u2019t some accident on a dark road.\" said by Summer\n\"It just\u2013 it\u2019s so hard to believe.\" said by Allie\n\"It is. There are certain things we don\u2019t know for sure.\" said by Kyle\n\"All of the evidence is pointing at diane. I\u2013 I\u2013 I don\u2019t know why you would doubt it.\" said by Summer\n\"Murderer? I don\u2019t know. She was so happy here with you guys, jack, harrison. Maybe there\u2019s, um, another option that we\u2019ve overlooked.\" said by Allie\n\"That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been saying.\" said by Kyle\n\"Under the right circumstances, everyone is capable of murder.\" said by Summer\n\"It\u2019s so good to see your face.\" said by Diane\n\"I hate seeing you like this. I want to grab you and take you out of this place.\" said by Jack\n\"I want that too. But the arraignment\u2019s still today, right?\" said by Diane\n\"Yes, but\u2013\" said by Jack\n\"So, I\u2019ll get in front of a judge, I\u2019ll tell them I\u2019m not guilty. They\u2019ll set bail and I\u2019ll get to leave.\" said by Diane\n\"Let\u2019s talk about the bail.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. And given my unfortunate history of disappearing, there\u2019s\u2013 there\u2019s the probability that I\u2019ll be denied bail. Which means that I am stuck here until the trial begins.\" said by Diane\n\"No, wait, wait, don\u2019t get ahead of yourself. Let\u2019s take this one step at a time. Let\u2019s talk facts.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, fact is, I don\u2019t even have a lawyer. And\u2013 and christine is the D.A., Which means that we need someone who\u2019s not intimidated by her. Some\u2013 some heavy hitter who just loves fighting for the underdog.\" said by Diane\n\"I have spoken to michael again.\" said by Jack\n\"No, he has already turned me down.\" said by Diane\n\"He\u2019s the right man for the job. I will convince him to take your case.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, I know that when you look at me, you see the woman you love, whom you believe, but when he looks at me, he sees his best friend\u2019s nemesis. And lauren would never forgive him if he defended me. She loved phyllis. They both did.\" said by Diane\n\"That doesn\u2019t matter.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, it matters to me. I want someone who doesn\u2019t know about my past. Who has\u2013 who has no relationship with you. Some\u2013 someone who\u2019s just in it for the money because everybody else wants me dead. Everybody but you and kyle. I mean, I might as well admit it, you know. Everything is stacked against me and I don\u2019t have a chance in hell.\" said by Diane\n\"You have me and we will get you through this, together.\" said by Jack\n\"And, you can\u2019t take diane on as a client. You work for victor.\" said by Nikki\n\"If a worthwhile case finds its way to my desk, I am free to do as I choose.\" said by Jack\n\"The operative word there being worthwhile.\" said by Nikki\n\"Do you really, nikki, believe that diane is a murderer?\" said by Michael\n\"Yes, I do. She has despised phyllis for decades and that kind of hatred doesn\u2019t just disappear. That\u2019s motive. And there were witnesses, including jack that saw her threaten phyllis that night. My god, michael. I mean, I know you\u2019re an attorney, but don\u2019t you have any common decency?\" said by Nikki\n\"You are cherry-picking facts to suit your narrative.\" said by Michael\n\"That\u2019s because my narrative is the right one.\" said by Nikki\n\"What, pray tell, is this all about?\" said by Victor\n\"It\u2019s definitely one of the more complicated and stressful situations we\u2019ve been through, but the guilty party still hasn\u2019t been arrested. So, once stark is in a cell\u2013\" said by Kyle\n\"Look, I know that it hurts, kyle. You don\u2019t want to believe that your mom could be so evil, but all of the evidence is pointing squarely at diane and the sooner you accept that, the less painful it\u2019s gonna be.\" said by Summer\n\"Good thing you\u2019re not the judge and jury.\" said by Kyle\n\"No, but I\u2019m probably gonna be a witness and I\u2019ll be sure to tell them that I heard your mom threaten to murder my mom.\" said by Summer\n\"You know that\u2013 that\u2019s a lot, summer. I know how hard it is to lose a parent. I lost my dad last year and it was so incredibly painful.\" said by Allie\n\"I\u2019m really sorry for your loss, allie, but I imagine it was under very different circumstances.\" said by Summer\n\"Hey, you know, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m feeling a little stir crazy.\" said by Noah\n\"Yeah, it was such a long flight.\" said by Allie\n\"Yeah, yeah, it was. You know, summer, I could probably catch a second wind if you want to get out of here. Maybe grab something to eat.\" said by Noah\n\"I don\u2019t know.\" said by Summer\n\"Come on. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve had some one on one with my sister. You don\u2019t mind, do you, kyle?\" said by Noah\n\"No, it\u2019s a good idea. I\u2019m still waiting to find out if my dad was able to retain michael baldwin for my mom\u2019s attorney.\" said by Kyle\n\"Seriously, still? Michael baldwin?\" said by Summer\n\"Hey, what do you say?\" said by Noah\n\"Get me out of here, now.\" said by Summer\n\"Bet you\u2019re glad you came home from your vacation early.\" said by Kyle\n\"Oh, kyle, I\u2019m so sorry.\" said by Allie\n\"The two women I love the most in this universe cannot exist together. What am I supposed to do?\" said by Kyle\n\"I know you don\u2019t want to get your hopes up, but right after this, I am meeting with michael and I am not going to give up until I get him to take your case.\" said by Jack\n\"He won\u2019t do it out of respect for phyllis and his wife. And I get that. And we need to respect his choices, agreed?\" said by Diane\n\"You\u2019re ready to have have a stranger be in charge of your life?\" said by Jack\n\"No, I just want to come home, jack. I mean, this\u2013 this feels like a nightmare, but it\u2019s my life. I mean, one minute the man of my dreams is announcing our engagement, and the next, I\u2019m in a jail cell framed for murder, facing the rest of my life in prison.\" said by Diane\n\"I promise you, we will get you through this.\" said by Jack\n\"I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Maybe not this time. I mean, I already\u2013 I already fought myself back from total disgrace. I tried to rebuild my life. I tried to earn the forgiveness of everybody that I care about.\" said by Diane\n\"Don\u2019t say that, that\u2019s not true.\" said by Jack\n\"You know, you and i were so proud that we had pulled one over on jeremy and so he did this. And now he\u2019s got the last laugh.\" said by Diane\n\"We will prove that he is the guilty party.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, but what if we can\u2019t? I mean, that\u2019s how he operates. Somebody else always takes the fall and this time it\u2019s me.\" said by Diane\n\"Do you trust me?\" said by Jack\n\"Of course I do.\" said by Diane\n\"There is nothing in the world I wouldn\u2019t do for you and I will not let you pay for a crime you didn\u2019t commit.\" said by Jack\n\"That means our visit\u2019s over.\" said by Diane\n\"Okay. I\u2013 I\u2019ll see you at the arraignment. Be strong, have faith, and know that every moment that passes, I am working to get you back home.\" said by Jack\n\"Even though we have very strong evidence against diane, I think we need to leave all of our avenues open. I wouldn\u2019t want the other side accusing us of confirmation bias.\" said by Christine\n\"Yeah. Well, jack and kyle are convinced that stark killed phyllis so he could frame diane for it, so I\u2019m looking into that.\" said by Chance\n\"Okay, and show me how that all connects, you know? Who and why, who benefits, what would stark\u2019s motive be for murder?\" said by Christine\n\"Money? You know, he\u2019s getting half of phyllis\u2019s estate. I mean, that\u2019s a hell of a payout for a couple days of wedded bliss, you know.\" said by Chance\n\"A vibrant, beautiful woman with friends and family marries a criminal with whom she has no romantic relationship. Not even a friendship that we know of? Why?\" said by Christine\n\"Well, stark said it was for protection. Yeah, phyllis was scared of diane, but knew that diane was scared of stark. So, she married him.\" said by Chance\n\"And I don\u2019t buy that. Phyllis wasn\u2019t afraid of anyone. Why would she fear diane and not stark? He was the one who was unpredictable and dangerous. Diane was just a major annoyance, not someone that would make her run for cover. Not the phyllis summers I knew.\" said by Christine\n\"Yeah, I didn\u2019t buy that either. She wouldn\u2019t run from anyone.\" said by Chance\n\"Could retribution be a motive?\" said by Christine\n\"Yeah, that is possible. I mean, you should have seen stark when he found out jack and diane framed him for stealing that necklace.\" said by Chance\n\"Yeah, but there was never any actual proof of that.\" said by Christine\n\"It didn\u2019t matter. I mean, a guy like stark, he finds out that somebody\u2019s trying to mess with him? Getting revenge becomes an obsession.\" said by Chance\n\"Okay. Show me what that would look like.\" said by Christine\n\"Well, he marries phyllis for the money, kills her, frames diane for the murder. He gets beaucoup bucks and he gets to watch diane go to prison.\" said by Chance\n\"Pay back with a little bit of payout.\" said by Christine\n\"Two birds, one stone.\" said by Chance\n\"Hm.\" said by Christine\n\"Michael is about to defend the indefensible, diane.\" said by Nikki\n\"Why in the world would you do that?\" said by Victor\n\"The truth is, I haven\u2019t really\u2013\" said by Michael\n\"Wait a minute. Am i not keeping you busy enough?\" said by Victor\n\"I enjoy my job very much.\" said by Michael\n\"Good.\" said by Victor\n\"Just as I was enjoying my coffee until a few minutes ago. Oh, well, would you look at that, my morning meeting. Nikki, thank you for the enlightening conversation. Quite edifying, but I\u2019m sure you have a full day ahead of you.\" said by Michael\n\"Now jack, don\u2019t keep him too long, all right? He\u2019s on my payroll, okay?\" said by Victor\n\"Jack.\" said by Nikki\n\"Can I get you anything? Have you even eaten?\" said by Michael\n\"No appetite.\" said by Jack\n\"Have you seen diane?\" said by Michael\n\"I just left her.\" said by Jack\n\"How\u2019s she holding up?\" said by Michael\n\"Not well. We still don\u2019t have an attorney and I know you don\u2019t want to hear this, but her future is in your hands. Known as a passionate artist.\" said by Jack\n\"Without having strong evidence tying stark to this crime, all we have are interesting theories.\" said by Christine\n\"You want me to have another conversation with him? Bring him into the station?\" said by Chance\n\"Would it do any good?\" said by Christine\n\"He\u2019s pretty tight-lipped. He knows how to talk to police. He\u2019ll probably just find a way to wiggle free.\" said by Chance\n\"It\u2019s worth a try. Is he still in town?\" said by Christine\n\"Yeah, as far as I know. I\u2019m tracking his finances, so if he moves any cash or makes any kind of big purchase, I\u2019ll know.\" said by Chance\n\"Smart. Oh, god. I mean, what are we missing? A woman like phyllis marries a criminal and then willingly gives over half her money.\" said by Christine\n\"Maybe he had something on her, had something she wanted. I don\u2019t know. All I know is that I\u2019m not getting the whole\u2026 one second. Chancellor. Yeah, what you got? Yes, that was the plan. Today? Ugh. All right. Well, then we need more boots on the ground asap. Yeah, hey, let me call you back.\" said by Chance\n\"That about stark?\" said by Christine\n\"He checked out of the graham phoenix, right after the distribution of phyllis\u2019s assets into his account.\" said by Chance\n\"You\u2019ve got to be kidding?\" said by Christine\n\"It gets worse. No one knows where the hell he is.\" said by Chance\n\"It all comes back to stark. He concocted this entire thing to get back at my mom.\" said by Kyle\n\"Because of their time in california?\" said by Allie\n\"Yeah, she turns on him for laundering money. He does time in a federal prison. While he\u2019s away, she gives up that way of life. Comes back to genoa city. He gets released and follows her here fixated on one goal, to make my mom pay.\" said by Kyle\n\"Okay. Yeah, I mean, that all makes sense.\" said by Allie\n\"Yeah. My parents do everything they can think of to try to get him to leave town, but stark won\u2019t go. They finally find a solution. Make it look like he\u2019s returned to his criminal ways. They tip off the cops. Cops catch stark red-handed. Just like that, he\u2019s back in jail.\" said by Kyle\n\"But he\u2019s out again?\" said by Allie\n\"With an axe to grind. He needed to send my mother a message, so he took advantage of the already volatile situation. The deadly feud between phyllis and my mother.\" said by Kyle\n\"So he killed phyllis and made it look like diane did it.\" said by Allie\n\"That\u2019s what I think.\" said by Kyle\n\"Why not just kill diane? Now that I say that out loud, it sounds even worse than it was in my head.\" said by Allie\n\"It\u2019s okay. I\u2019ve already thought about that. I think he thinks it\u2019s more fun to watch my mom suffer. Phyllis was just collateral damage.\" said by Kyle\n\"That sounds so dark. But given who jeremy stark is, I guess it\u2019s feasible. Summer\u2019s not buying it at all?\" said by Allie\n\"No. She\u2019s grieving her mother and she thinks my mother is to blame, so there\u2019s no convincing her. Not much communication lately.\" said by Kyle\n\"I am so sorry that you guys are going through this.\" said by Allie\n\"The only way out is to prove my mother\u2019s innocent and she doesn\u2019t even have an attorney yet.\" said by ", "answer": "Kyle"}

I encouraged diane to get over to the grand phoenix spa, just to shake off some of that stress and to not upset summer.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, good thinking. You know, dad. I\u2013 I feel so helpless. She barely slept.

Dad, I need to know. What do you really think about stark\u2019s accusations?\" said by Kyle\n\"They\u2019re ludicrous. There\u2019s no way diane did that.\" said by Jack\n\"Dad, I feel the same way. But do you think in the past she could have done something like this?\" said by Kyle\n\"What does it matter whoever she was in the past? She is a completely different person today.\" said by Jack\n\"You\u2019re right. But not everyone is going to see it that way. Especially after the fight those two had. Everyone knows how much they hated each other.

I knew I could count on you.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Everybody keeps calling me, asking me if I\u2019m doing okay. I just want this to be done and over with now.\" said by Carson\n\"Okay, all right. Take the money, forget you ever met us. And if the cops question you again, you keep playing your part, okay? You stick to the story, keep it simple, or else we\u2019re gonna have a problem. Got it?\" said by Jeremy\n\"Yeah, I got it.\" said by Carson\n\"Okay, now get outta here.\" said by Jeremy\n\"He\u2019s so skittish.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Unfortunately, it\u2019s impossible to get a viable autopsy on phyllis\u2019s remains. The medical examiner said the damage done by the fire was just too extensive.\" said by Christine\n\"But the lab is processing a sample from the wreckage. Her blood that was drawn before the crash, so they can at least run a tox screen on that.\" said by Chance\n\"Mm-hmm. Court order\u2019s been issued. The sample\u2019s being tested. I\u2019m telling you, if there was a substance in her system before she passed out\u2026\" said by Christine\n\"Then the emt\u2019s statement of her last words being about poison is validated.\" said by Chance\n\"And if that\u2019s true, we will have a whole other mystery to unravel. Who was behind the poisoning? Diane? Stark? Someone we haven\u2019t even considered?\" said by Christine\n\"Why would stark poison his new wife?\" said by Chance\n\"Uh, well, maybe he married her for her money. Maybe he was looking for some fast score before leaving town. I don\u2019t know, the guy\u2019s a wild card, and this quickie wedding to phyllis has caught everyone off guard.\" said by Christine\n\"Hello. I\u2019d say good morning, but I\u2019M\u2026 not.\" said by Michael\n\"I have a feeling that you two need to speak alone. I\u2019ll let you know when the test results are in.\" said by Chance\n\"Okay. Hey, I know how hard this must be for you and lauren. Phyllis\u2019s death, I\u2013 I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2013 I know how close you were.\" said by Christine\n\"There aren\u2019t enough words to describe how we\u2019re feeling. And I\u2019m sure lauren and I aren\u2019t the only ones.\" said by Michael\n\"Summer. Hey. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re up. Can I get you anything? How about some breakfast? I\u2019m sure you\u2019re pretty hungry.\" said by Jack\n\"Uh, not really. Where\u2019s harrison?\" said by Summer\n\"Linda thought it\u2019d be a good idea to get him out of the house for a while.\" said by Kyle\n\"And we agreed.\" said by Jack\n\"Okay. Were you afraid that I was gonna go off on diane again?\" said by Summer\n\"No.\" said by Jack\n\"No. No, we just didn\u2019t want him picking up on all the grief in the house today.\" said by Kyle\n\"Then he should come home, because I\u2019m done with all of that.\" said by Summer\n\"We\u2019re done with all of what?\" said by Jack\n\"Grief, being sad.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, summer, if only it were that easy for any of us. No, saying it is over does not make it so.\" said by Jack\n\"Okay, well, I\u2019m done talking about diane or jeremy stark or anything that happened yesterday.\" said by Summer\n\"I totally understand that. You don\u2019t have to talk about anything you don\u2019t want to deal with right now.\" said by Jack\n\"Hey, it\u2019s a beautiful day out. Why don\u2019t we go out back and get some sun?\" said by Kyle\n\"I can\u2019t right now. I have work to do.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, honey, marchetti can wait at a time like this.\" said by Jack\n\"We\u2019ve notified the staff. We\u2019ll be taking some time off.\" said by Kyle\n\"Thanks, but it\u2019s not marchetti. It\u2019s something far more important and it can\u2019t wait. Having diabetes can raise a lot of questions.\" said by Summer\n\"Hey, that carson, he\u2019s a lucky guy. He gets to keep his identity and he gets some money.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Oh, he had no attachments, so worked out just fine for him. He can start over. He\u2019s probably halfway to a tropical beach by now.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Okay, and then those two bodies from the morgue, mr. And mrs. John doe, that were found at the crash site? I mean, that\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s me and the driver, right?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Hmm. Poetic, isn\u2019t it? The same blueprint that diane used with her exit all those years ago. Only this time she\u2019ll be a murder suspect and spend the rest of her life behind bars.\" said by Jeremy\n\"And I\u2019ll be wiped out of existence.\" said by Phyllis\n\"What?\" said by Jeremy\n\"What?\" said by Phyllis\n\"I hope that\u2019s not regret I\u2019m hearing?\" said by Jeremy\n\"Summer, what work could you possibly have to do that\u2019s more important than everything else going on right now?\" said by Kyle\n\"I have to start planning my mom\u2019s memorial service.\" said by Summer\n\"That\u2019s not something you have to take on right now, is it?\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, you need to rest. We hate to see you pushing yourself like this.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019m not pushing myself. I\u2019m just doing what needs to be done. My mom deserves a proper tribute and I\u2019m gonna be the one that arranges it.\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m really glad we just stayed here for the night. I imagine you have to go be with summer. Have you heard from her?\" said by Sally\n\"[ Clicks tongue ] I\u2019ve tried calling her, um, several times but she\u2026\" said by Nick\n\"I mean, she has to be devastated. If she should spend the next few weeks in bed, no one would blame her.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah. I told noah and faith. Noah and allie are on a trip. Uh, they\u2019re gonna cut that short and head home. I told faith she should call summer, but\u2026 she\u2019s got to stay at school. She\u2019s prepping for finals.\" said by Nick\n\"And christian?\" said by Sally\n\"I haven\u2019t had the heart to tell him yet. He adored phyllis. It also just happens to be one of those random days off from school. So, the nanny was gonna take him to the zoo, get him some ice cream, make a special day out of it. I didn\u2019t want to take that away from him by telling him about this.\" said by Nick\n\"You\u2019re amazing, you know that?\" said by Sally\n\"Not feeling really amazing right now.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Sighs ] But you are. I mean, look at how you\u2019re taking care of your kids in the middle of a tragedy. I really admire that about you. But you need someone to lean on, too. I hope you know you can count on me. All you have to do is ask.\" said by Sally\n\"Thanks. I just can\u2019t stop thinking about phyllis and why this happened. How big a part of my life she is. I\u2019m really gonna miss her.\" said by Nick\n\"So, how\u2019s lauren doing? I know that she and phyllis have been through hell and back. And to lose someone who you\u2019ve seen through the best of times and the worst of times, it\u2019s devastating.\" said by Christine\n\"Lauren is shaken to her core. This morning she told me that she could literally feel her heart breaking. Phyllis was one of the best friends she\u2019s ever had. And it\u2019s just unreal to think that she\u2019s just gone like that.\" said by Michael\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s the hard part.\" said by Christine\n\"Well, god knows this town won\u2019t be the same without phyllis running around raising hell.\" said by Michael\n\"I mean\u2026 I\u2019ll admit there have been many times that I wished phyllis would leave this town for good.\" said by Christine\n\"Not like this. No one should wish something like this on anyone.\" said by Michael\n\"The way she was ripped out of everyone\u2019s lives, it\u2019s jarring, to say the least, but I promise you this\u2013 I will get to the bottom of what happened and make sure justice is served.\" said by Christine\n\"Which is why I wanted to speak to you, madam district attorney.\" said by Michael\n\"Michael, you know I can\u2019t discuss an ongoing investigation.\" said by Christine\n\"I totally understand. I\u2019m not here seeking information. I\u2019m here to share some.\" said by Michael\n\"At the gala, I turned off my phone. I promised lauren a romantic night with no distractions. And we were having a glorious time until it all went to hell.\" said by Michael\n\"I seem to remember you and lauren leaving right after everyone was told phyllis didn\u2019t make it.\" said by Christine\n\"Oh\u2026 we went home in a complete daze, just trying to process what happened. It wasn\u2019t until the middle of the night that I remembered to turn my phone back on. And I was\u2026 stunned by what I\u2019d missed.\" said by Michael\n\"What was it?\" said by Christine\n\"A call from phyllis that she made last night. She left a voice mail. And you need to hear it.\" said by Michael\n\"I don\u2019t have regrets, exactly. Um\u2013\" said by Phyllis\n\"Okay, well, what do you have, then?\" said by Jeremy\n\"I am just concerned about my kids. That\u2019s all.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Okay, you knew from the beginning how hard it was gonna be on them.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Yes, I knew, it\u2019s just this one thing. Um, when I started in on my speech after jack and diane\u2019s announcement, um, I looked over at them and they seemed agitated, and so I just carried on, and\u2013 and, um, when I started stumbling, they seemed a little alarmed, that\u2019s all. And I could see it in their eyes that they were worried. And then when I fell to the floor, they\u2013 they seemed really frightened and I\u2026 I just wasn\u2019t expecting that. How did they react when they found out that the ambulance didn\u2019t make it to the hospital?\" said by Phyllis\n\"They were surprised and upset, as to be expected.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Okay. How did they react when they found out that I\u2013\" said by Phyllis\n\"Phyllis! What does it matter?\" said by Jeremy\n\"Well, it just matters to me because I\u2019m not used to walking away from my kids. That\u2019s all. I\u2019m not diane.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Look, I can understand why you\u2019re having second thoughts, but need I remind you how furious you were? Remember? How you felt utterly disillusioned and betrayed? Now, that\u2019s one of the main reasons why you agreed to take it this far.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Yeah, I know.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yeah, yeah, yeah. Your kids made you the enemy, huh? Remember that? They chose her side. They pushed you away. They\u2019re not kids anymore. They have families of their own and they\u2019ll find a way to move on without you. Okay? \u2018Cause that\u2019s what people do. I know that\u2019s hard to hear, but that\u2019s the way it is. They grieve, they heal. And ultimately, they move on. Which is precisely what you need to do.\" said by Jeremy\n\"Hi, sweetheart, how are you doing?\" said by Nikki\n\"I\u2019m good, how are you? Thank you, guys, for coming. You really didn\u2019t have to. I\u2013 I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m not gonna waste another second falling apart. It\u2019s not the newman way. Right, grandpa?\" said by Summer\n\"There\u2019s no wrong way. No right way. No newman way. Don\u2019t you stay strong just because of us, okay?\" said by Victor\n\"I\u2019m not. Believe me, I\u2013 I\u2019m seriously\u2013 I\u2019m fine. I just need to stay focused.\" said by Summer\n\"Focused on what?\" said by Victor\n\"On phyllis\u2019s memorial. Summer started putting some thoughts together before you got here.\" said by Kyle\n\"Already.\" said by Nikki\n\"Please\u2026 don\u2019t coddle me. It\u2019s not what I need right now and I\u2019m not a child. So just don\u2019t treat me like one.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay. Sweetheart, come here. Come here.\" said by Victor\n\"I mean, it still doesn\u2019t seem real. It\u2019s definitely not right. Phyllis was the embodiment of life, that fire, that passion, was always there. It was never phoned in. She lived life to the fullest at all times. Even though there were some times when I wish she didn\u2019T.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, she definitely knew how to command a room, that\u2019s for sure.\" said by Sally\n\"I think that electricity, that\u2026 spark around her is what drew me to her. I was at the lowest point in my life when she and I got together, sharon and i had just lost cassie. It was, um\u2026 I want you to know that I don\u2019T\u2026 I feel terrible, the way I betrayed sharon and I\u2019m not trying to make excuses for my behavior, but at that time\u2026 I was in trouble. I was drowning and phyllis was a lifeline for me.\" said by Nick\n\"After cassie died, I didn\u2019t think that anything could hurt me more deeply. And then\u2026 I learned about nick and phyllis\u2019s affair and that poured salt in an already opened wound. That was the beginning of nick and phyllis\u2019s relationship and it was the beginning of my rivalry with her.\" said by Sharon\n\"It must have been a long time ago.\" said by Chance\n\"Yeah, it was pretty ugly. The jealousy, the cat fights the psychological warfare. Of course, I can\u2019t blame it all on her. There were times I\u2026 gave as good as I got and probably sometimes when I went a little further than that. Look\u2026 whether you hated phyllis or you loved her, she had a talent for sparking very strong emotions and she made sure that she was a presence that could not be ignored.\" said by Sharon\n\"It was all extremes, all the time with phyllis, on both ends of the spectrum. Sometimes that was the best thing about her. Sometimes it was the worst. Uh, she was\u2026 unpredictable and exciting, stubborn and infuriating, especially when she got some idea in her head and, look out, there was no stopping her. Especially if it was something that she shouldn\u2019t be pursuing, it didn\u2019t matter. Yeah, she drove me nuts sometimes.\" said by Nick\n\"Nuts in a good way, looks like. What happened between the two of you?\" said by Sally\n\"I guess in the\u2026 long run we weren\u2019t meant to be together. But we always stayed close, you know? It was mostly because of summer but also\u2026 underneath that fierce, maddening exterior was someone with a really big heart.\" said by Nick\n\"Ultimately, phyllis and i found a way to get along. We were both part of the same extended family, so it was important that we\u2026 learned to be civil. And then\u2026 when I was undergoing cancer treatment, out of the blue\u2026 phyllis showed me genuine kindness and that was the last thing that I expected. But that was phyllis. She was\u2026 always full of surprises.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, it sounds like she was two different women. You never knew which one you were gonna run into, huh?\" said by Chance\n\"Exactly. One of them was\u2026 vicious and scheming and the other one, she was capable of love and compassion. Now they\u2019re both gone.\" said by Sharon\n\"You know, our romantic relationship, it ended a long time ago, but we have this bond that is unbreakable. She loved her kids with every fiber of her being. They love her just as much. It scares the hell out of me, thinking about how summer\u2019s gonna\u2026 find a way to get through this.\" said by Nick\n\"Darling\u2026\" said by ", "answer": "Nikki"}
{"content": "\"One second.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Hi.\" said by Adam\n\"Hi. What are you doing here?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Uh, I came to check on you. I was just, um\u2026 oh. It\u2019s like you were expecting me.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh\u2026yeah, I was just making a little lunch. If I knew you were stopping by, I would have set a place for you.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Uh, looks a little crowded there. Connor\u2019s at school, right?\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Mm. So, the actual place setting is for, uh \u2014 let me guess \u2014 billy?\" said by Adam\n\"I know you dislike him, but you don\u2019t think he should be allowed to eat lunch?\" said by Chelsea\n\"I think there\u2019s a whole lot of nice restaurants he could get a lunch in genoa city. I don\u2019t know why he\u2019s got to come here.\" said by Adam\n\"Adam, things are going well for me. I\u2019m making progress. I\u2019m putting in the work. Billy has been there for me every step of the way. Okay? He\u2019s a part of my life. So please leave your bad attitude at the door.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Some people say my bad attitude is the best quality i have.\" said by Adam\n\"Adam, I\u2019m serious. I don\u2019t need any of your negativity surrounding my friendship with billy.\" said by Chelsea\n\"It\u2019s not the friendship that I\u2019m worried about. I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s gone past the \u201cwe\u2019re just friends\u201d part.\" said by Adam\n\"Maybe it has.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Flowers and chelsea\u2019s favorite pastries. You must be headed upstairs.\" said by Sharon\n\"I am, yeah. She\u2019s making lunch. You know, I don\u2019t want to show up empty-handed. That would be in poor form.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, look at you, billy abbott. When did you become so thoughtful?\" said by Sharon\n\"[ Chuckles ] It\u2019s a box of pastries and a grocery-bought bouquet of flowers. It\u2019s not a big deal, sharon.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, it is often the small, thoughtful gestures that speak volumes.\" said by Sharon\n\"I feel like there\u2019s more to that statement.\" said by Billy\n\"I think it\u2019s really admirable, the way that you have stepped up for chelsea. You have been instrumental in her reclaiming her life.\" said by Sharon\n\"But\u2026?\" said by Billy\n\"I do worry. Obviously, the bond between you two is growing stronger.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, it is, but isn\u2019t it supposed to?\" said by Billy\n\"Yes, ordinarily. But you two came together under extraordinary circumstances, and chelsea has made great stride in her recovery, but she\u2019s still in a fragile state, billy.\" said by Sharon\n\"Hey. Did you work from home this morning?\" said by Kyle\n\"I did.\" said by Summer\n\"Sorry I didn\u2019t wake you. I went into the office early to conference with milan, and after my late night last night, it feels like I haven\u2019t seen you in forever. What\u2019s wrong?\" said by Kyle\n\"Do you really want to know?\" said by Summer\n\"Well, when you say it like that, I\u2019m not so sure anymore.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s wrong. Sally freakin\u2019 spectra.\" said by Summer\n\"I ran into summer yesterday\u2026and it was pretty uncomfortable.\" said by Sally\n\"[ Exhales heavily ] You told her?\" said by Nick\n\"Everything.\" said by Sally\n\"Everything?\" said by Nick\n\"Everything.\" said by Sally\n\"You told her all of it? You\u2019re pregnant. It\u2019s adam\u2019S. We\u2019re still together.\" said by Nick\n\"Mm-hmm. Yeah. All of it. I don\u2019t know. I-I\u2019m sorry. Really, I just thought it would be a good thing. But she just accused me of creating chaos wherever I go.\" said by Sally\n\"Sorry she said that to you.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, well, the worst part is she\u2019s not wrong. I mean, this whole thing is a mess. (Phyllis) oooh, hearts\" said by Sally\n\"I don\u2019t want to overstep, billy.\" said by Sharon\n\"I know you don\u2019T. Look, you\u2019ve been nothing but respectful towards chelsea throughout her recuperation. And, uh, it\u2019s obvious you come from a place of concern.\" said by Billy\n\"Yes, I do. And I\u2019m not chelsea\u2019s therapist, but I do have some thoughts.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, I always appreciate your input. You\u2019ve always been a big help. So, don\u2019t stop now.\" said by Billy\n\"What if you don\u2019t like what I have to say?\" said by Sharon\n\"I\u2019m still gonna listen. Look, you\u2019re a trained professional, okay? I\u2019m a fool with some flowers and some \u2014 some baked goods. But we\u2019re both concerned about chelsea, and, uh, the big difference being you actually have the experience to help.\" said by Billy\n\"Okay, so, from my objective point of view, I do worry about her dependency on you. I know that you\u2019ve made a deep commitment to helping her get through this crisis, and you have lived up to that and more. But I\u2019m here all day. I see how often you come through here to go up and check in on her. And I imagine your relationship has gotten pretty close.\" said by Sharon\n\"We\u2019re good friends. Maybe a little bit more, but i feel like that\u2019s a natural progression.\" said by Billy\n\"Of course.\" said by Sharon\n\"Look, sharon, I would never do anything consciously to jeopardize chelsea\u2019s progress.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, it doesn\u2019t have to be conscious in order to be harmful.\" said by Sharon\n\"So, you think our friendship is hurting her?\" said by Billy\n\"I think that you are too close to the situation to be aware of any of the potential dangers. She\u2019s still in a very vulnerable state, billy.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yes, but she is getting better.\" said by Billy\n\"How much of that is because you\u2019re around? We all know that a new romance is enough to buoy anyone\u2019s mood.\" said by Sharon\n\"That\u2019s a good thing, isn\u2019t it?\" said by Billy\n\"Ordinarily, yes, it can, but\u2026it\u2019s almost like it\u2019s artificially lifting her spirits. And chelsea needs to get through this on her own. It\u2019s the only way that she\u2019s going to come out the other side stronger than she was before. I\u2019m not saying that her dependency on you is causing her to regress. It\u2019s just something for you to be aware of.\" said by Sharon\n\"Hey. How you doing?\" said by Daniel\n\"Good. How are you?\" said by Lily\n\"Oh. I\u2019m good. I\u2019m good. Thank you for meeting with me.\" said by Daniel\n\"Of course. So, thankfully, jill has agreed to move forward with omega sphere even while we get everything at the company sorted out.\" said by Lily\n\"Right. Good. Well, I owe you for that. I know you\u2019ve been fighting for this, so thank you.\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, of course I have. I believe in you, and I believe in the project. And that\u2019s why I feel like, no matter what has happened with heather and no matter how you feel about it, this venture is way too important to walk away from. You\u2019ve put too much time and energy into it.\" said by Lily\n\"I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\" said by Daniel\n\"Daniel, I mean it, okay? This is not just a beautiful gift for your daughter. You\u2019re creating something impactful. And it\u2019s a way to reinvent yourself, just like heather and lucy told you.\" said by Lily\n\"You know I can be a little slow on the uptake sometimes. Plus, I needed to do some wallowing after they left. So, thank you for being patient with me.\" said by Daniel\n\"Yeah, of course. I mean, look, it was kind of like hanging out with eeyore, but, you know\u2026\" said by Lily\n\"And I\u2019m glad that you can ridicule me for it. It just makes me feel so much better about myself.\" said by Daniel\n\"Good. Good. Laughter means that you\u2019re moving on.\" said by Lily\n\"And, again, I\u2019m grateful to you for that.\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, you know who i owe a big thank-you to. Chelsea.\" said by Lily\n\"Well, good thing you didn\u2019t invite me to lunch \u2014 because after learning your relationship with billy has progressed beyond friendship, I\u2019ve lost my appetite.\" said by Adam\n\"Trust me. I know about your opinions on billy.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Listen, chelsea, come on. It\u2019s not an opinion. It\u2019s a fact. Billy abbott is a self-serving walking train wreck who cannot possibly have your best interests at heart. You deserve so much better than that.\" said by Billy\n\"Is that a fact?\" said by Chelsea\n\"It\u2019s absolutely a fact.\" said by Adam\n\"Why can\u2019t you just let go of this animosity and be happy for me that I\u2019m in a good place? You know, I\u2019m doing all the work, and good things are finally happening for me.\" said by Chelsea\n\"But, chelsea, I am happy for you. And it\u2019s actually because you are doing the work that you need to be worried. You have to keep your guard up.\" said by Adam\n\"Why do you say that?\" said by Chelsea\n\"From experience. Billy abbott is toxic.\" said by Adam\n\"[ Sighs ] Come in!\" said by Chelsea\n\"Is everything okay?\" said by Billy\n\"Perfectly fine.\" said by Adam\n\"I was actually asking chelsea.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah, but you\u2019re concerned about me being here, which is absurd. My son lives here, and chelsea is his mother, so \u2014 I know you understand the concept of co-parenting.\" said by Adam\n\"Adam, can you stop talking? I was asking chelsea if she\u2019s alright, and she can answer for herself.\" said by Billy\n\"[ Sighs ] I used to pre-rinse dishes cause my old detergent\" said by Chelsea\n\"Alright, everybody calm down. You\u2019re in my house, so you got to abide by my rules. Rule number one is you have to be kind and respectful to one another. If you can\u2019t do that, you got to leave, both of you.\" said by Chelsea\n\"I got no problem with that.\" said by Billy\n\"Sure. We\u2019re all friends.\" said by Adam\n\"You never did tell me why you stopped by.\" said by Chelsea\n\"I just wanted to check in. I wanted to see how you\u2019re progressing. You seem like you\u2019re doing well.\" said by Adam\n\"I am. And I appreciate you checking in. I really do.\" said by Chelsea\n\"I know you do. Um\u2026enjoy your lunch.\" said by Adam\n\"Thank you.\" said by Chelsea\n\"You\u2019re welcome.\" said by Adam\n\"Ooh! Flowers and pastries. Thank you.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Really not a problem, not a big deal. Just thought I would bring something sweet and pretty to put on the table for lunch.\" said by Billy\n\"Mm. So, if I invite you over for dinner, you\u2019re gonna bring something even more decadent?\" said by Chelsea\n\"You\u2019re gonna have to invite me and find out.\" said by Billy\n\"Maybe I will.\" said by Chelsea\n\"So, what\u2019d I miss?\" said by Billy\n\"You know, I think adam\u2019s just lost right now. He would never admit it, but i think he stopped by to see me because I\u2019m the most stable thing in his life right now. Imagine that.\" said by Chelsea\n\"You sound worried about him.\" said by Billy\n\"[ Sighs ] I am a little. Adam\u2019s had a lot of changes in his life recently. That can be unsettling for anyone, but especially adam.\" said by Chelsea\n\"You know, you said that the last time he came to you to get something off his chest. So, what\u2019s going on with him?\" said by Billy\n\"It\u2019s not really my place to share, but if you\u2019re so concerned about him, you should ask him.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Oh, yeah, that would go over very well. You know, I just don\u2019t want him to get into one of those phases, you know? That\u2019s when all the terrible things happen.\" said by Billy\n\"I know, but I don\u2019t think you should judge him for something he hasn\u2019t done yet.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Fair enough, and i don\u2019t want to talk about adam anymore. I want to talk about you.\" said by Billy\n\"Me?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Yes. You invite me over for this fancy lunch, and you hint at something special that\u2019s going on, on the phone. What\u2019s up?\" said by Billy\n\"I just \u2014 I can\u2019t believe this woman. I can\u2019t believe the way that she\u2019s latched onto my dad. And I cannot believe this latest stunt she\u2019s pulled.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay, whatever it is, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a reasonable explanation for it.\" said by Kyle\n\"She\u2019s pregnant.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, um\u2026 I didn\u2019t see that coming. Well, maybe it\u2019s a blessing that \u2014\" said by Kyle\n\"It\u2019s adam\u2019S.\" said by Summer\n\"You can\u2019t be serious. Okay. Well, at least she won\u2019t be in our lives.\" said by > Kyle\n\"No, my dad is sticking by her. He\u2019s committed as ever.\" said by Summer\n\"What is wrong with him? That is \u2014 wow!\" said by Kyle\n\"See? Even you can\u2019t put a positive spin on this. It\u2019s a disaster.\" said by Summer\n\"O-okay. It\u2019s a lot to take in, uh\u2026 I mean, a lot. But\u2026we can work through this. It\u2019s just a complicated situation.\" said by Kyle\n\"Complicated? Kyle, this is a nightmare.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, I doubt that.\" said by Kyle\n\"What\u2019d you just say?\" said by Summer\n\"I-I doubt that she was loving every second of it, summer. It\u2019s not like she did this intentionally.\" said by Kyle\n\"We really don\u2019t know that.\" said by Summer\n\"I think we have to operate under the assumption this isn\u2019t a stunt. It\u2019s a baby. I\u2019m sure she had a lot on her mind and a lot to worry about without considering how this situation affects you.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019m just kicking myself.\" said by Sally\n\"About what?\" said by Nick\n\"Actually thinking that summer could offer some understanding or support. I mean, there\u2019s absolutely no reason why she would or should. So I don\u2019t blame her. I mean, what was she supposed to say? How was she supposed to react? \u201cYes, I am having a baby with your uncle, but don\u2019t worry. Your father and I are doing just fine. Never better, actually, and I\u2019m so sorry still about that whole job-stealing thing.\u201d\" said by Sally\n\"That was a lifetime ago. You\u2019re a different person now.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, I know, but my life is just as chaotic right now.\" said by Sally\n\"Look, something happened that you didn\u2019t plan for. It\u2019s gonna be okay. That\u2019s the way life works. It\u2019s not ideal, but we\u2019re gonna make the best of it. And it\u2019s not like you\u2019re alone. I\u2019m right here, and I\u2019m not going anywhere. Now, I know you\u2019ve got your doctor\u2019s appointment later today. Is that something you want me to go to with you?\" said by Nick\n\"No, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s not one of the fun ones with the ultrasound and all that.\" said by Sally\n\"Alright, well, if you change your mind, call me and I\u2019ll be right there. So, here\u2019s what we\u2019re gonna do. You\u2019re not gonna worry about summer or anything else. Your doctor appointment is your focus. The baby\u2019s your focus. It\u2019s our focus.\" said by Nick\n\"Hey. How are you?\" said by Sharon\n\"I am fine.\" said by Adam\n\"And that tone says that you are not. How are things going with sally? Are you still okay with the situation?\" said by Sharon\n\"Sharon, please don\u2019t do that.\" said by Adam\n\"Do what?\" said by Sharon\n\"I don\u2019t need you to therapist me. I\u2019m just \u2014 I\u2019m here for the coffee.\" said by Adam\n\"It\u2019s called being a friend, adam. Most people show some awareness for what their friends are dealing with. I\u2019m trying to show some concern for how you\u2019re facing this because I know you\u2019re going through a rough time, but if you don\u2019t like it, there are plenty of other places in genoa city that serve coffee.\" said by Sharon\n\"There are?\" said by Adam\n\"Don\u2019t make a joke.\" said by Sharon\n\"What? Who is joking? I \u2014 I have not seen these coffee-serving establishments, so I\u2019m gonna need a list and maybe a map.\" said by Adam\n\"Mm-hmm. I know what you\u2019re doing. You don\u2019t know how to deal with your emotions, and so you\u2019re just lashing out.\" said by Sharon\n\"[ Laughs ] Are you sure you\u2019re not trying to therapist me?\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, I don\u2019t know. Maybe a little. But I know that you are going through a tough time. And I\u2019m sure that running into billy upstairs at chelsea\u2019s is the reason for your foul mood.\" said by Sharon\n\"You can\u2019t really think chelsea getting involved with billy right now is a good idea.\" said by Adam\n\"I have not spoken to chelsea, but I did give my opinion to billy just now.\" said by Sharon\n\"I mean, this guy \u2014 he has just made himself a fixture in chelsea\u2019s life, and it\u2019s like he needs her to need him and he does not care how it affects her or her recovery.\" said by Adam\n\"Have you shared your feelings with chelsea?\" said by Sharon\n\"I have. And they have not gotten through. But she would listen to you. I mean, she respects you. You guys have professional history together. I think that you should maybe say something to her \u2014\" said by Adam\n\"I think that you should stop. Some people are born to hustle.\" said by Sharon\n\"It was so great. I mean, it felt like \u2014 like fate, bumping into him.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Bumping into who? You still haven\u2019t told me who this person is.\" said by Billy\n\"Oh, sorry. Daniel.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Romalotti.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah. I pitched him an idea where we could use omega sphere to help users\u2019 mental health.\" said by Chelsea\n\"I didn\u2019t think you were that far along. I thought it was more of a preliminary idea.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, it was. But I talked to my therapist about it, and she\u2019s on board. She thinks it would be good for me, very healing to work behind the scenes on a project like this.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, that\u2019s great. That\u2019s great. How did daniel come about this information?\" said by Billy\n\"Well, I was leaving my therapy session, and I bumped into him and lily at the coffeehouse. So I just asked him. I asked him if I could share my idea, he said yes, and then it just kind of came pouring out.\" said by Chelsea\n\"And lily was there. So, how did that go? She can be a little bit of a tough crowd.\" said by Billy\n\"She listened and asked questions. I mean, she was a little concerned that maybe it\u2019s too much too soon, but she seemed to like it.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, that sounds very promising.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah. Well, I had this idea where players go through mazes and obstacles that are personal to them, relating to previous traumas in their lives.\" said by Chelsea\n\"I\u2019m thrilled that you\u2019re using your personal experience for something good.\" said by ", "answer": "Billy"}
{"content": "\"Your assistant told me you were covering for sharon.\" said by Nikki\n\"Yeah. I\u2019m just checking on a few things and I\u2019m gonna get the staff up to speed, then I\u2019m gonna head out to the ranch and check on sharon and faith.\" said by Nick\n\"Have you calmed down since you went at it with your father?\" said by Nikki\n\"Went at it, mom? Hardly. I\u2019m just sick of dad\u2019s fixation with sally. Not with cameron in town and making all these threats. Right now, sharon\u2019s making sure that faith gets out of town herself and I think it\u2019s breaking sharon\u2019s heart.\" said by Nick\n\"Honey, you really need to do something about that hand. It could be broken.\" said by Nikki\n\"Will you leave me alone about my hand, mom?\" said by Nick\n\"It\u2013 it\u2019s kind of sweet how protective you are of your ex-wife. A little sad because she no longer wants or loves you, but super sweet.\" said by Cameron\n\"You are gonna stay away from sharon and faith, and you will be gone by the morning\" said by Nick\n\"Or what?\" said by Cameron\n\"You don\u2019t wanna find out.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, my gosh. Did you see dominic with that little hand drum?\" said by Abby\n\"I did.\" said by Devon\n\"Almost. Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.\" said by Abby\n\"Did you see that picture that tucker sent earlier of dominic in class waving his little wand around, trying out conducting? It\u2019s the cutest thing in the world.\" said by Devon\n\"So cute. I think we might be a little bit biased though.\" said by Abby\n\"Oh, well. Definitely biased for sure.\" said by Devon\n\"I don\u2019t know, I just, I can\u2019t stop wondering.\" said by Abby\n\"Hm.\" said by Devon\n\"Tucker hasn\u2019t missed a single music class and that is not easy on the eardrums. I mean, is he really just trying to prove to our family that he wants to be a part of all of this? Or is this some sort of angle that he\u2019s using? Look, I know. I know it feels like I\u2019m being negative and I should just be grateful that he\u2019s doting on his grandson, but.\" said by Abby\n\"I know. He\u2019s\u2013 he\u2019s tucker and he is not the most trustworthy guy in the world.\" said by Devon\n\"Especially where my mom is concerned.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah. Well, maybe it\u2019s time that I put my plan into action.\" said by Devon\n\"Right?\" said by Ashley\n\"Right.\" said by Tucker\n\"Cheers to us.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yes.\" said by Tucker\n\"Hmm. We have to tell abby and devon about our engagement before they hear about it from somebody else, okay?\" said by Ashley\n\"Okay. How about, \u201chey, abby and devon, we\u2019re engaged. For real this time.\u201d\" said by Tucker\n\"They\u2019re not gonna be happy about it.\" said by Ashley\n\"Who cares?\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, I care. They were very upset when they found out you were moving in with me. Remember that?\" said by Ashley\n\"Ah! Speak of the devil.\" said by Tucker\n\"Wow.\" said by Ashley\n\"Talk about timing.\" said by Tucker\n\"\u201cSociety in 30. Early dinner with devon and me. My treat.\u201d Is that what you got?\" said by Ashley\n\"That\u2019s what I got.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh.\" said by Ashley\n\"That forces the issue, doesn\u2019t it?\" said by Tucker\n\"Yes. Do we accept?\" said by Ashley\n\"What do we have to lose?\" said by Tucker\n\"The timing is interesting though, don\u2019t you think? Is this a coincidence?\" said by Ashley\n\"It could be that they found out about the engagement and wanna stop the wedding. But it\u2019s not up to them, is it?\" said by Tucker\n\"I can\u2019t take any more fighting, honestly. There\u2019s so much on my plate with this jack and diane thing. I can\u2019t take it.\" said by Ashley\n\"Well, okay. What are you gonna do if they do object? You gonna put the wedding on hold indefinitely?\" said by Tucker\n\"Hmm. A preemptive promotion, huh?\" said by Jack\n\"Well, you can\u2019t deny that kicking me up the corporate ladder would send a powerful message to ashley and tucker.\" said by Diane\n\"It might also set off world war iii.\" said by Jack\n\"Well, your sister is to blame for that. What? Threatening to oust you from jabot as long as I\u2019m in the picture?\" said by Diane\n\"Have you given any thought to what position might be suitable?\" said by Jack\n\"Well, my number one requirement is I wanna work closely with my fianc\u00e9.\" said by Diane\n\"Ooh, I like that.\" said by Jack\n\"Hmm. But since you asked, I understand that our chief talent officer is set to retire at the end of the month.\" said by Diane\n\"Ha! That\u2019s right. Brenda is retiring. Any key hires go through her desk.\" said by Jack\n\"Yes. It\u2019s a key position. And I know that hr has been interviewing possible candidates, but they\u2019ve yet to fill the position. I would like to throw my hat in the ring if you think that\u2013\" said by Diane\n\"You had me at your fianc\u00e9. And yeah, the more I think about it, the more that\u2019s a perfect job for you. I can\u2019t think of anyone shrewder at reading people.\" said by Jack\n\"So you\u2019ll recommend me?\" said by Diane\n\"After everything you have been through in the last few months, feeling like you had no future, I want you to dream big. And yes, I can make this happen.\" said by Jack\n\"Good. Hmm.\" said by Diane\n\"Thanks for meeting me.\" said by Summer\n\"Uh, how bad did it get after kyle saw mom in the hotel room? I mean, I stayed with her for a little while after I was half expecting to hear sirens and have a swat team show up at the door.\" said by Daniel\n\"Well, keep listening.\" said by Summer\n\"Are you saying kyle turned her in?\" said by Daniel\n\"He found out that I knew where she was all this time and that I didn\u2019t say anything.\" said by Summer\n\"Oh, god. Summer, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know.\" said by Daniel\n\"I don\u2019t know how we come back from this, but honestly, the only thing that I could think about in that moment was saving mom. So she and I did the only thing that we could.\" said by Summer\n\"All right. Hotel security\u2019s gonna pull the surveillance footage for me.\" said by Chance\n\"Oh, it\u2019s not like they\u2019ll find anything. Phyllis knows all about cameras and how to avoid \u2019em. It\u2019s not like she was on her own either.\" said by Kyle\n\"You know that\u2019s twice now, man. You\u2019ve come pretty close to incriminating your wife. Is there something you wanna tell me?\" said by Chance\n\"I hate this. That\u2019s what I wanna tell you.\" said by Kyle\n\"Yeah, you\u2019re in a, uh, tough spot, man. I get it.\" said by Chance\n\"Okay. If there was any other way, but the truth has to come out. Summer has known where phyllis was for weeks. I can only assume she helped her escape. If your moderate to severe crohn\u2019s disease\" said by Kyle\n\"Additional sponsorship provided by\u2026 -you got this buddy.\" said by Announcer\n\"We can\u2019t be sure if abby and devon even know that we\u2019re engaged, so let\u2019s just cross that bridge when we get to it.\" said by Ashley\n\"Let\u2019S. Very reasonable.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah. Then again, knowing abby, if she knew, she would definitely voice her opinion because she\u2019s not shy, if you haven\u2019t noticed.\" said by Ashley\n\"I have. So, you think this is just a coincidence? Just a friendly invitation for the four of us to get together?\" said by Tucker\n\"Maybe. We had a nice time when the four of us ended up at neil\u2019s lounge, right? Wasn\u2019t that kind of okay? Wasn\u2019t it, right? It sounds like fun, maybe, to do this.\" said by Ashley\n\"Hey, and I love fun things, man. I love \u2019em a lot more than things that aren\u2019t fun.\" said by Tucker\n\"Me too.\" said by Ashley\n\"I know.\" said by Tucker\n\"Okay. Here we go. Oh, \u201cwe\u2026\u201d\" said by Ashley\n\"\u201cWe\u2013\u201d\" said by Tucker\n\"\u201c\u2026Would be delighted.\u201d\" said by Ashley\n\"\u201cWe\u2019d be delighted.\u201d Ugh! That\u2019s brilliant.\" said by Tucker\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Ashley\n\"You know, it\u2019s possible they won\u2019t believe a word of it, or at least they\u2019ll be suspicious.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah. Or both. Because we did tell them about, you know, the fact that we were considering a fake engagement purely for shock value.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah.\" said by Tucker\n\"I think the best thing to do is just be open and honest about both motives, right?\" said by Ashley\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Tucker\n\"You know that us being married just strengthens us in case diane becomes a problem at jabot. Although that has to be private information, you can\u2019t tell anybody.\" said by Ashley\n\"Devil\u2019s advocate though. Are we being, uh, unfair to abby by putting her in the middle of all this and making her keep up our pretense with the rest of the family?\" said by Tucker\n\"Honestly, she\u2019s gonna wind up there anyway if diane getting kicked out of jabot becomes an issue with the board. Thankfully, my daughter\u2019s very adept at straddling the fence because she\u2019s both an abbott and a newman. But you know what? Honestly, she\u2019s very much her own person, so she\u2019s not gonna just blindly follow my lead. I guess tonight, we\u2019re gonna find out whether or not I have her support, huh?\" said by Ashley\n\"Yes, we are.\" said by Tucker\n\"Okay. Fingers crossed.\" said by Ashley\n\"Fingers crossed.\" said by Tucker\n\"All right. Louise is all settled in with dominic.\" said by Devon\n\"Excellent.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah. Um, hey, you know that the original plan was just for me to spend one-on-one time with tucker to find out where his head\u2019s at with your mom, right?\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah, but it won\u2019t hurt to have some backup, right? I mean, you shouldn\u2019t have to subject yourself to that all alone.\" said by Abby\n\"No. I mean, it\u2019s not torture to hang out with the guy. He\u2019s got a couple good qualities.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay. If you say so.\" said by Abby\n\"It\u2019s true. The hard part comes when he shows his true colors and then you have to question everything he says or does.\" said by Devon\n\"Yes, that part would be torture, having to second guess everything your father says. But tonight, you won\u2019t have to be doing it alone. I will be there. You will have a second pair of eyes and ears to zero in on tucker. We won\u2019t let him slip anything past us.\" said by Abby\n\"So mom\u2019s a fugitive again out there racking up more crimes. What the hell is wrong with her?\" said by Daniel\n\"She offered to turn herself in to save my marriage, but I told her no.\" said by Summer\n\"Why would you do that?\" said by Daniel\n\"Because she needs more time to figure this out.\" said by Summer\n\"Summer, that was a mistake. We need to be handling this out in the open, not encouraging her to run and hide from the cops. I mean, it\u2019s just making things worse for all of us.\" said by Daniel\n\"I wasn\u2019t about to let her sacrifice her freedom for my\u2013 chance.\" said by Summer\n\"Chance at what?\" said by Daniel\n\"I\u2019m done playing games. Where\u2019s phyllis?\" said by Chance\n\"Sorry, mom. I\u2013 I don\u2019t mean to snap at you. I\u2019m not upset with you. I\u2019m just frustrated.\" said by Nick\n\"It\u2019s okay. So, did punching the wall solve anything?\" said by Nikki\n\"You know, I think you\u2019ve asked me that like a hundred times since I was six.\" said by Nick\n\"And I\u2019ll keep asking you that until you give me the right answer.\" said by Nikki\n\"I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if punching the wall solved anything, but it may have bought us some time.\" said by Nick\n\"Is there an update? Is cameron still in town?\" said by Nikki\n\"I haven\u2019t heard anything, mom, so I have to assume he is still here.\" said by Nick\n\"And you will let the police and your father\u2019s security team deal with it, right?\" said by Nikki\n\"Yeah. Whatever works.\" said by Nick\n\"Darling, I understand that you\u2019re worried. You wanna protect your family, but please don\u2019t forget how dangerous it got last time.\" said by Nikki\n\"Mom\u2013\" said by Nick\n\"Cameron kirsten is an animal. He needs to be handled by professionals. If he can hurt you, he will, and he will be trying to do major damage.\" said by Nikki\n\"Genoa city P.D.? I\u2019d like to report an assault. Around here, we like to keep things simple and honest.\" said by Cameron\n\"You\u2019re very relaxed.\" said by Ashley\n\"I\u2019m very relaxed.\" said by Tucker\n\"They\u2019re here.\" said by Ashley\n\"Uh-oh.\" said by Tucker\n\"Hi. Oh, thank you.\" said by Abby\n\"Hi. How you doing?\" said by Tucker\n\"Hi. How are you?\" said by Abby\n\"Hey, you two.\" said by Devon\n\"Mom!\" said by Abby\n\"What\u2019s going on?\" said by Devon\n\"Hey, son. How\u2019re you?\" said by Tucker\n\"You look beautiful.\" said by Abby\n\"Oh, my gosh.\" said by Ashley\n\"Hi.\" said by Abby\n\"Hi, ashley. How are you?\" said by Devon\n\"Good. Really good to see you.\" said by Ashley\n\"You look beautiful.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, thank you.\" said by Ashley\n\"Thank you.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah.\" said by Devon\n\"Woo!\" said by Ashley\n\"Woo! Well, um, thank you for sending that picture of dominic at his music class.\" said by Abby\n\"Oh, yeah. Yeah.\" said by Tucker\n\"Boy\u2019s a natural\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. And not only at the drums. Did you see the footage of him conducting?\" said by Tucker\n\"I loved it. Yeah.\" said by Abby\n\"He\u2019s a natural born leader, so it\u2019s in the genes.\" said by Tucker\n\"Right. Yeah.\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, well, um, let me just tell you, the chef has outdone herself this evening. Um, there is a duck and scallop special that is out of this world.\" said by Abby\n\"A duck and scallop together special. So it\u2019s like a duck stuff\u2013 stuffed with scallops?\" said by Tucker\n\"Or separately, you know. However you like it.\" said by Abby\n\"Okay.\" said by Tucker\n\"Should we get wine for the table or you guys want cocktails? What do you think?\" said by Devon\n\"Yes.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, why limit ourselves?\" said by Abby\n\"That\u2019s why I love you.\" said by Devon\n\"Ooh.\" said by Abby\n\"Okay. Stop. Anyway, we were both so happy that you invited us now because we have such great news.\" said by Ashley\n\"Really?\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah.\" said by Ashley\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Abby\n\"We\u2019re getting married.\" said by Ashley\n\"Don\u2019t everyone talk at once.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah. No. I\u2013 I don\u2019t know if we believe you, that\u2019s all.\" said by Devon\n\"I mean, is\u2013 is this real or is this for\u2013\" said by Abby\n\"It\u2019s\u2013\" said by Tucker\n\"Diane and uncle jack\u2019s benefit?\" said by Abby\n\"It\u2019s very real. And the wedding is going to happen very soon.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah.\" said by Ashley\n\"How about to new opportunities?\" said by Diane\n\"How about to our new life together with lots of opportunities?\" said by Jack\n\"Hmm. No matter what ashley says.\" said by Diane\n\"Where\u2019s summer? Is she here? I need to talk to her.\" said by Kyle\n\"No, I haven\u2019t seen her.\" said by Jack\n\"Neither have I.\" said by Diane\n\"Hey, what\u2019s wrong? What\u2019s going on?\" said by Jack\n\"I can handle it.\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle! Kyle! You can\u2019t expect us to sit back when you\u2019re this upset. What\u2019s going on?\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, we\u2019re here for you. What is it?\" said by Diane\n\"Okay. I wish I didn\u2019t have to tell you this, but I can\u2019t keep it to myself any longer.\" said by Kyle\n\"I have no idea where our mother is.\" said by Daniel\n\"You sure about that?\" said by Chance\n\"You wanna hook me up to a lie detector?\" said by Daniel\n\"What about you?\" said by Chance\n\"I don\u2019t know where she is either.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay. Well, I know she\u2019s been laying low at the athletic club. She\u2019s not there anymore. And I bet you\u2019re the one that hustled her outta there.

We might not be on anyone\u2019s top ten list yet, but we keep pitching ideas and putting ourselves out there, right?\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, out there, is right. We\u2019ve been pitching to some pretty weird places, you\u2019ve got to admit.\" said by Chloe\n\"Okay. Well, that\u2019s how we make a name for ourselves.

No one can afford us.\" said by Chloe\n\"I am not lowering my standards just to\u2013\" said by Sally\n\"What? Make a client happy or get our foot in the door so we can get this job going?\" said by Chloe\n\"Are you saying I\u2019m rigid?\" said by Sally\n\"Would it have killed you to just accept nick\u2019s offer to back our business?\" said by Chloe\n\"It doesn\u2019t matter how old you are when you lose a parent, it changes you forever.

No worries.\" said by Nick\n\"If I can just leave you with one thing, I\u2026 just know, justice will be served.\" said by Christine\n\"I believe you. It\u2019s good seeing you.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, take care.\" said by Christine\n\"What\u2019s up, man?\" said by Nick\n\"Nick.\" said by Chance\n\"How you doing?\" said by Sharon\n\"Hanging in. How about you?\" said by Nick\n\"Good. Well, better. I know you felt guilty about bringing up that wine stain on that bottle of champagne that showed up out of nowhere.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah. Saying that it looked like blood, sorry.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s okay. We both know that was silly.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, I\u2019m just glad you got rid of it.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, I can buy my own champagne.\" said by Sharon\n\"Of course, you can.\" said by Nick\n\"The message you left about finding new evidence.\" said by Christine\n\"It could be proof that phyllis is alive.\" said by Chance\n\"What do you think dad would say if he were here right now?\" said by Lily\n\"Oh, he would say, \u201cwhat took you so long? Let\u2019s celebrate.\u201d\" said by Devon\n\"I hope you know, I really hated fighting with you like that.\" said by Lily\n\"Oh, yeah, I hated fighting with you too. We got through it though. And I know neil would be the first one to sit down here and say that he was the reason we got through it too.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, my god, he so would. And now look at us, we can do this. After the dinner I survived.\" said by Lily\n\"Um, who did you have dinner with?\" said by Devon\n\"Hm. Uh, daniel, lucy, chelsea, billy, johnny, connor.\" said by Lily\n\"Oh, that sounds fun. Dinner with your ex and his date and their kids.\" said by Devon\n\"Yep.\" said by Lily\n\"And daniel.\" said by Devon\n\"Yep.\" said by Lily\n\"How are you? What\u2019s\u2013 what\u2019s going on with the two of you these days? Is there anything I should know about?\" said by Devon\n\"No, no, no, not now. I mean, we could have maybe had something, but I think the timing is off.\" said by Lily\n\"I\u2019m sure. I mean, losing a parent throws your whole world off.\" said by Devon\n\"And she was a powerhouse.\" said by Lily\n\"Yeah, I still can\u2019t believe she\u2019s gone.\" said by Devon\n\"So, nick newman is completely unaware that some of phyllis\u2019s nearest and dearest are claiming that she\u2019s still alive.\" said by Christine\n\"That\u2019s interesting.\" said by Chance\n\"I mean, isn\u2019t that information you tell your father? That phyllis still walks among us?\" said by Christine\n\"They got some complicated family dynamics at play right now. And after trauma like that, there is no normal, not for a while anyways.\" said by Chance\n\"So, what\u2019s the latest?\" said by Christine\n\"So, I went to stark\u2019s last known residence, a motel room where he was using an alias.\" said by Chance\n\"Oh, wait, please say that he left something in that room that we can use in court.\" said by Christine\n\"Nothing. I couldn\u2019t get confirmation that the shower curtain was missing. A lot of the cleaning crew turn over there, but the shower curtains they have are the same type, same brand that stark\u2019s body was wrapped in.\" said by Chance\n\"So really nothing.\" said by Christine\n\"Not exactly. I did find a program from phyllis\u2019s memorial outside the room.\" said by Chance\n\"And that would interest me why?\" said by Christine\n\"This one was stained with what appears to be mascara-tinted tears.\" said by Chance\n\"You did what? You were\u2013 you were there. You\u2013 you saw what losing you did to us.\" said by Summer\n\"I needed to know.\" said by Phyllis\n\"You needed to know what? That your plan to make us suffer was a success?\" said by Summer\n\"No. No, I needed to see how my children felt about me. I needed to know that, summer. And I saw how much pain you were in. But I knew you had something up your sleeve because you had it at the jazz lounge. So, I knew you were working something and you were fierce. You were amazing. And you had diane on a hook and you kept on pushing and you didn\u2019t let her go. And you pushed her to the breaking point.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yeah. Well, I thought that she\u2019d killed you.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah. And finally, I won. But I lost my kids and I saw how much you guys were suffering. So, did I really win? You know, you needed your mother.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Of course we did.\" said by Summer\n\"So, I didn\u2019t win, did I? And I was so vindictive and I was wrong. I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so sorry for what I did to our family. I\u2019m so sorry.\" said by Phyllis\n\"I could have accepted nick\u2019s offer.\" said by Sally\n\"We\u2019d be in business right now.\" said by Chloe\n\"But I wanted to do this on our own.\" said by Sally\n\"It\u2019s just seed money. A few thousand to sprinkle around, help us grow. Branch out. Money is opportunity and protection. It\u2019s a shield.\" said by Chloe\n\"Yeah, you\u2019re right. All across the board. And\u2013 and I would have loved to have taken the hand out.\" said by Sally\n\"Okay, great. Well, then all you have to do is pick up the phone.\" said by Chloe\n\"Okay, chloe, look at me. And please just try and see me like a newman would. All trust was gone after summer went to milan. And they choose to forget that I designed the most amazing wedding dress ever created for victoria. And then, I had the nerve to attempt a relationship with adam. And even though I put newman media on the path to success, now that I am pregnant with the newest newman, they\u2019ve probably decided that I\u2019m just going to use her as my meal ticket.\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, but it\u2019s not like he\u2019s going to invest in the company and then go tell his family that he did. I mean, they would never know.\" said by Chloe\n\"But I would.\" said by Sally\n\"He wants to give you this money because you\u2019re good and because he believes in you.\" said by Chloe\n\"I just don\u2019t want to take advantage of my relationship with nick.\" said by Sally\n\"Because of the baby?\" said by Chloe\n\"Well, yes. Yeah. Yeah, because of the baby, but also because nick has a case of the l word.\" said by Sally\n\"Love?\" said by Chloe\n\"Nick told me that he is in love with me.\" said by Sally\n\"Oh, that is so sweet and romantic and annoying because this explains the business decision. Um, well, congratulations. Really.\" said by Chloe\n\"I\u2019m just saying, the learning curve for somebody like sally is gonna be a lot steeper. She doesn\u2019t have any family in town. I mean, she\u2019s got chloe, but chloe\u2019s got her own kids and is raising her own family. I don\u2019t know. Who\u2019s gonna teach her all the baby stuff? Sharon? What\u2019s wrong? With moderate to severe plaque psoriasis,\" said by Nick\n\"I can\u2019t believe you didn\u2019t lead with this. I mean, this is the good stuff. This is the stuff that we should be celebrating.\" said by Chloe\n\"He turned my suite into a romantic oasis.\" said by Sally\n\"Ah, no.\" said by Chloe\n\"Candlelight, flowers and it was just the most amazing surprise.\" said by Sally\n\"What a guy. You know, you should do something equally unexpected. You know, something that he\u2019ll love as much as you loved your special evening.\" said by Chloe\n\"What could I possibly do to top that?\" said by Sally\n\"Take the money.\" said by Chloe\n\"Oh, my god.\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2019m kidding. I mean, well kind of, I am. I look, I am so happy that one of you geniuses finally figured it out and spoke up the truth.\" said by Chloe\n\"Oh, has it just been awful?\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s been brutal. I mean, I\u2019ve just been, like sitting there quietly just rooting for you guys. I mean, the amount of hours that I have spent talking to kevin about you and how I could just make love happen.\" said by Chloe\n\"You\u2019re a very dedicated partner and a loyal friend. So there\u2019s only one way that I can pay you back.\" said by Sally\n\"A raise?\" said by Chloe\n\"Your freedom.\" said by Sally\n\"Pardon me?\" said by Chloe\n\"I\u2019m letting you off the hook.\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2019m on a hook?\" said by Chloe\n\"Look, you have been so good to me and you\u2019ve held on through the ups and the downs and the sideways and any time that I wanted to give up, you were there to\u2013\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, there to kick you in the derriere, which is what I\u2019m about to do right now. Are you breaking up with me?\" said by Chloe\n\"Look, I love you too much to just keep disappointing you.\" said by Sally\n\"Wait\u2013 wait, are you saying this because we\u2019ve been let down yet again? I mean, come on, I\u2019m not just gonna scurry off because of that. I\u2019m sorry, but I am made of much sterner stuff than that my friend.\" said by Chloe\n\"So you\u2019re still in?\" said by Sally\n\"We\u2019re a team.\" said by Chloe\n\"Even though I won\u2019t take nick\u2019s offer.\" said by Sally\n\"We don\u2019t need it. We have something way more valuable than nick newman\u2019s money.\" said by Chloe\n\"Well, I\u2019m dying to hear what this is.\" said by Sally\n\"We have talent, tenacity, and a brilliant business plan. Jill loved it. I mean, that was before her budget came up and bit her on the bottom line.\" said by Chloe\n\"So, our mission is to find someone who is visionary enough to hire us even though we have no track record?\" said by Sally\n\"Fall in love with us, sight unseen.\" said by Chloe\n\"Or we give an old option something new to see.\" said by Sally\n\"Hm. I have something in my car for you for my favorite nephew.\" said by Lily\n\"Oh, my gosh. Stop buying him stuff. You\u2019re spoiling him.\" said by Devon\n\"What are you talking\u2013 you did the same thing with maddie and charlie. Oh, how\u2019s the co-parenting thing going, by the way, with chance?\" said by Lily\n\"Uh, I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s going well because we have the nanny take care of the drop-offs and the pickups.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, it must be nice to be rich.\" said by Lily\n\"You know what?\" said by Devon\n\"Must be nice.\" said by Lily\n\"You know what?\" said by Devon\n\"What?\" said by Lily\n\"You\u2026 you have no idea how much I missed you.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, my god, I missed you too.\" said by Lily\n\"Mm-hmm. Kinda.\" said by Devon\n\"Hi.\" said by Chloe\n\"Hello.\" said by Sally\n\"Hey, you two.

Although, you didn\u2019t have to come all the way over here to say that. What\u2019s going on?\" said by Lily\n\"I\u2019m glad you asked.\" said by Sally\n\"So, the single strand of red hair that jack and kyle find, we both know a judge could easily discount that. Hair travels. The wind, animals, clothing, you name it. We don\u2019t know when it got there, how it got there, or how long it was there before jack and kyle found it.

I\u2019ve just been playing catch up with lily out of town visiting charlie in new york, so I\u2019ve had more work on my plate, but it\u2019s all good.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh. Well, I love that you\u2019re excited to go back to chancellor-winters. I think it\u2019s a blessing the way everything worked out.\" said by Abby\n\"What do you mean by that?\" said by Devon\n\"Well, you know, I know tucker\u2019s on his best behavior right now, but I think it\u2019s good that you didn\u2019t buy his company and get wrapped up in him and mccall.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah, I agree with you. I\u2019m very happy that tucker\u2019s company is someone else\u2019s problem.\" said by Devon\n\"I dug up a little background on mccall\u2019s subsidiaries. There are a lot of vulnerable, weak spots. We should be able to find something we could take advantage of.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, I\u2019m really impressed. I love a business partner who is proactive and takes initiative.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, thank you. But you deserve all the credit. You have a way of inspiring the best in me.\" said by Nate\n\"Sorry to interrupt. I need to speak with my sister, if that\u2019s all right.\" said by Nick\n\"Tucker mccall.\" said by Audra\n\"Audra freaking charles. How do you do?\" said by Tucker\n\"Still in genoa city I see.\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah. Surprised?\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, you know, I heard you were sticking around despite your declaration that you were running off to greener pastures.\" said by Audra\n\"As\u2013 as you said, genoa city does have its appeal.\" said by Tucker\n\"I doubt it\u2019s the town\u2019s charm that kept you here. And I double doubt you decided to spend your newly rudderless, company-less existence playing pickleball.\" said by Audra\n\"Don\u2019t be so sure. I have a pretty good backhand.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, I can only assume the reason you\u2019re here is because you\u2019re still pining for the love of your life, ashley. And yet, um, where is she?\" said by Audra\n\"You\u2019re so funny. I can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re trying to convince me you\u2019re not jealous and you\u2019re actually are. Or you\u2019re not jealous in the least, but you\u2019d like to give me the impression that you\u2019re covering intense jealousy.\" said by Tucker\n\"So this textile company that victor signed over to marchetti is performing very well. Definitely helping out the bottom line. Kyle did a fantastic job getting that under the umbrella. Next would be the new line, jabot men\u2019s grooming collection. It\u2019s finally in production and pre-sales have been very promising. And, uh, I am talking to myself, aren\u2019t I? Seem to be. Jack?\" said by Billy\n\"I\u2019m sorry, what? What\u2019d you say?\" said by Jack\n\"I said what\u2019s the point in having coffee and talking about business when the only thought you have is on diane? Don\u2019t tell me this is a permanent condition.\" said by Billy\n\"I apologize. I have been distracted lately, but we\u2019re working on something that\u2019s going to really help her case.\" said by Jack\n\"Help how?\" said by Billy\n\"I can\u2019t get into the details right now, but suffice to say I am more hopeful than ever that we can clear diane\u2019s name.\" said by Jack\n\"That is good news. I\u2019m happy to hear that.\" said by Billy\n\"Which means I can officially get focused again on jabot. So, what can I take off your plate? What, uh, what\u2019s the most important thing I need to know before I jump back in? Ashley might be planning a coup. Feeling sluggish or weighed down?\" said by Jack\n\"Additional sponsorship provided by.\" said by Announcer\n\"You don\u2019t have any regrets about turning down tucker\u2019s offer, do you?\" said by Abby\n\"No, I don\u2019t at all actually. The only regret I have is not having enough time to spend with you this morning before I go to work.\" said by Devon\n\"I know. And dominic, we have a very busy morning together and then I have to go to society, and you just said that you have to cover for lily at work, so.\" said by Abby\n\"I know. I do.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay. You cannot keep looking at me like that.\" said by Abby\n\"What\u2019s gonna happen?\" said by Devon\n\"We\u2019re not gonna get anything productive done today.\" said by Abby\n\"Well, we could actually be very productive, but it seems like you\u2019re kicking me out. I guess the honeymoon phase is over, huh?\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, no, no, no, no.\" said by Abby\n\"No?\" said by Devon\n\"No. The honeymoon phase has just begun. Hm. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t feel bad about kicking you out \u2019cause we have so much time to make lots and lots and lots of love. But right now you gotta go.\" said by Abby\n\"I gotta go?\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah, you gotta go.\" said by Abby\n\"I\u2019ll go. Bye.\" said by Devon\n\"Goodbye.\" said by Abby\n\"I love you.\" said by Devon\n\"I love you.\" said by Abby\n\"Love you more. Whoa. What\u2019s with all these boxes in the hallway?\" said by Devon\n\"I have no idea.\" said by Abby\n\"Looks like nate and elena are moving.\" said by Devon\n\"I think you should increase your marketing budget on those podcasts to maximize awareness and drive more audience interests.\" said by Victoria\n\"Right. Sounds good. Well, if you\u2019ll excuse me, I will get that in the works.\" said by Nate\n\"We need to talk about some budget issues with some of our newest acquisitions.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, really? Is that what you\u2019re so anxious to discuss with me? The budget issues?\" said by Victoria\n\"Yes, vic. Actually, that is why I\u2019m here.\" said by Nick\n\"Because I get the feeling that you actually want to turn this into another lecture.\" said by Victoria\n\"Why? Because I just happen to walk in on you and nate yet again?\" said by Nick\n\"Walk in? On what? Some chemistry? Oh, how dare we.\" said by Victoria\n\"I didn\u2019t say that.\" said by Nick\n\"No, no, you don\u2019t have to say much. You just glare at me and grit your teeth. You know, I\u2019m actually impressed you were able to hold back for so long. You obviously didn\u2019t hold your opinion back from dad. He was more than happy to interrogate me after you riled him all up.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, it\u2019s not like mom wasn\u2019t gonna tell him about it anyway. And what\u2019s the deal? Is your new hot relationship with nate a big secret? Well, elena knows about it and she\u2019s certainly not keeping it to herself.\" said by Nick\n\"It\u2019s not a secret. But I would\u2019ve appreciated the opportunity to share the news myself instead of being blindsided by dad.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay. You have a point. Maybe I did speak out of turn, but my concern is for the company right now.\" said by Nick\n\"Really? Well, then please explain to me again how it was perfectly fine for you to see sally while she was working here, but me seeing nate is somehow a recipe for disaster?\" said by Victoria\n\"You just love bringing up sally, don\u2019t you? Trying to compare what was happening with us and what is going on with you and nate. But you refuse to acknowledge one big difference.\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, yeah? And what exactly is that?\" said by Victoria\n\"Sally was never gunning for my job.\" said by Nick\n\"Are you suggesting that I\u2019m jealous of what your puppy adoration of a woman who clearly doesn\u2019t feel the same way about you?\" said by Audra\n\"I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re not up to speed on current events, in that case. I\u2019ve made quite a bit of progress in that department since you and I last spoke.\" said by Tucker\n\"Have you now?\" said by Audra\n\"Yes, I have. I live in the abbott house.\" said by Tucker\n\"Uh\u2026\" said by Audra\n\"Yes. What you got to say now?\" said by Tucker\n\"What\u2019s rent like?\" said by Audra\n\"Rent free, baby.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh.\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah. Ashley said, \u201ccome in. Live with me.\u201d\" said by Tucker\n\"Wow.\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah.\" said by Tucker\n\"Unrequited co-habitation. Good for you, tucker.\" said by Audra\n\"Speaking of unrequited, how are things going with nate? You still banging your head against that wall?\" said by Tucker\n\"Actually, uh, things are going surprisingly well. You know, I\u2019d hope for a bit more, um, entertainment, but that was at first. Now, the situation as it stands, could work out better than I planned.\" said by Audra\n\"That\u2019s a fantastic way to look at it. I\u2019m surprised though because I know how much you like to be entertained. And you\u2019re at your most productive when you\u2019re mixing quite a bit of pleasure with your business.\" said by Tucker\n\"Nope. I am keeping things strictly business. You know, nate is hungry, smart, decisive. He\u2019s exactly the kind of partner that I need and want at this stage of my career. He\u2019s the right ticket to get me where I wanna be.\" said by Audra\n\"[Indistinct], Baby.\" said by Tucker\n\"Hm. You know, as opposed to a man who\u2019s only occasionally useful, mildly charming, but indecisive and weak willed and then lost everything he has in an embarrassing fashion.\" said by Audra\n\"Maybe you\u2019ve forgotten who you\u2019re talking to here. And what kind of milk?\" said by Tucker\n\"A coup. I cannot believe ashley is planning on making this move. It\u2019s not possible.\" said by Jack\n\"I said might be planning a coup. And coup is my word, not hers. But I know she floated the idea of convening the board in order to take a certain action against you.\" said by Billy\n\"I know she\u2019s upset about diane. I just never thought she would go so far as to make this move.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, she\u2019s concerned about the way diane has wormed her way back into your life in record time, despite a very checkered past. She\u2019s concerned about the undue influence that your fianc\u00e9e seems to have over you.\" said by Billy\n\"I\u2013 I thought her threats were just, you know, something she\u2019d blurted out in the heat of the moment, an intimidating tactic she had no intention of following through.\" said by Jack\n\"I don\u2019t know if she\u2019s done anything yet. But I have heard rumblings that she is gathering the troops in order to vote against you.\" said by Billy\n\"How is she justifying this? On what grounds?\" said by Jack\n\"Your unwavering devotion to diane, jack. She sees it as a sign of weakness. You\u2019re too invested. You\u2019re too concerned about a woman who could potentially end up in jail for a very long time.\" said by Billy\n\"Okay. Why are you telling me this now? You have a position on this. You agree with ashley? You also think I should step down as jabot?\" said by Jack\n\"Perhaps I misspoke. Our past collaborations have proved to be beneficial for both of us. We both got something out of it, in and out of the bedroom. That\u2019s why there\u2019s no need for insults. And besides, I doubt you would\u2019ve even put out with me if you didn\u2019t see something in my capabilities and respect my ambition.\" said by Audra\n\"That\u2019s true. On both counts.\" said by Tucker\n\"Mm.\" said by Audra\n\"Wow. I guess this is a parting of the ways for you and me. I wish you well, really. Newman media and all else.\" said by Tucker\n\"And I wish you well with ashley, I guess.\" said by Audra\n\"Oh, uh, do you mind if I give you a friendly word of warning for old time sake?\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah, sure. Warn away, old friend.\" said by Audra\n\"Don\u2019t get too cocky. Your new partner and the former dr. Hastings has proven on more than one occasion he\u2019s not above turning on those he\u2019s closest to. He can be ruthless if he feels you\u2019re no longer useful. I wouldn\u2019t get in his way.\" said by Tucker\n\"Sharon, how are you?\" said by Devon\n\"I can\u2019t complain.\" said by Sharon\n\"Good.\" said by Devon\n\"You want your usual?\" said by Sharon\n\"Yes, please.\" said by Devon\n\"Got it.\" said by Sharon\n\"Thanks. Sharon, I\u2019ll be right back.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, take your time.\" said by Sharon\n\"Thanks. Hey, you. It\u2019s good to see you.\" said by Devon\n\"Good to see you too.\" said by Elena\n\"I saw all these boxes outside your apartment. You and nate moving and not letting me know?\" said by Devon\n\"No, those were my boxes, devon. Not nate\u2019S.\" said by Elena\n\"Ah, what did he do?\" said by Devon\n\"I found out that nate\u2019s been sleeping with victoria.\" said by Elena\n\"So let me get this straight. You think that nate is after your job and that\u2019s what you\u2019re so worried about?\" said by Victoria\n\"I didn\u2019t say he was going to succeed, but he might try. It\u2019s been my concern ever since what he tried to pull at chancellor-winters. What makes you think he\u2019s not gonna try and do the same thing here?\" said by Nick\n\"And you\u2019re so damn sure that nate is up to no good with\u2013 without any proof of your suspicions and your accusations?\" said by Victoria\n\"What about his track record of deceit and lies?\" said by Nick\n\"At his former company on our behalf. That\u2019s no reason to hold a grudge.\" said by Victoria\n\"I\u2019ll tell you what, let\u2019s bring elena in here and ask her what she thinks about what nate did and just for fun, we could also bring devon and lily too.\" said by Nick\n\"This situation is very different.\" said by Victoria\n\"How about the fact that he\u2019s always in here having these little meetings with you? Don\u2019t you think he should be getting stuff done in his own office?\" said by Nick\n\"Oh, please. He reports to me. Why wouldn\u2019t we be meeting?\" said by Victoria\n\"He\u2019s been making himself very familiar with every division of newman enterprises. It seems to me he should be focusing on his own division first and foremost.\" said by Nick\n\"So now you wanna penalize the man for smart thinking and broadening his knowledge of our company. You know that there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with looking for more synergy under the newman umbrella. In my book, he should be commended.\" said by Victoria\n\"I cannot believe you cannot see this giant red flag waving right in your face. Vic, we have been here before.\" said by Nick\n\"I already told our father that there would be no repeat of the ashland locke affair. So just drop it, nick. I\u2019m in control. Just move on. Or the only person who\u2019s gonna have a problem here is you. One prilosec otc each morning blocks\" said by Victoria\n\"Nate and victoria are sleeping together. That\u2019s something I didn\u2019t see coming.\" said by Devon\n\"Well, I did. And I warned him that I was suspicious of her motives and he just kept repeatedly denying it.\" said by Elena\n\"I\u2019m sorry. You certainly don\u2019t deserve that. Are you okay?\" said by Devon\n\"I mean, it\u2019s been rough, but it\u2019s also been a long time coming. I just thought that he was gonna go back to being the man that I loved. I really believed he would change.\" said by Elena\n\"I mean, I always thought that if anyone could get nate to do the right thing, it was you.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. I gave him a chance to turn his life around and try to be the man that I thought he was and instead, he just threw that trust back in my face.\" said by Elena\n\"I don\u2019t know what he was thinking.\" said by Devon\n\"He wasn\u2019T.\" said by Elena\n\"He was obviously caught up in something.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah. And her name is victoria.\" said by Elena\n\"I mean, whatever the case is, she\u2019s clearly changed over the last year. And I know that I don\u2019t have any room to judge anyone really, but I hope that you know that you are a whole lot better than him and this.\" said by Devon\n\"Thank you. I do know that. Honestly, I\u2019m just relieved to finally be done with nate. He is swimming with sharks now. And believe me, he better be careful because the minute victoria smells blood in the water, she\u2019s gonna eat him alive.\" said by Elena\n\"Nick, what\u2019s up? I can tell you\u2019re all wound up about something.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, but I don\u2019t wanna talk about it.\" said by Nick\n\"Okay. Well, I have something\u2013\" said by Sharon\n\"Thank you.\" said by Nick\n\"I can talk about that might just put a smile on your face. I got to babysit little aria last night. She is such an adorable sweetheart. And we had fun just hanging out.\" said by Sharon\n\"It is very hard for me to imagine you as someone\u2019s grandma. You seem more like a cool aunt to me.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, they can call me whatever they want. I was just so happy to have that little angel in my arms. And her real aunt faith can\u2019t wait to come home and meet her in person.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, I talked to her. I hope she finishes up her work with her professor as fast as she can so she can come home for some much needed family time.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, you won\u2019t have to wait much longer. Our little girl will be here before you know it.\" said by Sharon\n\"I hope so. Hey, what\u2019s up with the, uh, the champagne? Are you turning this place into a bar? Because if so, pour me a drink. Sometimes coffee just isn\u2019t enough.\" said by Nick\n\"Girl, I was just thinking about you.\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah. Why?\" said by Elena\n\"I can\u2019t believe your ex.\" said by Audra\n\"Devon? He was just here.\" said by Elena\n\"No, no. The latest one. Okay. He\u2019s just sitting there acting like nothing\u2019s changed and it\u2019s driving me crazy.\" said by Audra\n\"Well, what did you expect? That he was gonna walk in shouting from the rooftops that he\u2019s sleeping with his boss?\" said by Elena\n\"I guess not. Besides, he and victoria still haven\u2019t gone public and I\u2019m keeping my mouth shut. For your sake, of course.\" said by Audra\n\"For my sake? Thank you, but\u2026 you don\u2019t need to worry about me.\" said by Elena\n\"You know, I just thought you didn\u2019t want people to know how badly nate treated you. You know, I have a feeling it\u2019s only a matter of time before nate and victoria get careless and everyone figures out what\u2019s going on with them. Look, I\u2019m sorry, but this is just not a way to run a business.\" said by Audra\n\"I really don\u2019t need to hear the gory details.\" said by Elena\n\"Of course, you don\u2019T. Look, I\u2019m sorry for going on like that when you\u2019re probably more interested in, you know, thinking about payback. Or do you plan to just walk away and let them suffer no consequences?\" said by Audra\n\"Hey, man.\" said by Nate\n\"Hey.\" said by Devon\n\"Just wanted to say, uh, thanks again for including me in the celebration for neil. It was really something special.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah, it was. It was. I wish elena could have been there. I just found out earlier why she wasn\u2019T.\" said by ", "answer": "Devon"}
{"content": "\"I know there\u2019s still a lot to discuss with you designing again, thomas, but honestly right now, all I can hear is douglas saying that he wants to come live with us again.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah. You\u2013 you must be so excited.\" said by Thomas\n\"I am. Honestly, I was beginning to think it might never happen. Oh, beth is gonna be so happy getting her older brother back.\" said by Hope\n\"Well, I think he\u2019s with our moms right now. I could grab him and bring him over to the cabin if you want.\" said by Thomas\n\"Thomas, are you\u2013 are you okay with this? I mean, I\u2013 I know. I mean, obviously, it was your suggestion that douglas pick where he lives, and I know you were hoping that he\u2019d want to live with you.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah.

She\u2013 she does.

Steffy had her convinced that he\u2019s the only designer in the whole universe that can save it.\" said by Liam\n\"What? What? That\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s insane. They have plenty of designers. He\u2019s not the only one.\" said by Wyatt\n\"You know that and I know that, but according to thomas, he and hope have a special connection.\" said by Liam\n\"Oh, god.\" said by Wyatt\n\"And it\u2019s\u2013 you know what? It\u2019s not even that he\u2019s wrong in general about that. I mean, the two of them share a kid. That\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just the whole, like, I\u2019m a changed man thing. That\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s where I get off the train.\" said by Liam\n\"Yeah. And how many times have we heard that?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Exactly. He\u2019s still the same guy, right? He\u2019s still unreliable. He\u2019s still egocentric. He\u2019s\u2013\" said by Liam\n\"Creepy.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Totally creepy.

I don\u2019t want you to take things too far.\" said by Hope\n\"No, no, no, no, no. No way. Now that guy is long gone, right? Thankfully.

A lot of that going around, huh?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Yeah. I\u2013 I wish\u2013 I wish there was something more I could do to help. I\u2019m trying to be like encouraging and\u2013 and supportive, but hope for the future is sputtering.\" said by Liam\n\"Combine that with losing douglas. It\u2019s gotta feel like a one-two punch to her, you know? I still can\u2019t believe he chose to live with steffy.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Yeah. I mean that was especially painful for hope because she\u2013 she prides herself on being not just a good mom, but a successful businesswoman. And it\u2019s annoying because all of the\u2013 all of this is thomas\u2019s fault, right? He\u2019s the one who got himself kicked out of forrester, which is why hope for the future is suffering. He\u2019s the one who pushed the whole custody issue.\" said by Liam\n\"Yeah. And I mean, hope\u2019s gotta see that though, right?

Well, I mean, I thought so, but\u2013 but then she started talking about the possibility of bringing him back to the line. And so I\u2013 I don\u2019t know. Listen, it\u2019s her business, obviously. She knows how to run it and she can do whatever she wants. But I\u2013 my thing is I don\u2019t want her to be manipulated, right? And that\u2019s why I took a stand.\" said by Liam\n\"You were being a protective husband and rightfully so.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Yes, of course, counterpoint is hope can totally take care of herself.

He cannot have a place in your lives.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Seriously. You want thomas as your lead designer?\" said by Steffy\n\"Well, pending your approval.\" said by Hope\n\"Approved. As long as it\u2019s something you really want.\" said by Steffy\n\"I mean, look, it\u2019s no secret that I wasn\u2019t exactly okay with it at first. I needed some convincing and I needed to be able to trust the people that I work with. And I needed to believe that thomas had really changed.\" said by Hope\n\"I have. I promise.And-and I will. I\u2013 I give you my word. All right. You\u2013 you too, steff.\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah. He was pretty convincing. Even my mom sounded cautiously optimistic.\" said by Hope\n\"She\u2019s never gonna forgive me for the phone call, how I affected her marriage, but she said that she would support whatever hope chose to do.\" said by Thomas\n\"You\u2019re good, thomas. Maybe I should move you over to sales.\" said by Steffy\n\"Hm. Yeah. I can\u2019t take all the credit. Mom definitely gave brooke a lot of encouragement.\" said by Thomas\n\"Hmm. Mm-hmm.\" said by Hope\n\"Their friendship has been such a game changer.\" said by Steffy\n\"Definitely a game changer for me. I mean, it changed my entire world, my life, you know. I mean, I\u2013 I was ready to accept whatever brooke said. You know, even if that meant that I could make it up to everybody, what I wanted to do all along, you know. That\u2019s all I wanted was to make it up to\u2013 to you, the whole family. And\u2013 and definitely my son.\" said by Thomas\n\"Douglas was here too.\" said by Hope\n\"Mm.\" said by Thomas\n\"Did you tell him the news?\" said by Steffy\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Hope\n\"I think he was more excited than we were.\" said by Thomas\n\"Absolutely. He always says how amazing it is when you two are getting along.\" said by Steffy\n\"And we told him it could be like that again.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah. Hope and i vowed to be a team at work and his parents.\" said by Thomas\n\"He must be so happy.\" said by Steffy\n\"He is. And actually he\u2013 he said that he misses me, he misses our family and he\u2019s actually ready to come back home.\" said by Hope\n\"Are you serious? Hope, that\u2019s great.\" said by Steffy\n\"I know. I know you know it\u2019s been really tough for me with him away.\" said by Hope\n\"Oh, yeah. I mean, I can only imagine. But I told you this is only temporary. Like, this is wonderful. Okay, so we\u2019ll\u2013 we\u2019ll reach out to the judge and we\u2019ll figure everything out.\" said by Steffy\n\"Yeah. We actually\u2013 we have a call in already.\" said by Hope\n\"Wow. Okay. Okay. So many changes around here. Speaking of changes, how does liam feel now that you\u2019re working with thomas? I\u2019m sure it took a bit of convincing.\" said by Steffy\n\"Well, he actually doesn\u2019t know yet. When asthma symptoms strike, airways narrow.\" said by Hope\n\"Well, look, I should get going. Hope\u2019s probably gonna be home soon, huh?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Yep. Maybe. Who knows? She might stay at the office and see if she can figure out how to salvage her line without thomas.\" said by Liam\n\"Look, if she can\u2019t, she\u2019ll find something else to do. Something better.\" said by Wyatt\n\"When did you become such a ray of sunshine?\" said by Liam\n\"I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I honestly think I blacked out there for a second. Look, not everything has to be dark and ominous in our lives. We get enough of that talking to dad.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Have you talked to him recently?\" said by Liam\n\"Nope. And I don\u2019t know why I would, because everything that he says just does not make sense anyway. What about you? You gonna tell him about this whole situation?\" said by Wyatt\n\"What? Tell dad that thomas is becoming a concern again? Absolutely not.\" said by Liam\n\"You know, the way things are going, maybe dad and thomas will become best friends.\" said by Wyatt\n\"Oh, god.\" said by Liam\n\"Why did I say that?\" said by Wyatt\n\"Oh. No, thank you.\" said by Liam\n\"I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m saying this, but I kinda miss him calling me a knucklehead ten times a day. It\u2019s just this whole sheila thing, it\u2013 it\u2013 it\u2019s weird. I just, I\u2013 I have no clue what to do.\" said by Wyatt\n\"I don\u2019t either. And in fact, the more I think about it, the less of a clue I have.\" said by Liam\n\"Well, you got enough on your plate. I\u2019ll handle dad. Hey, at least I get to cross thomas off the list, right?\" said by Wyatt\n\"So liam doesn\u2019t know you\u2019re bringing me back as lead designer?\" said by Thomas\n\"You didn\u2019t talk to him about it?\" said by Steffy\n\"No, I did and he was upset to hear that my line might be canceled, but I explained the situation to him and the two options and that I was considering it.\" said by Hope\n\"And one of those options being that I\u2019m coming back as lead designer.\" said by Thomas\n\"He wasn\u2019t thrilled. He insisted that I say no.\" said by Hope\n\"But you got liam to come around.\" said by Steffy\n\"Well, he\u2019s genuinely worried about me, our family. He just wants to protect us.\" said by Hope\n\"From me.\" said by Thomas\n\"From being hurt again.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah. Look, I\u2019m sorry, hope. That must have been a really hard conversation.\" said by Thomas\n\"Well, liam understands that hope for the future is very important to me, but the security and safety of our family is paramount to him and I don\u2019t disagree with that. So, by the end of our conversation, I assured him that I would tell you both no.\" said by Hope\n\"You did?\" said by Steffy\n\"Wait, so when you came here today, you\u2013 you\u2013 you planned on letting me down?\" said by Thomas\n\"I was going to tell you no. And liam does have a point. After everything that happened with douglas and beth, after how many chances you\u2019ve been given.\" said by Hope\n\"Right. But you didn\u2019T. So, something changed your mind?\" said by Thomas\n\"I love my line and I don\u2019t wanna see it end and I think it would be good for douglas to see us working together. So yes, I changed my mind. I also believe, thomas, that this time is different.\" said by Hope\n\"It is different, okay. I promise you, you don\u2019t have to worry and neither does liam. I\u2019m not gonna let you down.\" said by Thomas\n\"I still don\u2019t think liam will find that reassuring.\" said by Steffy\n\"Well, I will find a way to get through to him. The sooner I do that, the better. I don\u2019t want him finding out from anyone else, so.\" said by Hope\n\"Hope, wait. Um, I\u2013 look, I\u2013 I promise you I meant what I said. I don\u2019t wanna cause you any more pain or heartache. Okay? So\u2026 if you have to let me go in order to protect your marriage, it\u2019s okay, all right? I\u2019ll be fine with that. I\u2019m jonathan lawson\" said by Thomas\n\"I see that smile.\" said by Steffy\n\"I am happier than I\u2019ve been in a long time. And\u2013 and not just because of what hope\u2019s done for me, bringing me back to the company. I mean, that\u2013 that\u2019s amazing. But honestly, she could go home right now and talk to liam and decide that she needs to let me go, but it\u2019s the fact that she actually was willing to put her faith in me again. And you too. It just\u2013 it means the world. So, thank you for going to bat for me.\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah. Hopefully, it doe g\" said by Steffy\n\"No backsliding, okay? I don\u2019t wanna see a hint of your old behavior. You\u2019re in a really positive place right now, and I just want you to stay right here.\" said by Steffy\n\"Okay. I\u2019m not\u2013 I\u2019m not\u2013 okay. I\u2019m not changing. I\u2019m not changing. I can feel the difference in myself.\" said by Thomas\n\"Good. I know you work so hard on yourself. I really hope it pays off. I mean, our family has just been through so much and we deserve a win this time.\" said by Steffy\n\"Yeah. Um, is dad gonna feel that way about you bringing me back?\" said by Thomas\n\"Okay, thomas. We will cross that bridge when we get there. The bottom line together again. Douglas is moving back into the cabin. It feels like our family is finally coming together. I wonder if it\u2019s the opposite over at hope and liam\u2019S.\" said by Steffy\n\"No, douglas is coming to live with them again, back at the cabin. They should be celebrating. And honestly, I\u2013 I meant it. I do not have any ill will toward their marriage.\" said by Thomas\n\"I have begged you so many times to keep thomas out of your life, and when you don\u2019t, we all pay the price. I don\u2019t know what\u2013 I don\u2019t know what to do anymore. So, I\u2019m begging you again. Please, please do not hire him at hope for the future. Please do not give him that opening in your life. Please.\" said by Liam\n\"Okay. Fine. Fine. I\u2019ll tell him no.\" said by Hope\n\"Oh, my god. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You\u2019re making the right decision, I promise. I promise. Hey, you\u2019re home. You actually just missed wyatt. I\u2013 I kinda filled him in on everything. He\u2013 he was\u2013 he was pretty shocked that\u2013 that steffy would even consider hiring thomas back and\u2013 and make you go along with it.\" said by Liam\n\"Well, steffy\u2019s not the only one pushing that.\" said by Hope\n\"No. Yeah, of course. Obviously, it was thomas himself and\u2013 and taylor. I\u2019m glad we got to have a conversation before you got pressured into making a bad decision. And thank you by the way, for hearing me out \u2019cause I know that you\u2019ve been really stressed and not just about the line, but about douglas as well, so.\" said by Liam\n\"Well, um, some good news. I actually saw douglas when I was at forrester creations and he said that he\u2013 he misses us and he wants to come back home.\" said by Hope\n\"Are you serious?\" said by Liam\n\"Yes.\" said by Hope\n\"Oh, my god.\" said by Liam\n\"It\u2019s incredible.\" said by Hope\n\"Oh, my god, that\u2019s amazing.\" said by Liam\n\"Yeah.\" said by Hope\n\"Yes. So what\u2013 how did\u2013 what did\u2013 what changed his mind? Like\u2013 like why did he\u2013 why did he decide to come home?\" said by Liam\n\"Uh, well um, he saw thomas and me together.\" said by Hope\n\"Oh, thomas was at forrester today?\" said by Liam\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Hope\n\"Was douglas present when you had to tell thomas he wasn\u2019t returning to hftf? \u2018Cause I kinda feel like seeing his parents arguing is the last thing he needs right now.\" said by Liam\n\"Oh, we weren\u2019t\u2013 we weren\u2019t arguing.\" said by Hope\n\"Well, that\u2019s cool. So, thomas kinda like took it on the chin for the sake of his kid. That\u2019s good. You know, see, that\u2019s growth, right? That\u2019s good.\" said by Liam\n\"Liam.\" said by Hope\n\"What? What?\" said by Liam\n\"You know, I\u2013 I respect you and I understand where you\u2019re coming from and I heard everything that you had to say and I was ready to go in there and tell steffy and everyone what we decided, but then I heard all the different sides of the argument and I, um\u2026 I changed my mind.\" said by Hope\n\"Um, you\u2013 you changed your mind about what specifically? What did you\u2013 what did you say?\" said by Liam\n\"I asked thomas to come back to hope for the future as lead designer. Thomas and I are going to be working together again.\" said by ", "answer": "Hope"}

When inspiration hits, you know?\" said by Thomas\n\"Oh, no, I do. I do know actually. You know, inspiration always used to hit your dad when we were just sitting down for dinner.

Yes, I do love hope. I still do \u2019cause she\u2019s my friend, right? We\u2019re coworkers. Co-parents. She\u2019s a great person, right? But\u2013 but I\u2019m not pursuing her in any way.

I\u2019m steve, I lost 138 pounds in nine months on golo\" said by Ridge\n\"Okay. So this is what\u2019s so amazing about lace, right? And\u2013 and keeping with the boho design. But you put it in there sort of as a base and then you can add something else on top of it like\u2013 like leather.\" said by Thomas\n\"To give it a little edge.\" said by Hope\n\"Exactly.\" said by Thomas\n\"I like it. And we could also play with the colors and use the leather to create kind of a richer, darker tone, but then use the lace to soften it up.\" said by Hope\n\"Like taking both worlds and bringing them together.\" said by Thomas\n\"You know what, kind of like the two of you. You know, I\u2019ve\u2013 I\u2019ve\u2013 I\u2019ve never seen you guys so creatively in sync and it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s pretty cool. I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m sorry that liam is not okay with this, you know?\" said by Taylor\n\"Oh, you know, hopefully, he gets used to it because we are co-workers.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah, of course. And god, he\u2013 he has no reason to be concerned anymore.\" said by Taylor\n\"Yeah. And that may be true, but he has every reason to be skeptical of me. I mean, I\u2019ve\u2013 I\u2019ve done some pretty horrible things in the past and hurt their relationship and I never want that to happen again. And I promise that I will, moving forward, you know, win him over. Are you okay?\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah. Yeah. It\u2019s just everything is, I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re finally coming together with douglas, with hope for the future. And heck, I mean, even our moms are besties now.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah.\" said by Taylor\n\"I don\u2019t\u2013 I didn\u2019t see that coming.\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah. Nope. Neither did I.\" said by Taylor\n\"I don\u2019t think anyone could have.\" said by Thomas\n\"No. No. Look, brooke and I will always care about ridge. We really will. But you know, it\u2019s\u2013 we have families with him, but it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s nice just to be done with all the drama.\" said by Taylor\n\"It is. You know, and dad, he wants the best for everyone honestly. I think that he really respects your friendship with brooke and I don\u2019t know, he wants\u2013 he wants this family to be great. This\u2013 this very big, very weird and complicated family.\" said by Thomas\n\"What\u2019s my relationship like with my brother?\" said by Rj\n\"Yeah. That\u2019s the question.\" said by Ridge\n\"We understand if things are a bit complicated between you and thomas.\" said by Brooke\n\"Complicated\u2026 it\u2019s just what he did was messed up. Making that call to cps pretending to be mom. I\u2019m not gonna lie, it hurt when you two got separated, but I can\u2019t get caught up in all the family drama. I just can\u2019T. I\u2019ve watched my brothers and sisters go at it against each other just too many times. The whole forrester-logan rivalry, it isn\u2019t fun, especially when you\u2019re a forrester and a logan. And I\u2019m proud to be both. I have great parents and amazing brothers and sisters. We\u2019re all really, really blessed.\" said by Rj\n\"Could have used your sound mind a few years ago.\" said by Ridge\n\"Well, I think I needed to step away to develop it.\" said by Rj\n\"You\u2019ve really grown up, rj.\" said by Brooke\n\"We\u2019re both proud of you.\" said by Ridge\n\"Thank you, dad. I hope I\u2019m not coming across like I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s just, I really don\u2019t wanna get caught up in any of the family drama. It\u2019s one of the reasons why I haven\u2019t been back in so long.\" said by Rj\n\"Of course. I mean, we understand. We don\u2019t want you to have to feel like you need to pick a side.\" said by Brooke\n\"No, not at all. Family is supposed to help and inspire. It\u2019s not something we should run from.\" said by Ridge\n\"I\u2019m not running, dad. I\u2019m just trying to stay focused. You know, I think this whole latest encounter with sheila really proves that our family is much stronger unified than fighting against each other. Hell, if dad and bill can get along, there\u2019s no reason our family can\u2019t, right?\" said by Rj\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s a good point. Um, we\u2019ve been doing pretty well.\" said by Ridge\n\"Mm-hmm. Yeah. Pretty well. It\u2019s even better now though, right? Now that he\u2019s back home? And I\u2019m not gonna let you leave. I\u2019m not. Okay everyone, our mission is complete balanced nutrition.\" said by Brooke\n\"This is the collection so far.\" said by Hope\n\"I wanted vintage hope for the future to inspire the collection, not\u2013 not be a reboot, right?\" said by Thomas\n\"No, but showing its growth and development.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah. As we all have grown and developed over the time since hope for the future was launched, right? Actually, this one was zende\u2019S.\" said by Thomas\n\"I\u2013 I love it. I\u2013 I love everything. I really do. I\u2019M\u2026 you guys are a\u2013 a good team. You\u2013 you really are. You collaborate very, very well. I\u2013 I bet the bond is strengthened even more from parenting douglas together.\" said by Taylor\n\"Sorry for the intrusion, but you might wanna lap up this grand cru before I spill it. Some might call it news, others might call it gossip.\" said by Charlie\n\"What is it?\" said by Hope\n\"Well, here I am, hard at work when the front desk wakes me\u2013 walkies me and says that ridge forrester is trying to get in the building.\" said by Charlie\n\"That\u2019s the news, charlie?\" said by Thomas\n\"What?\" said by Taylor\n\"Well, security said ridge forrester was at the entrance, but ridge forrester was in his office working.\" said by Charlie\n\"So someone is pretending to be ridge and trying to break into forrester.\" said by Hope\n\"Oh, the tale of two ridges is far more complex than that my friends.\" said by Charlie\n\"Can you get to the point?\" said by Thomas.\n\"Well, the ridge at the front entrance was a real ridge. The ridge in this office was a real ridge. What? Two ridges? Two ridge forresters? How can that be? Well, there was a big ridge and a little ridge. Well, not so little anymore, I guess you\u2019d call\u2013\" said by Charlie\n\"Are you talking about rj? Like our rj?\" said by Hope\n\"Bingo.\" said by Charlie\n\"Why didn\u2019t you just say that in the first place?\" said by Thomas\n\"Thomas, our baby brother is home.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah.\" said by Thomas\n\"Well, what do you think? You\u2013 you just gonna stay for a while or you\u2013 you just gonna stay until the next festival kicks off?\" said by Ridge\n\"That\u2019s a fair question. But no, I\u2019m not just passing through. I\u2019ve\u2013 I\u2019ve\u2013 I\u2019ve really missed you guys. I miss being home.\" said by Rj\n\"Oh, honey. You don\u2019t know how good it makes me feel to hear you say that.\" said by Brooke\n\"So maybe since you\u2019re gonna stay for a while, you could be in the office.\" said by Ridge\n\"Uh, ridge\u2026\" said by Brooke\n\"Yeah. He could work as\u2013 as an intern.\" said by Ridge\n\"Dad?\" said by Rj\n\"What?\" said by Ridge\n\"What are you doing? You know how I feel about the fashion industry. I\u2013\" said by Rj\n\"I know, but it\u2019s been a while and maybe now coming back, it\u2013 it would be different. You know, you could spend some time with me, with your granddad. We\u2019d just be here and we\u2019d, I don\u2019t know, we\u2019d love to have you.\" said by Ridge\n\"I\u2013 I appreciate the offer, but I got my own thing going on.\" said by Rj\n\"Yeah. The\u2013 the online stuff.\" said by Ridge\n\"Yeah. I mean, that\u2019s stuff, being an influencer, it allows me to travel the world. Collaborate with so many artists. And\u2013\" said by Rj\n\"I know because you are an artist. We\u2013 we\u2013 we are artists.\" said by Ridge\n\"Ridge, don\u2019t pressure him. Okay? He\u2019s just finding his\u2013\" said by Brooke\n\"I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m not! I\u2019m just talking about the sketches you used to make. And they were good. You remember? They were good.\" said by Ridge\n\"Dad, thank you. I appreciate it. But come on, isn\u2019t it already busy enough here between you and granddad and hope and steffy? And not to mention thomas and zende are killing it.\" said by Rj\n\"Just because they\u2019re designers it doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t have room for you. What?\" said by Ridge\n\"Dad, I\u2019ve got my own followers. I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m building my brand. I\u2019m making my own content and it\u2019s\u2013\" said by Rj\n\"Okay. I know. I\u2013 I get that. I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m hip to all that. But here\u2019s the thing. Wait. Hey, if you\u2019re gonna create some stuff here, you design some stuff here, you could make your brand bigger. Get more followers. You know what I\u2019m saying? Please.\" said by Ridge\n\"Yes, I know what you\u2019re saying, but can you just stop for a second? He just got here.\" said by Brooke\n\"I know.\" said by Ridge\n\"Look, he\u2019s\u2013 he\u2019s here. I don\u2019t wanna scare him away, ridge. Stop. I really missed you so much. I did. I missed you.\" said by Brooke\n\"I missed you too. Martial arts is my passion.\" said by Rj\n\"Wait, so rj is here in los angeles?\" said by Hope\n\"Not just in los angeles, but in the building, mon amie. In fact, he\u2019s in the office de grand fromage with brooke as we speak.\" said by Charlie\n\"Wow. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve seen rj.\" said by Thomas\n\"Well, he is not such a kid anymore. In fact, he turned out to be quite the handsome jack. Chip off the old block, if you ask me. You can tell tell ridge I said that, okay?\" said by Charlie\n\"Okay.\" said by Thomas\n\"Okay. Well, I will get outta your hair and charlie, will go back to what charlie does best and that is keeping forrester safe from neferocity.\" said by Charlie\n\"It\u2019s not a word, charlie.\" said by Thomas\n\"Oh.\" said by Charlie\n\"This is exciting. Your little brother\u2019s back.\" said by Taylor\n\"I know. We\u2013 I was actually talking about rj with my mom this morning. I mean, she always misses him, but sometimes it just hits her really hard. So, I am sure that she is thrilled. So I am\u2026 I\u2019m gonna go see our brother.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah, you go ahead. I\u2019ll catch up.\" said by Thomas\n\"Okay.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah.\" said by Thomas\n\"Um, okay. Um\u2026 why didn\u2019t go with hope to see your brother?\" said by Taylor\n\"\u2018Cause I have stuff I have to do right now.\" said by Thomas\n\"Really? Have you talked to rj at all?\" said by Taylor\n\"No. Not in a while.\" said by Thomas\n\"No? Why?\" said by Taylor\n\"Because being at odds with his mom makes for some pretty awkward conversation.\" said by Thomas\n\"Okay. But you\u2019re not at odds anymore, so.\" said by Taylor\n\"He doesn\u2019t know that.\" said by Thomas\n\"Yeah, because you haven\u2019t talked to him in a while. See? See how that works? Come on. It\u2019d be good for you to reconnect with your brother.\" said by Taylor\n\"Do you have to do the psych thing all the time?\" said by Thomas\n\"Do you have to avoid the psych thing all the time? I wanna know how you feel about rj being back.\" said by Taylor\n\"You know, I could ask you the exact same question. How do you feel about the only child that dad and brooke ever had being back?\" said by Thomas\n\"So we\u2019re cool, dad?\" said by Rj\n\"Yeah. I\u2019m just happy you\u2019re home.\" said by Ridge\n\"We both are. And don\u2019t worry, there\u2019s gonna be plenty of time to figure out what you wanna do while you\u2019re back here in la.\" said by Brooke\n\"Well, I mean, I know I wanna work on my online brand. But don\u2019t worry, dad, I\u2019m not gonna slack off.\" said by Rj\n\"I\u2019m not\u2013 why do you\u2013 no, I know. I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m not worried about you slacking off. I know how you get when you\u2019re passionate about something. I just don\u2019t want you to forget that you have designer blood running through your veins. That\u2019s all.\" said by Ridge\n\"Rj.\" said by Hope\n\"Oh, hey, hope.\" said by Rj\n\"Excuse me. Come here. Come here. Hi. Oh, my gosh. I can\u2019t believe you.\" said by Hope\n\"What?\" said by Rj\n\"When we talked yesterday, you didn\u2019t tell me you were coming home.\" said by Hope\n\"Well, I wanted to surprise you and all of them.\" said by Rj\n\"And what a wonderful surprise it was.\" said by Brooke\n\"Well, you look great.\" said by Hope\n\"Aw, thank you. So do you. Not to mention you have been killing it with hope for the future.\" said by Rj\n\"Ah, yeah. Well, thomas does deserve some of the credit, but what about you? I mean, I\u2019ve been keeping up to date on all your exciting adventures.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah. It\u2013 it\u2019s been amazing, but I, you know, I was ready to come home. I missed everybody, especially you.\" said by Rj\n\"Does this mean you\u2019re going to stay for more than a week?\" said by Hope\n\"He better be.\" said by Brooke\n\"Yes. I\u2026 like I was telling mom and dad, I\u2019m gonna be hanging around for a while and my plans are open.\" said by Rj\n\"That\u2019s what we like to hear.\" said by Ridge\n\"Well, you were certainly missed. Right, mom?\" said by Hope\n\"Yes. So much.\" said by Brooke\n\"Oh, my gosh. Look at you. I mean, it feels just like yesterday that we were running around these halls and having dance parties in the showroom after everyone left for the day.\" said by Hope\n\"Yeah. Such are good times.\" said by Rj\n\"Yes, they were. And now we get to have some more. It\u2019s good to have you home, rj.\" said by Hope\n\"It\u2019s good to be home.\" said by Rj\n\"Oh, group hug.\" said by Hope\n\"Let\u2019s do a family hug.\" said by Brooke\n\"Everyone get in here. I\u2019m so happy.\" said by ", "answer": "Hope"}
{"content": "\"You are engaged?\" said by Kyle\n\"Uh\u2026wow.\" said by Summer\n\"Getting married. Did not see that coming.\" said by Kyle\n\"I know it sounds a little out of the blue, but if you think about it, it\u2019s really not. It seemed \u2014 well, it made perfect sense to us.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, perfect sense to you, but you have \u2014\" said by Kyle\n\"Is that something that you\u2019ve been thinking about for a while or \u2014\" said by Summer\n\"Why didn\u2019t you say anything?\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, I suppose the moment actually, uh, surprised me.\" said by Jack\n\"Both of us.\" said by Diane\n\"But our relationship has been heading in that direction for some time now, and it felt right.\" said by Jack\n\"Why this weekend? At the cabin? The timing is weird.\" said by Kyle\n\"What do you mean, kyle?\" said by Diane\n\"The two of you leave town because stark has returned, to avoid whatever potential revenge he has planned, and you come back engaged? I have to ask \u2014 is this engagement because of the threat of jeremy stark?\" said by Kyle\n\"I am. That\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019m carrying out the next phase of our plan. But it\u2019s gonna take some time. Because we need personal items of diane\u2019S. That\u2019s not gonna be easy to get. It takes maneuvering and finesse. And I feel like I need to remind you \u2014 please do not endanger my family while I\u2019m making this happen. Mr. Stark, you don\u2019t get to make threats and be impatient. I am telling you, do not hurt my family. Uh, I have to go. Alright. Bye. Bye. Hey!\" said by Phyllis\n\"Hey, phyllis.\" said by Lauren\n\"Hey, lauren.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Hey.\" said by Nick\n\"Hi there.\" said by Victoria\n\"What are you doing here?\" said by Nick\n\"Uh, I\u2019m just getting a little work done and having a glass of wine. Are you on your way up to see sally? How\u2019s she doing?\" said by Victoria\n\"Uh, physically, both she and the baby are doing great.\" said by Nick\n\"\u201cPhysically\u201d?\" said by Victoria\n\"It\u2019s a tough situation emotionally.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Sighs ] Yeah, because of adam. Whenever he gets involved, somehow it becomes more difficult.\" said by Victoria\n\"It\u2019s been difficult the whole time. I will give adam credit, though. He seems to be behaving like an adult and respecting the rules.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, that\u2019s a first.\" said by Victoria\n\"Sally was very explicit about what she wanted his role to be during the pregnancy.\" said by Nick\n\"Mm-hmm. And he\u2019s not using the fact that he is the father to his advantage? He\u2019s not trying to manipulate sally to suit whatever his agenda might be?\" said by Victoria\n\"Not yet. But I\u2019m ready for anything.\" said by Nick\n\"I just can\u2019t help feeling in my bones that things aren\u2019t over between you and adam yet. I sense some sort of eternal connection there, as if\u2026\" said by Summer\n\"What?\" said by Sally\n\"As if we\u2019re meant to be.\" said by Adam\n\"You know, one of the things that I love the most about you is that you have this ability to see the best in people. You have a very big heart.\" said by Victoria\n\"You\u2019re just jealous because you don\u2019t have a heart at all.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Chuckles ] Well, maybe that\u2019s true, but not in all cases. Anyway, it comes in handy when I\u2019m dealing with certain personalities, like adam\u2019S. You know, you have to remember who he is and what he\u2019s capable of, and you cannot take him at his word.\" said by Victoria\n\"I know. I\u2019ve been burned by it too many times.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, we all have. So, the fact that he is suddenly acting like a responsible, mature adult \u2014 that should be setting off alarm bells for you.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, I know. They are clanging in my head loud and clear. But I appreciate the reminder, especially since I know that you would prefer it if adam and sally ended up together.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, I mean, i can\u2019t lie. They do seem like they\u2019re better suited for one another.\" said by Victoria\n\"How so?\" said by Nick\n\"I don\u2019t know. I mean, their personalities just seem closer. Look, nicholas, I\u2019m not judging you. I\u2019m just saying, my observation when I look at sally and adam, they just seem like a more natural couple than you and her. Don\u2019t you agree?\" said by Victoria\n\"No. But I guess I could see why you would say that.\" said by Nick\n\"Okay. Well, if that\u2019s true, then maybe you should be asking yourself, \u201cshould I be concerned?\u201d\" said by Victoria\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Sally\n\"Roses. I know. Alarmingly clich\u00e9.\" said by Adam\n\"But still very sweet. I love some good old-fashioned romance from time to time.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, good, because that is what you\u2019re gonna get with me.\" said by Adam\n\"Ahh. I remember when you brought me flowers on my first day as ceo of newman media.\" said by Sally\n\"You didn\u2019t exactly have a classic response to those.\" said by Adam\n\"What, I didn\u2019t thank you?\" said by Sally\n\"I think it was more along the lines of, \u201cthis is such a big risk. I don\u2019t know if I have the experience.\u201d\" said by Adam\n\"God, yes. I had a total freak-out. I\u2019m very sorry.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, don\u2019t be. It was honest. And it was endearing.\" said by Adam\n\"Sure. Yeah. We\u2019re gonna go with that.\" said by Sally\n\"Of course I did. Because I know you like nobody else does\u2026or ever will.\" said by Adam\n\"That looked like a pretty intense phone call.\" said by Lauren\n\"Ah, no, that was nothing. Thank you.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Thank you. Well, it sort of felt like something.\" said by Lauren\n\"Really? No.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yeah!\" said by Lauren\n\"I mean, I was just talking to the salon. I\u2019m trying to get a mani-pedi appointment, and they can\u2019t get me in till next week, and i just \u2014 look. Look how horrible my nails are. I need to get them done. So, that\u2019s all that was. I\u2026 hey. Thank you. Thank you for pointing out that I was intense. I really appreciated it. You know what I\u2019m gonna do? I\u2019m gonna call that salon and I\u2019m gonna apologize to them. That\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do. I\u2019ve been apologizing a lot lately.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yeah \u2014\" said by Lauren\n\"Hey, but I want to talk about you. You \u2014 you\u2019ve been planning for the bicentennial party. So, I want to know all about it.\" said by Phyllis\n\"What\u2019s going on?\" said by Lauren\n\"What do you mean?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Well, the last time i saw you, you could not have been more miserable, and now you\u2019re just, like, vibrating with positive energy or energy of some sort. What happened between then and now?\" said by Lauren\n\"No, it was not the threat of jeremy stark that led me to propose.\" said by Jack\n\"How could that not have been a factor?\" said by Kyle\n\"If anything, it might have put things in perspective for me. And by that, I mean I realize i no longer want to keep looking backwards, rehashing the past. It\u2019s not fair to diane. And we\u2019ve done it too long.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. I don\u2019t expect people to forget all the things I\u2019ve done or to just let it go. I mean, I\u2019m aware that forgiveness has to be earned, and I will continue to win people\u2019s trust by the way I live my life.\" said by Diane\n\"When diane first came back into our lives, I was suspicious of her motives, of her intentions.\" said by Jack\n\"We remember.\" said by Kyle\n\"I was trying to protect you, kyle. Now, I can\u2019t remember the exact moment when I fell back in love with her, but I know it happened shortly after I realized she was trying to protect you, too. When I saw the love she had for you and for harrison, yes, it was a change of heart for me. I realized then that she is not the same person, that she is a different person with different \u2014 different priorities. Not everyone\u2019s going to agree with me, but as far as I\u2019m concerned, diane has nothing left to prove. Kyle, I asked her to marry me for one reason. I love her. I want to spend the rest of my life with her. I have not been this happy in a very long time. You have to also remember that this love started many years ago. Yes, it has been put through unbelievable tests, and still the flame has not extinguished. And we feel the full force of it now. And we can\u2019t \u2014 we won\u2019t deny it any longer.\" said by Jack\n\"And we also have the wisdom and experience that we didn\u2019t have the first time we were together. We\u2019ve both been through so much. And we have matured into different people. And we are better together than we are apart. I love my hardwood floors.\" said by Diane\n\"Kyle, diane is already an integral part of this family. She\u2019s your mother. She\u2019s harrison\u2019s dee dee. She adores that little boy every bit as much as we adore him. This is the natural next step.\" said by Jack\n\"I can see how strongly you both feel. I appreciate that. But you must know not everyone is going to see this as a natural next step.\" said by Kyle\n\"We are well aware of how others might react to this. We can\u2019t let them dictate our decisions. We have chosen each other. We want to embrace this wonderful thing that has happened to us, and we are sincerely hoping the both of you can do the same.\" said by Jack\n\"No, we want you to be happy. You have to know that.\" said by Kyle\n\"We do.\" said by Diane\n\"And you do seem happy.\" said by Summer\n\"But I am still struggling to understand why you feel the need to get married now. It\u2019s a lot to process. We just \u2014 we need some time to let it sink in.\" said by Kyle\n\"All right, that\u2019s fair. We don\u2019t want to push. We just hope that you can see it in your hearts to give us your blessing \u2014 at some point.\" said by Diane\n\"And we are trying to keep this quiet for right now. Of course, we wanted to tell you both, but if you could keep this to yourselves, we would appreciate that.\" said by Jack\n\"I will be very quiet, silent.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, we are headed to society. We\u2019ll talk later.\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, kiss harrison for me.\" said by Diane\n\"What the hell was that?\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m not worried about adam making inroads with sally, if you\u2019re asking if I\u2019m jealous.\" said by Nick\n\"Are you?\" said by Victoria\n\"No, but I am worried that he\u2019s going to cause sally a bunch of stress that she and the baby just don\u2019t need.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, just do your best to protect her. Make sure you keep your guard up.\" said by Victoria\n\"I will. I would tell you to do the same, but I know your guard is always up when it comes to adam. And just so you know, adam did confirm dad\u2019s plan.\" said by Nick\n\"And what plan is that?\" said by Victoria\n\"Once newman enterprises acquires mccall unlimited, adam\u2019s gonna be placed in charge.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Laughs ] That is never gonna happen.\" said by Victoria\n\"Look, vick, I know fighting with dad is like a newman family staple, but i really think you should consider staying out of this one. Dad wants to bring adam closer to the family, and you know how he is. He\u2019s not gonna quit until he gets what he wants.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, then I guess he\u2019s just gonna have to find another way to get what he wants.\" said by Victoria\n\"By letting adam run mccall, it keeps him out of our business and lets him focus on something else.\" said by Nick\n\"But then adam wins.\" said by Victoria\n\"Who cares, vick? Let him, if it keeps him out of our hair.\" said by Nick\n\"My plan is to fold mccall into newman, and I\u2019m not gonna let dad and adam derail that.\" said by Victoria\n\"Newman doesn\u2019t need mccall. We\u2019ve made a bunch of greatacquisitions. The company is doing great. Let\u2019s just focus on what we have. Let adam and dad go off and do whatever they want away from us.\" said by Nick\n\"Look, nicholas, i understand where you\u2019re caution is coming from, but I am not gonna pass on this phenomenal opportunity so that dad can use mccall to lure adam back into the family, which is only gonna make him more beholden to dad, like some emotional hostage. It\u2019s bad business. It\u2019s miserable parenting. You and I \u2014 we\u2019ve seen this movie before. We know that it ends in disaster for both of them.\" said by Victoria\n\"So, now you\u2019re worried about adam\u2019s emotional well-being?\" said by Nick\n\"I don\u2019t want to fight with you right now.\" said by Victoria\n\"Alright. Should we reschedule this fight for some other time?\" said by Nick\n\"Hi, nate. What a pleasant surprise.\" said by Victoria\n\"After that very unfortunate evening I had with you and michael, um\u2026 I had a moment. I had a wake-up call.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Well, good. I\u2019m glad to hear it.\" said by Lauren\n\"Yeah. And I am sorry.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Wow. Look who\u2019s getting better with the apology thing.\" said by Lauren\n\"I know! I know!\" said by Phyllis\n\"Wow.\" said by Lauren\n\"Practice makes perfect.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Yeah. You know, I so want to believe this change is positive and legit, but I still think you need some, you know, perspective and \u2014 and distance.\" said by Lauren\n\"Okay. Sure. What do you have in mind?\" said by Phyllis\n\"I have a great idea. Girls\u2019 trip. Let\u2019s go for the weekend to vegas. I have some business there, and it\u2019s not gonna take too much time, which means you, my friend, can have some fun.\" said by Lauren\n\"That\u2019s great. I would love that. You know, um, why don\u2019t we do that, but just not now. I can\u2019t get away at the moment.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Really? I mean, don\u2019t take this the wrong way, but you don\u2019t have a job and you\u2019re fighting with your kids.\" said by Lauren\n\"Why would I take that the wrong way?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Look, I\u2019m just asking you, what is keeping you from leaving?\" said by Lauren\n\"I-I just have a lot of things going on, other things, and I just can\u2019t leave town at the moment. You can\u2019t run away from your problems, right?\" said by Phyllis\n\"Honey.\" said by Lauren\n\"Evening. Lauren. Phyllis.\" said by Jack\n\"Hi, jack.\" said by Lauren\n\"Hey. You two look amazing.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Thos sincere.\" said by Diane\n\"Well, I\u2019m just pointing out the obvious. That\u2019s all.\" said by Phyllis\n\"So, let\u2019s just leave it there then, okay? An unspoiled, surprisingly civil moment.\" said by Lauren\n\"I mean, I made an effort. That\u2019s what I did. I get points for trying.\" said by Phyllis\n\"Oh, is that because you\u2019re always keeping score?\" said by Diane\n\"That\u2019s right. I was always keeping score, wasn\u2019t I? I played a game, and I lost. And you know what that caused me? Nothing but misery. Nothing but misery. But, see, I want what you guys have. That\u2019s what I want. I want romance and love and beauty. I want what they have. And, uh, that\u2019s hard to get, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s harder to sustain. Right? Especially in your current circumstance.\" said by Phyllis\n\"What circumstance?\" said by Jack\n\"I\u2019m just surprised to see you back in town.\" said by Phyllis\n\"So, elena crashed as soon as we got home, but I still had all this energy, so I wanted to see you. The latest developments with tucker\u2019s company have my mind working overtime.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah. That makes two of us.\" said by Victoria\n\"I was thinking maybe we could continue strategizing about the deal?\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah, of course. Um, nick and I \u2014 we just bumped into each other by chance.\" said by Victoria\n\"Huh. Yeah. Um\u2026 I was just coming by to see sally.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, you\u2019re welcome to stick around for the discussion, if you\u2019d like.\" said by Victoria\n\"Absolutely. I would love to hear your input, nick.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah, maybe next time. I got to get upstairs. You, uh, have a great conversation.\" said by Nick\n\"Actually, I have been going over some of the numbers that I wanted to show you.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, this page here.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah, I was going over this, as well.\" said by Nate\n\"Why are you here?\" said by Sally\n\"You know why, sally.\" said by Adam\n\"Refresh my memory.\" said by Sally\n\"Because we are meant to be.\" said by Adam\n\"I didn\u2019t say that.\" said by Sally\n\"It doesn\u2019t matter because it\u2019s something that we both know is true. Do you remember how perfect things were when we were together? I mean, of course you do. It was impossible to forget.\" said by Adam\n\"I remember.\" said by Sally\n\"And up until that moment, both of us had lived lives like we were on the outside, like we were at war with the world and ourselves. And then suddenly there was this person in front of us that understood us. I mean, I saw you exactly for who you are. I accepted you. I loved you in a way that made you feel like you didn\u2019t know what love was until that moment. We had a connection of a lifetime, and I know that you feel it just as much as I do. We are meant to be together. And that is what this baby represents. This is our love that is real. You and me, whoever, we\u2019re gonna create this incredible person. Sally? Sally!\" said by Adam\n\"[ Breathing heavily ]\" said by Sally\n\"Sally! Sally? Sally, if you don\u2019t open this door, I\u2019m gonna call security! On the count of three. One, two \u2014 are you okay?\" said by Nick\n\"[ Exhales sharply ] Get in here.\" said by Sally\n\"[ Breathing heavily ]\" said by Sally\n\"You know tucker. He has been a bit unpredictable. I thought I knew what fueled him \u2014 to win at all costs.\" said by Victoria\n\"Mm. You definitely understand that.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, so do you. I mean, we\u2019re both very ambitious, but it feels like tucker\u2019s taking a different path.\" said by Victoria\n\"Hmm. So, what do we think has changed?\" said by Nate\n\"I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not sure, but something is definitely different. Maybe after everything he\u2019s been through, maybe he\u2019s getting a little soft.\" said by Victoria\n\"Is that what age and life experience do to you?\" said by Nate\n\"Mm. Well, not to me, but for tucker, maybe. Or maybe he really does want to bridge the gap between him and devon. He has a grandchild now. And apparently he has a woman that he can\u2019t get off his mind.\" said by Victoria\n\"You\u2019re talking about ashley, who bought up his debt.\" said by Nate\n\"You know, he has been pursuing her since he came back to town. Ashley \u2014 she bought up all of his debt, yes, maybe to keep him engaged, maybe to keep him under her control.\" said by Victoria\n\"Control.\" said by Nate\n\"Yes, that\u2019s a very powerful motivator. Most people crave that.\" said by Victoria\n\"Some more than others.Just me honest about it.\" said by Nate\n\"Okay, um, let\u2019s try to connect the dots. Ashley is in a position to make demands of tucker. You think tucker offered to sell his company to devon. Is it logical that she\u2019d use her leverage to force him into it?\" said by Nate\n\"Logical? No. No. Why would ashley care about tucker\u2019s company or who he sells it to? Why would she work so hard to try to repair the relationship between devon and tucker? No. It\u2019s occam\u2019s razor. The simplest answer is usually the most likely. They\u2019re two very dynamic and powerful people with a passion for business and for each other.\" said by Victoria\n\"She\u2019s testing him to see how far he would go for her.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah.\" said by Victoria\n\"It\u2019s a game.\" said by Nate\n\"Exactly. It\u2019s a game, one that most men, I think, enjoy playing. We\u2019re not talking about ashley and tucker anymore, are we?\" said by Victoria\n\"We\u2019re talking about us.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s right. We are. Nate, we should just stop dancing around this. What is going on between the two of us?\" said by Victoria\n\"Look, I\u2026 I-I\u2019m not crazy. This engagement is impulsive, right?\" said by Kyle\n\"Buying a pack of gum at the register \u2014 that is impulsive.\" said by Summer\n\"Yeah, but now it\u2019s real.\" said by Kyle\n\"It\u2019s a little too real. I don\u2019t know if I should tell you what I\u2019m actually thinking right now.\" said by Summer\n\"Please do.\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, I\u2019m wondering if this was diane\u2019s plan all along.\" said by Summer\n\"You know how diabolical she would have to be to come to town to try to marry my dad?\" said by Kyle\n\"Maybe it was an unconscious thing. But then again, she did lure jack to L.A. Using mysterious texts and inserted herself in his life in underhanded ways. And, honestly, what about her has been on the up-and-up? It\u2019s been secret after secret. And if you tally it all up \u2014\" said by Summer\n\"No, no, no, people aren\u2019t equations. Most of the time, they\u2019re a bundle of messy emotions. You and I are examples of that.\" said by Kyle\n\"I\u2019m not disagreeing with you there. I am just worried that you and jack are turning a blind eye to something.\" said by Summer\n\"And I\u2019m worried you\u2019re never gonna be able to let go of your suspicions and give my mother a chance.\" said by ", "answer": "Kyle"}
{"content": "\"Hi.\" said by Tucker\n\"Hi. A little early in the day for this?\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, it\u2019s never too early for champagne. I thought you could use a break from all things abbott right now.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh. Very thoughtful of you.\" said by Ashley\n\"But not entirely selfless. I\u2026 I couldn\u2019t wait any longer to see you.\" said by Tucker\n\"So this is good news, right, about devon and mccall unlimited?\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh.\" said by Victoria\n\"Is this a bad time?\" said by Audra\n\"[Sighs heavily]\" said by Nate\n\"I thought you were working.\" said by Elena\n\"I didn\u2019t want to wake you since you got called back to the hospital late last night. I must have been at the gym when you got up.\" said by Nate\n\"So you don\u2019t have to go back to the office?\" said by Elena\n\"I\u2019m taking the day off. I thought we could spend some time together.\" said by Nate\n\"[Scoffs] Okay. But first\u2026 I\u2019d like to talk about what you were talking about last night with nick. Why, considering everything he\u2019s going through right now, did he feel compelled to confront you? And why does he think you\u2019re consumed with power? And are you finally ready to tell me what\u2019s actually going on?\" said by Elena\n\"Hi, mom.\" said by Mariah\n\"Well, hey. What are you doing here?\" said by Sharon\n\"There\u2019s the maternal warmth I was looking for?\" said by Mariah\n\"No, i am being maternal. It was just A\u2026reflex because I know that you hate leaving tessa and the baby at home, and who could blame you? But I\u2019m always glad to see you.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, I am going to be heading home soon, but I just wanted to come here, pick up some treats and some much needed coffee on my way back from jabot.\" said by Mariah\n\"The office? Why? I thought you were on parental leave.\" said by Sharon\n\"I am, but, uh, with diane\u2019s arrest, I just thought I could put in a few hours at work. I mean, she can\u2019t handle her own pr crisis.\" said by Mariah\n\"The whole situation is so horrible.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah.\" said by Mariah\n\"But I\u2019m sure that jack will really appreciate you stepping up at a time like this. You know, on the other hand, it\u2019s also okay for you to put yourself and your family first. I mean, the first few days with your new baby are so precious.\" said by Sharon\n\"I couldn\u2019t agree more.\" said by Abby\n\"Hi!\" said by Mariah\n\"Hi! Oh.\" said by Abby\n\"My gosh.\" said by Mariah\n\"Welcome home. How are you and tessa doing?\" said by Abby\n\"Uh, we are exhausted, but deliriously happy.\" said by Mariah\n\"Well, I remember the feeling. When can I meet little aria? If you ever want to sneak in a nap, I can totally babysit.\" said by Abby\n\"I\u2019m going to take you up on that. Uh, how are you? I know we haven\u2019t spoken since the divorce finalized.\" said by Mariah\n\"Uh, I\u2019m\u2013I\u2019m okay. You know, it can be a little complicated, but it\u2019s not all bad, which probably sounds terrible under the circumstances.\" said by Abby\n\"If you and chance weren\u2019t happy, I\u2026 I totally understand, you know? And eventually, you\u2019ll both move on with your lives.\" said by Mariah\n\"About that, um\u2026 I have some news, and I wanted you to hear it from me directly. It\u2019s something I didn\u2019t see coming until it happened.\" said by Abby\n\"So this feels very decadent, but what the hell? We\u2019re celebrating, right?\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah.\" said by Tucker\n\"Cheers.\" said by Ashley\n\"Cheers. Mm. I have orange juice if you\u2019d prefer.\" said by Tucker\n\"Would you please just tell me what happened when devon finally came around? Take it slow. Tell me the story.\" said by Ashley\n\"Sadly, that\u2019s one thing I can\u2019t offer you. Devon has decided to go back to chancellor-winters rather than take over mccall.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, that\u2019S\u2026 that\u2019s very disappointing.\" said by Ashley\n\"I\u2019m sorry. Sorry that I couldn\u2019t pull off the one task you gave me.\" said by Tucker\n\"Why are we drinking champagne? I mean\u2026\" said by Ashley\n\"I\u2019m hoping we can toast to us. I\u2019m appealing to your better angels, ashley. I haven\u2019t given up on becoming the man that you want and deserve.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, you\u2019re certainly taking your defeat in stride.\" said by Ashley\n\"Hmm. Actually, I was really stung by devon\u2019s rejection. Actually, no, not stung. I was hurt because it\u2019s been my dream to have my son take over my company and continue my legacy. But while I am disappointed for myself, I\u2019m very happy for devon and lily, because they have this really strong bond that\u2019s rare and to be cherished.\" said by Tucker\n\"You\u2019re so upbeat and magnanimous about the whole thing.\" said by Ashley\n\"And don\u2019t be so surprised. I am capable of both those things. And I think I have reason to be positive \u2019cause I give myself a little credit for devon\u2019s current happiness.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, that\u2019s a shock. You give yourself credit? Why is that?\" said by Ashley\n\"For providing him an alternative. Because when I laid out the possibility that he might sever ties with chancellor-winters and lily to take over mccall, I\u2019d like to think that inspired lily to make peace. So in a way, I did devon a service, and I\u2019m proud of that. And I hope you can be proud of me, too.\" said by Tucker\n\"Nate and I went over your langston report, and we have decided to make an offer to buy the company.\" said by Victoria\n\"That\u2019s great news.\" said by Audra\n\"I have some notes, and nate will email you the details, if he hasn\u2019t already.\" said by Victoria\n\"Uh, this is the first I\u2019m hearing about it. Uh, when did you two exactly decide to greenlight the deal?\" said by Audra\n\"Yesterday.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh.\" said by Audra\n\"You know, uh\u2026\" said by Victoria\n\"Understood. I just like to stay on top of things, like I imagine you do.\" said by Audra\n\"You\u2019ve made that abundantly clear. You\u2019re always going above and beyond, aren\u2019t you?\" said by Victoria\n\"[Chuckles] Is\u2013is that a compliment or a criticism? Look, I hope I didn\u2019t offend you during our last meeting when I talked about my own ambitions.\" said by Audra\n\"I don\u2019t offend easily.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, if there\u2019s any question, let me go on the record now. I am absolutely a team player.\" said by Audra\n\"That\u2019s good. Very good. I respect ambition, but I respect loyalty even more.\" said by Victoria\n\"I plan to emulate nate in that regard.\" said by Audra\n\"Meaning?\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, you know, just that nate\u2019s really putting in the hours and working day and night to satisfy you. There\u2019s no doubt where his loyalty lies.\" said by Audra\n\"I wasn\u2019t trying to avoid you or your questions last night. You got called into that emergency at the hospital. There wasn\u2019t much time for talking.\" said by Nate\n\"Okay. Well, we\u2019re both here now, so why is nick upset with you?\" said by Elena\n\"Truth is, he\u2019s never been thrilled that I took the job to run newman media.\" said by Nate\n\"Because victoria got rid of sally against his wishes?\" said by Elena\n\"And due to the way I left chancellor-winters. He felt like I sold out my family for a better job at newman.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh. Didn\u2019t realize you guys had such a frank conversation about it. Although I can see why he might have felt that way.\" said by Elena\n\"Because you felt the same way.\" said by Nate\n\"Luckily, we were able to get through it.\" said by Elena\n\"And I was hoping, uh, nick and I could as well. I told him I would try my best to gain his trust, you know, work hard to prove myself to him. But I guess that second chance isn\u2019t going to happen now.\" said by Nate\n\"Why? What happened yesterday?\" said by Elena\n\"[Sighs] Nick\u2019s emotions are running hot because of phyllis\u2019 death, and he might have heard something at newman that set him off.\" said by Nate\n\"Like what?\" said by Elena\n\"I\u2019m not exactly sure, but victoria loops me in on things more often than nick would like, and that doesn\u2019t sit well with him.\" said by Nate\n\"So you\u2019re saying your access to victoria is causing more problems between you?\" said by Elena\n\"Yeah, and there\u2019s nothing I could do about it. I have to take my cues from my boss.\" said by Nate\n\"Right. So let\u2019s talk about you and victoria. There are times, I wonder\u2026\" said by Elena\n\"Devon asked me to move in with him. And after some thought, dom and I moved into his penthouse yesterday.\" said by Abby\n\"Wow. [Laughs] Uh\u2026yeah, that\u2026that is, uh\u2026 that\u2019s big news. Sorry, I just need a minute to kind of wrap my head around that.\" said by Mariah\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s been most people\u2019s reaction. Sharon, you don\u2019t seem surprised.\" said by Abby\n\"Oh. Uh\u2026 well, chance mentioned it.\" said by Sharon\n\"Right. Yeah. I\u2019m\u2013I know the two of you have become friends. Um\u2026 I\u2019m really happy that he has someone to talk to. He doesn\u2019t want to discuss things with me recently, which I don\u2019t blame him for, so\u2026\" said by Abby\n\"Abby, you know that I love you and devon and chance. I\u2019m in all of your corners. I just didn\u2019t know that you and devon were so serious already. Just, it does seem a little fast.\" said by Mariah\n\"I totally get that. Yes, it does seem fast, but\u2026 I don\u2019t know. It\u2026 it just feels right. After talking to chance, of course, and he didn\u2019t object. I know this can\u2019t be easy for him, but he has been very mature, and he has handled things very civilly.\" said by Abby\n\"Well, it\u2019s probably been difficult for him, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s just going to continue to do what\u2019s best for dom.\" said by Mariah\n\"I have no doubt about that. Our child comes first.\" said by Abby\n\"I didn\u2019t see that as a kid myself, but I absolutely want to make that true for my daughter. And my heart could burst.\" said by Mariah\n\"Welcome to the club.\" said by Sharon\n\"[Laughs]\" said by Abby\n\"I have concerns about your dynamic with victoria. She has a deep-seated need for power, and you have a need to prove yourself to her.\" said by Elena\n\"Only because I want to be good at my job.\" said by Nate\n\"Obviously, I\u2019m not at newman every day, but nick is. And seeing him confront you the way that he did did not make me feel any better about whatever\u2019s going on at that office.\" said by Elena\n\"Look, I love my job. I love the opportunities it represents, but I\u2019m not obsessed with power. I\u2019m just trying to do what I can to grow newman media and show that I deserve to be in that ceo seat.\" said by Nate\n\"I never said you shouldn\u2019t love your job. That is exactly how I feel about mine.\" said by Elena\n\"But I realize I\u2019ve been a bit of a workaholic lately, and that\u2019s taken a toll on us. When you\u2019re at the hospital, you have a shift. There\u2019s a reason why you clock out\u2013 because it can be all-consuming. The business world is the same way, but there\u2019s no one else to take over when I get off. And things come up around the clock. So\u2026 lines could get blurred. But I should have set some limits. Listen, you are my top priority. I want you to know that. Feel it. That\u2019s why I took today off, because I want to work on making things right between us. And I know I told you we\u2019d find a way to balance our jobs and our relationship, and I\u2019ve been slacking in that department. [Scoffs] I missed you. And you deserve better. I promise, things will be better from now on.\" said by Nate\n\"Am I proud of you? You didn\u2019t really keep up your end of the bargain.\" said by Ashley\n\"Ashley, I tried my best to do right by devon, to prove to him that I could be a better man and a better father to him. I was just going to hand my company over to him. I offered to stay on as an advisor so I could work alongside him, so we could rebuild the business together. I mean, do you doubt my sincerity in this?\" said by Tucker\n\"I know you tried. I believe that. But I think your take on his rejection is just a little bit too shiny.\" said by Ashley\n\"No, but I actually believe, honestly believe, that\u2013 the way things turned out is gonna be the best thing for him and lily. And I can\u2019t force him to do something he doesn\u2019t really want to do. That would be putting my wants ahead of his. I have to respect his position. And despite my best efforts, he just doesn\u2019t trust me. I really want you to tell me that\u2019s not true for you.\" said by Tucker\n\"I don\u2019t know how to answer.\" said by Ashley\n\"Don\u2019t do that! Don\u2019T\u2026 don\u2019t use devon to retreat again and put up your walls, ashley. You know, there was nothing fake about our fake engagement to me. I\u2019ve opened my heart to you. I want to marry you. I want to be the husband to you that I should have been the first time. And I saw that look in your eye when I asked you, and I knew that you wanted it as much as I do, but then you pull away as you always do, because you won\u2019t let yourself believe it.\" said by Tucker\n\"I can\u2019T.\" said by Ashley\n\"[Sighs]\" said by Tucker\n\"Look, I\u2019m sorry. Maybe it\u2019s easy for you just to let go of the past and move on with your life, but it\u2019s not that easy for me. Okay? I\u2019m having a hard time doing that. But then again, you weren\u2019t the one that was deceived, right? I mean, you did really crappy, despicable things to me. And you know what? You\u2019re always going to have a roving eye, because that\u2019s just who you are.\" said by Ashley\n\"Not anymore.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yes, it is. You love the game. You know you do. You dropped in on all of us, literally, out of the blue. You hid your alliance with diane. You hid your alliance with audra. And you think I\u2019m stupid? Really, tucker, you think I don\u2019t know there\u2019s a little something going on between the two of you?\" said by Ashley\n\"I have tried every conceivable way to show you that I have changed. You have to know now that my love for you is real. Yeah. But that\u2019s not good enough for you, though, is it?\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, look how cute. I am so grateful to know this sweet little girl.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah. This is from this morning. It was her first time waking up in her new room. Although she had, uh, been up for a few hours before that \u2019cause she needed to be fed. And it definitely wasn\u2019t daytime out. The sun was not out, uh, but, uh, there\u2019s no need to get into that. I am extremely grateful for every second.\" said by Mariah\n\"Even when they\u2019re fussy and they\u2019re having their meltdowns.\" said by Abby\n\"Uh, though, right here, she happens to be very cute and very, very bubbly. Are they not like this all the time?\" said by Mariah\n\"Oh, yeah, they are. They\u2019re always a bundle of sunshine and rainbows.\" said by Sharon\n\"Oh, yeah, and I\u2019ve heard they stay that way. Yeah, the terrible twos are just a myth.\" said by Abby\n\"Wow. Okay. Well, the less cute moments make the cute moments 10 times better. I mean, just look at those cheeks and those eyes. Oh, god, she\u2019s an old soul.\" said by Mariah\n\"Well, it\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re with two people who can\u2019t hear enough about her.\" said by Abby\n\"I could talk about this baby 24/7.\" said by Sharon\n\"[Laughs]\" said by Mariah\n\"Um, abby, I want to talk to you about something. I\u2019m glad we have a moment alone.\" said by Sharon\n\"Do you want to talk about chance? I know that he\u2019s been confiding in you. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard an earful about me.\" said by Abby\n\"No. I told you a long time ago, I\u2019m very fond of you and devon and chance, and I\u2019m not judging. It\u2019s not my place to. I wanted to talk to you about mariah and tessa. I\u2019m, um, hoping to throw them a baby shower, and I really want it to be a surprise.\" said by Sharon\n\"That\u2019s amazing. That\u2019s a great idea. Yeah. We could get around mariah insisting that it\u2019s not necessary and that we shouldn\u2019t go to the trouble.\" said by Abby\n\"Exactly.\" said by Sharon\n\"Because it is no trouble at all. Showering mariah and tessa with gifts and love\u2013 they deserve it all. So you can totally do it at society. Just tell me when.\" said by Abby\n\"Good work speaks for itself, and the rewards\u2013 they just follow. You don\u2019t really have to push it.\" said by Victoria\n\"I just wanted to be honest about my intentions.\" said by Audra\n\"Hey. Um\u2026 just wanted to let you know i decided to come in and take care of a couple of things.\" said by Nate\n\"Great. Better late than never.\" said by Victoria\n\"Victoria was just filling me in on the langston deal. Exciting.\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah, yeah. It should be a good acquisition for us.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah, I agree. Have you had a chance to look at the audio book app I sent you? I meant to follow up with you about it last night, but I couldn\u2019t track you down.\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah, I was, uh, tackling some other stuff.\" said by Nate\n\"Right. Of course. Uh, you two were greenlighting the langston deal.\" said by Audra\n\"Look, uh, I should have some time this afternoon to go over stuff. Uh, let\u2019s sit down in a bit.\" said by Nate\n\"I\u2019ll be in my office.\" said by Audra\n\"So\u2026 what brings you into the office today after all?\" said by Victoria\n\"I\u2019m sorry that I can\u2019t tell you what you want to hear. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t tell you that I see us riding off into the sunset.\" said by Ashley\n\"You can. You choose not to.\" said by Tucker\n\"I never made you any promises.\" said by Ashley\n\"No, I suppose you didn\u2019T. Always consider myself a smart man. But I\u2019ve been an absolute fool when it comes to you. And I have failed at every turn. My own son wants nothing to do with me, and now the woman I love does not love me in return. But you know, you say that I\u2019m the one who enjoys the game. I don\u2019t think so. I think you\u2019re the only one playing games here, ashley. Yes, because if you never felt any genuine feelings for me, that means you were just enjoying, uh, torturing me and manipulating me.\" said by Tucker\n\"Look, that\u2019s not true.\" said by Ashley\n\"It is true!\" said by Tucker\n\"It\u2019s not.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yes, it is. Of course it is. You wanna just\u2013you love it to see me just tie myself in knots for your own amusement! Well, so much for good intentions, man. I am done.\" said by Tucker\n\"You\u2019re done?\" said by Ashley\n\"Yes, I\u2019m done with this exercise in self-flagellation.\" said by Tucker\n\"Okay, so\u2013\" said by Ashley\n\"I know when I\u2019m beat. I said I\u2019m beat!\" said by Tucker\n\"Okay. What does that mean? What does it mean, tucker?\" said by Ashley\n\"I\u2019m going to pick up this phone. I\u2019m gonna\u2013 I\u2019m gonna sell my company, and I\u2019m gonna leave this town.\" said by Tucker\n\"Okay, so now you\u2019re threatening me.\" said by Ashley\n\"No, I\u2019m telling you the truth. I don\u2019t know how you can be so cold. Of course, I don\u2019t know how I didn\u2019t see it coming. Because you love to push me and you just push me and push me right to the edge, and then you push me over, and you get some kind of sick satisfaction out of it! You know what you are? A sadist!\" said by Tucker\n\"Okay. Thank you so much for the drink. You do whatever you need to do. Want luxury hair repair that doesn\u2019t cost $50?\" said by Ashley\n\"Here you go. Coffee and pastries to keep you going.\" said by Sharon\n\"Thank you so much. You are a lifesaver. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t stay and chat longer.\" said by Mariah\n\"No, go on, get home and give aria a kiss for me.\" said by Sharon\n\"Give her a kiss for me, too.\" said by Elena\n\"Hi! You just missed an endless barrage of baby photos.\" said by Mariah\n\"Ooh, text me next time.\" said by Elena\n\"Me, too.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, we\u2019ll probably have a photo session this afternoon, so\u2026\" said by Mariah\n\"Bye.\" said by Sharon\n\"Bye.\" said by Elena\n\"Elena. What can I get you?\" said by Sharon\n\"Uh, oat milk latte, please.\" said by Elena\n\"You got it. You know, actually, I\u2019m glad you stopped by. It saves me the call. We are throwing a baby shower for mariah and tessa, and it\u2019s a surprise. Tomorrow at society. Do you think you can make it?\" said by Sharon\n\"Um, I\u2019m working nights for the foreseeable future, so yeah, I\u2019ll be there.\" said by Elena\n\"Great. It\u2019ll be so much fun. Things are really coming together for mariah and tessa. It\u2019s so nice to see. They are just happier than ever.\" said by Sharon\n\"That\u2019s the way it should be.\" said by Elena\n\"Is everything all right with you?\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah. Yeah, I\u2019m fine. Thank you.\" said by Elena\n\"Well, I was kind of wondering if\u2013 if you were taking the day off because of\u2026 you know, because of what happened between us.\" said by Victoria\n\"I was. I needed some time to consider the situation before seeing you.\" said by Nate\n\"Okay. Um\u2026I\u2019m not really liking where this is going.\" said by Victoria\n\"We made a mistake.\" said by Nate\n\"\u201cWe\u201d? Uh\u2026look, maybe you feel that way, but you can\u2019t speak for me. I don\u2019t feel like I made a mistake.\" said by Victoria\n\"All right. I made a mistake. I\u2019m the one who\u2019s in a committed relationship, one that I value deeply. Look, I don\u2019t want to be that guy who betrays the person I love, okay? Someone who risks wrecking a good thing because I lost control.\" said by Nate\n\"Don\u2019t you feel like maybe it\u2019s more than that at this point?\" said by Victoria\n\"Victoria, you\u2019re an incredible woman, and I\u2019m not denying the connection between us.\" said by Nate\n\"By that you mean a meeting of the minds, an incredible physical connection.\" said by Victoria\n\"This is about right and wrong. I am with elena. We acted impulsively without thinking about the repercussions. The fact that your brother almost walked in on us proves the point that we weren\u2019t thinking straight.\" said by Nate\n\"My brother won\u2019t be an issue. He\u2019s not that much of a hypocrite.\" said by Victoria\n\"[Scoffs] Hate to tell you, but he tracked me down last night, made all sorts of accusations, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the last we\u2019re going to hear from him.\" said by Nate\n\"What do you want?\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, hello to you, too. You know, you really know how to make a woman feel welcome.\" said by Audra\n\"Not really interested in your repartee at the moment.\" said by Tucker\n\"You used to love my repartee.\" said by ", "answer": "Audra"}
{"content": "\"Well, hello. I\u2019m glad to see you here.\" said by Nikki\n\"You\u2019re not surprised to see me back in genoa city?\" said by Victoria\n\"No. I saw nate last night at neil\u2019s tribute, so I figured you were back, too. But he didn\u2019t tell me why you had to cut your trip to la short.\" said by Nikki\n\"Uh, well, we accomplished our goal, so, uh, we decided to head on back.\" said by Victoria\n\"What happened to the idea of you extending your trip there for a working holiday?\" said by Nikki\n\"Our plans changed.\" said by Victoria\n\"Oh, I\u2019ll have my usual. Hey. You\u2019re already back from la. Did you find nate and victoria hard at work?\" said by Audra\n\"They were hard at something, but it wasn\u2019t work.\" said by Elena\n\"Ugh. I almost hate to ask.\" said by Audra\n\"You should have seen them. They were so casually intimate, even in a public restaurant. And their body language gave away everything that was going on between them.\" said by Elena\n\"Oh, my god.\" said by Audra\n\"At least nate had the decency not to deny what was going on. He didn\u2019t even try to. He just admitted it flat out.\" said by Elena\n\"Elena, I am so sorry that you\u2019re going through this. I\u2019m not sure I could have been as strong or as brave as you. But what are you gonna do? What happens now?\" said by Audra\n\"So, you\u2019ve noticed it, too?\" said by Chelsea\n\"It\u2019s impossible not to. I mean, ever since we told connor about sally\u2019s baby.\" said by Adam\n\"He\u2019s been so moody and sullen. I\u2019ve been trying to pull him out of it, but\u2013 I mean, I don\u2019t understand. So, he\u2019s okay having a big brother, but he\u2019s not okay now having a younger sister?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Yeah. He and johnny were already solid as cousins, but they\u2019ve really bonded as brothers. The only thing that I can imagine is the news about the baby was just one change too many.\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah.\" said by Chelsea\n\"You spent the night.\" said by Sally\n\"I mean, how could I leave? You pretty much demanded I activate my legendary spooning skills.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, you definitely have considerable talent in that area. Where are you off to now? Going home to see christian?\" said by Sally\n\"Yeah, I\u2019m just gonna run home and change and make sure he gets off to school.\" said by Nick\n\"Do you have time to stay here and have breakfast in bed with me? It\u2019s my treat.\" said by Sally\n\"Sounds amazing, but, uh\u2026\" said by Nick\n\"But what?\" said by Sally\n\"I have some pressing matters I need to handle.\" said by Nick\n\"Something tells me I know exactly where you\u2019re headed. You\u2019re off to fight with your father, aren\u2019t you?\" said by Sally\n\"Nick, can you please not go into battle with your father over me? Okay? I already know who victor is. All right? I know what he wants. He wants me gone. He\u2019s made that perfectly clear.\" said by Sally\n\"That\u2019s not his decision to make.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, I\u2019m still here. Can I please ask you not to turn this into a big newman family war?\" said by Sally\n\"No war. Seriously. I just gotta run home. And then, uh, get to the office. I\u2019ve got a pile of work to catch up on. What\u2019s your day looking like?\" said by Nick\n\"Well, I am meeting up with chloe to go over some design ideas before we follow up with jill. I have been doing tons of research on some workflow office ergonomics experts, \u2019cause we really need to add someone to our team.\" said by Sally\n\"I like it. And speaking from experience, those clunky chairs, sitting in them all day can really mess up your back. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re gonna find the perfect person. I have absolute faith in you.\" said by Nick\n\"Nicely done, nick. You have diverted my attention. But I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not buying it. Are you sure you\u2019re okay with putting what victor did behind us?\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2019m good. I mean it. So, just because I\u2019m not sticking around for breakfast, it doesn\u2019t give you permission to skip it. Okay? I want you to call up some food and then promise me you\u2019re gonna take your vitamins.\" said by Nick\n\"I promise.\" said by Sally\n\"That\u2019s my girl. Maybe just one more.\" said by Nick\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Sally\n\"Bye.\" said by Nick\n\"Bye. [ Sighs ]\" said by Sally\n\"Let\u2019s check back in about connor later.\" said by Adam\n\"Of course. And adam\u2013\" said by Chelsea\n\"Yeah.\" said by Adam\n\"You got a lot of time before the baby\u2019s born. Connor will come to terms with being a big brother. It\u2019s just been years of endless change for him and I think he\u2019s hit his limit. But once he meets his baby sister, he will adjust.\" said by Chelsea\n\"I really wanna believe that. Billy.\" said by Adam\n\"Good morning. Hi. Look at you.\" said by Billy\n\"Hi. What about me?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, you\u2019re smiling and seeing you smile makes me very happy.\" said by Billy\n\"Oh, well, that\u2019s a very sweet thing to say.\" said by Chelsea\n\"And, you know, adam was surprisingly civil, so maybe things are coming up roses. How\u2019s everything with connor? Is that getting any better? Is he still giving you the silent treatment?\" said by Billy\n\"Well, he goes from being sullen and moody to quiet and withdrawn. I don\u2019t know what to do. I try giving him space. I try telling him I\u2019m here if he wants to talk. I just think I need to come up with the perfect combination of what to say and how to say it in order for him to open up to me. I mean, adam\u2019s trying, too. Billy, nothing\u2019s working.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, I know you know this, but part of it is just his age.\" said by Billy\n\"I just wanna fix this for him and I don\u2019t know how to do it.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, here\u2019s the thing about what you went through, okay? You showed him that it\u2019s okay to ask for help when you need it and to talk about your feelings, okay? So, don\u2019t blame yourself for connor\u2019s normal, if painful reaction to finding out he\u2019s having a new sibling. He\u2019s a bright kid and he trusts you.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah. He\u2019s just already been through so much in his short life. You know, even navigating the stuff between adam and me.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Well, you know what, that\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s always a difficult situation for parents and for kids. And he\u2019s not even a teenager yet. Okay? Wait \u2019til he crashes that party. He\u2019s gonna want even more distance from you. Hopefully he\u2019s not starting early.\" said by Billy\n\"[ Sighs ] I just wanna hold him. Tell him everything\u2019s gonna be okay. [ Sighs ] But he won\u2019t let me.\" said by Chelsea\n\"So, what\u2019s going on? You\u2019re not yourself today.\" said by Nikki\n\"Oh, no. I\u2019m fine. I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s just the travel.\" said by Victoria\n\"Mm-hmm. But you got back last night. So, why didn\u2019t you go with nate to neil\u2019s tribute?\" said by Nikki\n\"Because devon didn\u2019t invite me. I assume that he\u2019s still angry that I went after chancellor-winters.\" said by Victoria\n\"But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what\u2019s really bothering you. Something else is going on and it\u2019s not jet lag. Did something happen? Victoria?\" said by Nikki\n\"Okay. Fine. Yes, something did happen.\" said by Victoria\n\"Business or personal?\" said by Nikki\n\"It started off as business, but my relationship with nate became much more personal.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay. So, great news. I think I found some really great candidates for our ergonomics expert and I thought maybe we could meet with them before presenting a choice to jill.\" said by Sally\n\"Okay, perfect. And I\u2019ve connected with a marketing and social media web guru who can get our new business on the map.\" said by Chloe\n\"Look at us, firing on all cylinders.\" said by Sally\n\"Until jill kills our deal.\" said by Chloe\n\"That\u2019s the sunny optimism we need.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, she\u2019s done it before.\" said by Chloe\n\"Not this time. Okay? I\u2019m sure that jill is on our side.\" said by Sally\n\"Is that her? Is it jill?\" said by Chloe\n\"Jill, hi. We were just about to call you. You are going to love our latest ideas for your chicago offices and we actually have some staffing suggestions that\u2013\" said by Sally\n\"Oh\u2026 sometimes, the lows of bipolar depression\" said by Chloe\n\"It is over. I told nate he could go straight to hell.\" said by Elena\n\"Uh, wow. How are you doing?\" said by Audra\n\"Well, I was beyond furious when I left la, but now I guess I am just numb.\" said by Elena\n\"Do you think you might forgive nate for his transgression?\" said by Audra\n\"[ Chuckles ] No. There is no going back for us. I couldn\u2019t even sleep in our bed last night.\" said by Elena\n\"Mm.\" said by Audra\n\"I packed a suitcase, left my key, and I walked away.\" said by Elena\n\"You know, when you love someone, um, as much as you seem to love nate, you don\u2019t just get over it and forget all the pain.\" said by Audra\n\"Even after I left, I couldn\u2019t sleep. I just kept thinking about why I put so much energy into that relationship. And then it finally occurred to me that it was because of what we did to devon. I guess I felt like\u2026 if my relationship with nate wasn\u2019t real and lasting, then I hurt devon for nothing.\" said by Elena\n\"No, I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t just for nothing.\" said by Audra\n\"I put everything I had into that relationship. I bent over backwards making excuses for nate. I held on to hope that he would somehow revert back into the man that I fell in love with. But I am done trying to save nate from himself. And I know that none of this is my fault. It\u2019s all on him. And I\u2019ve been disappointed with him since the day that he started working at chancellor-winters. But now\u2026 I\u2019m just disgusted. So, victoria can have him. In fact, they deserve each other.\" said by Elena\n\"So, when you say something more than business, am I to assume that you\u2013\" said by Nikki\n\"Yes, mom, you can assume.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, I\u2019m very surprised to hear that because I thought nate and elena were still together.\" said by Nikki\n\"They were. Until she surprised us both and showed up at the hotel in los angeles. Apparently, she sensed that something was going on, so nate confessed.\" said by Victoria\n\"So, this has been going on for a while?\" said by Nikki\n\"Yes. This mutual attraction that we share has been building for some time. And you\u2019re right, we have acted on it before this trip to los angeles.\" said by Victoria\n\"You know, I see so much of your father in you. You\u2019re taking the same tone he would have, almost daring anybody who questions his decisions.\" said by Nikki\n\"And dad would be right in that regard. This is my life. I know what I feel. And nate and I, we tried very hard to keep things professional, but we can\u2019t deny this connection that we have. And I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t control what people think about that.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay. All right. That\u2019s fine. You feel the way you feel. But exactly what is this undeniable connection the two of you share? And have you taken a moment to consider how that might impact the company?\" said by Nikki\n\"Morning, guys.\" said by Nick\n\"Hey.\" said by Billy\n\"Morning, dad.\" said by Nick\n\"Hey, son.\" said by Victor\n\"Just can\u2019t help yourself, can you?\" said by Nick\n\"What are you talking about?\" said by Victor\n\"You keep interfering in sally\u2019s life, but this time you\u2019ve gone too far.\" said by Nick\n\"Really?\" said by Victor\n\"Now you don\u2019t just wanna banish her from the family or genoa city, now you wanna take her baby away from her.\" said by Nick\n\"Thanks, jill.\" said by Sally\n\"What did she say? Was it as bad as it sounded? Have we been fired before we\u2019ve even been hired?\" said by Chloe\n\"So, even though jill is still very intrigued by our pitch, she wants to wait. Just chancellor-winters has decided not to take on any large scale commercial projects for the foreseeable future. So, good news is it\u2019s not a no, just a not right now.\" said by Sally\n\"Well, it\u2019s a good thing I didn\u2019t order those 5,000 new desk lamps.\" said by Chloe\n\"I don\u2019t know. We\u2019ve been so focused on the potential of this massive job that we haven\u2019t even tried to pursue any other clients. I just was really counting on catching the big fish and using it as bait to open countless more doors for us.\" said by Sally\n\"And without it, we have no portfolio and no track record to tout.\" said by Chloe\n\"Yeah, unfortunately, we are back at square one.\" said by Sally\n\"What\u2019s going on?\" said by Adam\n\"Um, okay, well, I guess I should get going. Um, you know, I have to actually pick up some snacks for miles\u2019 class party anyway. Just, we\u2019ll talk tomorrow. Okay? And I don\u2019t want you to stress anymore over this, because we are going to come back stronger and better than ever. How\u2019s that for phony optimism?\" said by Chloe\n\"How bad is it?\" said by Adam\n\"Well, it appears that I won\u2019t have any income coming in anytime soon. The design job that chloe and I were hoping to score has been postponed indefinitely.\" said by Sally\n\"I am sorry to hear that. Man, that\u2019s bad timing. You would\u2019ve done great in the job.\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah, I have a feeling we absolutely would\u2019ve killed it. But unfortunately, chloe and i put all of our eggs in one basket. But at least I still have some savings to rely on, so\u2026\" said by Sally\n\"Okay. I\u2019m not liking the sound of that. Once you dip into that, it\u2019s gone forever. I\u2013 I have another idea.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay. Please tell me you\u2019re not talking about the trust for our daughter, because there\u2019s absolutely no way that I\u2019m gonna accept that for myself.\" said by Sally\n\"No, no. No, you\u2019re misunderstanding me completely. I\u2019m not offering you cash. I\u2019m offering you a job, working for me. Good checkup?\" said by Adam\n\"I wonder what that\u2019s about.\" said by Chelsea\n\"[ Chuckles ] It\u2019s victor being victor, you know? Spreading joy and sunshine everywhere he goes. Whatever it is, I think it\u2019s best that we stay far away from that.\" said by Billy\n\"Oh, I agree, wholeheartedly. The last thing I need is victor using any of his classic victor newman moves to try to handle any of my son\u2019s issues.\" said by Chelsea\n\"That\u2019s a very good point. You know what? I think I might have a potential solution of my own on that matter. What about a\u2013 a classic distraction for the young man?\" said by Billy\n\"Like what?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Why don\u2019t we plan another get-together for johnny and connor? You know, our boys always have a good time together. They happen to cheer each other up, which is always good. And it could be a fantastic reminder for connor that having a sibling\u2013 not all that bad.\" said by Billy\n\"I love that idea. Anything to get connor out of this funk.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Yeah.\" said by Billy\n\"Hey!\" said by Chelsea\n\"Hey.\" said by Chloe\n\"Uh-oh. I know that look. What\u2019s wrong?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Oh, a big fat disappointing setback.\" said by Chloe\n\"What happened?\" said by Chelsea\n\"Um, jill\u2019s not moving forward with our project. And we were on such a roll. We were this close to signing a deal.\" said by Chloe\n\"I\u2019m sorry to hear that. Do you, uh\u2013 do you want me to put in a good word with my mother?\" said by Billy\n\"Um, would that work? Does she ever listen to you?\" said by Chloe\n\"First time for everything.\" said by Billy\n\"[ Laughs ] Thanks, but no. I\u2019m just, you know, gonna try to look on the bright side. I mean, it\u2019s really hard to do considering the circumstances. I mean, you just think you\u2019re gonna take over the world and everything just goes, \u201cpfffft.\u201d\" said by Chloe\n\"I know what you need. A girl\u2019s night. It\u2019s been too long.\" said by Chelsea\n\"[ Laughs ] No, what we need is a girls\u2019 two week vacation\u2013\" said by Chloe\n\"Ah.\" said by Chelsea\n\"But, um, yeah, I\u2019ll settle for a night out.\" said by Chloe\n\"Yeah, you\u2019re right. If I don\u2019t leave now, I\u2019m gonna be late for therapy. I\u2019m not letting you skate on a girl\u2019s night. And as for you, I\u2019ll call you later.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Sounds good.\" said by Billy\n\"Bye.\" said by Chelsea\n\"Bye.\" said by Chloe\n\"Well, well, well. Look at you, mr. Responsibility. You\u2019ve really stepped up.\" said by Chloe\n\"So, that\u2019s how sally spectra described our meeting? That I was ready to kidnap her child that hasn\u2019t even been born yet? That\u2019s a gross misinterpretation of what I intended.\" said by Victor\n\"We both know that\u2019s not the case.\" said by Nick\n\"Do I have to remind you that we are the newmans? Do you know how many people over the past have tried to take advantage of us, and still do? That\u2019s what I\u2019m vigilant against.\" said by Victor\n\"She\u2019s having a baby. That is your defense?\" said by Nick\n\"I will not be taken advantage of.\" said by Victor\n\"Okay, so, you\u2019re trying to pay off the mother of your granddaughter. That is an overreaction. But thankfully, sally told you she is not for sale.\" said by Nick\n\"Huh? Has it occurred to you that by turning me down, she was simply angling for, you know, something more substantial? Upping the ante, as it were?\" said by Victor\n\"This is not a negotiation.\" said by Nick\n\"Everything is negotiable, son.\" said by Victor\n\"It\u2019s not, dad. Not this. See, I know you would never try and take away a baby from its mother.\" said by Nick\n\"From the wrong mother, I damn well would.\" said by Victor\n\"No, you wouldn\u2019T. It goes against everything that you stand for. This is one of your tests. But see, sally doesn\u2019t know that. She thinks it\u2019s a legitimate offer, but she turned you down. She passed your test. Leave her and the baby alone.\" said by Nick\n\"How am I supposed to work for you when you don\u2019t even work anywhere yourself?\" said by Sally\n\"[ Scoffs ] I\u2019m talking about mccall. It\u2019s the most appealing offer on the table for me right now. And if it comes with the added benefit of providing you with gainful employment, what\u2019s stopping you from taking me up on my offer?\" said by Adam\n\"Wait, hold on. An offer? So\u2013 so, you haven\u2019t even accepted, but suddenly you would if it meant handing me a job?\" said by Sally\n\"Okay. Yeah. It wouldn\u2019t all be for you. I\u2019ve been leaning in this direction for quite a while now. I\u2019ve been giving it some serious consideration ever since my dad mentioned it. I mean, I think it\u2019s perfect, especially since I\u2019ve been itching for a new challenge.\" said by ", "answer": "Adam"}
{"content": "\"You got dressed?\" said by Tucker\n\"As one does. What did you think? I was gonna be lounging around all morning. I\u2013 this is a work day.\" said by Ashley\n\"I was gonna make you breakfast in bed.\" said by Tucker\n\"I only see coffee.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah, I\u2019m still navigating my way around that kitchen.\" said by Tucker\n\"It\u2019s very sweet. I\u2019ll give you a tip though. If you want to catch me before I go in to work, you\u2019re gonna have to start a little earlier.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah, but it\u2019s impossible to know when you get up \u2019cause my room\u2019s all the way down the hall. We\u2019re gonna have to fix that, I think.\" said by Tucker\n\"Not right now. I have to get to work, but you know, we\u2019ll talk about it later. You know.\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, you\u2019re gonna\u2026\" said by Tucker\n\"That\u2019s very sweet. I\u2019m good. Okay, goodbye.\" said by Ashley\n\"Morning. Coffee?\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, it is a beautiful day. Clear skies, the sun is out. You can tell summer is on its way.\" said by Elena\n\"You\u2019re in a good mood.\" said by Audra\n\"I am relieved. Things are finally getting better between nate and me. I have moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.\" said by Elena\n\"Additional sponsorship provided by\u2026\" said by Announcer\n\"So at first, I was thinking maybe an island. Something charming, not too far away, but then I thought it might be touristy, so then I was thinking maybe something more intimate, romantic. Or I could go big, you know, exotic, palm trees, mojitos. Just make a week of it. But then it might be hard to book something like that because you know, this is also last minute. Nate just told me about it last night.\" said by Elena\n\"Did he?\" said by Audra\n\"Yeah, that man is full of surprises lately.\" said by Elena\n\"Yeah, he certainly is.\" said by Audra\n\"And he couldn\u2019t have been more sweet about it. He told me to pick a place, wherever I wanted to go would be perfect because as long as he was with me, he would be happy. And then he left a note on my pillow reminding me to pick my dream vacation.\" said by Elena\n\"What a guy.\" said by Audra\n\"Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have doubted nate when he told me that I was his priority and not work, and not victoria. I mean, he\u2019s really trying. He\u2019s really been putting in the work to prove that I am important. And I think now it\u2019s up to me to trust him and I feel like I\u2019m finally in a place to do that.\" said by Elena\n\"Yeah, and now he\u2019s in L.A., On a business trip.\" said by Audra\n\"Right. And it is a good thing that he has you to look after things at newman media. I\u2019m pretty sure he is going to be focused on making deals and proving himself to the powers that be. Probably won\u2019t even come up for air until he\u2019s back home. That man really throws himself into his work.\" said by Elena\n\"Yeah, he\u2013 he certainly does.\" said by Audra\n\"Okay. What\u2019s wrong with you?\" said by Elena\n\"Did nate tell you he was going to L.A. Alone?\" said by Audra\n\"Yes.\" said by Elena\n\"Well, he didn\u2019T. He went with victoria.\" said by Audra\n\"Hey.\" said by Nate\n\"Hi.\" said by Victoria\n\"You look ready for action.\" said by Nate\n\"Thank you, I\u2019m extremely excited. I just love this moment. We know why we\u2019re here. We know what we\u2019re gonna do and I have no doubt that we\u2019re gonna be successful beyond anything that we\u2019ve imagined.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, with that confidence, how can we not go home winners?\" said by Nate\n\"Exactly. All right. Well, practically back-to-back meetings starting later today. Um, you know, I just wanted to go over the agenda, the bullet points, the goals, the research, and just make sure that we\u2019re on the same page.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay.\" said by Nate\n\"So, as you can see, we have dinner later this evening in santa monica where we will make our pitch and\u2026\" said by Victoria\n\"And dazzle them with our offer.\" said by Nate\n\"Yes, I like the way that you think. But in the meantime, I do want to go over the research and make sure that it\u2019s solid because I really want to nail this deal.\" said by Victoria\n\"So do I.\" said by Nate\n\"Why are you here?\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, you mean like what\u2019s the meaning of life and all that?\" said by Tucker\n\"My family is in crisis right now, diane is in jail. Summer is mourning the loss of her mother. We are struggling through every hour of every day and ashley drops you on us.

Yes.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, I know you don\u2019t like me.\" said by Tucker\n\"You apparently don\u2019t realize how much I don\u2019t like you.\" said by Jack\n\"But believe it or not, I am as dedicated to family as you are.\" said by Tucker\n\"You don\u2019t know the meaning of the word.\" said by Jack\n\"Which word?\" said by Tucker\n\"Family.\" said by Jack\n\"Uh, that\u2019s true. I\u2019m not as great at it as you are, but I\u2019d like to be and I\u2019m trying to be. And that\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m here. Uh, I\u2019d like to repair my relationship with devon and ashley understands that. So, she\u2019s offered to let me move in here.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, let\u2019s be clear. Ashley asked you to move in here to make my life hell.\" said by Jack\n\"Jack, I hope you will receive this in the spirit that it\u2019s offered, but not everything\u2019s about you. And I came back to genoa city expressly to, uh, to show ashley that I\u2019m worthy of her love. And so we can make a real future together.\" said by Tucker\n\"A future? With you?\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah.\" said by Tucker\n\"After the unending pain you caused her. How did you con her into believing that?\" said by Jack\n\"So, you think that she\u2019s just so easily manipulated that she\u2019s fallen prey to my evil agenda?\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah, that about sizes it up.\" said by Jack\n\"That\u2019s funny because that\u2019s exactly what she thinks about you and diane.\" said by Tucker\n\"Hey.\" said by Billy\n\"Hey. So good to see somebody working hard around here.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yeah, it\u2019s been crazy the last few days.\" said by Billy\n\"Thank you, jack. He\u2019s lost his mind because of diane.\" said by Ashley\n\"I\u2013 I didn\u2019t know he\u2019d seen her. What\u2013 what happened?\" said by Billy\n\"I don\u2019t know. He doesn\u2019t keep me in the loop. Frankly, I don\u2019t want to be included in that insanity.\" said by Ashley\n\"Well, you know, jack\u2019s in a tough spot right now. I think we can take it easy on him a little.\" said by Billy\n\"Oh, good idea, billy. I\u2019ll take it easy. Meanwhile, jack is defending a murderer to anybody that will listen.\" said by Ashley\n\"I think we should watch our word choice. You know, walking into the C.E.O.\u2019S office, claiming his fiancee\u2019s a murderer.\" said by Billy\n\"Murderess. I\u2019m sorry.\" said by Ashley\n\"Not the part I was worried about.\" said by Billy\n\"As co-C.E.O., You should be worried because jack\u2019s priorities are a threat to this company.\" said by Ashley\n\"I don\u2019t follow.\" said by Billy\n\"Well, um, you are aware of the barrage of media inquiries we\u2019ve been getting. They\u2019re not asking anything about jabot. They want to know about the co-C.E.O.\u2019S fiance who murdered his ex-wife. And P.S., The trial hasn\u2019t even started yet. That\u2019s gonna be a feeding frenzy. So, I was just thinking that maybe we should try to do something before the jack and diane show tanks this company completely.\" said by Ashley\n\"Oh, wait, wait. If you\u2019re gonna compare yourself to diane, stop right there. Diane has genuinely changed. She\u2019s done the work. She\u2019s made amends. You, you\u2019re the same tucker that screwed over everybody in this town.\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah, but who also almost died in a car crash and\u2013\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, yes, yes. And lived in an ashram and found your soul. The flaw there is you don\u2019t have one.\" said by Jack\n\"Okay. Not a morning person, noted. This coffee\u2019s good, man. You sure you don\u2019t want some?\" said by Tucker\n\"I\u2019ll get coffee on my way to work.\" said by Jack\n\"Hey, uh, by the way, I just want you to know that I\u2019m truly sorry for what diane is going through right now. For what it\u2019s worth, I don\u2019t\u2013 I don\u2019t think she\u2019s entirely responsible for phyllis\u2019s death.\" said by Tucker\n\"For what it\u2019s worth. I don\u2019t give a damn what you think. Wait, you know what? As long as we\u2019re having this conversation, if you intend to continue this little dalliance with ashley, whatever the hell it is, be warned. There will be hell to pay if you ever again hurt her or use her.\" said by Jack\n\"I don\u2019t buy into the whole doomsday scenario you\u2019re painting for jabot. I think it\u2019s overblown.\" said by Billy\n\"Really? Well, because of the public\u2019s fascination with this case, our department heads have become well-versed in the art of no comment. They\u2019re not really running their divisions, billy. It\u2019s not good for morale. It\u2019s not good for our bottom line and it\u2019s not good for jabot\u2019s reputation.\" said by Ashley\n\"You know, jabot has faced worse and come back even stronger.\" said by Billy\n\"But this is just the beginning. Jack is distracted, he\u2019s throwing his money and his time behind whatever defense that michael comes up with. He\u2019s doing nothing to get in front of the explosion that\u2019s gonna happen day one of diane\u2019s trial.\" said by Ashley\n\"That\u2019s a good point. I\u2019ll talk to P.R. And make sure we have a plan in place.\" said by Billy\n\"Great idea, but it\u2019s not gonna work because the problem is diane jenkins. Oh, just tell me this. How does one spin an employee who\u2019s engaged to a co-C.E.O. Who murders a former colleague?\" said by Ashley\n\"Alleged murder, ashley, okay? And again, I think you\u2019re overreacting.\" said by Billy\n\"I am not. I\u2019m being realistic. Jack\u2019s behavior has been irrational since he got back with diane and I\u2019m warning you, we need to make moves to do whatever we can to protect our company before it\u2019s too late.\" said by Ashley\n\"Victoria went to L.A.?\" said by Elena\n\"The plan was always for the two of them to go together. Yeah, I think she asked him to make the trip.\" said by Audra\n\"How do you know?\" said by Elena\n\"Well, nate told me about it yesterday. Now, I wanted to tag along, learn from my boss, but he said he needed me to run the office since he and victoria were making the trip. That he was hoping she\u2019d teach him a few things. I can only imagine the things she\u2019ll be teaching him.\" said by Audra\n\"Oh my god.\" said by Elena\n\"You know, I can\u2019t believe the man would lie to your face. After all the talk about making you a priority. He\u2013 he sneaks off to L.A. With victoria. What an ass. You know, and then he gets you all excited about this romantic getaway.\" said by Audra\n\"Stop it.\" said by Elena\n\"You know, the jerk only made the play to cover his guilt. Nate has a brilliant, beautiful woman in his life and he\u2019d rather go chase after victoria newman.\" said by Audra\n\"Audra, stop. And we\u2019re done.\" said by Elena\n\"You know, billy, honestly, diane always has her own agenda. You know that. And guess what she wants now. Everything. She wants, jack, she wants his name, she wants his money, she wants his power. She\u2019s a danger to him and to us and the fact that jack doesn\u2019t see that proves he\u2019s in no position to be protecting our company or to be running jabot.\" said by Ashley\n\"So, what do you plan? Hm. What do you think we should do about that?\" said by Billy\n\"Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s kind of obvious?\" said by Ashley\n\"You can\u2019t be serious.\" said by Billy\n\"I am serious. We need to convene the board and contain jack. I don\u2019t want to see it come to that, but maybe we need to do something. I don\u2019t know, shut him down completely.\" said by Ashley\n\"You need to slow down a little bit, okay? And you need to listen to yourself because it sounds like you\u2019re planning a coup.\" said by Billy\n\"I\u2019m protecting the company.\" said by Ashley\n\"Okay, well, that\u2019s not gonna happen. We are not gonna force jack from his position as C.E.O of this company. There\u2019s no reason to believe he doesn\u2019t have the company\u2019s best interest and our family\u2019s best interests at heart.\" said by Billy\n\"There\u2019s every reason to believe that because his obsession with diane has gone on too far and it simply has to stop, period.\" said by Ashley\n\"This is about a hell of a lot more than business isn\u2019t it?\" said by Billy\n\"Oh, wow.\" said by Ashley\n\"What ashley and I have, there\u2019s no doubt, it\u2019s, you know, it\u2019s one of the great, epic love stories. You\u2019ll see, we\u2019re meant to be together.\" said by Tucker\n\"Oh, you want me to see that?\" said by Jack\n\"Yeah. I mean, listen, I understand your resistance because I was not a great guy, back in the day, I admit it. Um, and that\u2019s why while I\u2019m here, I\u2019m as dedicated to proving myself to you and the rest of the abbots as I am to ashley.\" said by Tucker\n\"This little stunt.\" said by Jack\n\"It\u2019s a kick in the pants, huh?\" said by Tucker\n\"As furious as I am at ashley for foisting you on this family at a time like this, she is still my sister. I love her. I will always protect her.\" said by Jack\n\"Now, see, that\u2019s something we have in common then because I love her and I will always protect her. See? We should do this more often. I feel like we\u2019ve bonded.\" said by Tucker\n\"I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2013 I shouldn\u2019t have gone off like that. Look, it\u2019s just for months, okay? Nate\u2019s sworn to you that there was nothing going on between him and victoria. Look, I knew he was ambitious, okay? I just didn\u2019t peg him for a cheating liar.\" said by Audra\n\"And I was dumb enough to trust him. I guess I just wanted to believe that we were gonna be okay. So, um, you think they\u2019ve been sleeping together this whole time? Or was that the point of this trip?\" said by Elena\n\"Look, there\u2019s a real chance we\u2019re reading too much into this, okay? That there\u2019s nothing going on between them. Look, maybe we should take a step back.\" said by Audra\n\"No\u2026 because regardless of whether or not nate and victoria have actually slept together, nate is a liar. He played me. He dangled a dream vacation in front of my face and he got me right where he wanted me. And there I was, trusting, patient, stupid girlfriend believing in a lie while he\u2019s off trying to really impress his boss.\" said by Elena\n\"The company has taken some hits, but they\u2019re definitely undervalued.\" said by Victoria\n\"Agreed. The dynamics for podcasting platforms are in flux. A lot of companies are downsizing, reorganizing, which is great timing for us. Newman can swoop in, rebuild, make the company leaner, more muscular.\" said by Nate\n\"Stronger, more powerful. Yes, I do like the sound of that. We can reorganize creators and copyright owners and build an economic model that will benefit everyone.\" said by Victoria\n\"How can they say no?\" said by Nate\n\"You\u2019re very hard to say no to.\" said by Victoria\n\"Um, something I was thinking about last night. A way to recoup a portion of our investment could be to include premium subscription offerings. Generate intellectual property deals with hollywood.\" said by Nate\n\"Does your brain ever stop working?\" said by Victoria\n\"I wish I did. I\u2013 I must confess, I listen to those podcasts featuring stories that help put you to sleep at night.\" said by Nate\n\"Mm. That sounds very boring.\" said by Victoria\n\"Boring? This company actually has a division dedicated to those types of stories.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, can that please be one of the first divisions that we downsize?\" said by Victoria\n\"You are very hard to say no to.\" said by Nate\n\"You know, I have a very hard time picturing you listening to sleepy story time podcasts.\" said by Victoria\n\"I find it soothing. Um, you know, someone\u2019s voice in my ear as I drift off to sleep on nights, I\u2019m feeling a little lonely.\" said by Nate\n\"A man like you can\u2019t possibly feel lonely.\" said by Victoria\n\"Once in a while. More often now, I guess. Ever since I entered this new stage of my life.\" said by Nate\n\"How so?\" said by Victoria\n\"It seems the people who matter the most to me aren\u2019t moving forward with me. Where I see positives, they see negatives. They don\u2019t understand what drives me.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, you know, bigger, better, more. It\u2019s not for everyone. But for some of us, it\u2019s the best reason to get out of bed in the morning.\" said by Victoria\n\"You really do get it.\" said by Nate\n\"I do, I get it. I can\u2019t tell you how good it feels working with someone that I\u2019m so in sync with. So anyway, the numbers are a little soft on this, but I think we can play that to our advantage as we, um, refine our position.\" said by Victoria\n\"To do that, we have to make the most of the moment.\" said by Nate\n\"What a day.\" said by Jack\n\"Hello to you too.\" said by Michael\n\"Where are we with diane\u2019s defense?\" said by Jack\n\"Oh, well, we are currently sitting in the shadow of a mountain of evidence that all points to diane. Jeremy stark remains dead, but somehow we are still waiting to learn of his cause of death.\" said by Michael\n\"Waiting is getting us nowhere. We have to be proactive, michael.\" said by Jack\n\"What do you recommend? Holding a seance and raising jeremy stark from the dead? That would be proactive.\" said by Michael\n\"He was our best chance at exonerating diane. Now what? Dead ends? The police aren\u2019t helping. Diane needs something to hold onto, so do I. Something that will give her some hope. Stark is dead. We have to pivot. How do we do that?\" said by Jack\n\"Maybe not pivot so much.\" said by Michael\n\"Meaning what?\" said by Jack\n\"We\u2019re behind the game where jeremy stark is concerned. We now do what we should have done when he was still breathing. Investigate the hell out of him. Hey, man. You could save hundreds\" said by Michael\n\"The young and the restless will continue. (Lucky) uh-oh the magic\u2019s disappearing!\" said by Announcer\n\"Do you know how many times jack has tried to kick me out of my own home? Not once, not twice, but three times. Simply because I don\u2019t want to play along with this fatal attraction thing he\u2019s got going with diane.\" said by Ashley\n\"Okay, great. So he kicks you out of the house and your payback is to kick him out of the company. That\u2019s your plan?\" said by Billy\n\"I told you I want to convene the board so I can protect the company.\" said by Ashley\n\"So you\u2019re not looking for revenge on jack?\" said by Billy\n\"No, I\u2019m not. Although because of recent events, I can see why it might be perceived that way, yes.\" said by Ashley\n\"Ashley, what are you doing?\" said by Billy\n\"I invited tucker to move in with me. I mean, he has his own room, but yeah.\" said by Ashley\n\"The man that shredded your heart into pieces. The man that wanted to steal this company. The man who lies to you and everyone in town simply by opening his mouth. Do you think that\u2019s a good idea to plant him under the roof of our family home?\" said by Billy\n\"I had a lot of reasons for what I did and not one of them is your business.\" said by Ashley\n\"Ashley, you\u2019re looking for war, okay? Tucker is a live grenade. He is just as malicious as you believe diane to be. What makes you think that he\u2019s not using you to try and take over this company?\" said by ", "answer": "Billy"}
{"content": "\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Nate\n\"Trust me, the only thing that\u2019s going on between me and victoria is business. I admire her, the way her mind works, her business acumen. Look, I am learning a lot from her, and I won\u2019t deny that we work well together. I-I don\u2019t understand why we have to go through this again.\" said by Nate\n\"Right now I need as much information as possible so that I can make my move, \u2019cause information is power. And power \u2014 power is control.\" said by Victoria\n\"And you like having control.\" said by Nate\n\"It\u2019s every bit as important to me as money, if not more so.\" said by Victoria\n\"[ Breathing heavily ]\" said by Nate\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Nate\n\"Adam.\" said by Tucker\n\"Hey.\" said by Adam\n\"[ Grunts ]\" said by Tucker\n\"Hey. Um, can I buy you a drink?\" said by Adam\n\"Hmm, it\u2019s an interesting offer.\" said by Tucker\n\"It is? I, um \u2014 I didn\u2019t mean it to be interesting. I just, uh, wanted somebody to drink with, you know.\" said by Adam\n\"Actually on the upswing these days. If you\u2019re looking for someone to commiserate with, you got the wrong guy.\" said by Tucker\n\"Do you want a drink or not?\" said by Adam\n\"Uh, I\u2019ll have a bourbon, neat, please. Thanks.\" said by Tucker\n\"So, is, uh, one of the things on the upswing you selling mccall?\" said by Adam\n\"[ Sighs ] You\u2019re not much of a small talker, are you?\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, word on the street is, your company is for sale.\" said by Adam\n\"Word on the street? Ah. You and I must be hanging out on different streets. Where\u2019d you hear that? Thank you.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, you know, I keep my, uh, ear to the ground.\" said by Adam\n\"Hmm. Your sister and dad told you, right? I didn\u2019t know you were in the newman inner circle these days.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah, we\u2019re, um \u2014 we\u2019re tight. We\u2019re \u2014 we actually, um \u2014 we\u2019ve never been closer.\" said by Adam\n\"Hmm. I\u2019m sure. You relish your role as the black sheep of the family, don\u2019t you? Having plunged a dagger into your dad\u2019s heart by going to work for jack abbott, I can\u2019t imagine that put you on his good side. Frankly, everyone knows victoria\u2019s distaste for you. So, honestly, where did you hear this?\" said by Tucker\n\"Thank you so much for getting this food. I didn\u2019t realize how hungry I was.\" said by Devon\n\"I didn\u2019t want you to starve to death. I know you. And I know that you\u2019re not gonna take a break, so I had to come over here and force you to take one with just a few of your favorite things.\" said by Abby\n\"Hmm. Are you talking about you and dominic?\" said by Devon\n\"Well, I was referring to the empanadas, but, yes, us too.\" said by Abby\n\"No, they were delicious. But nothing beats spending time with you and our little guy. Just looking into his face always puts things back into perspective. So I appreciate you bringing him over here.\" said by Devon\n\"Well, he loves you, and you certainly wore him out, because he has not made a peep since you put him down.\" said by Abby\n\"I \u2014 right.\" said by Devon\n\"Doesn\u2019t it make you want to be a kid again?\" said by Abby\n\"No.\" said by Devon\n\"No?\" said by Abby\n\"It\u2019s not \u2014 not me. No. But today did remind me of why I\u2019m fighting so hard to get my company back and why I\u2019m considering buying mccall, because it\u2019s not for me at all. It\u2019s for our son\u2019s future.\" said by Devon\n\"Look, I \u2014 I know where you\u2019re coming from, but you don\u2019t have to wrestle back your company for dominic. Who knows? He might not even want to be a part of the business when he gets older. He\u2019s going to be his own person, create his own career, his own path.\" said by Abby\n\"Yeah, I know. I know. And I would never force him to do anything he doesn\u2019t want to do. But I just mean, I want him to be proud of me. You know, I want him to be proud that I\u2019m fighting to protect the family legacy.\" said by Devon\n\"Well, he is gonna be proud of the man you are, no matter what. I promise you that. And look, I hate to segue back into business, but are you still considering buying mccall? I\u2019m jonathan lawson\" said by Abby\n\"I came down to see if I could catch vick. She still around?\" said by Nick\n\"I\u2019m not sure. We finished up a while ago. You know, I don\u2019t always know where she is or what she\u2019s up to, right?\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah, nate. I\u2019ll call her later. Where are you headed to?\" said by Nick\n\"It\u2019s personal information. I like to keep it that way. But elena and I had an argument earlier. That\u2019s why I decided to come out, you know, have a drink and clear my head.\" said by Nate\n\"Interesting. When I saw you earlier, you made it seem like you came to meet with vick to talk about the mccall deal.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s how i clear my head these days \u2014 scotch and strategizing about newman media. Business is sometimes a good distraction from your personal life. You know?\" said by Nate\n\"And vice versa.\" said by Nick\n\"Anyway, I\u2019m too tired to face what\u2019s waiting for me at home, so I thought it\u2019d be a good idea if I give elena and me some space and crash here for the night.\" said by Nate\n\"Well, good luck with that.\" said by Nick\n\"It\u2019ll be fine. Good night.\" said by Nate\n\"Good night.\" said by Nick\n\"I told tucker that I knew about him offering his company to newman first.\" said by Devon\n\"Mm. And did he have an explanation?\" said by Abby\n\"He did, yeah. And it made some sense. But the more I think about it, I realize that it doesn\u2019t really matter that he went to newman first, \u2019cause he pulled that offer. As long as he\u2019s being sincere about what he\u2019s offering me.\" said by Devon\n\"Well, sincerity is always in question when it comes to tucker.\" said by Abby\n\"Right, right. I just \u2014 I feel like my reasons for wanting to buy the company are more important than whatever his reasons are for trying to sell it.\" said by Devon\n\"And what are those reasons?\" said by Abby\n\"Oh, just the safety-net argument. You know, in case things don\u2019t go well with this lawsuit and getting back hamilton-winters, obviously getting the company back is my priority. But I have to be smart. You know? And I have to consider whether there\u2019s a benefit to rebuilding a company with tucker.\" said by Devon\n\"Look, I know that i have been the one that was kind of pushing this whole mccall-tucker thing, but, honestly, I-I don\u2019t know if I can fully trust tucker, and I would never want you to get burned again.\" said by Abby\n\"We did riff off each other pretty well when we were talking about our ideas for fixing the company.\" said by Devon\n\"Okay, well, I guess it\u2019s great to be on the same page as the person running the company before you, but it\u2019s not like you would be moving forward, working together. I mean\u2026\" said by Abby\n\"Well, there\u2019s another element to this whole thing. He said that if I were to buy the company, he\u2019d want to come on and take an advisory role and report to me.\" said by Devon\n\"Wait, so, he would want to take a lesser position?\" said by Abby\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Devon\n\"How do you feel about that?\" said by Abby\n\"It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s probably a sign that he\u2019s being honest about wanting to actually fix things between us, \u2019cause I know he doesn\u2019t like to take orders from anybody.\" said by Devon\n\"Yeah, agreed. That\u2019s true. Um, I guess it shows that he\u2019s trying to form a connection. But I mean, that\u2019s if we are giving him the benefit of the doubt.\" said by Abby\n\"Right. And should we?\" said by Devon\n\"You obviously don\u2019t have your ears as low to the ground as I do. Um, [Inhales deeply] I\u2019m actually no longer at jabot.\" said by Adam\n\"No, I know that. Ashley told me you underperformed your way out the door there.\" said by Tucker\n\"It wasn\u2019t a good fit.\" said by Adam\n\"The c-suite press-release lingo. Did you also quit to spend more time with family?\" said by Tucker\n\"No, victoria, dad, and I \u2014 we have our issues, but, uh, at the end of the day, we\u2019re family. And we always will be.\" said by Adam\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Tucker\n\"I know you can understand that, with everything that\u2019s going on with devon.\" said by Adam\n\"Indeed, I can. Father-son relationships are, uh, huh, complicated. Yeah.\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s the thing about victor me, is we \u2014 we understand each other on a cellular level because we are so much alike.\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah. Yeah, you are. You\u2019re both miserable, ruthless.\" said by Tucker\n\"See, you, on the other hand, you are nothing like devon. You know, him being principled, thoughtful.\" said by Adam\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Tucker\n\"Yeah, you really botched that relationship. It sounds like he doesn\u2019t want anything to do with you, including acquiring mccall. Which means I might actually end up being the ceo of your empire.\" said by Adam\n\"Adam\u2026\" said by Tucker\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Nate\n\"[ Sighs ] I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here. Come in.\" said by Victoria\n\"[ Clears throat ]\" said by Nate\n\"Get you a scotch?\" said by Victoria\n\"Listen, I, uh \u2014 I need to make something clear. I\u2019m not, um, here for sex. I just didn\u2019t want to be rude and not respond at all.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh. So, instead, you decided to come here in person and tell me to my face that you\u2019re not interested.\" said by Victoria\n\"You know full well I\u2019m interested. And that is the problem. I\u2019m already in two committed relationships, okay? One with elena, and the other with newman media. And I\u2019m not about to screw up either one. For copd, ask your doctor about breztri.\" said by Nate\n\"[ Inhales deeply ] Do you want to sit down and talk?\" said by Victoria\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Nate\n\"Oh, of course. Okay, well, both feet on the ground at all times.\" said by Victoria\n\"As much as I\u2019d like to throw caution to the wind \u2014 and trust me, part of me wants to more than you know \u2014 there\u2019s a logical side of me that\u2019s holding me back. Okay? Not only because I\u2019m in a relationship with a woman I care about, but I would hate for this amazing connection we have at work to somehow be tarnished. I\u2019m happier at newman than I\u2019ve been in a long time.\" said by Nate\n\"Does some of that happiness have to do with me?\" said by Victoria\n\"Of course. I love working with you. You\u2019re a great boss, great leader, a true visionary.\" said by Nate\n\"That\u2019s it?\" said by Victoria\n\"[ Chuckles ] You look better in a dress.\" said by Nate\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Victoria\n\"[ Chuckles ] Obviously, there are, um, other physical feelings. A lot of desire.\" said by Nate\n\"How much desire?\" said by Victoria\n\"So much\u2026 desire. But I have to rise above it, okay? We both do, for the sake of our working relationship. I\u2019m sorry if you disagree or you think this makes things untenable for you, but I definitely think it would make things untenable if we act on our feelings. I hope you\u2019re not insulted.\" said by Nate\n\"I\u2019m not. And I think your earnestness makes you even more attractive.\" said by Victoria\n\"Are we okay?\" said by Nate\n\"Yes, of course we\u2019re okay. I\u2019ll see you at the office tomorrow.\" said by Victoria\n\"[ Sighs ]\" said by Nate\n\"So, when you sell mccall to newman, victor, um, intends to install me as ceo.\" said by Adam\n\"Hmm. Well, in that case, it\u2019s a good thing I have no intention of selling to newman\u2026\" said by Tucker\n\"Hmm.\" said by Adam\n\"\u2026\u2019Cause having you at the helm would be a surefire way to run it into the ground. And your intel about my relationship with devon is old news. I don\u2019t know what wild promises your father is making to you, but you should know better than to fall for them. The scenario you described is absolutely never going to happen.\" said by Tucker\n\"Hmm.\" said by Adam\n\"So I would tell him and your sister to just move on.\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, your deal with devon isn\u2019t done yet. And there\u2019s two things that I know about my family. One, they don\u2019t give up and just walk away. And two, everyone has their price. And the newmans will pay that price.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, look at this. You boys love to hear yourselves talk so much, I\u2019m surprised there\u2019s any oxygen left in the room.\" said by Nick\n\"What is this, a newman convention?\" said by Tucker\n\"Just came for some takeout. Not interested at all in whatever this is.\" said by Nick\n\"Well, tucker was just throwing down the gauntlet, saying that newman enterprises will never get its hands on mccall unlimited, which kind of sounds like the opening of a negotiation to me. So, you know, what would it take for you to change your mind?\" said by Adam\n\"Hmm. Well, devon means everything to me. And you \u2014 you mean less than nothing. So\u2026 how\u2019s that for negotiation? Thanks for the drink. Okay?\" said by Tucker\n\"Well, there you go. You got your answer straight from the man himself. He\u2019s never going to let newman buy mccall. Are you ready to let this go yet?\" said by Nick\n\"Well, you have a lot to think about.\" said by Abby\n\"Hmm.\" said by Devon\n\"Hmm. And I love being your sounding board, but I should probably take dominic and head home.\" said by Abby\n\"Take dominic?\" said by Devon\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Abby\n\"Why you gonna do that? He\u2019s asleep. You don\u2019t want to wake him up.\" said by Devon\n\"Well, I guess I could leave him here and come get him in the morning.\" said by Abby\n\"I have a better idea. How about you just don\u2019t go home.\" said by Devon\n\"Hmm, but I have to get up very early in the morning.\" said by Abby\n\"Oh, then I can wake you up very early in the morning.\" said by Devon\n\"Can you?\" said by Abby\n\"I can.\" said by Devon\n\"[ Chuckles ]\" said by Abby\n\"And you just had wine. You don\u2019t need to be driving anywhere.\" said by Devon\n\"Oh, is that what you were thinking when you poured me that glass?\" said by Abby\n\"No. No. No, not at all. And I have so much on my mind, you know I\u2019m gonna be lousy company for myself. I\u2019m not gonna get any rest.\" said by Devon\n\"Are you suggesting that I put you to sleep?\" said by Abby\n\"Well, that depends on if you think you\u2019re up to that.\" said by Devon\n\"I am always up to that.\" said by Abby\n\"You are?\" said by Devon\n\"Mm-hmm.\" said by Abby\n\"Hmm. Then be my guest.\" said by Devon\n\"Hmm.\" said by Abby\n\"It\u2019s going to take more than tucker walking out of here, pouting, for me to give up on mccall. We just have to make sure that devon does not accept his offer.\" said by Adam\n\"Tucker wants devon to have the company. Tucker usually gets what he wants. And well, it might be harder for him to win back his son than he thinks. And if there\u2019s one thing that I know, it\u2019s how to work the angles on a fractured father-son relationship.\" said by Nick\n\"[ Sighs ] Look, adam, even if devon wasn\u2019t in the picture, it\u2019s tucker\u2019s call to make. What makes you think he\u2019s going to sell mccall to newman? I mean, he clearly doesn\u2019t want you anywhere near that ceo chair.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah, but victor does. And tucker is no match for our father.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, that may be, but you know who is? Victoria.\" said by Nick\n\"Okay, well, she\u2019s not gonna come out on top on this one.\" said by Adam\n\"[ Sighs ] You know the reason you and vick don\u2019t get along? Because you\u2019re too much like dad. You\u2019re both willing to fight tooth and nail for this acquisition, and then you will tear each other apart.\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah. I mean, so what? It \u2014 it\u2019s our normal.\" said by Adam\n\"Mnh-mnh. It\u2019s weird and it\u2019s toxic, and you guys need hobbies. And I have no interest in being a part of another newman family drama. It\u2019s why I\u2019m working so hard to keep things civil between you and me when it comes to sally and the baby.\" said by Nick\n\"I appreciate that.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay. So is there any chance you could let go of this dream of running tucker\u2019s company? Adam, you can do whatever you want. You have several high-profile options. Start your own damn company. The world is your oyster. Why does it have to be tucker\u2019s company that will satisfy you?\" said by Nick\n\"Because now I have a reason to fight for it. I have a baby on the way, and i want to leave a legacy behind \u2014 a newman legacy for both of my children.\" said by Adam\n\"Nate.\" said by Audra\n\"Hey.\" said by Nate\n\"What are you doing here? I thought you had a date night with elena.\" said by Audra\n\"She had a long day, so it was an early evening.\" said by Nate\n\"Listen, I still feel terrible if I caused any misunderstanding between the two of you. If there\u2019s anything I can do \u2014\" said by Audra\n\"There\u2019s not. I cleared it up with elena.\" said by Nate\n\"Oh. I\u2019m glad. Uh, then what are you doing here now and not at home?\" said by Audra\n\"I just had a restless night.\" said by Nate\n\"Then, definitely, the thing you need is coffee. Why don\u2019t you join me?\" said by Audra\n\"Look, I still have a ton of work to do at home. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here, to fuel up.\" said by Nate\n\"Okay, no worries. See you tomorrow. Did you see victoria this evening?\" said by Audra\n\"Why do you ask?\" said by Nate\n\"Hello, son. Sit down. Now, you made it sound urgent on the phone.\" said by Victor\n\"Yeah, well, I wanted to talk to you before morning. I, um, ran into tucker tonight.\" said by Adam\n\"Hmm.\" said by Victor\n\"And he seemed awfully determined to make a deal with devon.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, what tucker wants and what he thinks devon will do \u2014 you know, two different things. Okay? Victoria tells me that she had a conversation with devon, who informed her that he wanted nothing to do with his father.\" said by Victor\n\"Okay, well, then maybe something has changed. I mean, tucker seemed pretty confident, pretty adamant that he could get devon to make him an offer.\" said by Adam\n\"Listen, tucker mccall has always been full of confidence. He\u2019s been full of bull.\" said by Victor\n\"I just \u2014 I-I think mccall is gonna be an uphill battle, but I don\u2019t want to let it go. Okay? I\u2019ve gotten pretty excited about this idea.\" said by Adam\n\"So have I. I want it for you, and I want for the family.\" said by Victor\n\"Hmm. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s gonna be one big happy family as you\u2019re envisioning, but \u2014\" said by Adam\n\"I\u2019ll work that out.\" said by Victor\n\"Hmm. You\u2019re gonna work out victoria\u2019s lifelong animosity towards me?\" said by Adam\n\"We\u2019ll take things step by step. And the first step is to acquire mccall unlimited.\" said by Victor\n\"Okay, well, the key to our success there is devon. We need to make sure that he is not interested, because tucker made it clear that he plans to sell to him, and that is his end game.\" said by Adam\n\"Leave it up to me. (Terrie) if you\u2019re a smoker.\" said by Victor\n\"I agree with you. I think we do need devon\u2019s help.\" said by Victor\n\"Well, I think it may be more effective if you meet with him. You know, he seems to admire you.\" said by Adam\n\"I respect him, as well, so I\u2019ll see what I can do. Alright?\" said by ", "answer": "Victor"}

Isn\u2019t she the woman that you would do anything for?

They say\u2013\" said by Nick\n\"Okay, well, they\u2019re\u2013 they\u2019re idiots, okay? Ava was my everything. And now, I have to spend the rest of my life trying to forget \u2019cause that is the only way I see myself getting through this. Forget about the doctors who told me that I was gonna be okay because I want them dead. And adam, who made the decision to let our baby die instead of me and leaving me to live with this pain for the rest of my life? How am I ever gonna be able to forgive him for that? God, and if I hadn\u2019t been so stressed out, then maybe\u2013 maybe, she would have had more time. Oh, and trying to forget that I was stressed because of you. Where the hell were you, nick? Keeping me in the dark, leaving me to think the worst and not answering your phone? I mean, you were supposed to make everything okay. You were the one person I could count on. And I get it. I do. I really do. Your family needed you. But what about me? Where were you when I needed you?\" said by Sally\n\"It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay.\" said by Nick\n\"I appreciate you trying to help sharon, but everything between sally and me is\u2013 it\u2019s over. She hates me.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, when she first learned she lost the baby, sure.\" said by Sharon\n\"I\u2013 I went back to see her today and I poured my heart out, uh, hoping to make her understand why I did what I did.\" said by Adam\n\"How\u2019d that go?\" said by Sharon\n\"Um, I\u2019m the loser in the blame game. So, as far as my demons go, let \u2019em be. I could use the company. Sally and I are going on our separate ways. It just wasn\u2019t in the stars.\" said by Adam\n\"You two were split when this baby was conceived.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah, that\u2019s true.\" said by Adam\n\"I just find it interesting that when the doctors gave you the choice between saving sally or the baby, you chose sally. Is that because you thought maybe, somewhere down the line\u2013\" said by Sharon\n\"I\u2013 I wasn\u2019t thinking. I wanted them both. I wanted the baby and sally. I never wanted our baby to\u2013\" said by Adam\n\"But those children wouldn\u2019t be with you.\" said by Sharon\n\"Yes, that is true. I know that. But like many have said, it\u2019s not about me. Sally\u2019s the only one that matters. So, now, life goes on. It\u2019s just\u2013 it\u2019s just not the life that I wanted.

You can be very persuasive. What exactly did they agree with?\" said by Billy\n\"We need to be proactive. We need to stop diane in her tracks. Before she can cause some real damage.\" said by Ashley\n\"Also, get pr to start working on a press release for diane\u2019s new role as chief talent officer.

You are kidding.\" said by Zelda\n\"I\u2019m not kidding. Um, she thinks that jack is going to, um, promote diane into a powerful position where she could potentially hurt the company.

Ashley, diane is not a comic book supervillain, okay? She doesn\u2019t have special powers. She doesn\u2019t even have a seat on the board\u2013\" said by Billy\n\"Yet.\" said by Ashley\n\"Our board is made up of family members.

All right, I can. That gloria, do you remember her? She caused a lot of damage.\" said by Ashley\n\"Yes, I do. And jabot is fine because of those checks and balances.\" said by Billy\n\"It\u2019s the balancing part that I\u2019m talking about, billy, all right?

That\u2019s all.\" said by Ashley\n\"Diane is not gloria, all right?

Everything that\u2019s happened, how we\u2019re going to get through it? Kyle, you\u2019ve got to know how sorry I am for everything. Hey, your\u2013 your mom has forgiven me. Did she tell you that?\" said by Summer\n\"She mentioned it.\" said by Kyle\n\"Well, I\u2019m hoping that you can forgive me too. Look, I know there\u2019s no excuse for anything that I did. I just miss you so much.\" said by Summer\n\"None of this is us talking. It\u2019s you trying to convince me to let go of my anger and accept what you did, but that\u2019s not going to happen with one conversation. It\u2019s going to take time. Maybe a lot of time, if I can even get there. So, I repeat, what is there to say?\" said by Kyle\n\"Kyle, I love you so much. I was afraid, I was confused when my mom first reached out to me.\" said by Summer\n\"Okay, if you were so confused and afraid, why didn\u2019t you come to me? You slept in another room for weeks while I begged you to talk to me, confide in me. You could have let me comfort you for your loss. Hell, you could have shared the same bed so I could hold you at night, but you couldn\u2019t do that. And I accepted it. I put your feelings first ahead of my own. So, I\u2019m going now and I assume you will give me the same time and space I gave you.

Have I lost him?\" said by Summer\n\"I\u2019m just so tempted to get on an airplane and fly to new york just to get away from the tension in the house.\" said by Traci\n\"Then, why don\u2019t you do it? Come to manhattan with me, and then you can write about the drama instead of living it.\" said by Zelda\n\"It is so tempting, but running away is not the answer. I have got to fix this. Or at least try. You know, jack and ashley always felt that jabot was daddy\u2019s legacy. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s the family. Our family is john abbott\u2019s legacy, and I\u2019ve got to find a way to make jack and ashley focus on that. I love you so much and I don\u2019t want to go away again. Please, won\u2019t you let me stay?\" said by Traci\n\"Well, will you do plan to continue school?\" said by John\n\"Well, of course I do. I\u2013 I just want to be around my family and my friends.\" said by Traci\n\"You know, honey, I had hoped you\u2019d make this decision.\" said by John\n\"Yeah?\" said by Traci\n\"Yes. I have loved having you girls home. I mean, for the first time, all of our family together, after all these years, I dreaded the idea of you leaving.\" said by John\n\"Why didn\u2019t you tell me?\" said by Traci\n\"Well, because you made your decision. I didn\u2019t want to influence it.\" said by John\n\"And I didn\u2019t want to disappoint you.\" said by Traci\n\"You know something, young lady?\" said by John\n\"What?\" said by Traci\n\"I think we got here failure to communicate.\" said by John\n\"Dad, I think we ought to talk more.\" said by Traci\n\"Especially, since you\u2019re going to be here now. Let\u2019s do that.\" said by John\n\"Oh, we will. I promise we will. Thanks for being so understanding, dad.\" said by Traci\n\"Have I told you something lately? Awful good having you home again.\" said by John\n\"Well, it\u2019s wonderful to be home. Especially since I have a super neat dad.\" said by Traci\n\"Super neat?\" said by John\n\"[ Laughing ] Yeah. Super, super neat.\" said by Traci\n\"I love you.\" said by John\n\"You know, I have watched you write your way out of a million tricky situations. Now, you are going to have to tackle this one the exact same way. Head on. Underneath that sweet, measured personality of yours is a will of iron.\" said by Zelda\n\"I don\u2019t know about that, but you\u2019re right. I will do it. I\u2013 I will try to find a way for\u2013 for jack and ashley to understand that peace is the only way, even if I have to slap them upside the head with it to make them see.\" said by Traci\n\"That\u2019s the spirit. That\u2019s it.\" said by Zelda\n\"You need to check yourself, billy, before you dismiss me and my concerns.\" said by Ashley\n\"I understand your concerns, ash, I just don\u2019t agree with them. And I\u2019m going to double down on what I said the last time we had this conversation. You try to oust jack from this company, I\u2019m gonna fight you on it.\" said by Billy\n\"You\u2019re such a kiss ass, aren\u2019t you? When you\u2019re so beholden to your big brother for letting you back in, you\u2019re sitting in your big chair, you\u2019re willing to ignore the wolf that\u2019s waiting outside the door, just waiting to sink her fangs into this company?\" said by Ashley\n\"You gotta stop, ash. You\u2019re embarrassing yourself.\" said by Billy\n\"What\u2019s embarrassing, is your ignorance, billy.\" said by Ashley\n\"This is out of control. And I\u2019m going to believe this is tucker pushing you to this extreme, getting you all riled up about something that hasn\u2019t happened. Ashley, he\u2019s using you.\" said by Billy\n\"Okay, so the chauvinist is back, right? Because god forbid your sister has an opinion that\u2019s valid on her own.\" said by Ashley\n\"I just expect better from you, okay? Either that or he\u2019s just playing into this whole worry about diane. He\u2019s making you believe that it\u2019s you and him against the world and it\u2019s total bs.\" said by Billy\n\"What\u2019s bs is every word that\u2019s coming out of your mouth.\" said by Ashley\n\"Okay, so, let\u2019s just run this back for a second, okay? Let\u2019s say that you succeed and you get jack kicked out of this company. And who\u2019s next? Me? Because I\u2019m beholden? Then, who\u2019s going to run the day-to-day? Abby and traci? No. Kyle and summer? No. They run a subsidiary. So, that leaves you and tucker, the king and queen of the castle. Which works out perfect for tucker, right? It\u2019s exactly what he wanted.\" said by Billy\n\"Oh, my god.\" said by Ashley\n\"You remember that he\u2019s the one that asked diane to funnel him confidential financial records, which diane refused to do.\" said by Billy\n\"Please, just stop! You have no concept at all of my relationship with tucker!\" said by Ashley\n\"What I do know is that tucker has wanted this company since the day he stepped foot back in this city and he still wants it. So let me just tell you right now, I\u2019m not gonna let that happen. I am team jack all the way.\" said by Billy\n\"I\u2019m relieved to know I can count on you against our sister\u2019s relentless onslaught.\" said by Jack\n\"Look at this little boys club. Such a joke.\" said by Ashley\n\"I think the joke\u2019s on you for allowing tucker to worm his way back into your heart.\" said by Jack\n\"Really? Well, you got sucked into diane, didn\u2019t you? Just like that.\" said by Ashley\n\"No, it\u2019s you. Tucker has suckered you.\" said by Billy\n\"You know, I\u2019ve had enough of you, billy. Why don\u2019t you just take a walk?\" said by Ashley\n\"Who the hell are you talking to like that?\" said by Jack\n\"You don\u2019t really have any business, do you? Sitting behind that desk, pretending that you know how to run a company, considering your long history of poor judgment calls. Didn\u2019t you pass out when you were 16 in the snow? You almost died because you were drunk. Granted you were just a kid, but not that long ago, didn\u2019t you lose the what, the company yacht in a poker game? I mean, seriously, billy, I don\u2019t think you should even be a part of this conversation, so\u2026\" said by Ashley\n\"You know I disagreed with her, jack, so, I guess, that\u2019s what I deserve.\" said by Billy\n\"I\u2019m afraid our sister is so blinded by her hatred she can\u2019t think straight. Pretty soon, she\u2019s going to come to regret that.\" said by Jack\n\"Was that a threat?\" said by Ashley\n\"You take that anyway you would like it, ashley.\" said by Jack\n\"Okay, well, you\u2019re going to be sorry for invalidating me, jack, because you are so brainwashed you don\u2019t know what the hell you\u2019re doing anymore.\" said by Ashley\n\"Wow.\" said by Jack\n\"That\u2019s from traci calling a family meeting. No excuses. You get the same thing.\" said by Billy\n\"Yeah. What happened?\" said by Ashley\n\"You think it\u2019s harrison?\" said by Jack\n\"We gotta go. Come on. And what kind of milk?\" said by Ashley\n\"Summer, I\u2019m so sorry. You must be feeling so helpless and\u2013 and scared.\" said by Diane\n\"I shouldn\u2019t have said anything.\" said by Summer\n\"Why not?\" said by Diane\n\"\u2018Cause I wish that I didn\u2019t feel the need to go to my mother-in-law about any of this.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, I\u2013 I want you to know that I\u2019m here for you. However I can be. No judgment.\" said by Diane\n\"Diane, if you\u2026 meant what you said about feeling\u2026 responsible about what was set in motion, then maybe, this is a way to make amends. Help me and kyle through this. Look, when I look into his eyes, I can see that he\u2019s in so much pain and\u2026 he\u2019s so disillusioned with me. He\u2019s so cold.\" said by Summer\n\"Well, jack has looked at me that way many times over the years, and when someone you care about is disappointed in you, it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s heartbreaking. But that\u2019s the past for us. And I am hoping that will soon be the case for you and kyle.\" said by Diane\n\"But the difference is\u2013 is jack kept his distance from you until you earned his trust. I had kyle\u2019s trust. And I broke it. I mean, I\u2013 I\u2013 I shut him out. I\u2013 I didn\u2019t trust him with my secrets, with my feelings.

This\u2013 this feud I have with phyllis started years ago, before you were even born. But now, it seems like our children are suffering because of it. So believe me when I say that despite everything, I will do whatever I can to help you and kyle find each other again. Find the love you share.

Also, wireless.\" said by Chance\n\"What does that mean?\" said by Faith\n\"Well, they could be triggered from a cellular or rf transmission point. The trigger could be anywhere. It might not even be here.\" said by Chance\n\"Okay, so what do we do?\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, before we take this off, the explosives are gonna have to be carefully deactivated. One by one.\" said by Chance\n\"And you can do that, right?\" said by Nick\n\"Additional sponsorship provided by\u2026\" said by Announcer\n\"Sally, you need\u2013 you need to rest, okay? You can\u2019t get worked up like this. The doctor said that you still gotta to watch your\u2013 your blood pressure.\" said by Adam\n\"You\u2019re hiding something. This is my body, I clearly had a c-section, I\u2013\" said by Sally\n\"Well, that\u2019s\u2013 that\u2019s because you\u2013 you need to rest.\" said by Adam\n\"No, I\u2019m not gonna relax until I have answers. What is going on? I\u2013 I remember the pain, and I remember, it kept getting worse. And then, I clearly, passed out. So, please\u2026 just tell me what happened.\" said by Sally\n\"Do you, um\u2013 do you remember when you were being admitted and elena said there might be a chance that they have to induce labor?\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah. \u2018Cause of the preeclampsia?\" said by Sally\n\"Yes. Well, unfortunately, that happened and you lost consciousness, so they had to make a decision to do a c-section.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay, but the baby\u2019s not supposed to be\u2013 supposed to be born \u2019til at least, 37 weeks.\" said by Sally\n\"Yes. It\u2019s early.\" said by Adam\n\"She must be tiny.\" said by Sally\n\"Uh\u2026\" said by Adam\n\"Okay. Okay. Um, I\u2013 I really need to be with our baby, so if she\u2019s too little, then you can just have them bring me to her, and if not, you can\u2026\" said by Sally\n\"Sally, stop, stop.\" said by Adam\n\"Oh, no, no, no, no.\" said by Sally\n\"Look at me.\" said by Adam\n\"No. No, no, please, just don\u2019t\u2013\" said by Sally\n\"During the c-section, there was a\u2013 there was a complication.\" said by Adam\n\"Well, that\u2019s to be expected, right? With a pre-term birth and, you know, premature babies they\u2013 they thrive all the time and she\u2019s strong. She\u2019s strong. She\u2019s got my spirit and your mother\u2019s strength and she\u2019s a spectra and she\u2019s a newman and she is a warrior and she can handle anything this life\u2026 has to throws at her.\" said by Sally\n\"Not everything.\" said by Adam\n\"Are you telling me that our little girl\u2026 she\u2019s not here?\" said by Sally\n\"She didn\u2019t make it.\" said by Adam\n\"Is everything okay?\" said by Nate\n\"Thanks. Yeah, just can\u2019t stop thinking about nicholas. He was so excited to have faith home from school, and now, he\u2019s got to deal with this cameron kirsten nut.\" said by Victoria\n\"Hm. Yeah. He and sharon must be going out of their minds.\" said by Nate\n\"I just hope he doesn\u2019t do his usual thing.\" said by Victoria\n\"What\u2019s that?\" said by Nate\n\"Try to take care of everything on his own.\" said by Victoria\n\"Yeah, I heard that about him. Think he\u2019ll do that again with this kirsten guy?\" said by Nate\n\"He already has. That\u2019s how he ended up in jail.\" said by Victoria\n\"Right, but this guy is still causing problems. Why don\u2019t they just call the police?\" said by Nate\n\"They did. Chance, general, city police, even my father\u2019s security team, they\u2019re all trying to help.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay.\" said by Nate\n\"It\u2019s so nerve-wracking.\" said by Victoria\n\"Well, it sounds like they have a lot of backup. And chance is well trained for situations like this. We just got to believe they\u2019ll be able to get this guy and bring him to justice.\" said by Nate\n\"I want to believe that.\" said by Victoria\n\"Gimme that.\" said by Nate\n\"Thank you. I feel better already. Thank you.\" said by Victoria\n\"When I was in the military, I had some training in disarming explosives like this.\" said by Chance\n\"Hear that, faith? We couldn\u2019t ask for a better person to do this.\" said by Sharon\n\"I\u2019m gonna need some light, somebody\u2019s got it?\" said by Chance\n\"Yeah, I got that.\" said by Nick\n\"Let me see this one. That\u2019s great. Thank you. Okay, faith, I understand this is scary, but I\u2019m going to need you to stay very still, all right? I\u2019m going to work as fast as I can, but we\u2019re in this together, okay?\" said by Chance\n\"If the bomb goes off, we both die? I trust you to keep me safe.\" said by Faith\n\"You okay, chance?\" said by Nick\n\"Yeah.\" said by Chance\n\"This isn\u2019t like in spain. You didn\u2019t have a chance to diffuse the explosive then, but you do now.\" said by Sharon\n\"[ Sighs ] Okay, why don\u2019t you two step back just in case?\" said by Chance\n\"No way, man. I have the light.\" said by Nick\n\"And I have faith\u2019s hand, and we\u2019re not going anywhere. Type 2 diabetes? Discover the power of 3 in the ozempic tri-zone.\" said by Sharon\n\"I know how to support you at work, but right now, I feel a little useless. I want you to be able to lean on me.\" said by Nate\n\"You just being here, it helps. I don\u2019t want to let my mind go to worst case scenarios.\" said by Victoria\n\"Then don\u2019T.\" said by Nate\n\"You\u2019re right. Until I hear something concrete from nick or my mom, I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m not going to waste any time worrying. It\u2019s out of my hands anyway.\" said by Victoria\n\"That is right.\" said by Nate\n\"It\u2019s not like it\u2019s in my control at all. Cameron, he\u2019s a wild card. There\u2019s no telling\u2013\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay, stop, stop. You\u2019re spending time worrying about something you have no control over. And I swear you just said you weren\u2019t going to do that.\" said by Nate\n\"Ah, you\u2019re right. You\u2019re right. It\u2019s just that this situation is a powder keg. And nick landed in jail. He didn\u2019t even lay a hand on cameron. My brother is a very fierce protector, but once that\u2013 that instinct is triggered, I mean, he doesn\u2019t think rationally, he just reacts.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay, nick can be a loose cannon, but those situations involve nick acting alone. But this time, they brought in the authorities. Even a madman like cameron kirsten won\u2019t stand a chance against that much protection.\" said by Nate\n\"How much longer?\" said by Faith\n\"Well, I have to cut the wire connected to the signal receiving antenna from each pack, one by one, so I know it\u2019s tough to be patient, but you\u2019re doing great.\" said by Chance\n\"So you\u2019ve worked on this kind of bomb before?\" said by Faith\n\"I\u2019m sure chance has seen all kinds of things in his military work. Right, chance?\" said by Sharon\n\"Yeah. Yeah, I\u2019ve seen similar. Okay. I\u2019m going to cut the first red wire now and what I need you to do is, don\u2019t breathe in too deeply, okay?\" said by Chance\n\"Okay. So, basically, don\u2019t breathe?\" said by Faith\n\"Yeah, basically.\" said by Chance\n\"Ready when you are.\" said by Faith\n\"Okay.\" said by Chance\n\"Well, now that you know it\u2019s the red one\u2026 I mean, unless\u2013\" said by Sharon\n\"Why? You think cameron\u2019s devious enough to change the pattern?\" said by Chance\n\"I love you both so much for being here with me, but if this doesn\u2019t work\u2013\" said by Faith\n\"It\u2019s going to work.\" said by Sharon\n\"I don\u2019t want all of us to die.\" said by Faith\n\"That\u2019s not going to happen.\" said by Nick\n\"Just gotta figure out this logic. You got the black, white, the red. The red is the obvious. The red worked.\" said by Chance\n\"Chance is so smart. You know, he\u2019s skilled, he\u2019s very brave. He\u2019s going to make sure that this works. He\u2019s going to get us out of this. I know it. And I\u2019m going to hold your hand until he does so.\" said by Sharon\n\"Dad.\" said by Faith\n\"I\u2019m not going anywhere. You never abandon your kids. I would do this for any of my children. That\u2019s what a father does.\" said by Nick\n\"And that\u2019s what a mother does, too. And one day, you\u2019re going to learn how that feels.\" said by Sharon\n\"I got the red, the white and the black. Or is it red, black, white?\" said by Chance\n\"This can\u2019t be true.\" said by Sally\n\"Sally, I am so sorry.\" said by Adam\n\"No. But how? But how? No, we were just talking about names and imagining exactly what she\u2019d be like. We said that she was going to be strong willed and she was going to be a fighter and how can all that be gone? How can it be over? Because I wasn\u2019t\u2013 I wasn\u2019t even awake for her birth. I\u2019ve never even met her.\" said by Sally\n\"I know. It all seems like a bad dream. I know.\" said by Adam\n\"No, this isn\u2019t real.\" said by Sally\n\"This isn\u2019t good for you I need you to take some deep breaths, okay? Your body has been through a lot and you\u2019re not out of danger. I really need you to rest.\" said by Adam\n\"No! No! Everyone kept telling me to rest and it didn\u2019t help!\" said by Sally\n\"No, no, you\u2013 you cannot think that way, okay?\" said by Adam\n\"No! Why? Why did I lose consciousness? Because if I had just been awake, I could have fought more and she wouldn\u2019t have had to do it on her own and I could have helped her and we could have survived. We could have survived together. Listen to me, stop, stop! You did nothing wrong.\" said by Sally\n\"Then why? Why is our little girl gone?\" said by Sally\n\"You are the strongest person I\u2019ve ever met, but you don\u2019t have to do this alone. Whatever happens, I\u2019m here for you.\" said by Nate\n\"Thank you. I appreciate that. I\u2019m going to take you up on it. I know. Everything\u2019s going to be okay.\" said by Victoria\n\"No question.\" said by Nate\n\"But this situation, it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s going to take a toll on nick. He\u2019s going to need to spend some time with faith. I think he\u2019s probably going to need to take some time off.\" said by Victoria\n\"Maybe. But he might also want to keep working. So let\u2019s just\u2026 take this a step at a time and pray for the best outcome.\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to sleep anytime soon, though.\" said by Victoria\n\"Do you wanna go home?\" said by Nate\n\"No. That doesn\u2019t feel right either.\" said by Victoria\n\"Okay, um\u2026 how about we go back downstairs for a nightcap or some tea and wait for nikki with an update?\" said by Nate\n\"Yeah, I like that. I don\u2019t want to stay cooped up here anymore.\" said by Victoria\n\"Me too.\" said by Nate\n\"Or maybe the nurse can, um, give you something to help you sleep.\" said by Adam\n\"Can you just send nick in, please?\" said by Sally\n\"Nick\u2019s not here.\" said by Adam\n\"You didn\u2019t call him? Adam, I\u2019ve had enough of your stupid competitive games. Seriously\u2026\" said by Sally\n\"That\u2019s not what happened.\" said by Adam\n\"Are you that selfish that you are pushing nick away when I need him most? Please, I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s dealing with cameron. I don\u2019t care if he\u2019s dealing with cameron. He deserves to know.\" said by Sally\n\"Okay, I\u2019ve called him. I\u2019ve left him voicemails. I\u2019m not trying to shut nick out. I\u2019ve even reached out to our father to try to get in touch with him.\" said by Adam\n\"And he hasn\u2019t answered?\" said by Sally\n\"Not yet.\" said by Adam\n\"Okay, then, something must be wrong.\" said by Sally\n\"Look, it\u2019s late. He probably already has his phone off.\" said by Adam\n\"Yeah, we both know that that is not true, okay? He would be here. He would be here if he could be.\" said by Sally\n\"There\u2019s probably plenty of reasons why he didn\u2019t get his messages. He\u2013 he could be away from his phone or\u2013 or the battery might be dead.\" said by Adam\n\"Or he\u2019s just dealing with his real family.\" said by Sally\n\"He is taking care of the cameron kirsten situation. We know that. But once he gets the voicemail, he will be here. It\u2019s what he does.\" said by Adam\n\"But what if he can\u2019t be?\" said by Sally\n\"It\u2019s not an option. He shows up when people need him and you need him now. So, I promise you that he will be here for you.\" said by Adam\n\"It\u2019s black. That\u2019s got to be it. All right. I got this.\" said by Chance\n\"Oh, my god. See, we\u2019ve got this, faith. We\u2019re almost there. We\u2019re almost there.\" said by Sharon\n\"In the movies, it\u2019s always the last wire that makes the bomb blow up, but that\u2019s not true in real life, is it?\" said by Faith\n\"Movies are seldom accurate.\" said by Chance\n\"That\u2019s not a no.\" said by Faith\n\"All right, can I get you over here with the light?\" said by Chance\n\"Yeah. Yeah. You know, faith, you\u2019ve been gone at school so long, you missed some of my new material. Two guys walked into a bar, third guy ducked. Get it?\" said by Nick\n\"Dad.\" said by Faith\n\"Right, right, you\u2019re not supposed to laugh or even move.\" said by Nick\n\"That\u2019s not why I didn\u2019t laugh.\" said by Faith\n\"No one would laugh at that.\" said by Sharon\n\"All right.\" said by Nick\n\"Then, tell me something real. Something I can look forward to.\" said by Faith\n\"All right, how about this? Sally\u2019s baby girl is going to be here pretty soon and she\u2019s going to look up to you even more than christian does.\" said by Nick\n\"And she\u2019s gonna get to grow up playing with baby aria.\" said by Sharon\n\"Double the fun. I love that.\" said by Faith\n\"She\u2019s going to be a very lucky little girl because your dad loves to spoil girls more than he does boys.\" said by Sharon\n\"Not true. I\u2019m an equal opportunity spoiler.\" said by Nick\n\"You are not.\" said by Faith\n\"All right, that might be true. I am looking forward to spoiling her. It\u2019s one of the greatest joys in my life.\" said by Nick\n\"Okay. It\u2019s done.\" said by Chance\n\"What?\" said by Sharon\n\"You mean it\u2019s over?\" said by Faith\n\"Right, take it easy. We\u2019re gonna take it off of you, and dispose of this\u2026\" said by Chance\n\"Oh, my gosh.\" said by Sharon\n\"\u2026Very carefully.\" said by Chance\n\"Oh, my baby. You did it.\" said by Sharon\n\"You did it. You\u2019re one brave young woman.\" said by Nick\n\"We did it. When migraine strikes, you\u2019re faced with a choice.\" said by Faith\n\"The young and the restless will continue.\" said by Announcer\n\"I can think of a lot better places for this celebration, so why don\u2019t you get faith out? I\u2019ll take care of everything down here.\" said by Chance\n\"Are you going to arrest me?\" said by Sharon\n\"No way. He knows it was self-defense.\" said by Nick\n\"She was protecting me.\" said by Faith\n\"I was here. I saw everything. Kirsten attacked you and you reacted out of self-defense. I would have taken him down myself, but I didn\u2019t have clear shot. I couldn\u2019t risk hitting you. Hey. Do not for a second question whether or not you did the right thing.\" said by Chance\n\"Absolutely. You didn\u2019t just save her, you saved all of us. I can\u2019t even imagine what would have happened if you didn\u2019t have that knife.\" said by Nick\n\"That was your idea, nick, thank god.\" said by Sharon\n\"Well, come on, let\u2019s get you two home. Thank you.\" said by Nick\n\"I should leave you down here with the rats. Hey, get down here. We\u2019ve got to lock up this crime scene. Move out a body.\" said by Chance\n\"I left another message.\" said by Adam\n\"Something\u2019s happened to nick, I know it.\" said by Sally\n\"Look, I know that you\u2019re upset that nick\u2019s not here, but we don\u2019t have any reason to believe anything happened to him. Victor would have called.\" said by Adam\n\"Stop trying to tell me not to worry. You told me that everything was going to be okay with the baby and then\u2026\" said by Sally\n\"Sally\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry. My deepest sympathies for your loss.\" said by Elena\n\"God, \u201cmy loss.\u201d I\u2019ve said that so many times in my life, but now it just sounds inadequate.\" said by Sally\n\"Sally, you should know that elena and the doctors did everything that they could.\" said by Adam\n\"It\u2019s okay. I understand that words are hardly comforting at a time like this.\" said by Elena\n\"I\u2019m sorry. I really appreciate all you\u2019ve done. I\u2019m just\u2013\" said by Sally\n\"You\u2019re in shock and that\u2019s to be expected. How are you feeling?\" said by Elena\n\"I don\u2019t know. Just numb. I can\u2019t really feel anything I just\u2013 nothing seems real.\" said by Sally\n\"Okay. Adam, would you mind stepping out of room? I want to talk to sally alone.\" said by Elena\n\"If it\u2019s okay with sally. I\u2019ll be right outside if you need anything. I\u2019m not going anywhere.\" said by Adam\n\"Thank you.\" said by Sally\n\"You were in the delivery room?\" said by Sally\n\"I was.\" said by Elena\n\"I need to know what happened. How did this happen? Was there nothing that you could do to save my baby?\" said by Sally\n\"I\u2019ve never been so relieved to be home in my life.\" said by Faith\n\"Yeah, me neither.\" said by Sharon\n\"And I\u2019ve never been so happy to see you, grandpa.\" said by Faith\n\"My sweetheart, I would have been right by your side if the police had let me into that sewer entrance.\" said by Victor\n\"That\u2019s what I was talking about earlier, faith. It\u2019s what fathers do. They protect their children for the rest of their lives.\" said by Nick\n\"Come here. I\u2019m so happy that everything worked out.\" said by Victor\n\"I hate to think of the other ways things could have gone.\" said by Sharon\n\"Let\u2019s not do that, sharon. We\u2019re all safe. That\u2019s what matters.\" said by Nick\n\"You know, I\u2019m going to call your grandmother, tell her that everything is all right. Okay? She\u2019s worried. Okay. Okay. Be right back.\" said by Victor\n\"Faith, you must be exhausted. Do you want some water? Or some tea? Want something to eat? When was the last time you had a meal?\" said by ", "answer": "Sharon"}
