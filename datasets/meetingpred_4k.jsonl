Could I ask the first question, Minister? Are you satisfied that the Bill gives the same emphasis on tackling noise\u2014? [Translation should read: Are you satisfied that the Bill places the same emphasis on tackling the effects of air pollution on the environment as it does on public health?]&nbsp;\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"The translation has gone weird for a minute.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Shall I try again with the translation?\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"One more go.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Are you satisfied that the Bill places equal emphasis on addressing the effects of air pollution\u2014? No. I'll have to get an English copy of the questions, if that's okay, because I'm not great at simultaneous interpretation.&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><br></span>\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Are you satisfied that the Bill affords equal weight to addressing both the environmental and public health impacts of air pollution?\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Yes. But, it's very important, I think, to understand that the Bill is not intended to be a be-all and end-all for everything to do with clean air. This is part of a suite of measures that we have in place, and it fills in a particular slot in that suite of measures. So, it's not intended to be an all-encompassing, everything-in Bill. So, we're very happy that this plays its proper part in the suite of measures that we have to make sure that we continue to improve air quality across Wales in accordance with all the very best guidelines, and that we will have the powers, because of this Bill, to continue to do that. So, I'm answering a slightly different question because it's really important to always remember that this is not a stand-alone Bill in that sense; it's part of a suite of measures.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Thank you. If I may follow up with that, then, what's your response to the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health and Wales Environment Link, who suggested that the Bill is a missed opportunity to address air pollution from agriculture?\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"So, it's not\u2014. As I say, it's not intended to be an all-encompassing Bill; it's intended to give us duties and powers to do particular things in the clean air air quality space\u2014the soundscape space as well, of course, which is new\u2014and it sits inside a whole suite of other things. We have a large number of duties, which various officials can take us through, to produce plans; there are targets already in place at UK level, and this Bill is enhancing some of the particular powers of the Senedd. So, it was never intended to be a complete catch-all, and, therefore, obviously, it isn't a complete catch-all. So, in that sense, they're right.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Diolch. Can I bring in Huw?\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Diolch, Cadeirydd. Just on that, before I turn to a couple of other matters on the levels of ambition within the Bill\u2014and by the way, some of the evidence we've heard does reflect the fact that we've got a Minister in place who has real ambition on this\u2014the question is: how much do we put on the face of the Bill, and how much do we leave? And there is something of a\u2014sorry, I don't want to put words in your mouth\u2014framework nature about this, and then lots of detail will follow, but on the ammonia issue, we have heard compelling evidence that this is an obvious one to actually put on the face of the Bill to give you the ability to deal with this when you've got all the information in front. It's such a compelling, obvious one to put on an air quality Bill. Are you open to that argument?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Yes. I'm not averse to having a look at the balance between powers and duties, but I think you have to sort of see it in the full landscape. So, what we're doing in this Bill is we're putting a duty on us to look at targets for PM2.5. PM2.5\u2014I'm no technical expert, I should say, Cadeirydd, so officials will come in as necessary\u2014but, as I understand it, PM2.5 is about particulates; particulates are an enormous range of chemicals, of all sorts of matter, debris, chemicals in the air, and we want to be under a duty to do that because that is the one that most people are very, very concerned about.We have already got in place a framework of targets for a number of other things. What this Bill does is give us the power to collect data and to have the right kind of information for being able to set stretching, achievable targets into the future. Now, if the committee feels very strongly that we should be under a duty to consider specific targets for other chemicals, we're very happy to look at that. Bear in mind, though, that we already have targets for a lot of them. So, I suppose the wording will be important. So, I don't know if Members remember the Environmental Protection (Single-use Plastic Products) (Wales) Bill, but we ended up with, 'The Government is under a duty to consider adding in a number of things to the single-use plastic ban'. A very similar mechanism we would be very happy to consider for this, but this Bill is very much about the fact that we don't have the data necessary, or the collection methodology necessary, to be able to look at those targets. So, I'm very happy to look at the balance of whether we're under a duty or we have the power. And the other thing is, the Government would need to consider\u2014. Let me just do a slight cartoon of what I'm trying to say: target setting can go up as well as down, like one of those financial things, your investment can go up as well as down. So, if we have a target, if we have a duty to set a target, and the target is set and it's at the right level, and the Government has a duty to set a target, what's it going to do?\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Yes, indeed. We can come to the detail of the targets, but it's actually\u2014\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"So, a duty to consider whether a target needs to be set for something is probably a more practical way of looking at what we're doing, and that's why we ended up with a single-use plastics Bill\u2014for exactly the same reason.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"I welcome that. I welcome the response there, because it gives us some scope, as a committee, to look at what we could put forward in our discussions. But, certainly, when you have the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health,&nbsp;Natural Resources Wales, Wales Environment Link, and others, relating to the overwhelming evidence that agricultural activity plays a significant role in the quality of air we breathe and biodiversity, it just screams at us, 'Well, why wouldn't we put some reference to this?'Anyway, let me turn to another area that we've had compelling and unanimous evidence that should feature within this, and features, according to those who've given evidence, actually within the scope and remit as well as the primary purposes of this Bill, which is finishing the unfinished work on active travel. So, duties on public bodies, et cetera. I'm just wondering where you are at the moment on this, where your legal advice is internally on this, if you've had any, if you've sought any, because every evidence session we've had has been unanimous in saying, 'This should\u2014'. It wouldn't make it a Christmas tree Bill; it will actually do what the Bill is trying to do and finish off those bits on active travel.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"So, our advice\u2014and I'm more than happy to have an exchange with the committee on this, and probably will need to do it in writing after the evidence session too\u2014but my advice is that we need to be\u2014. I'm very happy to look at it, I'm very happy to consider whether strengthening some active travel provisions will assist with air quality, but we have to be very careful that we're not narrowing the scope of the Bill by doing it. I know the intention is to broaden it, but we have to be really careful that, by putting indicative things into a general section, we're not somehow narrowing the scope, which would be an unintended consequence, I absolutely agree. You also have to be sure that\u2014. So, the parts of active travel you'd be talking about in this Bill would be for air quality only, and so you have to be sure you don't narrow the active travel Bill itself inadvertently by doing that. Because active travel is about a lot more than just air quality, although, obviously, it has an air-quality element to it, but it also has a number of other elements\u2014I preach to the converted here, I know you all know that. So, I'm not averse to it, Huw, but I think we have to be really careful to get the technicalities of it right, so that, in trying to do what I know you're trying to do, we don't inadvertently either narrow this Bill or narrow the active travel Bill. So, I think, probably, if the committee wants to write to me, setting out what you had in mind, and then we can properly respond with the technical considerations of why we think that there might be some unintended consequences. It may well be that, together, we can come to an agreed amendment that the committee Chair or somebody else might want to move, that we would be able to support.I'm not in a position now to argue the intricate detail of exactly what an amendment might look like, but our advice is that, to keep it in scope, it has to be specifically about air quality and nothing else, and you then have to be very careful that you're not conducting a narrowing exercise inadvertently; I understand it would be inadvertent. But I'm more than happy to have that conversation with the committee, and I think, probably, an exchange between our various lawyers and so on about how that might look is very good, and if we can come to an agreed amendment, then I'm more than happy to do it. There's no principled objection to it.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"That's fantastic.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Thank you. That's very welcome, Minister. I appreciate it. I apologise, Huw, can I just bring in Janet quickly? She's indicated.\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Yes, absolutely.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Good morning, Minister. Just back to the ammonia issue, you say that there are targets already in place and then you mention a lack of data. Am I correct to assume, then, that there's no actual monitoring in terms of data going on, as regards the levels of ammonia at the moment?\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"I'm going to have to ask one of the officials to come in on that. Roger, is that you?\" said by Julie James AM\n\"I think there are various stations that monitor levels of ammonia, but there aren't many of them across Wales. And then, obviously, assessments are done on the condition of habitats and things that ammonia will impact on.\" said by Roger Herbert\n\"So, in the areas where we all know are quite rife for where there's probably most likely to be lots of ammonia in terms of this issue, what kind of monitoring is taking place currently?\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"So I think, from memory\u2014I could be wrong\u2014there are about four monitoring stations across Wales that monitor concentrations. There are other methods that measure deposition\u2014so, the fallout onto the plants and soil of ammonia. And those are compared against levels protective of sensitive habitat types.\" said by Roger Herbert\n\"And are they high at the moment?\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"That's also supplemented by modelling, I should say, as well, across the whole of Wales.\" said by Roger Herbert\n\"Because there are concerns that we would like this added in the Bill, you see, but the argument perhaps, Minister, from your side is, 'Well, we're already monitoring them'. But how well are they being monitored is what I'm trying to\u2014\" said by ", "answer": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM"}
{"content": "\"We'll move immediately then to item 2, which is a scrutiny session on the UK Climate Change Committee report on reducing emissions in Wales, and thank you, Minister, for joining us this morning. We are delighted that you've been able to join us so soon after the publication of the report. And, for the record, may I ask Jonathan to introduce himself?&nbsp;\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Good morning everybody. I'm Jonathan Oates. I'm the interim deputy director for climate change and fuel poverty.&nbsp;\" said by Jonathan Oates\n\"Many thanks, and good to have you both here. If I can start then, Minister, obviously we all saw on the news yesterday the huge wildfire on Rhigos mountain\u2014not the only wildfire we've seen in Wales already this year. If anyone doubts that climate change is something that isn't happening, well, actually, we know from flooding, wildfires et cetera that this is the reality and it's impacting on our communities and environment now. In terms of what we're focused on today and the report itself, obviously, there are some positives for Welsh Government there where Wales is leading the way in terms of public engagement and workers and skills, and so on, and it's great to see that praise and acknowledgement. But, overall, this report does raise a number of concerns about our response and actions relating to reducing emissions. I'm sure you've seen the quotes there:'Tangible progress has been insufficient in many areas that are dependent on Welsh Government policy powers',saying that the Welsh Government'is not using its policy powers to full effect. In those sectors where policy is mostly controlled in Wales, the effort is insufficient to achieve the emissions reduction required.'Can I ask for your response, therefore, Minister, to the report?\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Yes. Thank you, Chair. Just let me say something about the wildfires, actually, first. We've had a series of very severe wildfires across Wales, and south Wales in particular, actually. So, I just wanted to say two things, and first of all to just pay tribute to the firefighters and Natural Resources Wales staff who have been absolutely flat out tirelessly working to contain the fires. There will be an investigation as to whether they were spontaneous or whether they were deliberately set. Unfortunately, it looks like some of them, at least, were deliberately set, so we will continue our education campaign.&nbsp;And secondly, to say that we will now have to, obviously, replace and replant all of that, as well as what we were trying to do. In particular on the Rhigos, it's particularly heartbreaking because a large number of the hectares that are burnt beyond redemption there were new trees just coming into full growth. So, it's absolutely heartbreaking, I have to say, but I did want to just pay tribute to the staff who have absolutely been phenomenal in their response to try and contain the fires, and have been successful in putting them out. So, I just wanted to start from there.Yes, just in terms of the report then, I met with the Climate Change Committee when they met here in Wales not long before the publication of the report, so the report is not a particular surprise to us. We had a very full and frank discussion with the Climate Change Committee. I think that we've been very clear about the difficulty of the pathway&nbsp;ahead for Wales. Just in this committee alone there have been lots of evidence sessions where I\u2019m saying that we have met our first carbon budget, we\u2019re on track for our second carbon budget, we\u2019ve complied with the Climate Change Committee\u2019s requests for what the second carbon budget should be, but that we will need to do nearly twice as much in the next 10 years as we\u2019ve done in the last 30. I\u2019ve said that repeatedly. That is not just a casual, throwaway remark, it\u2019s an acknowledgement that we\u2019re off where we need to be. We\u2019re okay 'for now\u2019, but we need to accelerate very significantly over the next seven years to 2030.We\u2019ve done a number of things to try and accelerate that. Net Zero Wales is one. We\u2019ve only very recently published Net Zero Wales. It has a whole raft of policies and proposals and pledges for action. One of the things this report very much highlights is that we can\u2019t do this alone. Policy alone will not do this. We need implementation on the ground. So, as we always do, we try to get a team Wales approach going with everyone involved in where we\u2019re trying to get to. At the moment it looks to us\u2014. I should say, to start off with, Chair, that we have not interrogated all of the data that goes behind this report. So there are bits of it that we\u2019re a little bit baffled by, and until we get into the data we won\u2019t understand quite how they\u2019ve got to where they are, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll come on to bits of that later on. But our current modelling shows that we will outperform carbon budget 2 and get to 44 per cent in this time period, but that we will then very seriously struggle to get to carbon budget 3 unless we put things in train in the next two years that will accelerate progress. So, that\u2019s our modelling, and we\u2019ll have to compare it to the modelling in here to just see what the various bits are.I hope this committee will play its part in relaying its feelings about this to the UK for the progress report that they are about to do, which we all contribute to, so that we understand the severity of the need for change in order to get to where we want to be. And unfortunately, the committee\u2019s just a little ahead of us because next week I\u2019m going to get our latest emissions data, so that will be the first real time that we have to see whether our projections for the data are actually accurate. Obviously, as soon as we get those and I\u2019ve managed to have a look at them, we\u2019re happy to report back to the committee, and indeed I\u2019ll probably do a statement in the Senedd about it. So we\u2019re in the process of just having a first, hard check, if you like, about where we are with the data.The other thing to say is that, of course, this has all been affected by the pandemic. The carbon data for the pandemic is extraordinary, as you\u2019d all expect. Transport emissions fall, nobody went anywhere, so the air cleaned up. If that wasn\u2019t an example of what human beings are doing to the planet, I don\u2019t know what is. It was obvious, and more obvious in other parts of the world than here, but here it was obvious, too. But of course, that affects our data. For that year, or year and a half, there\u2019s going to be a blip in the data going forward that we\u2019ll have to have a look at.We\u2019ve got to get past the idea that we can all sign up to these goals and then baulk at the various things that we need to do to get there. You\u2019ll have heard me saying in the Senedd on a number of occasions that it\u2019s all very well to say we\u2019ve signed up to this, but pretty much everything we put forward has somebody saying they don\u2019t want to do that bit. And that\u2019s not going to work. So we\u2019re all going to have to change, we\u2019re all going to have to do things differently, and that\u2019s every single sector across Wales, not just the Government, because otherwise we can\u2019t do it. I can\u2019t do it on my own. So, I think if this isn\u2019t a wake-up call for everyone, then I don\u2019t know what is, really.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Thank you, Minister. I know Huw is&nbsp;keen to come in.\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Thank you very much, Chair. One of the things that might help with that level of holding individual Members to account will be the extension of the TheyWorkForYou website to cover the Senedd as well as the UK Parliament, and people will be able to look at individual voting records on department budgets and how they've carried through on this or not. But what I wanted to ask was\u2014. You mentioned there the challenge about what this committee can do to support overtures to the UK Government. I don't want this to be a session where we just look up the M4, but what are those specific asks, please? Can you lay them out? And do they include, as this committee recently did, an ask for the UK Government to step in and assist, for example, one of the biggest contributors to carbon emissions, which is Tata Steel, in terms of decarbonisation? They told us, in front of us, that the \u00a3300,000 contribution is nothing, it's a drop in the ocean compared to what other European governments are giving to decarbonise steel.&nbsp;\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"There are a number of things, Huw, but the two big ones are that they could decarbonise the grid\u2014we still have a disproportionate number of gas-fired power stations in Wales, for example, so they could decarbonise the grid in a big way\u2014and the UK Government has not got a great track record for onshore renewables, to be honest, and hasn't been all that helpful with us, if I'm honest.We're currently having an argument with the UK Government, which will come to the floor of the Senedd shortly, about the current Energy Bill and some issues in it around devolved competence that we're not very happy about. I don't think it's appropriate for me to go into the detail here, but there are a number of areas in which they say they want to decarbonise the grid but, actually, they're not doing any of the things that would allow you to get the fossil-fuelled power out of it. Tata Steel is a very good example, but there are a number of others. We think that there's much more that could be done in carbon capture, in hydrogen roll-out. There are a variety of them, and Jon can give you chapter and verse, if you want, Chair. We don't have the levers to be able to do all of that ourselves, but we do have a supporting role in all of that and we do play it.&nbsp;I extremely recently met with National Grid. I met with the Crown Estate yesterday with the First Minister and so on. So we play our part in trying to push those sectors in the right direction. But, for example, with National Grid, National Grid needs a complete overhaul of the regulatory framework within which it operates. It has a very excellent new chief executive who wants to do that, but the UK Government has to do that. I don't have the levers to do it myself, although obviously when we instruct National Grid from our point of view we give the instructions that would keep us in line with the pathway. So, there are a number of things, and I'm very happy to set them out for the committee.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Yes, please.&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"They're included in Net Zero Wales, in fact, in pretty stark terms. We can do that. But we have a number of levers here that we also\u2014I'm sure the committee will want to get into this right now\u2014try to pull. I would argue, and I'm about to argue I'm sure in front of the committee, and, if any of you saw me being interviewed with <em>Politics</em> <em>Wales, </em>you will have heard me arguing it then as well, that we've very significantly turned the ship of state in the last two or three years, and it's not easy to do. In the formation of this portfolio in the incoming Government, which is not quite halfway through its term at the moment, there's been a significant policy shift in the last two and a half years, and you can see that in our attitude to the roads review, to active travel, to tree planting, to biodiversity recovery. The whole thing is different.&nbsp;\" said by Julie James AM\n\"If I can, Minister, from the comments you've made, do you think the criticisms are unfair from this report?&nbsp;\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"No, I don't. I think they're perfectly fair. We had a very good conversation with them. There are nuances that I might argue with. The wastes chapter we are a bit baffled by, to be honest, and I'll happily go back to them. But they are a critical friend. There's plenty of praise in here for us as well, but they're right: we are not going fast enough in agriculture and in transport and there are more things that we could do. I suppose what I would argue though, Chair, is that I think it's a little bit harsh in its perfectly okay criticism, in that I think we've actually shifted in that direction quite substantially over the last two years, and, actually, in conversation with them they certainly acknowledge that, but it's not coming through in the report, and that's a matter for them. But I do think that the ramping up of tree planting, for example, and the restoration of peatland and seagrass has ramped up in the last year in a way that wasn't evident before that. So, I think we've significantly turned.&nbsp;\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Thank you. I'll bring Jenny in.&nbsp;\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"I absolutely acknowledge the leadership role you've played in terms of the review of the roads and the courageous decisions you've taken on that. I just wanted to go back to National Grid, because it seems to me they have such a dominant role in how we account for our expenditure on gas and electric. Whilst we still guarantee all these fossil fuel companies a guaranteed price, based on whatever the spot price for gas is, it just seems to me there are no levers or no reasons why they should change. We'll come on to the detail, but what can we do, in light of that fundamental policy decision by the UK Government?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"There are three intertwined things there. There's the way that energy is generated for the grid. That's the first one, and that is about getting as much fossil fuels out of it and as much renewables in as humanly possible. I don't think they're going fast enough to do that, for various complicated reasons. Then there's the second one, which is about how the grid anticipates future development, and that requires the regulatory reform that I was talking about, because, at the moment, it's reactive, it requires a contractor to come along and say that they'd like a connection and so on. So, it's really hopeless. They know that, but it needs regulatory reform.And then the third one is actually the energy pricing structure, which is in the hands of the UK Government. They have decided to peg electricity to the marginal price of gas. Well, that makes no sense for renewables; the way that you build, construct and deliver renewables is entirely different. If you think of a fossil fuel power station, you have capital expenditure to build it\u2014you obviously have revenue expenditure as well, but mostly capex to build it\u2014and then you have revenue expenditure to provide it with the raw material to produce the energy. When you build renewables, you have capital expenditure and some revenue to support it, and then a small amount of revenue to keep it running, but the raw material that it 'burns' to produce energy is free. So, the idea that it's pegged to the marginal price of gas makes no sense for renewables.How we've been responding to that in Wales\u2014and, actually, this is a community response right across the UK\u2014is more and more people are going to fixed-wire developments that don't connect to the grid. Morriston Hospital, for example, is currently powered entirely by a solar farm that isn't connected to the grid, so they're not paying for electricity in that way,&nbsp; they're having it provided to them direct from their own expenditure. That is a way to do it, but it's not optimal. It would be far better if the grid was able to support those developments and that the price you then paid for the electricity was commensurate. This is a long conversation we could have about how that works.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Okay. Well, let's come back to it afterwards.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Yes, because, obviously, we are focused today on the report specifically on Wales, and I do want to return to the fact that the report does say that we are not using our full powers to full effect. I think that's the focus I would like us to place. Obviously, Chris Stark said that there's a worrying gap between ambition and delivery in Wales. There's no doubting the ambition and where we all want to get to, I would hope, and I hope you will see us as a critical friend as a committee, because we understand how important it is, but I do want to focus on some of the issues there, just in terms of the Net Zero Wales plan, if I may, specifically. Obviously, the Welsh Government had decided on an approach that was different to the recommendations. Do you think that was right?

The first item this afternoon is questions to the Minister for Economy, and the first question is from Peredur Owen Griffiths.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"1. What is the Government doing to create jobs in South Wales East? OQ59573\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"Thanks for the question. Our economic mission, published last year, sets out clearly the values and priorities that shape our decisions to support the economy. Just one positive example is the work we have undertaken to promote and secure investment in the compound semiconductor cluster in South Wales East. This includes, of course, the KLA multimillion pound investment, which will secure hundreds of new well-paid jobs.\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"Thank you for that answer.\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"In recent weeks, we've had the devastating news that two large factories in my region are closing\u2014Tillery Valley Foods and, more recently, Avara\u2014with a combined loss of more than 600 jobs. I hope there's swift and robust action from this Government in response to the heavy blow to the local economy, and I'd welcome an update from the Minister about what steps the Government is taking to help mitigate those job losses. I'm also keen to explore what jobs can be created in my region, specifically in the Tech Valleys project of Ebbw Vale. When this was unveiled some six years ago by your Government, it was hailed as \u00a3100 million investment that would create at least 1,500 jobs in new technologies and advanced manufacturing. A freedom of information response from the Welsh Government from March of this year showed that you can only account for 29 jobs that have been created, whilst admitting this may be an incomplete picture. Many people are asking where these jobs are that were promised. Recent weeks have shown how badly these jobs are needed. Can you confirm, Minister, that this project is still on the cards and won't be consigned to the file marked 'Yet another disappointment for Blaenau Gwent'? Diolch.\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"I'm positive about the future of the Tech Valleys programme. It's a subject that I've had a number of direct conversations with the constituency Member for Blaenau Gwent about since I took up this post, about what we are doing, and making sure that people think about the travel-to-work area as well, to make sure that the investment is focused on Blaenau Gwent. And the constituency Member has been very clear that he expects to be able to see the money spent within the constituency. What we are looking to do is to make sure that we're looking at strategic investments, and the way we've partnered with both the authority and the board around this are important parts of it. If you look at areas where that investment helped secure, for example, the work around Thales in Blaenau Gwent, a deliberates choice, added to by Tech Valleys, the work we're looking to do with both the TVR investment and the security of jobs on that site, and the investment in property, I think we'll actually have a good story to tell on Tech Valleys.And more broadly, of course, on the issue you started with, about the significant loss of employment that is likely from both Tillery Valley Foods and the announcement yesterday about Avara, our concern remains the 440-odd families affected by yesterday's announcement, and the approximately 260 families affected by Tillery Valley Foods. And we're looking to have an approach that brings together both the trade unions\u2014it's Community on TVF, and it's Unite at Avara\u2014the local authority, the Welsh Government, and agencies from the UK Government too. The first meeting of a formal taskforce around TVF took place this morning, and I met with the deputy leader of Monmouthshire County Council this morning, who's the lead member on economic development in the county. In Avara, it's a fact that much of the workforce in Avara, which is in Monmouthshire, comes from Blaenau Gwent. So, I'm looking at how we join together the responses with both local authorities, both recognised unions, and opportunities, if there are any, to try and secure going concerns on those sites, and, if not, what we can do with the programmes we fund\u2014Communities for Work Plus and ReAct+\u2014to try to secure alternative employment for people directly affected by losses in this sector.\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"I join my fellow Member for South Wales East in his concern for what's happening in South Wales East at the moment, in terms of the job losses. Six hundred jobs is an awful lot of jobs. We saw, obviously, Tillery Valley Foods entering administration last week, and now we've got Avara Foods in Abergavenny. It would be interesting to see what actual positive action you have taken to date and timelines of anything you've done and what you plan to do in the future. It's great that you say that you will look to take care of families, in partnership with local authorities, that have been affected. But we need to know what you're going to do to improve job opportunities in our region, going forward,&nbsp;and how you are going to look to protect any more businesses from any more future job losses. We can't have a situation where, every week, we stand up in the Senedd and we've got more job losses. This seems to be a recurring theme at the moment. So, is there something that you can actually do, Minister, to intervene here, and to ensure that there are fewer job losses and more positive action from this Government in terms of what you're doing on the ground, perhaps even looking into extending degree apprenticeship opportunities, which are severely lacking in Wales compared to the rest of the UK? That also, in itself, will expand job opportunities and upskill many of the people in my area. Thank you.&nbsp;\" said by Laura Anne Jones AM\n\"With respect, I don't think degree apprenticeships has much relevance to the challenges faced by Tillery Valley Foods or, indeed, Avara. We're thinking about a sector that is directly affected by a range of factors. It's affected by trading conditions, and you'll have heard, in the previous issues on Anglesey, that Two Sisters were clear that the post-Brexit trading environment was part of the reason why they felt that they could not go on.The other common factor, though, is the reality of price rises. So, it's a cost-of-living crisis and a cost-of-doing-business crisis. Energy costs are a significant factor in this sector, and Avara have cited that that is a significant concern for them. They're looking to consolidate their business, and they're saying that they're also looking at investment choices within plant and machinery. And actually, within this part of the food sector, there is capital investment support available from the Welsh Government\u2014up to 40 per cent support with costs for capital investment. We've offered that previously. We've made clear that offer is still available for Avara in the past, or, rather, in the immediate past following their announcement, because our focus is can we maintain the jobs and can we secure an alternative business on that site. If that isn't possible, we will need to look at what else we can do, and I've set that out both in the earlier response, but also in answer to the topical question from the Member for Blaenau Gwent about Tillery Valley Foods. That's going to be the continued focus. And I think, actually, if I go into too much detail on what the Member set out\u2014what are the challenges for businesses and what can we do?\u2014it will end up being a very, I think, typecast discussion and disagreement about UK-wide choices.&nbsp;I'll continue to keep people updated on what we are doing with both of the businesses and the scale of the job losses, and the alternatives for employment within the south-east area, where, in some sectors, we do have significant opportunities for the future. Others, I think, will be under increasing stress and pressure, and today's inflation figures, I think, underscore the unevenness of the pressure and challenges facing key parts of our economy and a range of jobs that rely upon them.&nbsp;\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"I'm grateful to you, Minister, for the answers to those questions. I'm grateful to you also for the support you've given the people of Blaenau Gwent during recent years, and the work you've done leading on the Tech Valleys investments, which has led to the work that's been done in Thales, has certainly fulfilled the expectations that we had of that programme. The job losses we've heard in recent weeks, both in Tillery Valley Foods and, this week, in Avara Foods, are real serious blows to the local economy and to the families that are sustained by that employment. Most of the employees, of course, in Abergavenny are actually from Blaenau Gwent. And we are looking to Welsh Government to continue the work that you have undertaken in recent weeks. There's a jobs fair taking place this morning in Abertillery, and also, I attended the first meeting of the taskforce on Tillery Valley Foods, and the Welsh Government officials there provided great support to the local authority and to others, and we're grateful to you for that.&nbsp;Looking forward, Minister, we clearly need to invest in that A465 corridor, and we look to the Welsh Government for that northern Valleys programme that we've debated and discussed. You've already agreed to come to Blaenau Gwent to discuss these matters, and I look forward to your visit. But can we ensure that we do have the structure put in place to ensure that we have the Tech Valleys, that we have the response to job losses, but we also have the proactive business support, employment support and economic support programme that the Welsh Government can deliver, has delivered, and I'm confident will continue to deliver in the Heads of the Valleys?\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Thank you for the comments and questions. I think it is good news that the taskforce has met, and that draws together Welsh Government, the local authority and, indeed, the local management of the Department for Work and Pensions, who have been constructive in this. I think it's important to recognise that part of the UK Government is actually trying to be part of the answer locally. There are issues around how we carry on our partnership work within the food sector, which, overall, has been a success story. But we do see challenges in some parts of the manufacturing chain, and that's exactly what we're seeing at the moment, and those challenges at the moment are leading to job losses. We need to look at those businesses, what the fragilities actually arise from, and what we can do and equally what other actors could do as well.I'm very keen that we continue to make the most of the investment that we have undertaken in the transport infrastructure, and you're quite right about that. Actually, part of the reason why so many of the workers in Avara Foods come from your constituency is that it is a very short trip on a piece of network\u2014on a piece of network that exists. But, also, it's a reason why it's an employment site that, I think, has good prospects for the future. Now, that won't be much comfort to those immediate workers who are there, but it's a site that is well served by infrastructure, well connected to workforce opportunities, and so I'm optimistic about what we'll be able to do in partnership with local authorities. And that comes back to your point around the structure and the opportunity to carry on investing, and not just the immediate reaction to where there are significant challenges, but what we'll proactively do to invest in communities, whether it's skills\u2014. That's why we're looking to deliver more investment and why it was so important that we had a refresh of our manufacturing action plan. I'm very keen that the Welsh Government, local authority, including the Cardiff capital region, understand that we expect to see proactive investment and effort in the Heads of the Valleys, and not simply around the southern part of the capital region. It's an ongoing conversation. I'd be more than happy to take up the Member's invitation to come to an appropriate event in Blaenau Gwent.\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"Peter Fox.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Diolch Llywydd, and I'm grateful to you for allowing me to contribute as well, and many of the questions have been put. This isn't a time to play politics; this is an important time for us to come together to support the communities who are deeply affected by the threats of job losses. I am pleased, Minister, that you've already had that first meeting this morning with those key individuals to find a way forward for my own community and for neighbouring communities. That is fundamentally important. I am so worried for these people. They have homes, they have mortgages, they have families, and they must be in a terrible situation at the moment with the anxiety of what lies ahead of them. I suppose my question would be: how do we work together to help these people through this difficult time? But more so, how do we work together to lay the foundations for future job opportunities in the area? And, building on the fantastic expertise we have and the conditions that we have in the area, there is a great opportunity there and we need to grasp it. These shocks are difficult to comprehend, but we need to help these people through this difficult time, and I'm willing to play my part in what is needed next.&nbsp;\" said by Peter Fox MS\n\"That's a very helpful and constructive offer from Mr Fox. Look, I'd say the honest truth is, when the business sets out that energy and wider inflation have a cost, that shouldn't surprise us. But, of course, today's figures on food and inflation show a significant rise, and that's because those cost pressures are in every part of the chain, from the feed cost, and you'll be aware from your own enterprise as well that feed costs have risen\u2014. That means that when poultry is then going into Avara Foods, it's at a higher price, that's being passed on and, actually, there's a challenge in people then deciding whether they want that product or not. That is a key factor in where we are. The Welsh Government and the UK Government need to be part of the answer. It's why I'm more than happy to work with the Member as a constituency Member, and, indeed, his colleague in the Westminster Parliament, who I may not always see eye to eye with as well, but this is an issue about the constituency and it's about people affected directly by that, and it's about how I think we can look to work with both local authorities, because there is a cross-over of interests and working populations. I'd be more than happy to get in touch with the office again. I know you weren't able to secure a meeting before today's debate\u2014I understand you have a debate on a piece of legislation\u2014but I am more than happy to make time to have a further discussion with him and other partners in order to see what we can do, as opposed to what things we can't do.&nbsp;\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"Minister, I recently visited Shine Catering Systems, a family-run company that employs about 65 people in Newport East. They've been in existence for quite some time. They design, they manufacture and they install commercial catering equipment, and their clients include the Ministry of Defence and Google. They've got a long history of employing apprentices, Minister, and one of their issues at the moment is that they're finding it very difficult to recruit a manufacturing apprentice at level 3, and this has been a trend for some little time. So, they asked me, really, to raise these issues and what more Welsh Government might do, working with the city council, Coleg Gwent to make sure that manufacturing apprenticeships are attractive to our young people in Wales.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"I actually think that continuing to raise the issue here and further afield is an important part of it. There's a job for the Government to do, but Members, with your own local influences and networks, and businesses too, as well. Because part of the challenge is that when someone is, at 16, considering their career then, there are a number of options that have already been closed off, so, actually, we've got to do more to raise the profile of other opportunities earlier on in their life, in education. It's something I discussed yesterday again with the education Minister.But manufacturing does have a positive future here in Wales. It\u2019s the biggest sector of our economy than in the rest of the UK\u2014over 150,000 jobs are in it and they\u2019re normally good jobs, paying well above the living wage. It\u2019s about how we then encourage people to keep their minds open to the opportunities that exist because there is funding support still available from the Government to support people through apprenticeships. And when things like National Apprenticeship Week come up, you again see the variety of opportunities. We\u2019re very clear that we want more people to undertake science, technology, engineering, and mathematics subjects and STEM-based apprenticeships. And I hope that the Member and others, when it comes to manufacturing week in the autumn, will take up further opportunities to highlight the wide variety of careers. It\u2019s not just Jack Sargeant who has an interest in this area\u2014all of us, I think, have an interest in seeing a bright and positive future for manufacturing. And we will keep on making the case to young people, and others later in life, that an apprenticeship is a really good route for their future and will also help us secure a better, stronger and fairer economy.\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"2.

{"content": "\"We move on to the second item where, of course, we're holding our first evidence session relating to the Environment (Air Quality and Soundscapes) (Wales) Bill as part of Stage 1 scrutiny of the Bill. You'll remember that we received evidence from the Minister at the end of the spring term, and we will be hearing from her again at the end of this first stage. But, before us today we have two academics who I'm sure are going to contribute to the scrutiny work, and therefore I welcome Dr Victoria Jenkins, associate professor in law with Swansea University, and Professor Enda Hayes, who is a professor of air quality and carbon management in the University of the West of England. A very warm welcome to you both and thank you for joining us. We'll go straight to questions, and I know that Janet Finch-Saunders wants to ask the first question. Thank you.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. Good morning, bore da. Is the Bill, as currently drafted, sufficiently ambitious to lead to significant improvement in air quality in Wales and soundscapes? And if not, why not?\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"Do you want&nbsp;to go first?\" said by Dr Victoria Jenkins\n\"A nice easy question to start. So, air quality and the challenge of dealing with air quality is not new. Since the Environment Act 1995, which is 25 years ago, we've been trying to address this challenge and, to be very honest, we have fundamentally failed. We're very good at diagnosing the problem; we're just not very good at solving it. Now, there are elements of this Bill that I think are going to have a fundamental effect, a positive effect on that challenge. Part of the issues around the Environment Act was the wording of the Act\u2014that you had to work in 'pursuit' of the air quality objectives. We now have got stronger language saying that we have to 'secure' them. So, that's good. Updating of the strategy on a more regular basis, evidence-based targets I think are all really, really positive steps. The bit that worries me is I get a tone from the Bill that we're almost starting from scratch, and we're not. We've got 25-30 years of evidence behind us, which means, I think, we can be a lot more ambitious in terms of the timelines, the targets and how we are going to get there. So, it's Marmite for me at the moment, because there are some bits that I think are really, really good and will solve a lot of the issues and will help us progress in terms of addressing the problems, but it just feels like we can do more.\" said by Professor Enda Hayes\n\"Okay. And we'll come on to some of those individual issues, I'm sure. Dr Jenkins.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"My interest in this Bill is in relation to how we balance, and my interest generally in terms of environmental law is how we create that balance between giving policy makers and giving Government the discretion to take action to achieve something, but at the same time ensuring accountability. So, that's where I think law may have done us a disservice in the past, and that, moving forward, we need more innovative approaches in that respect. And, from that perspective, I think there are, again, some good bits of this Bill, which are really attempting to put into place a robust framework. I should say I've been an environmental academic lawyer for over 20 years, but I don't specialise in air quality law specifically, so I'm less familiar with the science, but that's why Professor Hayes is here. So, I would say it makes it a little bit trickier for me to talk about the ambition of the Bill in those circumstances, but I'm here to discuss the framework and how it sits today in terms of that balance between discretionary powers and accountability.\" said by Dr Victoria Jenkins\n\"Excellent. We will indeed be pursuing some of those points, as well, in a moment, but I'll come to Huw.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. I want to go through a specific point right at the outset, which is the scope of the Bill. You touched on the point about starting from scratch. Well, actually, we have various policies in place. One of them is the Active Travel (Wales) Act 2013. I declared my interest earlier on there. Now, the active travel group have submitted evidence to this about whether we need to finish some unfinished business that could have been done at the time of the original active travel Act. It's to do with things such as duties to promote active travel, which we've failed to do, et cetera. Now, within the Bill, the Bill addresses two specific, distinct purposes\u2014and my thanks for the briefing note on this\u2014improving air quality, and assessing and managing noise. The cross-party group submission makes the point that Welsh Government state that, in their clean air plan, transport is now the largest source of nitrogen oxides in Wales, predominantly due to emissions from road transport, accounting for approximately one third of emissions, and also, within the explanatory memorandum to the Environment (Air Quality and Soundscapes) (Wales) Bill, it states that our 27 noise maps suggest the homes of more than 200,000 people across Wales are exposed to road traffic noise levels exceeding the World Health Organization's 2009 night-noise guidelines, and make the point that the most significant way to deal with this is shifting people away from road use, motorised vehicles, into active travel, walking and cycling, and they suggest some amendments. Have you had time to look at that? Sorry for the extensive preamble, but have you had time to look at that, to express an opinion as to whether you think amendments on active travel would fall within the scope of this Bill? And if you haven't\u2014and I realise you may not\u2014would you be able to go away and have a look at this to see whether you think that those may fall within the scope, because the Llywydd will ultimately have to make a decision on this?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"I haven't had a chance to look at it before coming today. I do think that the active travel legislation is significant in the context of air quality and public health, and from my perspective, as an environmental lawyer as well, it's particularly important in bringing together our objectives in Wales in relation to both public health and environmental protection. So, it's certainly, from that perspective, something that I would consider important.\" said by Dr Victoria Jenkins\n\"Okay.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"I haven't had a chance to look at it either, but what I would say is that when you're looking at solutions, particularly for transport, active travel is essential. You've got to get to that point. I think, for years, we've been very much orientated in our solutions towards technocentric solutions. So, these are cleaner vehicles, cleaner fuels. That will only get us so far; the scale of the problem here means that we have to look at behavioural interventions, which means getting more people out of vehicles, onto bikes, and out of cars. That's a given. There are a lot of things you have to address to get around that: affordability, accessibility, reliability\u2014all those things that come with public transport\u2014and safety issues around active travel infrastructure, things like that. It's essential. If we're going to solve this problem, then we've got to deal with it.The other point that I might add, if I may, is that what we're dealing with here is a public health issue. It's a public health issue. So, if you're looking at active travel interventions, those interventions will have the core benefits of also working towards better public health. So, it isn't just about improving air quality; it's also the benefits you get elsewhere. So, it's essential, in my mind.\" said by Professor Enda Hayes\n\"Rather than delay the committee, then, Chair\u2014and thank you for those answers; so, in principle, you've got no objection and, in fact, you can see the benefits of it\u2014I wonder if I could, perhaps, be cheeky enough to ask you to go away and look at it, perhaps discuss it with colleagues in law and whatever to see whether you think it falls within the scope of the two aims of this Bill.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Okay.\" said by Professor Enda Hayes\n\"Thank you. Janet, did you want to come back in on something? And then we'll come back to Huw.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Yes. Thank you, Chair. All it was, when we take evidence during the forming of new Bills, quite often, one thing that comes up is that we haven't collected enough data. Now, you say that we look like we're almost at the start again, but a lot of years have gone before. Has the Welsh Government been proactive in collecting the relevant data so that any Bill going forward will be based on really good evidence, if you like?\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"I can start there. You can always get more data, is the short answer. You can always have more, it can always be better. Across Wales, if we're looking at air quality monitoring data, we've got a pretty extensive network of monitoring sites. I think, from memory, there are about fortyish continuous analysers run by local authorities, and about 10 to 12 analysers connected to the automatic urban and rural network. There's plenty of data already out there. Now, that can always be improved, and I think the tone of the Bill means that we'll have to think differently about how we monitor. So, at the moment, we've monitored for compliance, we've monitored where we've got problematic areas, where we've got these hotspots, where we've got these risks of exceedances. This Bill, again, seems to be more orientated towards prevention, being more proactive\u2014again, the public health side of the issue\u2014which means we have to think differently about how we monitor in terms of understanding public health, and bringing that air quality, health, deprivation triple jeopardy into the equation. So, we've got plenty to start from; we can always have more, and we will have to think differently because the Bill is orientating our approach slightly differently.\" said by Professor Enda Hayes\n\"Okay. Fine.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Thank you.\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"Thank you. Huw.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Let me come on, then, to ask for your views on the Welsh Government's decision, as it stands, to set air quality targets in regulations rather than on the face of the Bill. And their argument is that this will give greater flexibility to respond to the latest guidance and to futureproof the Bill. Do you have sympathy with that or would you prefer to see air quality targets bang on the face of the Bill?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"I think this is a question for me in the sense that, if you say too much on the face of primary legislation like this, then you are impinging your discretion to take action as things proceed and as scientific knowledge and understanding moves on. So, it is often a good idea to create a power to introduce regulations. That said, the issue then becomes, well, to what extent do you give the Government discretion, or the Executive discretion, to bring in those regulations and what's the framework for that. So, currently, there is quite a lot of discretion now given to the Executive in that respect, and that's something that you might want to consider further.\" said by Dr Victoria Jenkins\n\"So, how would you suggest that we limit that discretion and that we have a good baseline going upwards rather than a baseline that allows flexibility for a future Minister to say, 'This is too tough; we're asking too much of people'?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Well, at the moment, you have a power to introduce the regulations. So, once you give someone a power, if you don't put a time frame on whether or not that power is exercised, then it might never be exercised. So, that's one thing you might want to consider.The other issue is that we don't necessarily want to set out exactly what pollutants we want those regulations to target, but we could have something in there about the fact that they need to target those pollutants that are an issue, and we want these regulations to achieve certain objectives in terms of tackling air pollution. So, you could frame it more clearly in that way, to ensure that the regulations will be brought into being and that they will aim to achieve certain objectives.\" said by Dr Victoria Jenkins\n\"Okay, so we should circumscribe a future Minister's discretion, make clear what flexibility we would allow, and also the question of making sure that it comes back to the Senedd for any changes, ratcheting up and so on. Other than PM2.5, the Bill doesn't require Welsh Government to set targets for other pollutants or to prescribe the pollutants for which targets should be set. So, what are your views on this? You just touched on one aspect of that.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Well, I've just said that, if you say on the face of this Bill exactly what pollutants, then, in future, unless you're going to give a power to add to that list, then it's going to be difficult, because this legislation is going to have longevity, isn't it, and you need to make sure that we can move on when new pollutants arise. So, one of the issues that has arisen during the consultation on the White Paper was this issue of ammonia. So, that could be a challenge in the future, and we need to make sure that this Bill is one that could address that, if necessary, in the future. So, that's what we need to try to achieve with this.\" said by Dr Victoria Jenkins\n\"Okay. Jenny, you wanted to come in.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"I understand the importance of constraining policy makers in the powers they have, but my concern about this Bill is that it's setting the bar so high in terms of it has to be objectively measured and it has to specify a date by which the standard is to be achieved. It doesn't feel like the precautionary approach is being taken here, given that we know that this is an urgent public health matter, so how do you\u2014? It feels like this could be a prescription for doing nothing, because there's never enough information about exactly what we know.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Well, that is the problem. If you're overly prescriptive&nbsp;and you don't get the balance right, then the problem might be that we're not ambitious enough in the targets that we introduce, and that's where we're trying to get the balance here. So, it's novel to say that we want to have targets that are achievable and that will be achieved, and, ultimately, that's what we want; you know, targets are no good if we don't meet them. But at the same time, if you do that and if you have very strict responsibilities placed on Government to achieve these targets, then you have to balance that with some discretion, and that's why there are provisions for exceptions, et cetera. So, it's just about the balance and how to get the balance right, and that's what I've discussed in the evidence that I've given.\" said by Dr Victoria Jenkins\n\"Thank you. Janet, you wanted to come in on another matter.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Huw has brought in about the PM2.5 target, other than just one part. Do you agree with the tight three-year timescale for setting this, and\u2014yes, just following on from Huw, really\u2014should there be a timescale for the introduction of other pollutant targets? If so, what should it be?\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"Well, I just said I thought maybe we should have a timescale, but as to the timescale\u2014.\" said by Dr Victoria Jenkins\n\"If I've understood the Bill correctly, I've got issues with the timescale. I'll try and do the sums in my head as I work my way through. So, we assume the Bill goes through and it gets signed off, Royal Assent, and it starts in 2024, for argument's sake. You've then got three years to put a target in\u2014that's 2027. You've then got 10 years to try and achieve that\u2014that's 2037. If you don't achieve it, you have to write a report within 12 months, to 2038, and then the phrase is that&nbsp;it needs to be achieved 'as soon as reasonably practicable'. What does that mean?\" said by Professor Enda Hayes\n\"And then, five years later, the review.&nbsp;\" said by ", "answer": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM"}

I'm Rachel Downing, I'm head of policy and campaigns at Target Ovarian Cancer.\" said by Rachel Downing\n\"Lovely, thank you. Sorry, there's one thing I should do before we show the video. Can I just do a quick translation check if that's all right? If you can hear, can you just put your thumbs up? Okay, that's fine. We'll sort that out, no problem at all. Thank you ever so much. First off, if I can ask the technical team if they can begin the video this morning.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Can I thank Judith for being willing to tell her story publicly as well as to the engagement team? It's such a powerful story. I'm just so sorry to hear Judith's story. It's difficult to know what else to say, really; it's just a terrible story. For us, as members of the committee, it's more powerful than anyone who can just sit here and give us written evidence or talk from a third-party point of view, so thank you, Judith.We heard two other video stories last week as well. So, perhaps, Lowri, I can address the first question to you. I think other Members will have questions about Judith's story, and they'll no doubt incorporate them into their own questions, but we just hear\u2014from Judith's situation, and from the videos last week we hear of symptoms being dismissed and ignored by healthcare professionals. Is this something, Lowri, that's happening across primary and secondary care, and tertiary care? Is there a gender bias in healthcare?\" said by Russell George AM\n\"First of all, I just want to pay tribute to Judith myself, and on behalf of Tenovus Cancer Care, for actually telling her story so bravely, and I know that she's actually watching this morning, so diolch yn fawr iawn, Judith, <em>am fod mor ddewr</em>\u2014thank you for being so brave. Obviously, we wish her all the very best.&nbsp;I think, also, it's really important to say that people are working very, very hard in the health board\u2014not just that health board, but across all health boards and across the NHS in Wales, and we need to recognise that. I think that's really important. But what we're seeing here, I think it's important to say, is not an isolated incident. It could be argued, and we hear that people say, 'The majority of people are okay', and what we're learning is, actually, that that majority is getting smaller and smaller, and these kinds of experiences are getting more and more frequent. I'm sure Claire can add in her own experience, and others who I know have contacted Claire since she spoke so openly about her experience are testament to that. So, what we have here is a situation that is common, or becoming more common, I think, as time progresses, where we see people maybe not being taken as seriously as perhaps they should be, given that they know their own bodies. I think that's the challenge that we have here, given that we have such an almighty recovery from COVID\u2014to address those challenges, but, actually, to address the challenges that existed within the system before COVID started. So, we're really on the back foot here, and now these women are actually falling foul of the system, and we're seeing more and more of these experiences. So, yes, it's a real shame and an incredibly moving experience, but it's not an isolated incident.\" said by Lowri Griffiths\n\"Thank you, Lowri, and I echo your thanks to Judith, and we, as a committee, wish Judith well also. I just hope that through our work we can shine a light on bad practice and make recommendations to Government that will bring about change so that others don't have to go through the same experiences, or those chances are greatly reduced. At this point, I'll bring in Sarah Murphy, if that's all right. Sarah.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Thank you very much, Chair. Thank you, Judith, and thank you all for being here today. Just to follow on, then, I want to ask what action you think is needed to address the gender biases held by some healthcare professionals that female health complaints often relate to hormones or underlying mental health issues.&nbsp;\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Do you want to pick that one up?\" said by Lowri Griffiths\n\"I can start with that one. I think it's something we see often in ovarian cancer. So, quite often, when women visit their GP, it's an irritable bowel syndrome diagnosis, which shouldn't happen after the age of 50 without ovarian cancer being ruled out; menopause is another one. So, I think GP education is something we'll probably return a lot to in committee today, but that is just so important\u2014that GPs are educated and know that the symptoms that we're going to be talking about today are not just always menopause or IBS. Particularly for ovarian symptoms, they are abdominal symptoms, so you're talking about bloating and abdominal pain and recurrent urinary tract infections under this diagnosis; they don't present, necessarily, as something that would flag gynaecological, but that's where that education comes in.I think empowering women is really important, so empowering women to know that their GP should be listening to them, and if they're not happy with, particularly, their GP, but also, through the secondary care experience, if they're not happy with the treatment that they're getting or the support that they're getting, empowering them to ask more questions and trying to get that help. But it does rely, fundamentally, on healthcare professionals taking those symptoms seriously and taking experiences like Judith's as seriously as they can.\" said by Rachel Downing\n\"Absolutely. That follows on nicely, actually, to my follow-up question, which is: how, then, do we empower all women, including those who aren't able to advocate or used to advocating for themselves to ask for a second opinion if they aren't happy with the care they receive from their healthcare professionals?\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"I still think it's difficult. I've internalised a lot of what happened to me along the way, and I still now, at times, have to sit down and psyche myself up to make a phone call, send an e-mail to say I'm still not happy with what's happening. So, I think there has to be a culture change. I know, first off, lots of women struggle with the front line, the receptionists; the triage that happens can be very uncomfortable. I think you all hear from your constituents at some point or other that they're like, 'I can't have a friendly conversation; it's quite combative to try and get an appointment.'But then I think there should be a switch whereby medical professionals offer you the option of a second opinion. It should be kind of like, 'We're here to look after you, and, actually, I'm happy for you to see someone else', rather than you feeling like you're challenging someone's expertise, or challenging their professionalism, which is really difficult to do. You want to have good will, and you want to maintain a good relationship, because you're relying on this person to care for you, so to then say, 'I don't trust you and I want a second opinion,' is really difficult. So, I think it should be an onus on the medical professional to make that offer to you, and it should just be a part of the pathway, that it's second nature.\" said by Claire O'Shea\n\"Can I just add that information is really crucial here, I think? Who knows when they're first diagnosed with cancer what treatment should look like, what that experience with your GP should look like? We've found, increasingly, that patients aren't given written information or signposted to support organisations like have given evidence around the table today who can really support patients with that. I think if you don't know what 'good' looks like, it is very difficult to advocate for yourself.\" said by Rachel Downing\n\"That's true. Thank you.\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"There's quite a lot of research being looked into at the moment, international research, around that gender bias. We've had some evidence from Marie Curie, for example, around some of the pain thresholds that women experience and whether or not they're taken seriously. So, there is a lot more work that needs to be done in this particular area. I think, as well, the older generation, particularly, don't feel comfortable challenging. They accept everything that they're told. Not everybody, obviously, so people can advocate on their behalf, but even someone like Claire, who is a strong, independent, intelligent woman\u2014sorry, Claire, to embarrass you. For someone like Claire to even feel slightly intimidated by the system, then what does it feel like for somebody who doesn't feel that they have a voice? So, I think the onus is, as Claire said, on healthcare professionals to offer, 'Would you like to speak to someone else?', or to facilitate those conversations if they're asked.\" said by Lowri Griffiths\n\"Thank you very much. Thank you, Chair.\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Joyce Watson.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Just following on, is there room for advocates here for those who don't want to challenge, and maybe for those who don't want to be challenged? If there is room for advocates, what should that advocate look like? Who can do that?\" said by Joyce Watson AM\n\"Gosh, that's a good question. I'm trying to think. So, the third sector does advocate on behalf of patient cohorts, less so individuals, I suppose, and that's the challenge, isn't it? You can get very invested in an individual's case, so how do you make sure that that works for everybody then and that you change the system? So, I think, as well\u2014. You yourselves, I'm sure, as MSs get individual constituents coming up to you as well, so there's a route there. But I'm not quite sure what it would look like, I don't have that answer, but I think the important thing is: why do we need advocates in the first place? The system should be working for people, and I think that's the challenge. If the system works, then you don't have to really push and pull against the system. I think the system should be working effectively, and it's not one issue within one particular area, it's different things across different areas, and I think that's the challenge that we have, that you can't pinpoint one particular place where things tend to go wrong or that you can actually unpick. So, I don't quite know what the answer is, Joyce, to be honest with you, but I think there is a need to make sure that the system is easier to navigate.\" said by Lowri Griffiths\n\"Talking about the system and moving on, why do you think that some women with gynaecological cancer symptoms are misdiagnosed by their GP?\" said by Joyce Watson AM\n\"Shall I kick off, and then\u2014?\" said by Rachel Downing\n\"Yes. I've got a couple of things to say, so\u2014.\" said by Claire O'Shea\n\"Well, do you want to go first?\" said by Rachel Downing\n\"Okay, I'll go. I think my first conversation with my GP was that I had several different symptoms. They were hard to kind of pin down to one specific illness. There were things, like I was saying, 'I need to go to the toilet all the time; it's really difficult.' It was during COVID, so there were no public toilets, so, as a 38, 39-year-old woman, I was taking decisions about not going for long walks, because I didn't know how to manage that, and my GP just kind of said, 'Well, that's what happens to women when they get older.' And I was 39, which didn't feel old to me, so it's just those kinds of conversations where they kind of look to reason away your symptoms.But after that, the next conversation was, basically, 'You've probably got IBS. There's no diagnosis for IBS. We do it by a process of elimination. So, once we've ruled out other conditions, we'll basically tell you you have IBS.' But they didn't really rule anything out for me. There was one physical examination where there was a palpable lump, but they didn't pay attention to it; I don't understand.And the next part of that was they sent my blood away for tests, and then nobody actually got back to me to say what my blood tests said. I had to ring, like, a couple of months later, and say, 'Well, I'm still experiencing the symptoms. What did my blood tests say?' And they said, 'Oh, they didn't show up anything.' And it was like, 'Well, what's next for me then?' I had to kind of push that. So, it's ruling out cancer, rather than ruling in IBS, which is what it felt like.So, there is a lot on that kind of initial discussion and not having your symptoms kind of dismissed one by one, but looking at it in the round, and taking it seriously as a combination of things.\" said by Claire O'Shea\n\"Yes, I think there is a huge education challenge. So, 43 per cent of GPs, when we surveyed them across Wales, incorrectly believed that symptoms of ovarian cancer only present at the late stage. So, we know there's a big education issue, but also I think Claire's point there brings up a really important point around safety netting. So, what do GPs do when they have patients with symptoms, who are presenting with symptoms on more than one occasion, but have potentially unremarkable test results? And we know that's somewhere the GPs really want more support. So, if you have some weird symptoms, but there might not be anything that you can spot in blood tests or in scans that they've had, it's really important that GPs have the systems in place and the support potentially from secondary care to keep up with these patients and follow-up with them, and proactively follow-up with them. Because we hear time and time again, if you've been to see your GP and you have these symptoms, and you're told your test results are normal, it can feel very difficult\u2014and this comes back to the advocacy point, I guess, in the sort of round\u2014to then go back to a GP again and say, 'Well, I'm still having these symptoms', after you've been told the test results were unremarkable. So, I think we need to put a bit more onus on that proactive GP safety netting in primary care.\" said by Rachel Downing\n\"Isn't there also a danger that that's what people want to hear? You know, 'Oh, my test results are fine.' Something in the back of your head is telling you it's not fine, but you've got this piece of paper that tells you it is fine.\" said by Joyce Watson AM\n\"And I think that's why safety netting needs to be more than, 'Come back and see me in 12 weeks or eight weeks if your symptoms are still around', which is what, quite often, people are told. So, that's why it needs to be proactive from primary care: what can we do in primary care systems to flag-up patients that have these? And there are some ways and we've been looking at ways that we could automate some of that follow-up, other ways that can be taken up. We know that GPs are really busy, but is there space across the whole primary care sector to automate some of this, just to make sure that it happens, and it's not relying on patients who, as you say, might not want to follow up because they've been comforted by what they've been told?\" said by ", "answer": "Rachel Downing"}
{"content": "\"Good afternoon and welcome to this afternoon's Plenary meeting. As we begin this afternoon, we are all painfully aware of the sudden loss suffered by the First Minister over the weekend, and, on behalf of us all, I wish to extend our condolences to him and his family.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"It\u2019s little understood by people outside this Chamber, but often what pains one of us can pain all of us. In this case, what pains the First Minister has touched many people throughout Wales. When the news broke on Saturday, the first asking for her condolences to be passed on to the First Minister, messaging me,&nbsp;was a nurse in Bronglais.Mark and his family are in our hearts and prayers this afternoon. Many will have known Clare well. We will rise now to remember Clare, and in love and support for our First Minister and his family.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Diolch. The Trefnydd will be answering questions on behalf of the First Minister this afternoon, and I ask the Trefnydd to say a few words.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Diolch, Llywydd. Thank you all for that moment of reflection in memory of Clare Drakeford&nbsp;and in recognition of her life. I know the thoughts of everyone in the Senedd, and across Wales, are with our First Minister and his family at this very sad time, which I know he will greatly appreciate.&nbsp;\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"I thank the Trefnydd for that.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"The first question this afternoon is from Buffy Williams.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"1. What discussions has the First Minister had with the Minister for Social Justice regarding the violence against women, domestic abuse and sexual violence strategy since it was announced last year? OQ59068\" said by Buffy Williams MS\n\"Only united action from all sections of society can end abuse and ensure that everyone in Wales can truly live fear free. Our national VAWDASV strategy sets out our aims, and the Minister for Social Justice will continue to work closely with all Cabinet colleagues to ensure it is delivered.\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"Diolch, Trefnydd. The violence against women, domestic abuse and sexual violence strategy is, to me, one of the most important pieces of work the Welsh Government has announced this term, especially for my communities in Rhondda. Shockingly, the number of incidents of domestic violence and abuse reported to South Wales Police in Rhondda is, more often than not, double that of Cynon, Taf&nbsp;and Merthyr combined. We also know that these figures increase on the days of rugby internationals.&nbsp;With the start of the six nations, I'm campaigning, in February, with partners, to raise awareness of what local and national support is available to victims and perpetrators. I know that the support is available thanks to the strategy, but we need people to be accessing it.&nbsp;Trefnydd, since the strategy's announcement, what work has been done to ensure people know where and how they can access support? And are we still able to fund services fully during the current financial climate?\" said by Buffy Williams MS\n\"Well, as Buffy Williams has outlined, in Wales, we know that too many people still experience domestic abuse and sexual violence, and our strategy absolutely puts prevention at its core, shifting the focus from symptom to cause through a public health approach. Buffy Williams referred to our groundbreaking Act back in 2015, and that created duties on local authorities and health boards in Wales to publish and implement strategies for addressing these issues in our local communities, and that really ensures that tackling violence against women and girls is prioritised right across Wales.&nbsp;You mentioned the upcoming six nations campaign, and, through our Live Fear Free campaigns, that is a time that we do publicise those more. And we will continue to raise awareness of stalking, of harassment, of abuse and violence against women in all aspects of life, and that includes the street and other public places. And what these campaigns really do is provide practical advice for those who may be suffering abuse, but, as well as highlighting the support that's available to enable friends and family, and the wider community, to recognise abuse and take safe action, and signposting for people who perpetrate, who are themselves concerned about their behaviour.&nbsp;The Welsh Government does continue to fund regional advisers and specialist services, including the 24/7 Live Fear Free helpline. That supports victims of domestic abuse and sexual violence, and works tirelessly to ensure that no victim falls through the gaps of service provision, and especially those at higher risk. And we welcome long-term collaboration and partnership working between the services, and also the criminal justice services, really working together to deal with the complexities of the trauma that can be experienced.\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"Minister, in a written statement dated 19 January on women's safety in public places in Wales, the Minister for Social Justice referred to the Welsh Government's violence against women, domestic abuse and sexual violence national strategy. The Minister said that the strategy will be delivered through a collaborative'\"blueprint approach\" alongside a group of key partner organisations including the police and specialist sector.'One of these blueprint work streams is street harassment and safety in public places, providing a focus and expertise for an innovative approach to these issues. Currently in Newport\u2014an area that I represent in South Wales East\u2014every other LED light in the city gets turned off from midnight until 6 a.m. in the morning. However, Newport's Labour council is considering switching off all 19,000 lights, except at 'safety-critical sites', overnight, in a bid to cut costs. Furthermore, since late 2019, street lights across Caerphilly county borough have been switched off each night between midnight and 5.30 a.m. So, do you agree with me, Minister, that turning off street lights at night is in direct conflict with the aims of your Government's strategy to help women and girls feel safe on our streets? And will you take up this matter with the local authorities concerned, going forward? Thank you.\" said by Natasha Asghar MS\n\"Thank you. Well, I think we have to recognise the very difficult position that our local authorities are in, in trying to save money, even with the budgets that we've been able to give them from Welsh Government. But, as you say, the Minister for Social Justice did make a statement, following a request\u2014I think it was from Delyth Jewell\u2014in the business statement, because the Minister for Social Justice absolutely recognises that it's really important how women and children\u2014well, everybody\u2014feel safe, particularly on our streets. You mentioned the blueprint, and that works very closely not just with our partners here in Wales, but also non-devolved organisations. As part of that structure, the Minister for Social Justice chairs the national partnership board, with Dafydd Llywelyn, who's the lead police and crime commissioner here in Wales. It's something that I'm sure the board will look at, to see what support they can give local authorities, but, as I say, we do have to recognise the position of our local authorities from a financial position.\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"The scope of the strategy was extended to include workplace harassment, because, as it says, women's safety can only come from change in a culture that fails to tackle toxic masculinity. Unfortunately, we've seen numerous examples of that culture in various organisations in recent weeks. So, do you agree with me, Minister, that trade unions are key to holding workplaces to account, and making sure that bosses are doing everything they can to prevent sexual harassment? We need good men in the room and employers to look at systems and procedures that enable and facilitate safe challenges. And would you join with me in welcoming the work that Wales TUC has done with Welsh Women's Aid to develop a toolkit, which I'll be launching here in March, that will help union reps to carry out that work?\" said by Joyce Watson AM\n\"Thank you. And thank you to Joyce Watson for bringing the workplace sexual harassment toolkit to our attention today. I think it will be an extremely useful tool, once it has been launched, and it has been developed jointly with Welsh Women's Aid and Wales TUC. And it's very much in alignment with our aim to, obviously, ensure that workplaces are safe for employees, but also to ensure that employers have the tools that they need to deal with any breaches when they do happen. The Welsh Government has a long history of working with Welsh Women's Aid, and I think that this toolkit is another example of their passion and devotion to make sure that we do eradicate violence against women and girls. And I know that the Minister for Social Justice is very welcoming of the toolkit also.\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"2. What is the Welsh Government doing to aid post-pandemic economic renewal in Islwyn? OQ59069\" said by Rhianon Passmore AM\n\"Our economic mission sets out Welsh Government's economic priorities. We are strengthening the sectors across the Welsh economy by focusing on support for firms to innovate and diversify, speeding up business decarbonisation, and investing in climate-resilient infrastructure.\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"Diolch, Trefnydd. Thank you. A popular independent cafe, called Marmajo's, had premises on Pen-y-fan industrial estate in Crumlin until it very recently closed, and the owner, Charlie Allcock, reluctantly made a really hard decision, after watching her energy bills triple, to almost \u00a31,800 a month. Also, in Pontllanfraith, the Islwyn bowls club reopened following the pandemic restrictions, but the bar and function room have also remained closed as the local authority seeks someone to take it over, and the commercial side of the club needs to be secured in the future. And in Blackwood, HSBC have announced their intention to close their branch in July this year. So, in communities throughout Islwyn, the consequences of 13 long, cold years of Tory austerity and the pandemic, and now the Tory cost-of-living crisis, are removing or endangering the important fabric of community life. Trefnydd, the people of Islwyn are grateful for their Welsh Labour Government that seeks, within its devolved functions and within its strict financial envelope, to encourage economic activity. One such area of Welsh Government activity has been in the creative arts. Executives of Netflix last week told the Welsh Affairs Select Committee that their shows, such as&nbsp;<em>Sex Education</em>, which saw filming in Newbridge town centre and across Gwent, contributed \u00a3200 million to the Welsh economy over the last five years. What other imaginative avenues, Trefnydd, are open to the Welsh Government to seek to bring life and energy into Islwyn's economic life?\" said by Rhianon Passmore AM\n\"Thank you, and I'm very sorry to hear about the businesses and organisations in your constituency that have had to unfortunately close. As you know, here in Wales, we have Business Wales, and that's just about to celebrate its tenth anniversary, and they've provided a single integrated service to support businesses through these very difficult and uncertain economic times. That includes during the pandemic, as we left the European Union, and obviously the current cost-of-business crisis. Nearly 32,000 businesses were supported through the economic resilience fund during the pandemic, and direct support is available for businesses who continue to face uncertainties due to the cost-of-living crisis, the business crisis and, of course, the recession. There are many businesses in your constituency that have received support and, as you know, we've recently rolled out the business productivity enhancement programme. That's aimed at supporting SME manufacturing businesses also.\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"Business Minister, for people in Islwyn, since 2019, they have experienced a real-terms increase of just \u00a32.59 in their weekly earnings. Clearly, this isn't enough to keep pace with inflation, and the only way to combat this in Wales is by truly supporting our private sector and making Wales a more attractive place to invest in so they can employ more people on better wages. Clearly, this isn't happening at the moment, with Wales having seen the biggest fall in employment in the UK over the last years. Business Minister, how do you intent to curb this worrying trend?\" said by Laura Anne Jones AM\n\"I disagree with the Member profoundly that Wales isn't an attractive place to do business and to bring new businesses. I think you just need to look at our track record and also the work the Development Bank of Wales has done. I mentioned the business productivity enhancement programme that's recently been rolled out that's attracting new businesses. Again, the number of jobs that have been created just in the last two years in Rhianon Passmore's constituency totalled 621 jobs, with 220 new-start businesses, and has provided dedicated support to 1,102 businesses in Caerphilly.\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"Questions now from the party leaders. The leader of the Conservatives, Andrew R.T. Davies.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Thank you, Presiding Officer. Before I start, with your permission, Presiding Officer, I'd like to identify with the comments you and the Trefnydd put on the record in relation to the shattering news of the First Minister's loss of his wife over the weekend. Having met Clare on several occasions in my role as leader here and as an MS as well, I realise what a kind and compassionate individual she was and how dedicated they both were to each other. I hope very much that the sentiments that everyone is expressing is a form of comfort, and I use the word 'form' of comfort because nothing will ever make up for the loss of your partner in life. I extend the Welsh Conservatives' sympathies, prayers and best wishes to the family of the First Minister and to the First Minister himself.Trefnydd, in your previous role as building Minister and planning Minister, you'll be well aware of the issues around building safety here in Wales. There was much speculation and talk in the press on the weekend in relation to the remedial measures that have been put in place across the United Kingdom, but in particular here in Wales. Through the Building Safety Act 2022 that has passed in Westminster, there are measures to make sure that people who live in what are known as 'orphan buildings', which are buildings that have been built by companies that have been collapsed once the project has been finished, can be restored and the liabilities picked up by the companies. Will you, as a Government, pick up those measures and incorporate them into Welsh law here, so that residents who find themselves in similar buildings can have those protections? I notice that Mike Hedges was raising this very issue with you in business questions only two weeks ago.&nbsp;\" said by Andrew RT Davies AM\n\"Thank you. Well, as is the case in England, the Minister works very closely with developers, for instance, and I know, around the developers' pact, the Minister's been doing that. She's also kept Members updated, so I appreciate that you will already have that information as well. The Minister is obviously working closely with the UK Government to see what aspects of the legislation we can look at, and I'm sure that she will keep us updated.&nbsp;\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"Leader of the house, it has been some years now, obviously, since the Grenfell tragedy. The inquiry into the Grenfell tragedy has concluded its work, and we await its report. As I said, in the UK Parliament, the legislation has been passed to give comfort to residents who live in these orphan buildings\u2014there is one literally just up the road from here\u2014who find themselves in the horrendous situation of not knowing whether they will get the remediation works undertaken, and they are living in properties that are unsaleable now and in fear of their lives basically, because of the fire activities that could potentially go on in those buildings. I would hope that I could have achieved a more substantial answer from you, given the time lapse since the tragedy of the Grenfell fire, but I implore you and the Government to take those measures on board to give confidence to those residents that they will get restitution in place to fix the damages.But another thing that was spoken about by the UK Minister, Michael Gove, was that, where companies refuse to honour their commitments to remedy these buildings, they would put into law the ability to stop those companies being able to work, build future buildings, in those localities. Will the Welsh Government give urgent consideration to adopting such measures here, to strengthen your arm when you are negotiating with these companies, so that\u2014if they couldn't build in the past to a good standard, what confidence can we have that they will build in the future to a good standard? And we need that legislative change here to give the Minister the ability to go into those negotiations and stop these companies doing what they did previously.&nbsp;\" said by Andrew RT Davies AM\n\"So, in relation to the first part of your question around remediation, I know the Minister has been working very hard to make sure that there is a programme of work that can be outlined, so that people do get that confidence, because I can imagine nothing worse than owning a home and knowing of the potential disaster that could befall it. And I know the Minister also is working very closely, as I say, with the UK Government, and has been having discussions with Michael Gove around that protection, as you referred to it, with developers who do not consider the requirements that will be needed from them, when they build in the future. So, yes, the short answer to your question is 'yes'. &nbsp;\" said by ", "answer": "Lesley Griffiths AM"}

Can you tell us about the main challenges facing parents at risk of having their children removed, and what more can the system do to mitigate these risk factors that lead to children being removed from their birth parents?\" said by Buffy Williams MS\n\"Who'd like to make a start? Mark.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Yes, I'm happy to make a start. Within our Baby and Me service in Newport, which is formed through our Newport partnership, we find that so many parents that we support and are referred to us through health or social care have multiple, complex factors within their life, and those can include\u2014. For example, in Baby and Me, two thirds of the parents who are referred through to us have had identifiable childhood trauma, including adverse childhood experiences, which include sexual harassment, sexual assault, being a victim of domestic abuse when they were children. Nearly two thirds have had a previous child removed also, so where parents have been through recurrent care proceedings. Half report mental health issues, including self-harm, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety. Half report, also, domestic abuse, recognising that domestic abuse often goes underreported, so, actually, we would expect that to be even higher than that. This comes at a time also when there is a distinct lack of funding for specialist domestic abuse services as well, which is something that is cause for concern for us.We've found in Baby and Me that 40 per cent of the parents are care experienced themselves. What we find is, particularly with these parents, that they have intersecting needs, often relating to mental health, domestic abuse and sometimes substance misuse as well. For 40 per cent of these families, this is their first baby. A third have had significant housing issues, including living in night shelters, hostels, refuges, and we've even supported some families who are living on the street. A third of these are young parents as well, who are often particularly isolated and vulnerable. Going back to the care-experienced parents that we support, something that we offer is lifelong links for these parents. What that does is it helps to increase their support networks, it brings together\u2014. It could be extended family, community partners, to really try and help support that.In terms of what I think could help with supporting these families and improving outcomes for the parents and for the babies, it is absolutely partnership working. Baby and Me has been formed through the Newport strategic partnership with Barnardo's and the local authority, but I think what we find is, for the level of complexity and the level of risk that's being managed within these cases, we need our partners, such as NYAS, drug and alcohol agencies, mental health services, health, we need this collective expertise and specialisms and we need that health and social care integration, which is absolutely fundamental. That's why we've brought in a specialist midwife into Baby and Me, and that is there to really improve the links that we have with the health board and with the dedicated teams to make sure that we're getting those referrals in early. But it's also about, along that journey through that pregnancy and into the infancy of these babies, making sure that we're working together collaboratively.\" said by Mark Carter\n\"Buffy.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you. To what extent would you say that the odds are stacked against some of those parents during the pre-proceedings stage, when social services have set out initial concerns about a child\u2014for example, that there are significant barriers to them getting the right housing, mental health services and support from domestic violence?\" said by Buffy Williams MS\n\"Project Unity works with exclusively care-experienced parents. We have parents who are as young as 14 up to the age of 25 and we work across Wales. Unfortunately, one of the very clear things we're hearing from all of our parents is that, as care-experienced parents, they are very vulnerable to the fact that, immediately, their babies are placed on the child protection register. What we feel is that that is already stacked against them. So, the minute they discover that they are pregnant, in whichever local authority, the fact is that it flags up that they are care experienced and their child is perceived to be at risk.The parents themselves say\u2014. We recently did a survey of all of the parents that we work with, and 51 per cent of them said that social services brought up things that happened to them when they were children themselves as reasons for putting their own child on the child protection register. These are young parents who actually were brought into care for us to protect them, and what we're actually doing is bringing them into a situation where now their own babies are vulnerable to what they perceive to be 'the system'.The problem is that care-experienced young people face structural discrimination because of their age and because of their care status. What we actually feel is that the young parents actually need to have had work done with them prior to actually getting pregnant. Many of the young parents, when we talk about\u2014. I agree totally with what's been said by Barnardo's. In many of them, we have substance misuse, we have housing issues. But, I think what we need to be very clear about is care-experienced young people should have access to the corporate parent. What these young parents have not experienced is that support from the corporate parent insofar as housing, insofar as services on mental health and substance misuse. When they get to the point that the baby is placed on the child protection register, as part of their paediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome assessment, they\u2019re actually told that they will have to attend so many different types of support. What we\u2019re finding\u2014and, fortunately, Project Unity works across Wales and so I can clearly tell you what across the whole of Wales is happening\u2014is that the services are not available. And therefore, when you\u2019ve got to a situation where a parent is being judged on whether they can keep their baby, they\u2019re actually not receiving the services to enable them to get to the stage where they could be in a position to be very good parents. And what they\u2019re asking for is support from the services to change that.So, the whole ethos of how the service is run needs to change. I totally agree with Barnardo\u2019s, in that, actually, what we need to do is to be working very much closer together in order to provide those services that actually say to the parents\u2014. All of the parents say to us, \u2018We want to be good parents. We don\u2019t want our babies to be in a situation where they come into care\u2019. So, we\u2019re already blocking that happening because we\u2019re not providing that support that they need, and we haven\u2019t provided it when they were living in care. So, already they\u2019ve come from the care system with their own traumas, not all already dealt with, and now they\u2019re pregnant, and the baby\u2014. Unfortunately, in 100 per cent of the cases we\u2019ve dealt with since Project Unity started, all of those babies have been placed on the child protection register, and very much cited in that is the fact that the parent was care experienced and, therefore\u2014and it\u2019s often stated\u2014they may not be able to parent appropriately themselves.\" said by Helen Perry\n\"I\u2019ll just bring Jane Dodds in.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you very much. The question focused on pre-proceedings work. Would you like me to start again? The question focused on pre-proceedings work\u2014that\u2019s the work that starts before the public services go to court. That\u2019s the 12 weeks before court action proceeds. Now, I think what the committee\u2019s interested in is what happens during that period, and what isn\u2019t working at the moment? So, in your view, and from your experience, what could change in order to ensure that parents receive the support that they should have? The have a solicitor and a lawyer during that period, but what isn\u2019t working properly now, because they subsequently go on to court? Could you just give one example each? Do you have experience of pre-proceedings work when you are supporting parents? Who\u2019d like to go first? Mark, perhaps.\" said by Jane Dodds MS\n\"Yes, I can certainly give an example of where we\u2019ve worked with a family who\u2019ve been through pre-proceedings where there were significant concerns around, primarily, a domestic abusive relationship. It transpired that the mother was care experienced herself. She\u2019d also had two children removed previously. There were concerns around mental health, the state of her mental health, and also misusing heroin as well. What we were able to do within that, and I think what had been, perhaps, missing previously, was to identify early the fact that this mother was expecting another child. So, through our work with Baby and Me we were able to work with the midwife teams within the local hospital to make sure that those referrals were coming in early. We were then able to work with the local authority within which we were integrated to make sure that these cases were identified, where support might be needed. So, we were able to get the referral over to us by 14, 15 weeks into the pregnancy, which allowed us time to work with that family to help the family to identify the concerns that existed, to help to get a plan in place to address the needs that existed within that family\u2014\" said by Mark Carter\n\"I'm going to leap in if that's all right, because we haven't got much time. What isn't working? You mentioned parent assessment manual, PAMS, assessments; are they not available? What isn't working? That's what we're interested in, in order to make sure that in that 12 weeks, that parent has access to assessments, et cetera. I'm sorry to rush you but I know we've got lots\u2014. We've got to make sure we've got the right focus.&nbsp;\" said by Jane Dodds MS\n\"For me, it's about that early identification, and it's about that clear and consistent assessment that puts the parent at the heart of that to identify the needs of the parent that's there. And I think ensuring that there are adequate specialist services available and around the table. As NYAS rightly pointed out, those services don't exist.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Carter\n\"So there's a paucity of services. Helen, did you want to talk about PAMS?&nbsp;\" said by Jane Dodds MS\n\"Yes. I totally agree. What we're finding is the PAMS assessment is outdated, 100 per cent. The PAMS assessment needs looking at. There is another assessment in place that has been used by some of the local authorities. However, what we're finding is that people are not trained up in the new assessment. The new assessment is much better, from what I've been told. We actually sit in on the PAMS assessment, or our advocates sit in with them, and what the advocates tell us is that new assessment is working much better. So, the PAMS assessment needs changing; that definitely needs looking at.The second thing that is falling down is the fact that we don't have enough places for young parents to go within Wales to gain support. So, for instance, once a parent is pregnant and it's identified that they're going to need a parent assessment or a parent placement, we're sometimes having to move them outside Wales. First of all, that's not working because we're moving them away from their communities and away from any contact. While the assessment is going on previous to the baby being born, we're in a situation where\u2014I totally agree with Barnardo's\u2014the services are not available. On the mental health services, I have to say that a lot of young parents are afraid to say they need or require mental health services, because unfortunately that has gone against them in their PAMS assessment. So, even though we identify need for mental health services, what we're finding is that some of the young parents will not say that they need those services.What we also find is that drug and alcohol services are also very stretched, and therefore the support that the parents need. We actually\u2014and I can identify\u2014had one parent who did state that she wanted mental health support. When we required it from the NHS, we were told that she did not meet the threshold. And actually, what happened was that the only way we were able to co-ordinate and advocate support was to link her in with Mind Cymru. The problem we've got is that you've got a lot of parents out there that are going through the PAMS assessment that haven't got access to an advocate or to support. What we find is that the parents do not understand the PAMS assessment, the information from the court, the information from the solicitors. It's very difficult to understand, and unless you've got someone sitting by the side of you\u2014. We need to change the language. &nbsp; &nbsp;\" said by Helen Perry\n\"Just to quickly add, an active offer of advocacy as well, I think, is imperative.&nbsp;\" said by Daljit Kaur Morris\n\"Thank you. Sorry, but we're going to have keep everything as brief as we can. A question from James Evans now.&nbsp;\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"I've got one question. I had some questions on the previous point but I think we need to move on in the interest of time. We've been told by birth parents aged 18 and under that as soon as they have their child, even if they're on a care order, the local authority seems to wash their hands of them and they move on to the safeguarding issue of that child. So, do you think the dual role of social services actually works in practice, and do you have any good practice across Wales where local authorities are doing this well and how this can be improved? Because this is an issue that's been brought up time and time again in front of us.\" said by James Evans MS\n\"Unfortunately, we haven't identified any real good practice. The only place where there is good practice is in Newport with Baby and Me, where you already have the service that is linked to the local authority, but is run by the charity, where you have that link with the local authority. Everywhere else in Wales, there is a definite issue. What we find is that\u2014I totally agree with you, James\u2014when a young parent who is already subject to a care order themselves becomes pregnant, suddenly the baby becomes the priority, and the young parent disappears, and they will clearly tell us that.\" said by Helen Perry\n\"Are there any other comments on that? If not, it's fine. I'm done. Thank you.\" said by James Evans MS\n\"Thank you. That's great. Questions now from Sioned Williams.&nbsp;\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you. I'll be speaking in Welsh. We have heard very powerful evidence, really, from birth parents regarding how they value parental advocacy, and you touched on how that can help them to go through these complex and difficult processes. So, what does the data tell us about what the impact is of having advocacy on family court outcomes? You mentioned the active offer; should all parents have a legal right to advocacy once an order has been made to the family court for the first child, rather than once a child has been permanently removed? To what extent would this level of provision be realistic, in your view?\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"Helen, did you want to start, or Daljit?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you for that question, because something that NYAS would really welcome is having that active offer, especially parent advocacy roll-out. We know that it's part of the Government agenda as well. I think that it's imperative for parents to have that offer, because it supports them when they're most in need. Early intervention is key, so to have it right from the onset, and to support and to show them clarity of support, and also to ensure that the balance of power is addressed when it comes to family rights as well. That's integral for the work that we want to do. We want to see support available for both sets of parents there, across Wales.\" said by Daljit Kaur Morris\n\"So, just to be clear\u2014a legal right to advocacy.\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"Yes, a legal right.\" said by Daljit Kaur Morris\n\"Can I pick up on something that you said? You said to have it prior to the baby being adopted. This needs to be early intervention advocacy\u2014even prior to getting to court. This needs to be at the point where the baby is considered to be looking to be on the child protection register, prior to the PAMS assessment.\" said by Helen Perry\n\"Anybody else?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"I would just echo that independent advocacy is absolutely fundamental to positive outcomes. We have found, over many, many years, that\u2014. The point that Helen from NYAS made particularly was about how parents often do not understand the process they are going through. Actually I've got quotes here\u2014I won't read them\u2014outlining that parents find the whole process traumatising and scary, and it fills them with fear. So, I think that we need to do more to overcome that and to support parents far better, and to let parents understand the situation that they're going through better, but also to feel heard and to have their voice really maximised.\" said by ", "answer": "Mark Carter"}
{"content": "\"Good afternoon, and welcome to this Plenary meeting. The first item this afternoon is the questions to the Minister for Economy. The first question is to be answered by the Deputy Minister for Arts and Sport, and is to be asked by Altaf Hussain.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"1. What steps is the Welsh Government taking to attract inward visitors to South Wales West? OQ59396\" said by Altaf Hussain MS\n\"Can I thank Altaf Hussain for that question? Visit Wales ensures that web, social media, public relations and travel trade activities provide opportunities for all parts of Wales to be promoted. Destinations and products in the South Wales West region are regularly highlighted to prospective visitors.\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"Thank you for that reply, Deputy Minister. Tourism is a vital sector of the economy in my region, and who would not want to visit? We have some of the best beaches in the world. However, all that is under threat due to policy decisions taken by your Government. Changes to the occupancy rule for holiday lets and the impending tourism tax are forcing many property owners to leave the market and sell up. Deputy Minister, how can we attract inward visitors if there is nowhere for them to stay? Will you now reconsider these policies given the weight of the evidence from the sector and the threat it poses to tourism in my region and across Wales? Thank you.\" said by Altaf Hussain MS\n\"Thank you for that supplementary question. And I have to start by saying, Altaf, that I don't accept the premise of the comments or the question that you raise. This very question was actually asked to the First Minister yesterday, and you can all ask the question as many times as you like and you're going to get the same answers every single time. The regulations on second homes and self-catering changes were debated on the floor of the Senedd to annul those regulations, and the will of the Senedd was that we should continue with those regulations. And I would remind you that the charges on self-catering accommodation were actually part of the Labour manifesto. We won that election in 2021, and we are now implementing the manifesto pledges that we had.But I think it's also worth saying and just repeating why it is we're making these changes. It is to ensure that self-catering properties are being used for business purposes for the majority of the year and are making a substantive contribution to the local economy. So, under the new criteria, properties are available to be let for at least 252 days of the year, but must be let for 182 days of the year. And we're very, very clear: the Welsh Government's view is that properties let out as self-catering accommodation on an infrequent basis should be liable for council tax. But if they are a genuine business, being let for 182 days or more, then they will be treated as a small business and will pay the relevant small business rates. What level the rates are set at in terms of any accommodation not meeting the 182 days, of course, is a matter for the local authority to determine.\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"South Wales West not only has the beaches that Altaf has talked about, but it's also got the beautiful valleys as well. So, in the South Wales West region, Minister, Bridgend council has recommitted to its leadership on the valleys park initiative, and we also have the Wildfox proposal for an adventure resort at the head of Dave Rees's valley and my valley\u2014the top of the Llynfi and Afan valleys there, up next to Croeserw\u2014looking to build on our natural advantage of those spectacular hills and valleys for walking, mountain biking, adventure as well. So, what additional support can Welsh Government give to those who want to develop the valleys as a destination for great adventure, outdoor fun and activity?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Well, can I say I absolutely agree with all the comments that the Member from Ogmore has made? And I spent many happy years living in Ogmore, of course, when the Member was my own MP and Member of the Senedd at the time. So, I absolutely agree that there are a number of areas in Wales, including your constituency, Huw, where we can all work alongside that wonderful natural environment, can't we, and we see many excellent examples in our valleys areas\u2014BikePark Wales in my own constituency, of course, and Skyline that we're looking to develop in Swansea. And my team are always willing to discuss any good development or investment opportunities with local authorities or leads of prospective projects. We've got the Brilliant Basics fund, of course, and we have the strategic capital investment fund via the Wales tourism investment fund, which is available, and that we can support through our marketing and promotion activities.You'll be pleased to know, of course, that the south-east Wales tourism forum has representatives from your local authority, from Bridgend, and it also has local operators such as Hugh Murray, who's the owner of the Porthcawl Surf School, and he's attended in the past, as have other tourism operators in the area. So, what I'm saying to you is that we have plenty of potential support for the right schemes, and look forward to continuing to support Bridgend, Ogmore as a whole, and many other varied tourism opportunities in your constituency.&nbsp;\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"2. What is the Welsh Government doing to grow the skills of young people? OQ59411\" said by James Evans MS\n\"We are making strong progress in delivering our young person's guarantee, with over 12,000 young people starting on employability and skills programmes alone since the launch of the young person's guarantee in November 2021.&nbsp;\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"I'd like to thank the Minister for that answer. Minister, the UK Government signed a new trade deal with New Zealand, and part of that was extending the working holiday visa up to 35. I firmly believe that growing the skills of young people is giving them the opportunities to go abroad to learn new skills and bring new experiences back home to improve their job opportunities back here in the UK. So, what is the Welsh Government doing to promote the opportunities that that trade deal has given to young people in Wales to go and work abroad so they can grow the skills base here in Wales?\" said by James Evans MS\n\"Well, of course, the trade deal with New Zealand, as indeed the other trade deals, contains a range of areas. And we have always taken a balanced view on the fact that there is potential for more trade and economic activity. There is potential for people to go and work and learn in other countries, and we would like to see those people return and enhance the economy here in Wales. It's of course part of the reason why the Welsh Government has funded the Taith programme, to make sure that young people have the opportunity to study in other countries after the UK Government brought our participation in Erasmus&nbsp;to an end.&nbsp;But those trade deals are balanced, and there are challenges in other areas of them. It's an ongoing area of conversation between me, my officials and the UK Government, and I'll continue to report back transparently to both the relevant scrutiny committee and, indeed, to the Senedd.\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"Minister, yesterday I hosted an event with Airbus and colleagues from the trade union movement, as well as the French ambassador, who I was delighted to welcome to our Senedd. The event itself was entitled 'Flightpath to Decarbonising Aerospace', and speakers at the event updated Members and other guests on the work being done in developing carbon-neutral aviation fuels, and, of course, the state of the art Wing of Tomorrow project in Broughton. Minister, do you agree with me that Wales needs to continue to lead on this type of new technology, and that the more we invest in upskilling young people, like those future generations watching in the gallery today, the more we can seize the opportunity in front of us?\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Yes, I do. And, in fact, we were talking much about the future of the economy in Wales when I was in Brussels yesterday, which was, unfortunately, why I wasn't at the event with Airbus. But I have good links with the company and, indeed, with the recognised trade union at Airbus, but more broadly across the wider manufacturing sector. And as we set out a renewed and refreshed plan for the manufacturing sector, alongside the action we're taking on our net-zero skills plan, we will continue to want to invest in the skills of young people, and the opportunity for them to grow and develop here in Wales.On the one hand, there are opportunities to work in other parts of the world. We want people, though, to be really confident about having a successful and fulfilling future here in Wales. It's why we're looking for clarity, not competition, when it comes to skills policy. We've seen different policy initiatives from the UK Government. We would like to see continued investment in real terms to increase the skills of young people for the future\u2014that's exactly what we're committed to\u2014and in the areas you mentioned specifically, the Wing of Tomorrow, in not just the materials used, but the manufacturing process itself. And when it comes to the new fuels that will allow us to carry on flying in a more sustainable way in the future, there are an awful lot of research, development and innovation opportunities. So, you can see the advanced manufacturing plan, the green skills plan and our innovation strategy all gearing up together with the young person's guarantee and a range of other programmes. And we've got to have a coherent plan, where we'll have partners to do that with\u2014both the trade union movement and businesses\u2014and I would like to see a more coherent partnership with the UK Government than the one we have at present.&nbsp;\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"Questions now from the party spokespeople. The Conservative spokesperson, Paul Davies.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Diolch, Llywydd. Minister, you will be aware of Cardiff Council's meeting tomorrow to discuss the possibility of introducing a congestion charge to tackle traffic levels in Cardiff. Whilst this is primarily a matter for the local authority, there could be important economic consequences should these plans go ahead, and so, as the Minister for Economy, can you tell us what your assessment is of the economic impact of these plans on our capital city and can you confirm the Welsh Government's position on this matter?&nbsp;\" said by Paul Davies AM\n\"Well, it isn't possible to deliver an economic assessment of the plans because there isn't a fully formed proposal to assess, and, as well as the impact on the economy, you need to consider the environmental, the societal and, indeed, the public health benefits. When Cardiff Council announced they were considering a range of proposals, it wasn't just about the potential for road user charging; it was also about their plan to invest in the future of public transport, and the council were very clear that they want to deliver public transport improvements before any element of charging may be introduced. And I am sure you will also have heard the public health director from Cardiff and Vale University Health Board talking about the potential public health benefits. Now, that's big news for me as a constituency Member. Obviously, I represent part of the city of Cardiff, and there are significant air pollution challenges. And I want to see my constituents and other constituents across Wales have opportunities to live in an environment where the way that we move around does not compromise their health and opportunity to succeed economically. I look forward to seeing a fully formed proposal. And I welcome the fact that the council are actually having this conversation, and I want to be gauging the evidence rather than misleading or less than truthful slogans that some people have indulged in.\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"Well, clearly, Minister, you don't know what the economic consequences of these plans are going to be, and I'm sure the people of Cardiff will have heard what you have to say on the matter and will draw their own conclusions.Now, it was recently reported that the number of firms collapsing into insolvency across England and Wales jumped last month to 16 per cent, as companies continue to struggle with soaring costs and weak consumer spending. So, it's vital that governments at all levels are working to support our town and city centres and help our businesses during this time. Now, you'll be aware of the 2021 Audit Wales report, which made six recommendations to help the Welsh Government and local authorities better manage and support town and city centres across Wales, and so can you tell us how many of the recommendations have been delivered and what further work will be done in this financial year to nurture and develop town&nbsp;and city centres in Wales?&nbsp;\" said by Paul Davies AM\n\"Okay. So, I can't give you a direct response to all six of those areas. I'd be more than happy to write to the Member to set that out in more detail\u2014the detail I think he'll want to see. We continue with our investing in towns programme\u2014our Transforming Towns programme. That's working alongside local authorities' programmes that they themselves are developing and leading and managing, and we'll continue to have a properly grown-up partnership on that.I should just make the point, when it comes to his first question and the comments he then made, when road user charging has been introduced in other cities in the UK and around the world, we have not seen the economy come to a halt. We have seen changes in people's behaviour and, actually, I think there is a really vibrant future for Cardiff city centre, and you can see that in the way that a number of professional services companies look at their future in and around the city. I'm expecting positive news over the next year or so on more growth and development in that area, and these policies don't put off those people from wanting to invest in the future of jobs and really good-quality jobs. I think, as I say, a dose of reality and evidence would be helpful when it comes to the future of thriving cities and, indeed, towns right across the country.\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"Well, I look forward to your letter regarding the Audit Wales report recommendations, which will tell us whether these recommendations have actually been delivered or not by your Government.Now, 12 months ago, the Federation of Small Businesses published its vision for Welsh towns, which looked at some of the challenges that our town centres have faced in recent years, and set out what they believe is needed to build a successful future for Welsh town centres and high streets. That report told us that only 3 per cent of people believe their town centre to be thriving, and that really should be a wake-up call for the Government to prioritise building resilient town centres, helping businesses to grow and recycling the Welsh pound in our communities. The scale is huge and the challenges include everything from changing consumer habits to cost pressures for businesses, to public transport, which you've just been talking about. Therefore, can you tell us what additional funding is being allocated to support businesses in town centres across Wales in light of some of the challenges that they are continuing to face? And can you also provide an update on the discussions you've had with local authorities about the measures they are taking in order to ensure that local interventions do not harm the ambition to create sustainable town centres for the future?\" said by Paul Davies AM\n\"Yes. Look, as ever, we work alongside local authorities and other partners when it comes to the future for town centres. But it's also a range of policy areas across the Government\u2014so, taking a 'town centre first' approach to the way that we develop. So, that includes when we're making choices around investing in housing and in the health service; when we're thinking about regeneration approaches as well. You can see that we are working directly alongside local authorities to do just that. I've visited Rhyl and Prestatyn in the past, for example, to see some of that work directly and that is all about how you do create a vibrant high street. A number of the challenges they face come from a number of different factors. The cost-of-living crisis is also a cost-of-doing business crisis\u2014the challenges of inflation when you look at some of the challenges around retail, and you mentioned that there are trends in the way that people are now behaving as consumers.So, when we developed our retail action plan, when we were going into the delivery phase, that was working alongside trade unions led by the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers; that was working alongside businesses led by the Wales Retail Consortia. And it is understanding all the different things we can do to have a positive future for retail, and it's part of what makes a vibrant and effective high street.I look back on other choices we've already made. For example, I know that other Members will have been today at events with pharmacy colleagues and Marie Curie and, actually, the choice that we have made consistently to invest in community pharmacy is hugely important for generating footfall on a range of our high streets in towns of all shapes and sizes. It goes into the everyday economy as well that Hefin David has regularly talked about, to make sure that procurement policy and the way that we work alongside small and medium-sized businesses actually have a direct impact, so that it isn't simply about where the budget lines are, it's also about the coherence of policy and understanding what we can all do to support our local town centres, not just on small business weekend, but through the year, and the policy choices we make in Government.&nbsp;\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"Plaid Cymru spokesperson, Luke Fletcher.\" said by ", "answer": "Y Llywydd / The Llywydd"}
{"content": "\"Just to remind Members, our session this morning will focus on north Wales, and it will cover the full session. Can I welcome the First Minister to the meeting this morning? First Minister, do you want to introduce your officials for the record?\" said by David Rees AM\n\"Good morning, Chair. Thank you very much. Joining me this morning, we have Elin Gwynedd, deputy director of north Wales\u2014a new post to support Lesley Griffiths\u2014and I'm also joined by Christopher Warner, deputy director of transport strategy and policy.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Thank you. Before we go into the question session, we have a two-hour session, and we might have a five-minute break, a comfort break, if people require it, halfway through.&nbsp;Okay. Let's go straight into questions, if that's okay. I'll start the first question, First Minister, and I suppose it's inevitable, as we're in north Wales, that we will want to question on the health service here. We all know that Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board is in special measures. It was first put into special measures, I understand, in 2015, when you were health Minister. Your successor took it out of special measures. His successor has put it back into special measures. How confident, therefore, is the Welsh Government that we will now see a turnaround? Because we've seen this yo-yoing of in and out of special measures.\" said by David Rees AM\n\"Well, I think we have to be optimistic about the capacity of the board to put right the things that need to be attended to. I think, in many ways, there is an obligation on leaders, whether they are health service leaders or political leaders, to offer hope to people in north Wales that the health service they provide can be put on a stable and reliable footing, and I think there is good cause for optimism. Here is a board that employs over 19,000 people, that serves a population of over 700,000 people. I think we're right to be optimistic that there is the talent, the commitment, the capacity to be found in north Wales to be able to manage the health services in ways that don't see that pattern of recent years, of recovery followed by a falling back into circumstances where special measures are needed. I think we're very fortunate to have secured the services of a new chair and a new chief executive who will now be committed to remaining in north Wales right through to the end of this financial year. I think they are already making a difference, not only in the actions they themselves are taking, but in the confidence they are giving to others that there is a pathway for the health board, as I say, to that more stable future, where it goes on providing the absolutely essential services that it does, in very successful ways in so many instances, every day in north Wales.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Okay. Thank you. Mark.\" said by David Rees AM\n\"Diolch. Morning. Bore da. And obviously, in my case, and certain colleagues here, we need them to succeed, because we're patients and our families are patients. There's good with the bad, and I experience the good regularly. But, nonetheless, as Chair of the Public Accounts and Public Administration Committee, we've had a session I can't talk about this week with them to discuss the Ernst &amp; Young report. We had a previous session in relation to our inquiry into public appointments with representatives of the former board members who were required to resign. They told us a number of things, which is all on the record, two of which I'll refer to: one was that they commissioned the Ernst &amp; Young report, and that has since been corroborated, and, secondly, that they had kept in close touch with the Welsh Government and Welsh Government officials, that, last autumn, they had made specific, or expressed specific, concerns to Welsh Government regarding not the whole executive, but an element of the executive, and gave evidenced reasons for that, and that they'd received feedback that they shouldn't take any further action without Welsh Government giving them the green light. And then, to their surprise and concern, they were required to go, when the concern had been raised regarding the executive.So that's ancient history; we've rehearsed it in the Chamber many times over what should or should not have been done and what different views were on this. But what consideration could you and your Ministers give to perhaps engaging with those former independent members, who are, and remain, respected people in north Wales, who have all held, or hold, senior positions in north Wales, and conducted themselves well in those positions, to obtain first-hand advice on the problems that they encountered and that they were taking action to deal with?\" said by Mark Isherwood AM\n\"Well, Chair, let me try and put it like this: I agree with Mr Isherwood that we have extensively discussed the circumstances that led us to where we are today. I want to repeat what I have said a number of times in my correspondence with the former chair of the board, that nothing in the way in which actions were taken should be regarded as a reflection\u2014an adverse reflection\u2014on the many years of dedicated and successful public service that he and other members of the board have given. Matters ended in the way that they did for a complex set of reasons involving not simply non-executives, or, separately, executives, but often in the interaction between them, and the conclusion that those relationships had broken down to a point where it would've been impossible to repair them in a way that would have allowed the board to discharge its responsibilities effectively.But I'm very keen to say again today that, in that complex set of affairs, I want to go on putting on record&nbsp;my appreciation of the service of those independent members. I think it is possible to capture their views. I have been in regular correspondence with the outgoing chair of the board, and he has set out in detail for me his understanding of, interpretation of, events, and I know that other former non-executive members have done the same. So, I don't think we're without the benefit of their views, and I'm very grateful to them for the trouble they continue to take in making sure that their experience is made available to us. In the end, we then have to take into account those views alongside a plethora of others, but we're not without the benefit of their experience.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Llyr, do you want a supplementary?&nbsp;\" said by David Rees AM\n\"Just a short question, really: do you regret the way that their departure was handled by the health Minister?&nbsp;\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"I regret the circumstances that made that necessary. In those circumstances, I think the health Minister responded in the best way that she could and with proper regard for the impact that her actions would have on all of those who were affected by them.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Mark.&nbsp;\" said by David Rees AM\n\"I'll conclude because I know time is short, but the evidence we received was that the independent board members had good relationships with many of the members of the employed executive. Their concerns related\u2014I won't name anybody\u2014to an element within that that was causing the relationship breakdown. And I know you can't go into details of human resource arrangements currently, or processes currently ongoing, but nonetheless it was made clear to us in evidence and in subsequent written correspondence and evidence received from them that the breakdown didn't lie with them or with the executive as a whole, but with a certain clique. We struggle to understand why the independent members\u2014without, according to them, any forewarning\u2014were required to take the fall.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Isherwood AM\n\"Well, Chair, what I have learnt is that there are many different perspectives amongst people around that single table as to why the board had become dysfunctional. And I hear and respect the views of the people who Mr Isherwood is reflecting, but it's just important to acknowledge, for me, that there are alternative views as to how circumstances had reached the point that they had. And in some ways, whatever the history and wherever different responsibilities lie, the information that the Minister had was, I think, irrefutable. She had independent advice from more than one source that the board was no longer able to discharge its responsibilities effectively, that there was no path to repairing the damage that had taken place in those relationships, and that the only course of action available to her was to set aside the board as it was then constituted and offer a fresh start with new people to shape the future for the board that we want to see. That is a very sad set of circumstances, and I'm absolutely sure that hurt has been caused to people who are caught up in them, but I don't think the Minister had any alternative, faced with the independent advice that she had that circumstances could not be allowed to continue as they were, and that a line had to be drawn and new people asked to take on those responsibilities.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Jenny.&nbsp;\" said by David Rees AM\n\"I wanted to move us on to the role of the board in improving performance, because I think, in all this conversation, a lot of the good work that Betsi Cadwaladr does gets lost. For example, the cross-party group on women's health heard about the sector-leading approach to bereavement services for parents of stillborn and neonatal deaths, a service I don't think exists yet in other health boards. But I think, obviously, one of the biggest challenges for the board is improving on the performance of waiting times in the emergency department and waiting times for treatment. What we\u2019ve learnt from Cardiff is that you\u2019ve got to have a whole-system approach to your hospitals, so that only those who need to come into hospital come into hospital, and once they\u2019re medically fit to leave, there\u2019s already a plan in place for where the next destination is. So, I wondered what your assessment is of how well the three hospitals have a whole-system approach, and it\u2019s everybody\u2019s business, not just the emergency department.&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Well, thanks to Jenny for that very important question. The special measures framework that has been agreed with the board, following the actions of the Minister, does set out a series of things that the board will now undertake in order to address some of the underlying problems that the board was experiencing, and of course, timely care in emergency and in elective care is fundamental to the framework.Chair, I hope that one theme from this part of this morning will be a continued recognition that, while the challenges are very real, and the areas of difficulty absolutely must be addressed, there is, as Mr Isherwood said and as you have said, an enormous amount of very successful work that goes on every day, and that is true in elective work, certainly. We have seen nearly a 50 per cent drop in over-52-week waits for out-patient appointments in this calendar year, since December. Cancer waits in Betsi are amongst the very best in Wales, and always have been. So there\u2019s a lot to build from.The board has been to Cardiff recently to look at the way in which Cardiff has reduced waits for emergency care, and there is lots to learn from that whole-hospital approach. One of the things that always frustrated me when I was the health Minister was the way in which some hospitals have a disconnect between the pressures at the front door and everything else that the hospital does. The problems at the front door belong to everybody, not just the emergency department, and that\u2019s the lesson that Cardiff has learnt. But I think there are lessons to learn between hospitals in north Wales as well. The performance in some parts of north Wales is better than others, and there should be a learning culture in which the board enables people to look at the good practice that already exists within the board, and then to make sure that the same things happen elsewhere.So, I met the chief executive, the acting chief executive, and the new chair, last night, and heard directly from them about the way in which they want some of the lessons that they are seeing happening and making a difference in some parts of north Wales, but which are not yet as apparent in others of the three hospitals. So, there\u2019s a job of work to be done in learning from others, but there\u2019s a job of work to be done in learning from one another as well in that whole-system way. The response to these challenges doesn\u2019t lie with individual strands within the service. If you\u2019re going to tackle them, the whole system has to be behind the efforts that are needed.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"My second question is: how well is social care working with healthcare? Because certainly friends of mine in north Wales are receiving excellent social care, with lots of continuity of care for people who have very high needs, but how well is social care working with hospitals to ensure that the day the patient arrives in hospital is also the day we start plotting their discharge?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Well, social care is under pressure in north Wales as it is absolutely everywhere. North Wales has a unique challenge in being a net importer of people later on in life. It continues to be somewhere where people from outside Wales regard as attractive to come and retire, so it has to deal with people who've grown up in north Wales and become elderly, and it has to find ways of providing services for people who come to live in this part of Wales later on in life. The same challenges that exist everywhere, of recruitment and retention in the sector, are as apparent here as they would be anywhere.I was encouraged by what Dyfed Edwards, the new chair, said yesterday\u2014and of course, he is very well placed, as a former council leader in north Wales for a decade, and a very highly respected council leader\u2014on what he reported as being very strong links between the health board and the six social services departments. There's a real commitment from council leaders to play their part, and an offer, for example, to second into the board, for one day a week, a director of social services from each of the six local authorities, so that you have\u2014. You know how difficult it can be to see the world from the other end of the telescope. Well, one way of doing that is to get people from the social care world to come and spend time inside the board as well, to see the issue from that perspective. But I think that there is, from what I was told, a very genuine commitment to making sure that social care plays its part, and some new practical actions to make sure that those systems work in support of one another, so that nobody stays in hospital longer than they need to, and of course that nobody comes into hospital in the first place when they could be equally successfully looked after at home.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Could I say\u2014? Sorry, just to add to that, the leaders in north Wales are very keen to say how well they work together. They meet regularly. There's a cross-sector leadership group that meets regularly. The chief execs meet regularly. They really welcome Carol to the meetings. But social care is one of the things on top of their list to discuss, and they have already discussed it and intend to discuss it further. But they really wanted to stress how well they work across the whole six local authorities together.&nbsp;\" said by Elin Gwynedd\n\"Sam.\" said by David Rees AM\n\"Thanks, Chairman, and thank you, First Minister, for being in north Wales. It's always appreciated. As you will know, I have only been in the Senedd for two years. There are much more experienced heads around this table. But one of the things that struck me in this context, talking about Betsi and, perhaps, health services generally, is this mixing between responsibility and accountability\u2014who is responsible for things and who is then accountable for things? I just wondered, within the context of Betsi, how you would see responsibility and accountability and the delivery of those two areas.\" said by Sam Rowlands MS\n\"Well, I think that it's a good question, Chair, and I think that it is, in some ways, a more difficult question in a small country. I think, actually, that on paper, it's not difficult to be clear about that. We have powerful boards with delegated responsibilities for the services that they provide. They have very large budgets in doing so, and publicly appointed chairs and boards. They are both responsible and they are accountable. And then they are accountable as well to the Minister, and the Minister's responsibilities are to ensure that funding is provided for boards, and that boards are held to account for the way in which they implement the key policy decisions that are made by the Senedd.I genuinely believe that Ministers get asked questions on the floor of the Senedd that an English Minister would never be asked, because nobody would expect an English Minister to have a day in, day out understanding of what goes on at a ward level in hospitals in a country as large as England. But on paper, the responsibilities are the same. It's just that in a small country, the Minister is often asked questions about things that really belong at that board, at the health board and with the people who are responsible at that level.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"So, just to follow up on that, Chairman, if I may. I guess that part of the criticisms that took place with regard to the actions of Betsi earlier this year was residents coming to me, feeling as though the Government, or the Minister, wasn't willing to be accountable for the delivery of some of those services and the outcomes for patients. So, I wonder if you would consider that to be a fair criticism, of not being willing to be held to account for outcomes for patients, and if it is not a fair criticism, how will you reassure my residents that, as elected Members and as Government, you are willing to be held to account for the outcomes that my residents want to see, day in, day out?\" said by ", "answer": "Sam Rowlands MS"}

Good morning and welcome back to the Public Accounts and Public Administration Committee, meeting this morning remotely. I welcome our guests who'll be giving evidence to committee. I'd be grateful if you could state your names and roles for the record, perhaps starting with Mr Prentice.\" said by Mark Isherwood AM\n\"Hello. My name's Phil Prentice, I'm the chief officer of Scotland's Towns Partnership and the national programme director for Scotland's Improvement Districts.\" said by Phil Prentice\n\"Thank you very much. And, Mr Roe.\" said by Mark Isherwood AM\n\"Good morning, everyone. My name's Richard Roe, I am the corporate director for place at Trafford Council.\" said by Richard Roe\n\"Thank you very much indeed. Actually, you're not very far from where I'm sitting at the moment, ironically, albeit across that incredible border.As you'd expect, we have a number of questions, and I would ask both Members and witnesses to be as succinct as possible so that we can cover as wide a range of issues as possible generated by this topic. I will start with the questions to the witnesses. I'll start by asking you to what extent you believe that local authorities in your own jurisdictions are able to effectively create local coalitions of change and bring together all the key players to help regenerate and improve towns. I don't know which of you would like to go first.\" said by Mark Isherwood AM\n\"I'm happy to go first, Mark. I think it's a mixed picture across the country. Some local authorities are very good at this, others less so. So, there genuinely isn't consistency across the piece. But, I would say that, where we see success, it's where local government works very positively with its community and business partnerships and there's trust and an understanding of roles and remits. No one sector is going to be able to fix this problem on its own, and I think there has to be a growing recognition that we do need much more collaboration, but it is a mixed picture.\" said by Phil Prentice\n\"Thank you. Would Richard Roe like to comment?\" said by Mark Isherwood AM\n\"Yes. I agree with Phil. I think I would say it's a mixed picture. But, if it's going to work, if you're going to successfully regenerate town centres, then it needs the local authority to lead. We are the key player in that role, but the local authority can't do it on its own. So, you do need a coalition with business, with community, with other public sector partners. That's certainly our experience. I think the private sector wants the local authority to step into that space, they want the local authority to take the lead, they want the local authority to create the right environment for investment, and then they will follow. I think the community is the same. I think that has to be the approach. I think, as Phil said, the appetite in different local authorities may not be there.\" said by Richard Roe\n\"Thank you. In the evidence we've received thus far, we've seen local authorities taking the leadership in some towns, but we've also seen town councils, for example, different tiers of local government, taking the lead in other areas, which goes back to the words you referred to in terms of working together and collaboration and partnership. To what extent, from your experience, have you seen local authorities having the right skills with their lead partners in terms of leadership, resources, buy-in and capacity to regenerate towns in the areas where you're working?\" said by Mark Isherwood AM\n\"I'll go first, if you don't mind. Again, it's a similar picture. I think local authorities have suffered disproportionately in terms of development departments\u2014economic, housing\u2014through the period of austerity over the last 12 to 15 years. Usually, it's these functions that will have been depleted. That said, I think there's an opportunity here for a regional approach, whereby a lot of those skill sets could be shared across a number of local authorities. In Scotland, we've got a unitary system of 32. We don't have to have specialists in 32 local authorities on housing or finance or net zero; you could actually be doing that at a regional level and driving efficiency. So, we're seeing much more of that through the city and regional growth deals and the regional economic partnerships, particularly in the south of Scotland where we've got a new enterprise agency. They've taken a much more clearly defined role in leading on town-centre regeneration and working more closely with the local authority. So, they're actually bringing the capacity into local government for that period of time, and additional resources, skills and so on. At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter about structure, so long as the activity is being delivered. But we are facing difficult times around resourcing, so I think there must be more collaboration and a regional approach taken.\" said by Phil Prentice\n\"I think there is, undoubtedly, a capacity challenge and a financial challenge, but some of this comes down to prioritisation and the extent to which the authority puts town-centre regeneration as being a priority, and therefore puts resources behind that. I do think there's an opportunity for collaboration. Certainly, within greater Manchester, we do that across the 10 districts and with the Greater Manchester Combined Authority, on the basis that that gives us collectively more scope, more buying power. I think there is also scope if you're going to do it with a public, private or community sector partnership, to bring in some of those resources from outside. It doesn't mean the authority has to do everything itself; you can tap into and bring in private sector resources to add in, and that's certainly something that we try and do and push as much as we can.\" said by Richard Roe\n\"Thank you. Have you witnessed or seen any pushback from, say, senior people who don't want to share power in practice, and want to be in charge and carry on in the old way? How's that being managed to get them on board?\" said by Mark Isherwood AM\n\"I think there's always some pushback. There are always little power bases. I think the starting point is to get the shared vision. So, certainly, our approach in our town centre\u2014so, in Altrincham and now in Stretford\u2014has been working to get a shared vision, shared ambition, and once you've got that, you've got something you can align behind and that becomes the priority. But that's the starting point.\" said by Richard Roe\n\"Thank you. In terms of the planning system, again, to what extent in your experience do you believe this has been flexible enough to support businesses and partners to respond quickly to problems when they arise, and, if it hasn't, what should be done to improve this? Of course, I'm aware\u2014as obviously, clearly you are\u2014the planning systems in Scotland, Wales and England are not completely aligned, but nonetheless similar issues apply.\" said by Mark Isherwood AM\n\"Again, I'll pitch in from Scotland. We have just published 'National Planning Framework 4', so the new national plan framework has just been approved by the Scottish Parliament. That was actually quite timely because we'd already begun to understand the ongoing trends around it, the decline in retail, and how citizen behaviour had changed, and the urgency around climate. So, a lot of the new policies point towards that. We also have a town-centre policy now called 'A New Future for Scotland's Town Centres', and things that will actually reduce our carbon footprint, that will put more energy back into our town centres, particularly by repopulating and driving residential solutions. So, the planning system, I think, that we have is fit for purpose, and certainly over the last few months, some of the early tests around out-of-town sprawl development have actually been called in by the Scottish Government, and the applications have been refused.So, I think it's important that the Welsh Government gets its story straight, and that there is an alignment within the Welsh Government to make sure there's a consistent approach, because at the end of the day, the planning framework should really encourage the right sort of investment, and we should only be funding the right sort of investment. So, if you get your story straight to begin with, most of the jigsaw pieces will then ultimately fall into place. And all commercial investors want to see is consistency and longevity. They want to know that this is the way it's going to be long term, and the money will then follow up after that. So, I think we have actually got a pretty decent planning system. Obviously, the proof will be in the pudding and the delivery over the next few years, but at least the policy is very solid.\" said by Phil Prentice\n\"Thank you. Mr Roe.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Isherwood AM\n\"I think I'm probably slightly less optimistic than Phil on this. I think there are some challenges in the planning system. I think it can be slow to get policy changes made. Actually, in our full council last night, we adopted a new planning policy, the civic quarter area action plan, just outside one of our town centres, but it's taken us four years to get that adopted, to go through the system that we have to go through. And we've ended up\u2014. We're adopting it in a very different place from when we started. So, I do think there are some challenges in getting policy and being able to move policy quickly enough to respond to a changing economic environment.&nbsp;I think permitted development rights and the conversion of office to residential gives us some challenges as well, in terms of our ability to manage how that transition&nbsp;from commercial to residential is led, not that we're against bringing more residential into the town centre. That's something that we want to do, but we also want to manage how it works from the commercial basis. You're always recognising in the planning system that you're potentially trying to balance out people with very different interests, and that is always one part of the challenge.Having said that, I think that, used properly, there are some advantages and some strengths in the planning system when you look at individual applications. We have got a neighbourhood business plan in Altrincham, which was worked on and led by the local community, owned by the local community, and they're still very involved with the design panel in looking at development within Altrincham town centre. So, used properly, it can be of benefit, but there are some structural challenges, I think.\" said by Richard Roe\n\"And what, in your view, needs to change to address those?\" said by Mark Isherwood AM\n\"I think that some of it is a national-level policy change. The nature of planning is that it takes a long time to do. Within greater Manchester, we're working on a regional strategy now, 'Places for Everyone', across nine of the 10 districts. We've been working on that for seven years now, to get that through. That's a long time to get your baseline planning policy in place. These things are complex, they're large, they're difficult, but there's got to be a way for us to get policy decisions made slightly quicker. Because Phil's right\u2014what the private sector and what the community wants is certainty and understanding. And actually, when you're going through the system, creating planning policy, you're putting uncertainty into the system, and always with the danger that there's a change in national policy, which actually then means that the baseline that you should be working against starts to change.\" said by Richard Roe\n\"Thank you. Again, based upon your experiences, what needs to happen to get other public sector partners, for example health trusts, boards, universities, or otherwise, to work with councils to deliver regeneration in towns?\" said by Mark Isherwood AM\n\"I'll pitch in. I think, in Scotland, we've taken a very different approach. We haven't looked at it solely through the prism of town centres\u2014we've looked at it through the prism of place. And through that, we developed a place principle, which was co-signed by local government and the Scottish Government and a number of our key agencies\u2014the likes of enterprise agencies, transport, VisitScotland and the third sector. And the rationale behind that was really that place is the responsibility of all actors, and, ultimately, all actors will have a distinct role to play in actually making the place better, making it work better for citizens, ultimately. And that does involve transportation, it involves health, it involves housing, it involves the environment. But I think that having that discussion at the place-based partnership gives us a much better opportunity to create a holistic vision, and to look at how resources are aligned in the longer term. It even considers disinvestments\u2014an honest discussion about what has to go and what's not affordable any more. So, I think, taking a place-based approach has broadened out the discussion, and no longer is town-centre regeneration seen to be solely the remit of local authorities\u2014it's actually seen to be everybody's responsibility. The principle was launched in 2018, so it's still taking time to embed, but most place partnerships now do involve constituent elements of local authorities\u2014usually being the main driver\u2014but other key community planning partners, particularly health, heritage and economy. And that approach genuinely has widened out and improved the approach to places, which, ultimately, has affected a lot of town centres positively. Because, a wee bit like Wales, Scotland is very much a nation of towns, with the exception of a couple of cities. So, it's where the bulk of our population and businesses reside, and we're need to actually grasp that nettle and just work collegiately to make it better.\" said by Phil Prentice\n\"Thank you. And Richard Roe.\" said by Mark Isherwood AM\n\"I think it comes back to agreeing a vision, really, in what you're trying to achieve. Our experience in Altrincham was that we brought in other public sector partners\u2014so, health partners, transport colleagues, education colleagues\u2014all to sign up to a vision, to recognise, actually, what they would gain by an improved town centre, in terms of improved service delivery, but improved outcomes for residents. And through that, we aligned investment, and investment decisions were made. We had investment from the council into the public realm, we had investment from health into a new hospital, and Transport for Greater Manchester into a new transport interchange. So, we were aligning that investment, and then again, that's part of creating the environment, turning the perception of the town around, and that creates a platform from which the private sector will follow and the private sector will start to invest, because they're seeing the public sector taking the lead.\" said by Richard Roe\n\"Thank you, both. What impact, again from your experience, do you believe the Welsh Government's target of 30 per cent of the Welsh workforce working at or near to home might have on towns? Is it something you've considered in your own areas? Is it something you consider to be feasible, based on any experience you have or any research that you've undertaken?\" said by Mark Isherwood AM\n\"I think it's a good ambition. Undoubtedly, in the post-COVID and climate emergency landscape, the world has changed substantially, and it won't go back to pre COVID. So, basically, we are looking at how economy and education and so on is delivered in a much more sustainable way.In Scotland, we noticed very quickly that towns were actually getting disproportionate benefit as opposed to city centres. The city centres were the ones that were most challenged, because, obviously, they weren't getting their daily commuters or the student flow or visitors. That has stabilised a little bit, but we've very much seen in Scotland the pattern of agile workforce, with large numbers of people continuing to work in a flexible way. That has been beneficial to the towns. We've seen co-working establishments open, because people don't want to spend all their time in their bedroom, so that's created an economic opportunity. But we've also seen consumption rise. So, people are going into coffee shops again on a much more regular basis.I think the concept of encouraging people away from carbon-intense commuting is actually a positive step forward. The role of the 20-minute neighbourhood, as it's often called, is to make sure that people do have access to education, employment, leisure, green space within that 20-minute walk or cycle. And that's really where a lot of our policies are headed towards, to actually embed that long term, to return to localism, to get people to think more about sustainability and their own individual carbon footprints. That means you have a bigger population base in your town; it's not being drained out into the city every day. The cities have to come up with their own imaginative strategies, but again, mainly around repopulation of city centres et cetera. But I think it's a worthy ambition. Maybe 30 per cent is actually\u2014. It's certainly an interesting figure to start with, because it probably is roughly about a third of the population who are currently working in that format in Scotland.\" said by Phil Prentice\n\"Thank you.

{"content": "\"Item 2 on the agenda is new petitions. Item 2.1, P-06-1306, 'More protection for ancient &amp; veteran trees in Wales. Old Trees can be relocated. Stop The Chop':'1960's tree felling laws are out of date. Current planning policy allows for the chopping down of ancient &amp; veteran trees.'We call on the Welsh Government to amend Planning Policy in relation to Tree Protection Orders (TPO\u2019s). More protection is required, the laws are far too relaxed.'Planning policies for both small &amp; large-scale developments allow property developers/land owners to apply for a Tree Felling Licence via Natural Resources Wales.'Stop The Chop of ancient &amp; veteran trees.'There is further information available to Members and members of the public on this petition. It was submitted by Nicholas Bounds, with 480 signatures. I will bring Members in to discuss this petition and any particular actions they wish to take, starting with Buffy Williams.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. I'd like to thank the petitioner for submitting this petition. I see that the Agriculture (Wales) Bill is due to be debated tomorrow on the Chamber floor. So, I would like to keep the petition open with a view to seeing what is said tomorrow in the debate. Obviously, this is a really important petition. We need to save our trees, we need to protect our old woodlands. That's really, really important, so I don't think we should close this petition. I think we should wait and maybe bring this petition back after we see exactly what is said tomorrow on the Chamber floor.\" said by Buffy Williams MS\n\"Thank you for that suggestion, Buffy. I can see Members are content with that and are in agreement.Item 2.2, P-06-1315, 'Stop outsourcing at the Plas Menai National Outdoor Centre for Wales':'Sport Wales has invited tenders for an external organisation to take over the running of its National Outdoor Activities Centre at Plas Menai, near Caernarfon, including the employment of its staff, and we are concerned about what this might mean for employees and the activities they provide. Previous experience suggests that outsourcing does not benefit staff, quality of service or the taxpayer.'We call on the Welsh Government to stop this process and keep Plas Menai in the public sector.'This was submitted by Darren Williams, with 1,253 signatures. We have had a response from the Minister in the Welsh Government and also a reply to that response from Darren Williams, who, for the record, I should state I know quite well through his work in a trade union. The petitioner Darren Williams has noted that the transfer of the outdoor facilities has happened, it's now gone ahead, so he's noted that and understands the committee can no longer do much more with that. On that issue, I suggest we close the petition, thank Darren for submitting, and, again, it's a different process, but certainly raising awareness of the issues across Wales. Are Members happy? I can see that they are.Item 2.3, P-06-1316, 'Rename Wales to her original name, Cymru':'Wales was the name imposed on Wales. The original name was Cymru.'This was submitted by Vaughan Williams, with 414 signatures. I'll bring Members in&nbsp;to discuss this petition now. Luke Fletcher.&nbsp;\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Diolch, Gadeirydd. I understand the sentiment behind the petition. You could probably argue that there are a number of names that were the original name for Wales. I think, actually, as well, this goes a bit deeper into place names within Wales. We know the Football Association of Wales, for example, uses 'Cymru' instead of 'Wales'. Looking at the Government's response to this, though, they're fairly firm in what they're going to continue doing, which is calling Wales both 'Wales' and 'Cymru'. I think it's going to come down to a bit of a culture change within society to get to this point of just calling Wales 'Cymru'. So, just based on the Government's position, but also with a commitment from myself and hopefully other Members to use the name 'Cymru' more, I think we should close the petition and thank the petitioner.&nbsp;\" said by Luke Fletcher MS\n\"Thank you, Luke. Are there any further comments from Members? No, I can see there are not. It is worth noting the Government's response, and I quote:'Our intention is to continue to use both Cymru and Wales, to refer to our nation in both its official languages, and to continue to promote the visibility and use of Welsh at a community and national level, reflecting our conviction that Welsh belongs to us all.'On that note, I think Members are agreed with Luke's position and suggestion. We'll action that and thank the petitioner and close. Diolch yn fawr.Item 2.4, P-06-1320, 'Allocate additional funding to Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council to ensure its sustainability':'The sustainability of the local government services delivered across Neath Port Talbot will be significantly challenged if additional Government funding is not provided. The ongoing impact of Covid-19 and the war in Ukraine are creating an unprecedented demand on already strained council services. We estimate a shortfall of \u00a35million for 2022-23 and a further \u00a320million for 2023-24. Our communities are struggling with the cost of living crisis and any increase in council tax must be avoided.'There is additional information available to Members and members of the public about this petition. It was submitted by Mark Fisher with 414 signatures. I would like to invite Members to discuss this petition now, and any actions the committee may wish to take. Luke Fletcher.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Diolch, Gadeirydd. I should probably say that I met with Mark a couple of times as one of the local Members for Neath Port Talbot and South Wales West more widely. I know he's quite committed, as this is a campaign he's run for a number of years now. The trouble we have at the moment is we're slap bang in the middle of budget season. I know the Finance Committee, and the Local Government and Housing Committee, have published reports today around their budget scrutiny. There are a lot of things in there for us to consider. Of course, we have the debate on the draft budget tomorrow. I think, because of that, we should keep the petition open for the time being, or at least until the final budget and local government settlement is published, and revisit it at that point to see what contribution we can make as a committee.\" said by Luke Fletcher MS\n\"Thank you, Luke. Do Members agree? Yes. Thank you.&nbsp;Item 2.5, P-06-1323, 'We request that the Welsh Government purchase St David's Hall as a national resource for Wales':'This is a heartfelt plea to prevent the loss of a vital cultural resource to the people of Wales; We call upon the Welsh Government to step in.'Again, there's additional information available to Members and members of the public on this petition. It was submitted by Ben Herrington with 3,575 signatures. I'll invite Members to discuss this petition now. Rhys ab Owen.&nbsp;\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Diolch yn fawr, Gadeirydd. This is an important petition to try and keep the national concert hall of Wales within public ownership. I know the importance of the hall for schoolchildren; I myself sang there a few times as a schoolchild. So, I know the public benefit of the hall\u2014the home of the internationally renowned Cardiff Singer of the World and the national orchestra. I see that the Welsh Government haven't responded formally to the petition, and of course we still have the public consultation with Cardiff Council, which I understand is due to be published next month. So, I submit that we keep open the petition pending the formal response from the Welsh Government, and see Cardiff Council's public consultation report.\" said by Rhys ab Owen MS\n\"Thank you, Rhys. Luke Fletcher.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Diolch, Gadeirydd. I never sung there myself when I was a kid\u2014I was a bit tone deaf\u2014but I'm pretty sure my wife did, as a Cardiff girl. In support of what Rhys suggests there, for me as well, there's an element of wanting to keep public institutions like this in public hands. On a personal level, I don't think privatisation is a solution, especially when it comes to cultural matters.\" said by Luke Fletcher MS\n\"Thank you for that, Luke, in agreement with Rhys's suggestion to keep open pending the response from the Welsh Government. Are Members all in agreement? They are. I think it's also worth noting a similar petition that was launched on the Change.org website, which the Petitions Committee can't look at. It is worth noting that that similar petition, on that external website, Change.org, collected 21,790 signatures\u2014so, again, just showing the importance of St David's Hall to the people of Wales. We await with interest the Welsh Government's response.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Item 3 on today's agenda is updates to previous petitions.Item 3.1, P-06-1314, 'Insulate all Welsh homes against both the heat and the cold...introduce grants that are open to all!'. This was submitted by Robert Curtis, with 279 signatures. This is a petition that the committee took great interest in, given the current climate that we all face. We have, as a committee, undertaken some work, both hosting a round-table with a number of external organisations, and too a committee visit to Sero Homes in Cardiff, to look at the innovations they are taking in developing and retrofitting homes across Wales. Both the visit and the round-table have posed some questions for the committee to consider. I propose to the members of the committee that we write to the Minister for Climate Change with the questions that have arisen from those two engagements that took place, and we will make that letter public. Are Members content? I see they are.&nbsp;Item 3.2, P-06-1209, 'Create a national list of all unpaid carers in Wales'. This was submitted by Mike O'Brien, with 77 signatures. I will bring in committee members to discuss this petition and any actions they may wish to take. Luke Fletcher.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Diolch, Gadeirydd. My understanding is that this is now being discussed at a pretty high level, but one of the things that keeps coming up all the time is the difficulty around collecting that data around unpaid carers. I'd be really interested in exploring that a bit more with the Minister, if possible. I would like to keep the petition open. I know there's a ministerial advisory group meeting around March or April time. I'd be interested to have an update from the Minister from that. But I'm really interested in just delving a bit deeper into the issues around collecting data here, because I think, actually, this is something quite important that we need to get to grips with.\" said by Luke Fletcher MS\n\"Thank you for that suggestion, Luke. Are Members in agreement? I can see they are. Are there any further comments? No. Okay.Item 3.3, P-06-1240, 'Improve health services for people with epilepsy living in Wales'. This was submitted by Janet Paterson with 1,334 signatures. I know Janet Paterson; I think I sponsored an event in the Senedd for Epilepsy Action Cymru. We've considered this petition a number of times now, but I will bring Members in to discuss the petition and any action. I'm again looking at Luke Fletcher.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Diolch, Gadeirydd. I think we should perhaps write to the Minister, just to see if there's a possibility of getting her view on the report published by Epilepsy Action Cymru. I know it's quite unusual for a Minister to comment on third sector work, but she has shown a willingness to share the report with those who are drawing up the new service specifications for epilepsy within Wales. I always go with the principle of, 'If you don't ask, you don't get', so I wouldn't mind if we could write to the Minister, asking for her views, and then come back to this petition once we've had the response. But I think we should also congratulate the petitioner on this petition. The fact that it's being discussed at the level it's being discussed right now is something to be really proud of.\" said by Luke Fletcher MS\n\"Thank you, Luke. So, there's been a suggestion to write to the Minister for her further thoughts and, as Luke has said, the Minister has shared it with her officials. The report is by Epilepsy Action Cymru, which I think was the one I launched with Janet here in the Senedd, and is now being considered by Welsh Government and those at the highest level. So, is there agreement with Luke's suggestion? I can see that Members do agree. Thank you. So, we will do that, and, again, yes, you're right: we should congratulate Janet and all those who signed that petition.Item 3.4, P-06-1242, 'Improve Endometriosis Healthcare in Wales'. This was submitted by Beth Hales with 5,895 signatures. Again, we've considered this a number of times, and I think we've had very good engagement with Beth Hales. The Senedd committee did debate\u2014. We did not debate the issue. It did reach the threshold for debate when it opened, but as a committee I think we had decided not to debate it because it was debated in the previous Senedd by the likes of our former colleague Suzy Davies, who put a wonderful, excellent contribution forward. On that point, I will bring committee members in. Buffy Williams.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. I'd also like to thank the petitioner and all those who are continuously campaigning to raise awareness of endometriosis. It's such a debilitating condition to have. I know that from my own personal experience. So, the more awareness we can raise for such an important subject, the better, and I think we've all played our part as a committee raising awareness on social media, so that people understand just how debilitating this condition really is.I know the petition has been open for over a year, and we've considered it four times now, but for myself personally and for the petitioner, I would really like to leave this petition open just until the women's health plan has been developed and published, so that we ourselves as a committee can look at that health plan and see just what provision is in there for endometriosis sufferers because this is one of those conditions that you can't see, and if you can't see it, it's almost like it doesn't exist. It can cost a woman two weeks out of every month of their lives. I know for myself that I was losing two weeks out of every single month where I just couldn't leave the house. So, it's so important that we keep this petition open, just to ensure that the women's health plan does specifically have an area for endometriosis sufferers in there.\" said by Buffy Williams MS\n\"Thank you for that suggestion, Buffy. I think it's worth noting your ongoing commitment to raising this in the Senedd at every opportunity. Do Members agree with Buffy's suggestion to await the publication of the women's health plan? They do. Okay. We will do that. Again, it's worth mentioning how inspirational Beth Hales is. We've all been struck by that, I'm sure, as a committee, and we will, I'm sure, engage further with her.Item 3.5, P-06-1247, 'We call on the Welsh Government to lead the way by supporting trials of a four-day week in Wales'. This was submitted by Mark Hooper with 1,619 signatures. Again, for the record, I and I think other members of the committee do know Mark from the work that he does. We, as a committee, took the decision to undertake an inquiry into the four-day week, or the prospect of a four-day week in Wales, and the committee recommended and endorsed a trial in the public sector in Wales. For the record, it's important to note that there was a minority view from the Member Joel James, who did not agree with our recommendation as a committee.The report was laid on 24 January. Myself, Mark and Joel did a lot of media interviews, actually, on that day. The petition saw a lot of engagement and actually raised a lot of debate\u2014it's probably up there as one of the petitions that has raised most debate. I understand it was even debated in a retired men's club, so we're informed. So, no, it's good to see engagement of the committee is reaching far and wide, and I suggest we wait to see the outcome of the Welsh Government's response to our report and recommendations, and consider the petition and any actions to take then. Do Members agree? Yes.Item 3.6, P-06-1287, 'Investigate C&amp;V UHB\u2019s refusal to keep north Penarth\u2019s surgery, allocating patients to distant GPs'. This has been submitted by Max Scott-Cook, with 348 signatures in total, 266 of them online and 82 on paper. I'd like to bring committee members in now to discuss further.

{"content": "\"Good afternoon and welcome to this Plenary meeting at the Senedd. The first item this afternoon is questions to the First Minister, and the first question is from Joyce Watson.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"1. What is the Welsh Government doing to encourage girls into science, technology, engineering and mathematics&nbsp;education and careers? OQ59722\" said by Joyce Watson AM\n\"Llywydd, I thank Joyce Watson for that question. The Welsh Government works with schools, colleges, employers, and with role models, to ensure that girls and young women are positively encouraged to select STEM-related qualifications and careers.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"I thank you for that answer, First Minister. This Friday is International Women in Engineering Day, and I'll be marking that with a visit to Dragon LNG. There are good initiatives out there, as you say, like the Engineering Education Scheme Wales programme, but, in the workplace, it remains the case that 73 per cent of the STEM workforce are men, women make up only 14.5 per cent of engineers, and only 20 per cent of women science graduates go on to work in STEM careers, compared with 44 per cent of men. It matters not just for gender equality, but because there is a shortfall of 173,000 workers in the UK STEM sector, costing the economy \u00a31.5 billion a year. Climate change, food and water security, future pandemics and the global challenges we face demand STEM-based solutions. We can't afford to waste female talent and knowledge.&nbsp;So, what is the Welsh Government doing to help close that gap and to work with other partners to secure that?\" said by Joyce Watson AM\n\"Well, Llywydd, I thank Joyce Watson for those points, and I agree with her basic premise very much that the future in the Welsh economy is going to be the competition for workers to take up the posts that are waiting for workers to fulfil them. And that quite certainly means that the talents and the abilities of over half the population cannot possibly be ignored in that quest.&nbsp;Now, girls consistently outperform boys in maths and science attainment throughout compulsory education. In GCSEs, girls outperform boys in every aspect of the sciences other than physics. And girls outperform boys at A-level as well. What we have to do is, as Joyce Watson suggests, Llywydd, make a greater effort to persuade those young women to use those qualifications in the workplace in the jobs that rely on STEM backgrounds to be successful. It is why, thinking of what Joyce Watson said about Friday being the women in engineering day in Wales, the Engineering Education Scheme Wales has a particular strength, encouraging young girls as early as year 8 in school to have contact with employers, to have contact with people in higher education, so that they take an active interest in STEM before they make GCSE choices, knowing that those choices lead on into employment possibilities of the future. Right across the effort of Government\u2014but not simply Government, employers as well\u2014we need a focus on the way in which young women are persuaded that there are a range of possibilities for them there in the workplace, and that the investment that they make in studying STEM subjects will pay off for them in career opportunities in the future.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Following on from what you just said, First Minister, about promoting an active interest to girls on STEM subjects before they get to GCSE level, as a proud ambassador for Girlguiding, I've been pleased to see that, over the last two months, Girlguiding Gwent have held space-themed events for Rainbows and Brownies, and over 80 guides have taken part in a STEM day. These girls have had an excellent time making lemon batteries, binary bracelets, and so much more, which, of course, has helped promote STEM subject to these girls.&nbsp;As a Government, you should be doing everything in your power to ensure these girls have the best opportunities in STEM, and, obviously, a level playing field and opportunities when accessing higher education. Yet, First Minister, your Government seems to want to make it harder than ever for young female learners to go into STEM, by combining those three separate sciences into double science at GCSE level, as I mentioned the other week. You didn't want to recognise it last time, but this is something that has been widely criticised by the profession and the science sector alike: Dr Lowri Mainwaring, academic team lead in biomedical sciences at Cardiff Metropolitan University; Professor Alma Harris from the department of education and childhood studies at Swansea University; Eluned Parrott, head of Wales at the Institute of Physics. This Government, in one breath, is asking young girls to take up science, technology, engineering, mathematics and jobs for the future, and then, in the same breath, you're putting them at an immediate disadvantage to the rest of the UK when they're applying for jobs and universities. First Minister, how is restricting young people's STEM education actually helping girls to go into STEM?\" said by Laura Anne Jones AM\n\"Llywydd, I've rehearsed this issue with the Member previously. I don't agree with the points she makes, but, far more importantly than my point of view, neither do those people who work in the field. This is a proposal by Qualifications Wales\u2014those people who we rely on for their expertise in plotting a path to futures for our young people. Industry bodies\u2014. And, actually, I heard that she mentioned Eluned Parrott; I understand that Eluned Parrott is in support of the proposals that the Welsh Government makes, and, moreover, that those parts, those representative bodies that we rely on for advice in chemistry, in biology, and so on, are in favour of these proposals, because they believe that more young people\u2014more young people\u2014will end up studying science at that level, and doing it in a way that gives them the confidence to know that they can go on and study it at higher levels as well. I hear a series of assertions from the Member, in an evidence-free way. These are her opinions, which she wishes to persuade us of, in the teeth of the evidence\u2014not opinions, the evidence\u2014from those who are experts in the field that the proposals will do more to encourage young women, and young men, to study sciences in Wales, and that's why the Government is pursuing those ambitions.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"2. How is the Welsh Government encouraging schools to become more environmentally friendly? OQ59694\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Can I thank Russell George for that question, Llywydd? Our young people are the best advocates for making schools environmentally friendly. The success of the Eco-Schools movement in Wales provides an effective way in which that commitment can be translated into practical action.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Thank you, First Minister. I agree with you entirely\u2014I think young people are the best people to lead this area. Last week, I met with children from Llanidloes Primary School\u2014Belle, Reggie, Millie and Willow\u2014who are members of the school's eco-committee. Now, they're very keen to see a reduction of plastic waste when it comes to the provision of school milk, and they detailed to me that they receive 78 individual small plastic bottles of milk each day as part of a UK-wide scheme, which is part-funded also by the Welsh Government. The young people outlined to me that the school uses 15,210 plastic milk containers each year. They also outlined to me that this cost \u00a35,171.40\u2014they're very good at maths at this school, I should add. Now, if they purchased the milk themselves, including delivery, and used recyclable cups, there would be a huge saving in weight terms; in fact, they calculated that at three times the weight per year of their teacher, Mrs Stead. So, apart from the environmental savings, there would be a huge cost saving as well, at 50 per cent. In fairness to the children, they also considered there would be a resource in washing the reusable cups as well. They've met with their local authority, they've met with others, but they just feel that they've been knocking their heads against a brick wall, unfortunately\u2014they feel demoralised, they feel like barriers are being put in place. So, can I ask, First Minister, that you task one of your Welsh Government officials to work with the children and the school, to run a pilot project, because, after all, there could be a huge saving in plastic use, and also a huge cost saving, if you think of \u00a32,500 plus every primary school, each year? Thank you, First Minister.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"I thank Russell George very much for that supplementary question. That is a remarkable combination of problem-solving skills that we saw from the students at Llanidloes. I'm very pleased to agree that we will find someone to talk directly to the school, and, indeed, to the children, to see whether their ideas can find a further way into practical action. But it is great to see, isn't it, the way that young people themselves are not only interested, in that general sense, in the future of the environment, but they translate that into the things that they see in front of them every day, and then come forward with those sorts of imaginative ideas to create new solutions.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"First Minister, as Members of the Senedd, I think we do get a strong sense of that passion that school pupils have for the environment when schools come here to the Senedd to visit and to learn more about the work of Senedd Members, and also when we visit schools. I've been very pleased to see local schools in Newport East setting a very good example, I think, in terms of recognising the passion of their pupils for the environment and organising around it: inviting local representatives in to discuss environmental issues and how action can be taken forward; organising survival skills experiences; taking lessons forward through Forest School; and climate action change measures, First Minister. So, would you agree with me that we need to look at schools in Wales that are setting a very good example, and make sure that we draw on that passion, as we take these policies forward?\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Well, Llywydd, I agree, of course, that we ought to find all the ways we can to draw on that passionate commitment that young people feel to the future of the planet that they will go on inhabiting. We will meet tomorrow with the Youth Parliament here, in this room, and I'm sure we will hear then views of those young people on climate change, on biodiversity loss, on ways in which we can act together to improve the environment.Now, I happen to have seen that the Member for Newport East was in Ringland Primary School recently, meeting their eco-council and sharing ideas with them. Just as in Llanidloes, here's another school with lots of practical ideas. I was taken by the fact that I saw that they have a weekly recycling competition in which every class has everything that they have collected that weak weighed, and then a winner of the competition declared every week, and that creates an interest in every child and in every part of the school in doing the practical things they can do to make a difference.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"I had a wonderful meeting with Albany school's council, and they raised the issue of adults feeding pigeons that prevented them using the little bit of green space they had around their school. So, children make the best eco-warriors. They also raised with me the problem of cars parking on pavements, which got in the way of their walking to school safely. So, I think there's a great deal more we can do. I would want to just remind the Government about the importance of ensuring that all students have the ability to walk, cycle or scoot to school, if that's physically possible. It may not be possible for all the students in Llanidloes, who may have a distance to go. But, just as we have a scheme for enabling people to buy a bike if they work for us here in the Senedd, has any consideration been given to having some sort of bicycle loan scheme so families would be able to buy a bike slowly?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"I agree with Jenny Rathbone that children are the most persuasive advocates with their own parents about actions that can be taken to improve environment around their own schools. As every Member here in the Senedd, I'm sure, I have visited schools where you see the displays of the messages that children convey to their parents about smoking, about littering, about parking, about all the things that make that immediate difference to the environment of the child. And, in fact, I believe that there are schemes that already exist that encourage schools to buy bicycles themselves so children can borrow them and can cycle back and forth to school\u2014combining that with cycling proficiency classes, all the things that make cycling fun, as well as making it a better alternative for children getting back and forth from home to school. And, of course, I encourage all schools and all local education authorities to go on doing everything they can to persuade young people and to enable young people to make those healthy and active choices.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Questions now from the party leaders. Leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew R.T.&nbsp;Davies.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Thank you, Presiding Officer. With your permission, can I welcome the new leader of Plaid Cymru to his position, and wish him well\u2014not too well\u2014in that position? [<em>Laughter</em>.] I\u2019m sure we will have some good debates and exchanges across the floor of the Welsh Parliament.First Minister, last week\u2019s unemployment figures here in Wales were disappointing. They showed that, regrettably, the numbers were going up for unemployment here in Wales, as opposed to going down in other parts of the United Kingdom. What assessment has the Welsh Government been able to make of those figures, and what actions is it taking to respond to the rising number of unemployed here in Wales?\" said by Andrew RT Davies AM\n\"I'm aware, of course, of last week's labour market statistics. The background to them is a serious one for the whole of the United Kingdom. The Conservative Party has crashed the economy, and we now see that working out in the pressures we see in the workplace as well. [<em>Interruption</em>.] I don't think that I can believe that I can think of Conservative Party Members laughing at the idea of the way that they've conducted the economic responsibilities of this country. But as far as Welsh figures are concerned, the figures that were published last week show a mixed picture. While the headline figures of unemployment went up in Wales, the figures that the ONS publish on monthly paid employees in Wales show that figure actually going up, and going up in Wales more strongly than any other part of the United Kingdom. So, they were two sets of figures, published on the same day, pointing in apparently different directions; while unemployment in Wales went up, the number of monthly paid employees also went up in the same month. And as ever, with any monthly set of figures, it is better to look over a range of months before we see which of these contradictory indicators turns out to be telling us the true story of the current state of the Welsh economy.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"First Minister, the UK economy was the fastest-growing economy for the last two years in the G7. Germany is in recession; despite all your backbenchers and your Government wishing this country to be in recession, this country is not in recession. Last week\u2019s figures clearly showed that unemployment was going up in this part of the United Kingdom, but going down in other parts of the United Kingdom. It is a fact that gross value added under Labour\u2019s watch has not gone up as it should have gone up, it is a fact that there is \u00a32,000 less in Welsh pay packets than those in other parts of the United Kingdom, and it is a fact that, sadly, we have more long-term unemployed in this part of the United Kingdom. The other fact is that we have 5 per cent of the population here in Wales, but we only generate 3 per cent of the wealth. For 25 years, the Labour Party have failed to improve those figures. I ask you again, First Minister: what is the Welsh Government doing to increase the long-term prospects for the Welsh economy and get those numbers moving in the right direction? Because those unemployment numbers last week just reinforced the failure of policy of Welsh Labour in Government here in Wales.\" said by ", "answer": "Andrew RT Davies AM"}

My name is Natalie Prosser.&nbsp;I'm the chief executive officer of the Office for Environmental Protection, and I'm very happy to be here today.\" said by Natalie Prosser\n\"Thank you for joining us. And finally, Mark.\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Good morning. My name is Mark Roberts, I'm the chief executive of Environmental Standards Scotland.\" said by Mark Roberts\n\"You're very welcome, the three of you. If you don't mind, we'll got straight into questions, and if I can start with a specific question for the OEP, just to ask, really, whether the interim environmental governance secretariat role, if you believe it was effective in logging and passing complaints to the OEP once established.\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Shall I start, Natalie, and then you can follow on? So, yes, we do think they were enormously helpful, those arrangements. The team we had were very good. They worked assiduously to do the right thing and not cross the line into actually investigating complaints. But there's a lot of work, as you receive a compliant, to make sure that it is at the appropriate place and in the appropriate format. And all that was done very carefully for us by that interim arrangement. And it also gave us a chance to test out our embryonic complaints procedures, so, it was a bit of a testing bed as well.\" said by Dame Glenys Stacey\n\"What I would add to that is that there was a reasonably considerable delay between establishing the IEGS and the establishment of the OEP on a statutory footing, and for those complainants who had to essentially wait for the OEP to be a on a statutory footing, we had to take a lot of care to support and manage them because there was a delay, and I'm sure that that was the cause of some frustration. But I agree with Dame Glenys's assessment\u2014it was very helpful having that function in place to allow complaints to be received and triaged before they were passed over to the OEP proper.\" said by Natalie Prosser\n\"Thank you, both. Both Janet Finch-Saunders and Huw Irranca-Davies have indicated that they have a supplementary, so, I'll come to you first, Janet.\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Thank you and good morning. I just picked up on the comments that you made on not crossing the line to investigate the complaint.\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"Yes. So, the interim body did not have the statutory powers of investigation. We had to wait for those to be enabled. That was the difficulty.\" said by Dame Glenys Stacey\n\"Okay. Now you have those powers, you've followed on through now with a number of investigations, then.\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"Yes. We've had 86 complaints; we've had over 700 general inquiries, and we have commenced two investigations.\" said by Dame Glenys Stacey\n\"Two investigations. Thank you.\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"Thank you. And if I can bring Huw in.\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Thank you very much, Chair. I just want you, briefly, to reflect on what lessons we might take as a committee now that we have a slight delay here in Wales. So, how do we overcome those hurdles that you've had, particularly with that lag between the powers you needed? What would you say to us as a committee?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Right. Well, again, I'll start, Natalie, and perhaps you'll come in. So, of course, the lag that we experienced wasn't just a problem in relation to complaints, it was the other powers and duties that we hoped to have as well as a statutory body. And during that period, I do think it's right that we were able to receive complaints and that people were then kept informed. And, as Natalie said, we worked hard at making that happen.&nbsp;But we were also able to make progress in other respects. So, for example, Government was persuaded to set up the OEP on an interim footing. So, there was this intermediate stage, if you like. We initially had the secretariat, then we became the interim OEP, and then we became the enacted OEP proper. And in that interim OEP period, we were able to make progress in a number of ways. We were able to, for example, complete the appointments process for members of our board. And that's a sizeable amount of our intellectual capital, and they were able to steer and shape the way the organisation would be in the way that they should. So, being able to get key senior staff and board members in early, before enactment, if you like, did enable us to hit the ground running, I would say, Natalie, didn't it, and it gave us thinking time. There's no point in having thinking time if you haven't got the right people doing the thinking. You don't want an interim secretariat doing that thinking for you, when you're thinking about how you prioritise matters or what your approach to enforcement might be, or what the priorities might be for you. You need the people who will be the bedrock of the organisation doing that thinking with you, and we were able to get those on board.\" said by Dame Glenys Stacey\n\"Thank you very much. If I can bring Joyce Watson in.\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Thank you. Good morning, both. I think quite a few of the questions have been asked, but you started talking about your reflections on establishing the interim OEP prior to the legislation. Do you have anything further to add?\" said by Joyce Watson AM\n\"Natalie, would you like to start?\" said by Dame Glenys Stacey\n\"The material benefit of the OEP being on an interim footing is, as Dame Glenys mentioned, the ability to do the building of the organisation, which is a substantial resource investment of recruiting, establishing all of your operational protocols, finding premises and so on. That space did enable us to progress.The other lesson I learned from the interim OEP was that we worked very closely with our sponsorship department, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, to scope out a governance arrangement that allowed OEP to take further steps forward in that establishment. That was developed in partnership, ahead of the legislation being finalised. For example, that allowed us to deliver a first report, assessing the Government's progress, which is our 'Taking stock' report, and it allowed us to provide advice to Government while we were in the interim phase. We didn't have all the powers that the statutory OEP had, but it allowed us to start doing that job in earnest while we were still building the organisation, and it allowed us to straight away start performing our role and supporting those statutory functions before they came online. So, I do think the interim arrangements were very valuable. I think the lesson from us is that there is real merit in establishing an interim body while the necessary legislative process happens. It's important that that legislation is subject to the right thinking and scrutiny, but in the meantime, we were able to crack on in getting the organisation up on its feet.\" said by Natalie Prosser\n\"Thank you.\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Okay, and where did you manage to find your staff and your expertise, and how did you go about doing that?\" said by Joyce Watson AM\n\"Natalie\u2014\" said by Dame Glenys Stacey\n\"Shall I start?\" said by Natalie Prosser\n\"Yes, please.\" said by Dame Glenys Stacey\n\"It was incredibly valuable that the appointments process for our board had been commenced early, and our board was appointed in interim form in July. That brought a guiding and informed board to allow the shaping of the organisation. I think that was a very prudent and wise decision to make to get the board up and running. The board, then, were able to commence recruitment and appointment, which we started almost straight away, and the interim arrangements with DEFRA meant that we could recruit staff on an interim basis into DEFRA, and the legislation then enabled those staff to be ported over into OEP. That was a very helpful enabling bit of legislation in the Act that happened.We are based in Worcester in England and Northern Ireland, and we progressed with our England-based recruitment initially. We advertised through the normal civil service channels. We found an enormous amount of interest from a broad range of skilled individuals in the organisation, so we were able to bring on board relatively quickly some very high-calibre staff. Through the transition period, we retained that supporting group of seconded staff from DEFRA, some of whom elected to apply and stay with the organisation on a permanent basis, and some of whom went back to DEFRA. That allowed a smoother transition from interim to statutory form.\" said by Natalie Prosser\n\"Thank you. Janet.\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Thank you. A very quick one first: how many staff do you have, and how many are on your board, please?\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"Do you want to go with the board, Dame Glenys, and I'll pick up staff?\" said by Natalie Prosser\n\"Yes, I'll deal with board. So, our board membership isn't as large as it could be. The statutory provisions would allow us to have a couple more board members. The statutory provisions also provide that our chief exec is a board member, as indeed she is, and that at least one other member of our executive staff should be on the board as well. And we deal with that by rotating\u2014[<em>Inaudible</em>.]\u2014on and off on a sort of six-monthly basis, so they each get a chance to do that, and that's working quite well. We followed the model set up there by the National Audit Office, actually, in approaching that in that sort of fashion. Other than that, there is myself, there is a board member dedicated, well, from Northern Ireland; by statute, we need that member, although he plays his full part across the whole range of other work. And then we have four other board members, bringing a mix of expertise, understanding of environmental law and wider environmental matters, and a good amount of policy experience as well. If I could say, they've proved to be excellent, and there are no one-trick ponies on our board; they all bring much more than one thing.&nbsp;\" said by Dame Glenys Stacey\n\"Oh, fantastic. So, what would you say are the lessons for Wales if we build\u2014or they build\u2014an interim body in anticipation of legislation to establish a Welsh environmental governance body?\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"Okay. So, I'll start, Nat, and you can pick up what I forget. So, first of all, there'll be a large debate about the extent to which this body would be independent, as there was in our country, and you can expect that debate to play through. It is important, in my view, that the relevant parliament or assembly is comfortable, ultimately, with the level of independence to be given to the body, although, in my experience, independence is all in the doing, in any event. So, you can expect that debate and the to-ing and fro-ing that would come with that. And you need to ensure that the body is sufficiently independent, in my view. That's the first thing.&nbsp;The second thing is that the quality of those board members, if you set it up in that way, is so important. You need a really good board for something like this, particularly where the board has statutory powers reserved to it, for example, to commence investigations. So, making sure that you attract a good cadre\u2014we had almost 200 applicants, I think\u2014and that the process is thorough and fair, and making sure that you get the best possible people, I think, is important as well, and get them in quickly so they can start to do the thinking that needs to be done.&nbsp;Thirdly, it is really important, in my view, to think carefully about the design of the organisation. Now, that is a matter for the organisation; it's not for a Government department, in my view, to do the detailed organisational design, but design matters, because this will be a cerebral organisation; it needs to do a good amount of proper thinking. It needs to be expert as well. It can't be expert in all areas of the environment, so it will need to bring in expertise, and also it will need to be remarkably flexible as an organisation, and you do need to think that through. It needs an embarrassing number of lawyers, because it's a very legalistic territory. You need to think about how those things are going to be designed to best effect. So, that's important.&nbsp;The last thing I would say is: get yourself a really good interim chief executive. If you've got someone that you actually do know can do the job, as we have the luxury of having Natalie, it does make it possible.&nbsp;\" said by Dame Glenys Stacey\n\"Thank you very much. And also what are your reflections on the establishment of Environmental Standards Scotland? And that's\u2014\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"Oh, sorry, that's\u2014. We're going to a different section there.&nbsp;\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"I do apologise.&nbsp;\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"Sorry, apologies. Yes. Mark, thank you for your patience. And thank you for answering so fully on the OEP there. If we can move on just for some questions on the ESS, and I think Jenny's going to kick us off, and, then, you're going to come in, Janet.\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Very good. Hello, good morning, Mark Roberts. We've heard some very cogent arguments from the OEP about the importance of establishing a shadow or interim board, and I wondered if Scotland followed the same model, or, if you did things differently, what were the reasons for that.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you, and good morning. So, first of all, it might be helpful if I just set out some of the chronology in terms of how things operated in Scotland. I should also say that I joined after the events I'm about to describe, so I'm reliant on my team's history here to a certain extent. So, the Bill that established ESS was passed by the Scottish Parliament in December 2020, and then, during the early part of 2021, ESS, in its shadow or interim form, came into being, and that included, in a very similar way to OEP, the establishment of the board.Our board is currently five members, all of whom are non-executive. I'm not a member of the board. It is about to become seven; we're about to have two new board members join us, which will take us up to our maximum number. During that interim or shadow period, the transition team, who had been established to start the process of setting up ESS, worked very, very hard\u2014a very small number of people\u2014around three key areas: firstly, the establishment of the organisation and its governance; secondly, around setting up about what our investigatory processes would be; and, thirdly, setting out our scope in a draft strategic plan that would set the backdrop for our work over the coming years.That interim or shadow phase ended on 1 October 2021, when ESS came into being and we adopted our full statutory powers. So, there was a comparatively short period of time when the board was operating in that shadow capacity. We were receiving enquiries. We were getting information coming in from the public and from organisations. But, similar to OEP, without our statutory powers, there was not a lot of work that we could really take on or do a significant amount of work with until 1 October 2021, when we came into our full mode of operation. And since then, we have gradually been growing and establishing the organisation, and that work is an ongoing process. We are currently about a head count of 20. I envisage that, fairly shortly, becoming about 25, and that's where we have got to at the moment.\" said by Mark Roberts\n\"The last question from me, before I hand over to somebody else, is: how good a job did the Scottish Parliament do in establishing in the public's mind that the ESS is independent from Government, given that one of your major roles is to scrutinise public bodies?\" said by ", "answer": "Jenny Rathbone AM"}

I'm Kath Davies, director of collections and research for Amgueddfa Cymru.\" said by Kath Davies\n\"Thank you very much to all of you for joining us this morning. We'll go straight to questions, if that's okay, and I'll turn first of all to Alun Davies.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Thank you. I'm reading this report, which was published around five years ago now, or something like that, and I'm not entirely sure whether I understand. One of of the advantages of being a politician is that you can ask quite stupid questions, and I don't know whether I understand completely what the offer is here, or the proposal. I remember, Pedr, visiting the national library years ago now, and Andrew Green, at the time, showed the collections that you keep in storage there\u2014and I take it, Kath, that there is a great deal in storage at the national gallery too. I take it that the gallery that we're talking about here isn't actually going to do anything to enable the public to see these collections that are currently in storage, because we're talking here about contemporary art; we're not talking about the historic collections. Is that how you understand it?\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"[<em>Inaudible</em>.]\u2014collections, and I think that's a very good starting point. Within the national museum collection, there are some 44,000 pieces in the collection as a whole. For the most part, it is contemporary art. So, as part of the work\u2014\" said by Kath Davies\n\"So, how would you define that?\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"We define anything as being contemporary if it relates to any artist who was alive after the second world war.\" said by Kath Davies\n\"That isn't the usual definition, though, is it?\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"That's the definition we've discussed with partners, and that's what they accept\" said by Kath Davies\n\"But it's not the usual definition\u2014\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"No.\" said by Kath Davies\n\"\u2014because 'contemporary' usually relates to people alive today, not people who were alive 80 years ago.\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Yes, but I would like to add that that is the definition we use, but, as part of that collection, we also include work that is of contemporary relevance. So, if there is a contemporary artist who's been inspired by a historic piece of art\u2014one example would be Thomas Jones's historic piece entitled <em>The Bard</em> and how that inspired Bedwyr Williams to create a piece of work\u2014we do include that historic piece of art as part of the offer here.If I could return to the collection itself and how much we can display and exhibit, at the moment the national museum can show around 5 per cent of the collection, and that is the same average figure that you would see across Wales, UK and Europe. The British Museum show just 1 per cent, and the average is between 2 per cent and 5 per cent. So, this project does provide us with an opportunity to share much more of the collection\u2014the contemporary collection and also the historic works that relate, perhaps, to some of our contemporary artists.\" said by Kath Davies\n\"It sounds to me as though you're using a definition that allows you to select what you show.\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Yes, that's right. Also, if you take the artist Gwen John, who has inspired a number of artists in Wales, we would include her as part of that offer. So, that's the definition, but we can be agile in the way that we\u2014\" said by Kath Davies\n\"You're very agile there. Pedr, what about the national library?\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Yes, that's a very interesting question, Alun, to be honest. Of course, the priority of Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru was to designate this gallery for contemporary artworks, but where the library is concerned, Alun is entirely right. That means that the majority of art collection isn't currently on public display.&nbsp;Now, personally, of course, and institutionally, the national library is 100 per cent behind this proposal and it's a wonderful and unique opportunity to exhibit our contemporary art to the people of Wales and to share it with the people of Wales. But at the end of the day, it doesn't establish a national art gallery that also includes contemporary art. Ideally, that's what we would have seen: a national gallery that would provide a platform for contemporary art, but would also provide a platform for our historical artworks, which are hugely important and of great quality.&nbsp;But why have a contemporary art gallery? I think that's a question for Welsh Labour and Plaid Cymru.\" said by Pedr ap Llwyd\n\"I'll be asking them too. But when I look at the collections that we have\u2014. I took my son to the national museum over the past holidays. I wanted him to see <em>La Parisienne</em> and the impressionists and so on, and it's gorgeous and it's a beautiful space, walking around the galleries and the art and the ceramics there, but I feel frustrated when I see that, because I feel that there is so much more for people to see and we can't enable that to happen for the reasons that Pedr has suggested, because we don't have a national gallery. And although you have selected a definition that isn't a contemporary definition, really, but I won't pursue that further, this proposal doesn't offer anything really to enable the people of Wales to access these major, historically important collections that we have and that I would like to see people in Wales being able to access.\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"First of all, I'd like to say that the national collection is a resource for Wales and we have to improve the way that we make use of that resource. There are a number of answers to your question. In the past, perhaps, the museum of Wales has been criticised because we don't provide a sufficient platform for Welsh artists, and that's an important part of what we are trying to do as part of this project.To return to your question on the historical collection, I would say that if a gallery truly wanted to display a piece of the historical collection that was relevant to the work they were doing with a local artist, for example, or a local school, we wouldn't necessarily say 'no' to that\u2014&nbsp;\" said by Kath Davies\n\"Well, that's not the question, with all due respect, Kath. The question is the ability for a parent to take a child to see our national collections during the school holiday or with a school trip, or for me to do so, when I've been working in town and I can just wonder in\u2014and I think having free museums is fantastic, if you can wander in without planning\u2014and see things that you hadn't expected or planned to see, and I think that's extremely important. But, if our national collections are in storage, that isn't possible, and perhaps there is a gallery somewhere else that would say, 'Well, I want to see\u2014' whatever, but that isn't planning on behalf of our national institutions to enable people to see these artworks. What I don't understand is how this proposal\u2014this model that you are discussing today\u2014\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Well, I would say it's an excellent opportunity with nine potential organisations as part of the scheme, for us to share the collection the length and breadth of Wales. So, I see that there will be far more loans, and also with the capital investment in these galleries, to enable them then to receive artworks from the national collection.&nbsp;I think that's what this programme is trying to solve.\" said by Kath Davies\n\"But the truth is, when you distribute these things, you don't distribute them across the whole of the nation, because people aren't going to travel from Blaenau Gwent to Anglesey or Pembrokeshire in order to see something as part of a wider exhibition, but they would go to Cardiff to visit a national gallery, because that's what people do, and we have examples from England and elsewhere where we have seen this. But, my concern is that we are investing in a model that won't actually deliver any objectives. We're not enabling people to see the important historical collections, nor are we creating something that is a sufficient draw for people to travel to see it. So, we would be enabling&nbsp;people in a relatively narrow area to see things in a local context, but there is no national institution to draw people in.&nbsp;\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Can I just mention\u2014\" said by Kath Davies\n\"Forgive me for intervening. Because of time constraints, I'll ask everyone to respond to what Alun asked there and then, perhaps, we'll have to move on. I know that Pedr wanted to come in there. I'll turn to Kath first and then I'll go to Pedr.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"I just wanted to mention one project that we developed during lockdown. As part of this project that had enabled us to pilot a new initiative, there was an opportunity for people in Wales to choose their favourite artworks that were part of the collection, and they selected around 30. One hundred had been put forward, but the 30 selected included historical work and contemporary work, and then we developed the 100 Celf exhibition, which travelled to Anglesey, Aberystwyth and Brecon. I do think that that's a very good example of the possibilities.&nbsp;\" said by Kath Davies\n\"I agree with these touring exhibitions. I don't have a problem with that. I'm sorry to cut across again, but I do think that it would be beneficial, if possible, Chair, for the committee to be able to visit the museum and the national library to see the work that you are doing to conserve and store these collections\u2014\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Yes, that would certainly be a good thing to do.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"\u2014and to talk about your plans as organisations. I think that would be very good for us as a committee.\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"A very warm welcome to you to do that.\" said by Kath Davies\n\"Thank you very much for that. Pedr, you wanted to come in on this.&nbsp;\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Yes, I would certainly welcome a visit from you to the national library. I agree with Kath, we and the museum are doing our level best to share our historical collections with the people of Wales, but the fact of the matter is that, as a nation, we don't have a national gallery, and that weighs heavily on my conscience.&nbsp;\" said by Pedr ap Llwyd\n\"Dafydd, did you want to add anything before we move on?\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Yes. The point that is raised is very fair in terms of the historical works, but the model that has been developed is unique, I think. There are no similar examples. The intention is to release the collections so that they can travel around Wales so that they are more available to communities outwith the capital, if you will, which means that people don't have to visit Aberystwyth. That's the fundamental objective. But, I accept the point about the historical works. The focus is on contemporary works here.&nbsp;\" said by Dafydd Rhys\n\"Thank you. We'll move to Llyr Gruffydd.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Yes, and I do think that creating a network of display areas with an appropriate atmosphere for exhibition would hopefully increase access and provide an ability to take our collections to various parts of Wales. We'll return, perhaps, to the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal and what it should look like, but the reality is that there is a proposal before us, and perhaps you could tell us what work, if any, you have done to date to work towards the aim of creating a national contemporary art gallery since the feasibility study in 2018.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Do you want me to start? I'll start and give you some information about the galleries that we have in mind. Work was commissioned back in 2020, truth be told, by Rural Office Architecture on behalf of the project to identify potential galleries across Wales that could be appropriate for the project. Those are: Storiel in Bangor; Aberystwyth Arts Centre; Glyn Vivian in Swansea; Mostyn in Llandudno; Newport Museum and Art Gallery; Oriel Davies Gallery in Newtown; Oriel Myrddin Gallery&nbsp;in Carmarthen; Plas Glyn y Weddw in Pen Ll\u0177n; as well as Ruthin Craft Centre.The criteria, maybe, are of interest for the committee this morning\u2014how we went about identifying this collection. Well, the work was commissioned by Rural Office to contact a number of galleries across Wales, but the criteria, simply put, were the need to have a wide geographical range across Wales, to ensure that the collections were available the length and breadth of Wales; the ability then to store and secure the work; the ability to provide educational opportunities and community-based projects; the capacity, then, so the capacity of the curatorial staff with the experience to contribute to co-creation; and what was affordable too\u2014that was a very important question; and accessibility to people with disabilities. And we prioritised spaces outside of Cardiff. Those were the major considerations when we selected the host galleries. Do you want to add anything to that, Kath?To date, there has been a delay in the work. We do acknowledge that. The main reason for that was the pandemic, certainly, because the work that was done on assessing the galleries was done right at the beginning of the pandemic. The emphasis of our work was changed during that period. We as an arts council focused on releasing the cultural recovery grants and so on, but the museum continued with its digital work, and I'm sure that you can tell us more about that in a moment, Kath. There was also a change in leadership within both bodies, in particular. But we have to acknowledge too, following the pandemic, it took some time to continue to pursue the impetus and we acknowledge we could have undertaken the GIS audits with the galleries more quickly. That's the only thing that's currently behind schedule.But, to date, we have succeeded in appointing an independent chair. We have an independent chair now. We have a project officer and we have a creative officer in place. So, a great deal of work has been done. There is more to do. But following correspondence with the Deputy Minister, we've also identified over the next two years what we need to be doing in terms of the work agenda. There are specific targets that have been set. The chairs of the three bodies have met. We are strengthening the project group in terms of the scrutiny function and regulation. So, a great deal of work has been done. There is work to do. But we're very happy to answer any questions on that.\" said by Dafydd Rhys\n\"Yes, fine. Perhaps we could get a response\u2014. I know we want to look in detail at the digital element, maybe, but would you like to touch on that now?\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"I'm happy to report that we have started to have the discussions necessary with the galleries. We met at the museum some fortnight ago, just to get under the skin of the model and to look at what would work for the galleries, what opportunities there are, and we will now be meeting regularly over the next few months to ensure that the resource and the programme is in place to allow them to progress in the way that they want.\" said by Kath Davies\n\"Does Pedr want to add anything there? Yes.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Yes, if I can speak in a parochial manner, Chair, in responding to those questions. What we're doing locally\u2014. What this project has enabled us to do and inspired us to do, indeed, is to invest in our contemporary art and to expand our contemporary art collection. We're coming to the end of the digitalisation process of our entire art collections and artworks\u2014we've got approximately 60,000 artworks in the library. But locally and in terms of supporting contemporary art, during the past year now, we have been commissioning contemporary artworks by young artists in Wales. And we were convinced that our national collections needed to be more representative of the diverse communities of Wales, and we have been commissioning artists from those diverse communities&nbsp;to create work that will be able to be part of this exciting project in future, and to share their work and to display it around Wales in the various galleries.&nbsp;\" said by Pedr ap Llwyd\n\"Thank you for that.

{"content": "\"So, we'll move on to item 2, the pre-appointment scrutiny of the preferred candidate for chair of Amgueddfa Cymru, Kate Eden. We'll go straight into questions, if that's okay.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"I'll ask you first, Kate, if you could please tell us a little bit about yourself and your background.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Yes, of course. Good morning, everyone, and thank you very much for the invitation to join you and the opportunity to be here today.\" said by Kate Eden\n\"My name is Kate Eden. I know you've had my CV and my questionnaire in advance, but I was born and brought up just outside Mold in north Wales, and I lived there until I went to university, where I studied social and political sciences, with a short spell in Italy, looking at art and political philosophy over there.I stayed in England for the majority of my executive career, which was spent largely in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, in a range of different roles, but focusing largely on public affairs, policy and strategic communications. I worked for a range of different companies, but large, global, complex, research and development-focused organisations, some based here in the UK and some with global bases. I did that for about 15 or 16 years, and then I took the opportunity to move back to Wales and have a slight career change, if you like. I'd always been very interested in the nature of non-executive working and the ability and the chance to provide scrutiny and oversight to organisation, and felt that there were a lot of transferabilities from my previous career into that.So, when I moved back, I started looking for opportunities and was fortunate enough to be given my first position with Public Health Wales, where I've remained to this day, and I'm now vice chair, and have added to that portfolio over the past seven or eight years. I now hold a range of different positions. Some of them are ministerial appointments and some are in the higher education sector as well. So, a good breadth and range of experience. And I now live just outside Abergavenny with my husband.\" said by Kate Eden\n\"Lovely. Diolch, Kate. Gosh, on another occasion, I'd love to be asking you more about your time in Italy, but I will refrain from doing that right now.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"We'll move to Alun Davies.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"I'm grateful to you, Kate. Thank you for that introduction. I think many of us have thought similar thoughts to you about non-executive career alternatives, and I can see that from your perspective, and you've clearly been very successful in doing so. But our interest here is about the national museum, of course, and the role of chair. I'm interested in what motivated you, because you've talked about your background in pharmaceuticals and the rest of it, and in healthcare. But what motivated you to apply to be chair of the national museum, because that's a very, very different sector, with very different demands and different expectations?\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Yes. At first sight, I would agree with you. It looks like a pivot\u2014\" said by Kate Eden\n\"There's nothing wrong with that, by the way\u2014it's not a criticism there.\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"I just see it as a natural extension of the work that I've been doing for different organisations over the past seven or eight years. Interestingly, I first applied to be on the board of trustees of the museum back in 2016, and I wasn't successful at that time. As with any professional setback, I think you reflect and you look to understand why that might be. My skill set and my experience wasn't broad or deep enough at the time.Since then, I've followed the development of the museum across its different sites and collections with a great deal of interest, looking at the developments in St Fagan's and the purchase of Melin Teifi. The way in which the <em>amgueddfa </em>has really grasped the widening participation and engagement agenda I think has been absolutely fantastic. So, I've followed its trajectory over the past seven or eight years, and I think my desire and my passion to work with the museum in some sort of form has only deepened and strengthened during that period. And throughout that period, I\u2019ve been able to get a much broader and deeper set of experiences in governance and non-executive working. So, three years ago, I was fortunate enough to be appointed chair of an NHS organisation, and that is a complex organisation, a commissioning organisation with a fairly large budget of around \u00a3800 million, and it relies very much on partnership working and collaboration to do the work that it does and to deliver the priorities that it has. So, I see a great deal of similarity and read-across with the museum in that respect.I was then also fortunate enough, in sad circumstances, to be appointed interim chair of the Arts Council of Wales back in October, and I think that demonstrated to me then at that point that my background in health had given me confidence to chair an NHS organisation, but those transferable skills were equally applicable to an organisation that I don't have a professional background in but have a great deal of amateur enthusiasm and passion for.\" said by Kate Eden\n\"And it's that that is at the heart of my question, really. I don't think there's any question about your professional background and your professional skills. I don't think there's any question about that\u2014the curriculum vitae speaks for itself. But, our interest here is in the role of the museum and the future of the museum. I'm a near neighbour of yours in Blaenau Gwent, and I'm interested as to how the museum can become a reality for the lives of people I represent, because the danger is, sometimes, that these places are seen as very grand places, many miles away, and very exclusive places as well. And my interest is in how we potentially break down barriers, ensure that national collections are safeguarded but also made accessible to people up and down the country, wherever they may live, and the museum, in itself\u2014obviously, you've got to do the business side of things, I accept that\u2014and then the potential of the museum to enrich the lives of people in the country.\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Yes, and those are values that I very much share. I think I was really struck by a recent visit to St Fagans and going into their first-floor visitor centre and how different that feels now, and just what a fantastic and joyous experience it was. I visited the Wal Goch, the Red Wall exhibition, and it felt different, and the people going there felt different. And I think that, to me, said a great deal about the work that the museum's put in over the past few years to attract different audiences to widen that engagement, and I know that's something that they're passionate about doing and replicating across all of those locations. And I think, particularly, the work that I've done through the Arts Council of Wales has allowed me to see the impact of widening engagement and drawing in all of our communities across Wales, and reflecting all of our disparate and myriad histories in the work that cultural and heritage organisations do\u2014the value that that can bring to our communities. So, I completely share the sentiments that you have. And, of course, growing up in north-east Wales, we weren't blessed with a location on our doorstep, particularly not at that time, and so I think the work that the museum is doing to further strengthen partnerships with local museums and with local centres of heritage and culture is absolutely what needs to be focused on for the coming years.\" said by Kate Eden\n\"Okay. Thank you.\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Okay, thank you. We'll move to Llyr Gruffydd.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Thank you. I was going to ask why you felt that you are well suited for this role, and I do still want to pursue that line of questioning. But you've just started talking about some of the experiences that you've had. Just looking at the material that has been prepared, you refer in your application to the fact that you are with the Welsh health specialised services now, and that there's a read-across in terms of seven health boards and the several sites that form Amgueddfa Cymru. You also say,\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"'I was presented with a number of key governance challenges on appointment'.&nbsp;\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Can you expand a little bit on some of those challenges, some of the things that you've&nbsp;had to deal with?\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Yes,<em> wrth gwrs</em>. So, I think, when I was appointed chair to Welsh health specialised services\u2014. Maybe I should say a little bit about it. It's the commissioning organisation. It commissions specialised and tertiary services on behalf of the seven health boards across Wales. So, we do the work once for Wales and commission from a range of different providers, largely for very small patient populations. The board there is an interesting make-up, because I have the WHSSC executives, I have some independent members, but then I also have the seven chief executives of the health boards, so you can imagine it's an environment in which there are many perspectives delivered very robustly. I think, as chairing experience, it has been absolutely second to none; it's been very instructive, it's been very educational, and it's allowed me to develop a chairing style that is very collaborative, that is very inclusive, that is democratic in its decision making, but is absolutely robust and rigorous in the need to make a difference and demonstrate an impact on behalf of the organisations we work for, the health boards and the people of Wales.There were some challenges going into that organisation. We'd had an Audit Wales report on governance arrangements within the organisation, which pointed to a number of areas for improvement, and so that, on appointment, was my immediate priority, to respond to those recommendations and ensure we were an organisation that was absolutely fit for purpose for the challenges of post-COVID recovery that we're still experiencing today.\" said by Kate Eden\n\"But there is a very adversarial culture when you have chief executives around the table and so on, and moving to a situation where you have trustees who aren't paid but who are there, perhaps, because the incentives are different. So, how are you going to handle the different cultures there? Because there is one style, I can imagine, for very challenging meetings with chief executives of health boards, but I would imagine that there'd be a very different style and culture in this context.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Yes. And it's an interesting point, because, certainly, in my six months chairing the Arts Council of Wales as a board of trustees, I have had to flex my style according to the environment. So, in that respect, you're absolutely right. But I think the decisions that we were making in the arts council, and we continue to make, around the investment review, are no less challenging, no less difficult, no less contentious or sensitive and no less encompassing of risk and implication, as those that we take in the Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee. So, in that respect, the importance of the work that we do across those different organisations is absolutely the same. Yes, my chairing style does need to be flexible to take into account the different personalities in the room, and I think what I've learned to do over the years is to navigate those conversations. And, as chair, my role is not to put forward my personal thoughts; it is to draw out the best of the participants that we have around the table, whether those are unpaid trustees or whether they are chief execs in their own right, and I hope that's something that I've demonstrated and I've been able to do over the past couple of years.\" said by Kate Eden\n\"Diolch.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Fine. Thanks. We'll move on to Carolyn Thomas.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Bore da. What are the three main outcomes you'd like to achieve during your tenure?\" said by Carolyn Thomas MS\n\"Thank you. I've been reflecting on this since I completed the questionnaire. I wonder whether I could add and additional element, because I think there are some outcomes that are longer term and then there are some immediate priorities that I think need to be addressed. Because, of course, the <em>amgueddfa </em>has been going through a period of change over the past year, and there will be a new chair, a new chief executive, a new vice-chair all coming in at the same time, and that has been a period of change for the organisation; it will continue to be a period of change whilst those new structures settle in. So, I think my immediate priority, if I am fortunate enough to be appointed, would be to lead that process of change alongside the new chief executive. So, I'll say that first of all.But then I think, looking longer term, and what I'd like to achieve in terms of the tenure, clearly, the museum has set out a really ambitious strategy up to 2030, and it's made some very clear and robust commitments to the work that it wants to do to widen participation, to ensure that all of our communities can engage with the collections, with the locations, and with the buildings in its gift. And so, I think I would want to see some really hard outcomes by the end of my tenure that demonstrate that we have achieved that, or that we are on a strong journey towards achieving that.Secondly, I'm aware that there's been a tailored review ongoing of the museum, and, clearly, that needs to be an immediate priority that I hope we would be able to achieve in less than the time frame of my first tenure. But I haven't seen the recommendations in it yet, so there may be some more longer term elements within that.And then, finally, I think there's a really important role to play around the setting of tone and culture. And I know, through some of the joint working that the arts council has done with the&nbsp;<em>amgueddfa</em>, that there is a really strong culture throughout that organisation. But what I would be really interested in and keen to ensure is that our staff, no matter where they're located across Wales, all feel seen, heard, and their contribution is valued to the work that the museum has done. So, if we can achieve some of those\u2014three of those\u2014things by the end of my first tenure, then I think that will be a powerful legacy to have left.\" said by Kate Eden\n\"Okay. Thank you.\" said by Carolyn Thomas MS\n\"Thank you very much.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"We'll move on to Hefin David.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Diolch. One of the things you said in your response to the questionnaire was that you wanted to work with individuals, and I think you said your first job would be to fully understand the partnerships with individuals and organisations that are already in place, and engage with them to build on them. So, can you just elaborate on that, and tell us what kinds of partnerships and individuals you're thinking of?\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"I think probably the first thing to say in response to that is that the most important stakeholder set of individuals is our own staff, and,with around 600 staff, it's a large and complex organisation, around a number of sites. So, there is a complexity to the set-up of the museum that I wouldn't underestimate. And so, one of my first jobs would be to get out there and be visible in the organisation, across the locations, to meet staff, and to listen to them very carefully, and to understand their experiences of what it feels like to be working in the museum at this time. It's probably one of the most rewarding elements of the jobs that I've been doing over the past few years\u2014getting out to meet staff, whether they're in microbiology labs or in a university, and just really understanding what working life feels like for them on the ground, because I think that taking that into the boardroom is one of the most powerful things that a chair can do. So, I'd start by saying that.Then, in terms of the different partnerships that we have, clearly, the relationship with the Welsh Government is a critical one, and with this committee and with the broader Senedd. But then, there are the broader partnerships that they have with other organisations across the public sector landscape in Wales\u2014so, the delivery partners for the contemporary arts gallery, clearly, and the National Library of Wales, and the arts council, local museums, and other cultural organisations where the collections can be displayed and disseminated. So, I think that's probably for a starter within Wales. Then, clearly, there will be broader relationships across the UK with other museums and organisations, and then the international and global element with organisations outwith the UK.\" said by Kate Eden\n\"One of the things the committee is interested in is international relations, and selling Wales to the world and bringing the world to Wales. So, how do you think the role will enable you to achieve that objective?\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"So, I think the chair's got a really important, external-facing, ambassadorial role to play on behalf of the organisation. And I've seen some of the fantastic work that the museum's already been doing, with FIFA, for example, and some of the cultural missions. So, I would like to see us very much embedded in those cultural diplomatic missions that the Welsh Government have across the world, and I would like to see us as an equal partner in those. The chair, obviously, plays a really important role in that alongside the chief exec, representing the aims and objectives of the organisation. I'd be very, very interested in that aspect of the role.&nbsp;\" said by ", "answer": "Kate Eden"}
{"content": "\"Good afternoon to you all and a very happy new year.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"A happy new year to you all.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"The first item on our agenda this afternoon, in 2023, and in the first meeting, is questions to the First Minister, and the first question in 2023 is from Peter Fox.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"1. What support is the Welsh Government providing to third sector organisations to help them through the cost-of-living crisis? OQ58917\" said by Peter Fox MS\n\"Well, Llywydd, happy new year to you and to everyone else too.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"I thank the Member for that question.&nbsp;Third sector organisations in Wales both provide vital help to others in the cost-of-living crisis and are directly affected by it themselves. We have increased funding to the sector on both counts, most often alongside our local authority partners.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Diolch, Llywydd. And can I wish you, First Minister, and other Members here, a happy new year as well? Recently, a charity contacted me with their concerns about the impact that the cost-of-living crisis is having on their staff. They highlighted that their staff are of course highly skilled and provide a valuable service to people from across Wales. Many of these organisations also provide employment to people who were vulnerable, giving them an opportunity to become fully involved within their community. However, the charity noted that they are simply unable to provide additional financial support to their employees to help them through this difficult period.&nbsp;Despite increased Welsh Government funding, as you just referenced, First Minister, they've used the money to expand services rather than to help improve staff pay and conditions. There are, then, worries about the well-being of staff and their families, as well as staff retention rates, at a time when demand for third sector services are ever increasing. First Minister, I realise that there are numerous demands on Welsh Government resources at this time, but I wondered what discussions you have had with your colleagues and others about ensuring that planning boards fully consider their role in improving conditions for third sector staff when commissioning services. Thank you.\" said by Peter Fox MS\n\"Llywydd, I recognise the dilemma that Peter Fox points to. I want to, as he did, pay tribute to the fantastic work that voluntary organisations and the third sector carry out here in Wales. And it's not a surprise to hear that many of those organisations, where there has been some extra funding available, want to put that into expanding the services that they provide, given the significance of those actions in local communities.And working in the third sector should be properly rewarded; it shouldn't be that people feel because they're working in that sector that they themselves should not receive adequate remuneration. I'll make sure that we raise the point that the Member has made in the different forums that we have. I'm pleased to say, Llywydd, that the Cabinet committee on the cost of living that met every week in the autumn term had representation from the third sector on that committee\u2014the Wales Council for Voluntary Action, the Child Poverty Action Group, Citizens Advice. We heard from them all over that period. So, the third sector has a voice right in the heart of the Welsh Government. But the pressures on the sector are absolutely real. Yesterday's announcement by the UK Government of the reduction in support for the third sector in energy costs will mean that there will be even further dilemmas for the sector to bear, and the Welsh Government cannot be the answer to every dilemma that every part of Welsh society faces.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"First Minister, credit unions have a vital role to play in supporting people in our communities, a role that is of course all the more critical during the cost-of-living crisis. At the last meeting of the cross-party group on co-operatives and mutuals, we had a presentation on how credit unions have come together to develop their Moneyworks Wales scheme, aimed at helping employers to help their staff. I know Welsh Government is doing lots to support credit unions, as highlighted just last week, but how can it make sure that employers are aware of this initiative and encourage them to participate?&nbsp;\" said by Vikki Howells AM\n\"I thank Vikki Howells for that, Llywydd. It was very good last week to have an opportunity there, with three other ministerial colleagues, to highlight the work of the Cardiff and Vale credit union. There were other colleagues, I know, out on the same day drawing attention to the services that credit unions are now able to provide, and we know that, whenever credit unions find themselves in the news, or with additional publicity, then more members come forward to join. The Welsh Government provided support to the sector in the run-up to Christmas to make sure that its services were as well advertised as possible. And early results from that campaign suggest that 7,000 additional members were made for the credit union movement in the run-up to Christmas. So, looking around, Llywydd, I see three other Members who were members of the first-ever employer credit union in Wales, when South Glamorgan County Council established a credit union that worked through payroll deduction. And that's exactly the system that Vikki Howells is pointing to\u2014the Moneyworks Wales campaign is a campaign to encourage employers across Wales to offer payroll deduction facilities to their employees, so that they can join credit unions in that way. I'm pleased to say that, as one of 13 different credit union projects, the Welsh Government will fund Moneyworks from April of this year so that they can go on encouraging as many employers as possible, in as many communities as possible, to make that way of becoming a member of a credit union available to people who work for them.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Good afternoon, First Minister.\" said by Altaf Hussain MS\n\"2. What action is the Welsh Government taking to eliminate multi-year waits for NHS treatment? OQ58907\" said by Altaf Hussain MS\n\"Good afternoon to Dr Hussain. Llywydd, in the six months following publication of the planned care recovery programme, long waits in the Welsh NHS have fallen by 23 per cent. That is the result of significant additional investment, expanded facilities, service reform and, most of all, the enormous effort of NHS staff themselves.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Thank you very much, First Minister. Of course, we all acknowledge the tremendous stress our NHS is currently under, but multi-year waits have been around since well before the pandemic, especially in orthopaedics. One of my constituents has been waiting for a total knee replacement since 2019. He has been waiting in agony for three and a half years, and all the local health board can tell me is that the waiting list is over four years long and that the patient should see his GP to manage the pain. First Minister, do you agree with me that it is totally unacceptable that patients should wait that long, or that secondary care should be placing these additional burdens on an already over-stretched primary care sector? I remember raising similar questions during my first term in the Senedd, and yet, here we are nearly a decade later having the same old discussion about orthopaedics. First Minister, when will Welsh patients finally get the service they deserve?\" said by Altaf Hussain MS\n\"Llywydd, I don't accept the general picture that the Member paints, of this being a condition that has always been a problem in the Welsh NHS. Waiting times in the Welsh NHS had been falling for four and five years in a row up until March of 2019 and beyond. It is the impact of the pandemic that has built up those lengthy waiting lists, in every part of the United Kingdom. As I said in my original answer, long waits, the longest waits in the Welsh NHS, fell by 23 per cent between the end of March and the end of October of last year, and that includes gains in orthopaedics, which is one of the most difficult specialities to see a way of resolving the backlog and increasing activity, because of the impact that COVID continues to have, in the way that operating theatres and other procedures are carried out in the Welsh NHS. Of course we want to see those waits brought down further, and, while people are waiting, I think there is a role for primary care clinicians in helping people to manage their conditions in the best way possible.In Swansea Bay particularly, the Member will be aware that the health board is intending to concentrate planned orthopaedic care in the Neath Port Talbot Hospital, freeing up capacity at Morriston, retaining 10 beds in Morriston for the most complex cases, and, in doing so, to have dedicated beds that will allow even more procedures to be resumed as fast as possible.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"First Minister, do you agree with me that it takes some front for a Conservative to criticise the national health service? One of the issues we've seen over the last decade has been how austerity has ripped the heart out of our public services. Brexit ripped the heart out of our economy. What we need to do to celebrate the seventy-fifth anniversary of Aneurin Bevan establishing the national health service is to provide it with the sort of funds it requires in order to deliver for people today and in the future. That means that you need to be absolutely crystal clear in your next meeting with the Prime Minister: austerity has failed for a decade, it's not going to succeed in the next decade, and if we want to see the national health service succeeding as it has, and as Aneurin Bevan wanted it to do, then we need to invest in it for now and the future.\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"I thank Alun Davies for that question, Llywydd. He reminds us of how fiercely Aneurin Bevan was opposed by the Conservative Party at the time. There never would have been a national health service had that party had its way. Where he is certainly true is this: Llywydd, if you look at satisfaction levels with the national health service, they were at their height in the year 2010, and they've been at their lowest in recent months. Why is that? It's because, in 2010, there had been a decade of investment in our public services. The level of investment in our NHS had reached the level that was available in our European neighbours. A decade of austerity has eroded all of those gains. It lies at the root of the difficulties that we currently face\u2014the difficulties we face with people feeling obliged to go on strike to express their dissatisfaction at the impact that pay held back over a decade has had on their lives, and we see it in the investment that has been available across the United Kingdom to keep that service in good order. I'll certainly make that point when I next see the Prime Minister, but it's a point we make more generally to people across the United Kingdom: this country needs a Government prepared to invest in the NHS and to repair the damage done by the last 12 years.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Questions now from party leaders. The leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew R.T. Davies.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Thank you, Presiding Officer. It is remarkable that the First Minister says that this country needs a Government to invest in the NHS when he and his colleagues voted to cut the NHS budget in 2011 and 2012. The record shows that you're the only politicians in this Chamber who have ever voted to cut the NHS budget, First Minister.&nbsp;The other point of difference to other parts of the United Kingdom that has happened over the last week is you've brought forward a proposal and instructed the NHS to discharge patients without care plans and suitable provision within the community when they're discharged. Doctors and health professionals have said that patients could potentially die or come to serious harm. Do you agree with the doctors and health professionals on their assessment of your plans?\" said by Andrew RT Davies AM\n\"Llywydd, I completely reject the characterisation that the leader of the opposition has made, and he should know better. It is utterly irresponsible of him to misrepresent the advice not of the Welsh Government, but of the Deputy Chief Medical Officer for Wales and the Chief Nursing Officer for Wales. I have their letter in front of me and it does not in any way bear out the accusations that the leader of the opposition has just made. It refers throughout to safe discharge. But, what it does is to say to the system that the system has to attend to the balance of risk across all of those people for whom it seeks to provide care. We have people, as he well knows and often puts to me on the floor of the Senedd, who are struggling to get access to the front door of this system, often people with very significant needs. At the other end of the system, prior to Christmas, we had 1,200 patients in a health service bed in Wales who were medically fit to be discharged. Now, what the letter from the deputy chief medical officer and the Chief Nursing Officer for Wales does is to say to health boards that they have to balance those risks. If there are patients in a hospital bed waiting for tests to be done, they could be safely discharged and called back in when those tests are available. It may be that not every element of a care package is in place, but the care package that is there is safe enough to allow discharge to take place. Instead of a culture of perfection around discharge, and the culture of crisis at the front door of a hospital, the letter seeks to rebalance that and to do it in a clinically responsible way.That was good advice to the health service in Wales; you will find parallel advice being prepared in other parts of the United Kingdom. I support what the chief nursing officer and the deputy chief medical officer have said to the service, and I think it will result in better care for many patients, who otherwise\u2014with very critical needs\u2014find themselves waiting too long to get access to the front door of a hospital.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"First Minister, I'm not misrepresenting anyone's advice. The British Medical Association, the Royal College of General Practitioners, the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, practitioners on the front line, week after week, day after day, last week, were coming out saying that this advice is bad advice, and ultimately it puts patients at harm. That's not me saying it. A quick Google on any of the computers that everyone's on in here today will find that on the news stories that accompanied this particular announcement. If you say it's misrepresenting, why didn't you have the health professionals in before this announcement was made, to give the security and assurance that they would require to back up the advice that your deputy chief medical officer and chief nursing officer put out there last week, rather than rushing out the advice and causing concern, causing worry, and causing distress?\" said by Andrew RT Davies AM\n\"Llywydd, the advice was not rushed out in any way; it was given out on 30 December. The 27 December was the single busiest day in the 75-year history of the Welsh NHS. On that single day, 550 patients were admitted to a bed in the Welsh NHS. Five per cent of the whole of the bed capacity of the NHS used in a single day, and still with ambulances having to wait to discharge patients into A&amp;E departments and people having to wait for treatment when they arrived. The letter responded in a sober and responsible way to that set of circumstances, advising clinicians of how they could safely make arrangements for people who are medically fit to be discharged\u20141,200 people in a hospital bed for whom the health service had already completed everything that the health service was intending to provide to those patients. I simply do not think it can be responsible to characterise that advice in the way that the leader of the opposition has sought to do this afternoon.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"I have merely taken the comments and quotes and observations of health professionals, First Minister. I haven't added any of my own words. As I said, the evidence is there for people to see. You say this evidence wasn't rushed out. Twenty-seventh of December to 30 December, that's 72 hours. A fundamental principle was changed in the discharge process, which was having care plans in place for people who were discharged. What people want to know is, can you give an assurance that when people are discharged there will be that help, that support, and that guidance, so that people don't end up being readmitted because the circumstances that they have been discharged into are not good enough for them to be looked after for the condition they went into hospital originally for? Because otherwise, you will be betraying their confidence in the ability of the health and social care system here in Wales to put them back on the road to recovery and ultimately security in life.\" said by ", "answer": "Andrew RT Davies AM"}
{"content": "\"So, we'll move on to item 3, which is our inquiry into services for care-experienced children: exploring radical reform\u2014evidence session 3. I'd like to welcome and introduce our witnesses who've joined us this morning. We have Sarah Thomas, director, The Fostering Network Wales, Elizabeth Bryan, head of operations, The Fostering Network Wales, Matt Lewis, therapeutic fostering services manager Wales, Action for Children, Rhian Carter, team manager, Action for Children, and Mike Anthony, manager for TACT Cymru. You're all very welcome.Members have a number of questions to put to you this morning. I realise there's lots to say, but if somebody has said something, I'd encourage you not to repeat it because I just want to make sure everybody gets through questions. I'd like to remind Members to perhaps be as brief as possible in their questioning. So, we'll start off with questions from Buffy Williams. Buffy.&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you for joining us this morning. How would you describe the situation of foster placements in Wales? For example, are enough of the right types of placements in the right geographical locations?\" said by Buffy Williams MS\n\"Who wants to start?&nbsp;\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"I'll start.\" said by Sarah Thomas\n\"Thank you, Sarah.&nbsp;\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"I'd say that we do not have enough placements, full stop. We do not have a foster carer for every child who needs them, and they're certainly not living in the location that the child needs them to live in. Some of the barriers that we have to placing children locally is the way that we have a current marketplace, which means that foster carers are free to foster with whom they choose, and that's a very good thing for lots of foster carers, but if we don't utilise and access them in the same way that a local authority can access their foster carers, then we prevent children from being placed within their own locality. The children who are most likely to remain in school, to remain able to attend their clubs and activities and to have a thriving opportunity are the ones who have a foster placement as close to their home location as possible, when it's safe to do so. Local authorities will know all of their foster carers within their LA, and they need to improve, I believe, in the way that they utilise each other and also the systems that are in place to utilise those providers who are external and may have a foster carer right on the front door of where that child needs it, but they can't access it as easily because of the systems and structures we have in place.&nbsp;\" said by Sarah Thomas\n\"Thank you.\" said by Buffy Williams MS\n\"Is there anybody else? Matt.&nbsp;\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"No, we certainly don't echo Sarah's point on that. My view is that we will never have enough suitable families for the number of children because of the framework we're working under, which is actually part of the problem at the moment. So, I think, in terms of radical reform, it's urgently needed of the entire system. Fostering for the foster parents is really complex and challenging. They lack support. They're under a huge amount of scrutiny from the child protection framework and the regulations. So, it is a very difficult place at the moment.&nbsp;The other problem we have is that the poverty, the trauma in our communities, is very serious. The children who come in from the referrals to our service are the worst we've ever seen. Children are routinely not being fed, starved, dehydrated, locked in cupboards, with serious sexual abuse. So, these children need support in their communities to stop the flow-through into care, and the foster families need a different type of recognition and different frameworks for support.\" said by Matt Lewis\n\"I'd also add as well that, in some ways, we've always had that problem, and, ever since I've been in social work and fostering, we've had problems recruiting foster carers. But I think it's even worse now, exacerbated by things post pandemic. The sorts of people that we are looking for, traditionally, are people who've got a spare room\u2014financial, cost-of-living crisis, all those things have come together as well. So, we're actually losing some of the people that we would've traditionally perhaps been able to access as well, so there are additional pressures. And we're also finding single foster carers are struggling within the current climate as well, because it is one of those roles that people have to make a big decision about, whether they can afford to foster, and the climate at the moment is super challenging.\" said by Mike Anthony\n\"Buffy.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you. Can you tell us about the main challenges facing fostering in Wales at the moment, and what are the key priorities to address them?\" said by Buffy Williams MS\n\"Yes, go for it.\" said by Sarah Thomas\n\"The main challenges are that the children are coming in with undiagnosed but very recognisable lifelong conditions such as complex post-traumatic stress, which is created by the birth family members who have terrorised their children and severely hurt the children. They're also severely neglected, and that neglect creates a lifelong learning difficulty. So, the kind of expectations are that these children will develop mental progress if you put them in the right place that's alongside other children, and the fact of the matter is, simply, the outcomes tell us that that's not true. I think of our service\u2014people who've been doing it a long time\u2014and we do everything we can to support the children, but managing their environments and keeping it safe, calm, playful, taking them back to early years experience, and keeping the anxiety at bay is the best chance that we have to help them.We also think much more like an adoptive service than a fostering service. So, success for us is that our children stay with our families for the rest of their lives; they're not encouraged to move out when they're 16, as they currently are. We know that children leaving care at 16 or 18 are likely to have their own children and then begins the cycle again, which leads to more potential removals of children. So, fostering should be viewed as a permanent option. It should be a family like any other. We don't use the word 'placement', because the children get very confused by it. So, there's a huge amount of challenge, but that would be where I would start at the moment\u2014recognising that children need far more support across a life journey than they're currently getting.\" said by Matt Lewis\n\"I think I would add, on that note, really, stability is the greatest challenge that we face for our young people. We are currently unable to ensure that, when we remove them from their family, where we take away the people who were meant to fight for them and protect them\u2014. We do that and then we fail to offer an alternative that is better than that on lots of occasions, because we're unable to create that permanency, to ensure the best possible match, because of the lack of provision that we have within the fostering sector. And then, on top of that, we don't necessarily structure our services in the way that they are driven to meet the needs of the child. At the moment, our services are meeting the needs of those who work within them, or meeting the financial pressures, rather than focusing on\u2014. It feels to me like we've sort of lost track of what good outcomes are and what it is that we're all here to do, and what we're striving to achieve seems to have become slightly diluted in the fact that our services aren't able to do what many of them would like to do.\" said by Sarah Thomas\n\"And I think some of that has been impacted hugely by the social work crisis as well in staffing. We're dealing with many foster placements where the turnover of social workers\u2014. There are massive delays, as Matt was describing, and a complexity of what we're dealing with with the needs of the children, and there's a real inconsistency quite often, or changes in social workers, and some of the teams are running at 30 per cent social work and carrying vacancies or agency staff. One of the good things about being in fostering, as an agency for a long time, as well, is that there's continuity in our fostering teams, but in the social work teams the churn is enormous, and that has massive implications for the services that you get. Delays in therapy: we might have a referral going to therapy, the social worker changes, the team leader changes, and you're knocked back in the work that's going on. So, I think the current crisis in social work is enormous as well.\" said by Mike Anthony\n\"Elizabeth.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Yes, for the child to have an adult who knows them well making a decision for them, I think some of them probably feel that that isn't the case because there hasn't been a consistency for them. And then, when they make their own decisions\u2014. I think we spoke earlier this morning in our event about how they're expected to make a lot of big decisions by themselves when they're 18, but they've not been supported to do that; it's not scaffolded through their life because there isn't that consistency from a trusted adult. I think that's really key.\" said by Elizabeth Bryan\n\"I think it actually does the opposite as well, doesn't it? In some cases, it's actually teaching some of our children and young people not to trust or invest in some of the adults that are working with them. So, it's a by-product of that, which is absolutely the opposite of what we're trying to achieve.\" said by Mike Anthony\n\"We also find there's poor provision. So, a lot of our children struggle in mainstream school, and even the specialist provisions are not fit for what the children need. In terms of the trauma, we find the children just can't cope with an education environment, and they really, really struggle. Family contact is also a huge issue. You're sending a child to see their abuser. So, it often retraumatises the children, and the lead-up to contact and after contact can be horrendous for our children in terms of bed-wetting, soiling. It sends them backwards, really, so they're not able to have that safe time away from their perpetrators.\" said by Rhian Carter\n\"Rhian's right. There are two things that we've identified that break down long-term foster families, and that is the wrong education provision because the children simply do not function at their chronological age in the way that mainstream education thinks they do. So, at 18, the children are much more like four years of age in the emotional developmental stage\u2014they still can't do friendships, can't manage relationships, or money, for example. The other thing is that the children have been highly terrorised and traumatised by birth families, and when we show them the perpetrators of their abuse, our current framework suggests that that's a good thing, but if you look at the underlying neurological, psychological impact on the child, it pulls them back into that abusive system. So, we create on our own\u2014. We've got a clinical issue in terms of the way in which the brain is affected by neurology that isn't recognised by the welfare and the rights-based system that we currently work within.\" said by Matt Lewis\n\"And also life story work. Children often have this piece of work done, often sharing information they never knew about or can't remember, and then they're planting memories and stories into their brains that they just cannot cope with\u2014\" said by Rhian Carter\n\"They can't process it.\" said by Matt Lewis\n\"\u2014and they just can't process.\" said by Rhian Carter\n\"Just one more quick question, Chair\u2014\" said by Buffy Williams MS\n\"Yes, absolutely.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"\u2014maybe to Matt. You spoke about children who have been seriously sexually abused, exploited and terrorised. Is there enough expert care\u2014quality expert care\u2014out there to support these children within the care sector?\" said by Buffy Williams MS\n\"I think, unfortunately\u2014. I've been working in these services a long time\u2014youth justice Merthyr and children with disabilities. There's a kind of myth\u2014a hopeful myth\u2014of recovery; we kind of hope that people will get better. Now, we know, as adults, if any of us have had some difficulty, we're always managing that difficulty. But, what we've got with our children are very, very serious developmental issues and traumatic problems that the system currently doesn't recognise; it's not making connections between them as victims of very serious perpetrators and what that means for lifelong belonging, if that's the only family you're allowed to belong in. I don't think the current system thinks clinically deep enough about the state in which children come out of what are very dangerous family settings. So, the short answer is 'no', unfortunately. There's simply not enough expertise.\" said by Matt Lewis\n\"I think, even when there is the expertise, sometimes you're trying to get to that, and sometimes the waiting lists are so long in child and adolescent mental health services. It's a pretty broken system, I think. That's why sometimes, like in our own lives, we have to sometimes bypass that, and parents will look to get their own services bought in or whatever. I think, with placements, sometimes, we're seeing placements break down, and not just placements break down, but we're seeing foster carers dealing with highly traumatised children, not getting the services the children need, and then we're seeing breakdowns in placements and losing foster carers because it can be such a difficult and impactful experience, managing such traumatised children.\" said by Mike Anthony\n\"Thank you. Thank you, Chair.\" said by Buffy Williams MS\n\"Thanks, Buffy. A question now from James Evans. James.&nbsp;\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"You're never quite sure here who's going to mute you or unmute you, sometimes. I am looking at my other screen, I am Chair, because I can't look at the small screen, my eyes go funny. Thank you.&nbsp;We've heard of the huge disruption and upset that children and young people experience when they have to move from placement to placement, especially at short notice, after the trauma of being removed from their birth family. Statistics do show that more than a quarter of children have had two or more placements in the last 12 months alone. Why are there so many placement moves and, to what extent is this because of a child's own needs, as opposed to it being because the placement is needed for another child coming into the system? I can't see any of you, so you'll have to jump in as and when. Chair, I'll have to hand over to you to bring people in, because I can't see you.&nbsp;\" said by James Evans MS\n\"That's no problem. Who wants to start. Sian? Sarah?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Yes. I think I would say that we don't have enough, so that's one reason, and therefore, as a result of that, we haven't got many robust and well-prepared environments for these children who are hugely traumatised and they end up having to go to placements that may not be very well matched, and matching is a critical factor if we want to achieve permanence and stability. I would say that the data that you just cited there\u2014those two or more placement moves\u2014for many children, if you're placed in an emergency, you will need to go to an emergency environment, and, then, you will need to have somebody who will care plan around your needs and move you on again. And, perhaps if that hasn't worked out, you'll move on again. Some of those moves could be positive. It could be that this could be to a family member that they move to as that third move, but they will come up as a statistic that we look at as negatively.&nbsp;We need to change the way that we collate this data, in order to understand more about whether we are placing children where they achieve permanence and stability, and in a well-matched placement that is aligned to their care and support plan. Because, unfortunately, due to the lack of resources in fostering, children are being placed in residential provision when their care plan\u2014the assessed need\u2014was a fostering family, a family environment that could not be found because of the lack of provision.&nbsp;I'll hand over to others. Everybody will have views on all of your questions.&nbsp;\" said by Sarah Thomas\n\"I'm sure they will.&nbsp;\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Like I said, our service is one that attempts to specialise in permanency for the children. So, the way in which we assess, train and bring people into the service is for a lifelong commitment. That doesn't always necessarily work out, and, I think, actually, some of the children's mental health issues at three, four, five years of age, are very, very significant. So, they're coming in, often very violent, often very resistant to adult care, because of their own experiences in their birth families. In those circumstances, the more support we build around, as part of the team around the child, the better.&nbsp;So, as a service, we go into the schools. We provide art therapy, we provide play support. What we try to build is a holistic view of the child that is systemic and, then, implemented across their care experience. So, if we can do that, we can then make sure that more children can stay more permanently in their family homes. For us, every kind of move is another layer of potential trauma and disruption, which teaches children that they don't belong in family settings, and then, it eventually is to residential care.&nbsp;\" said by Matt Lewis\n\"Anybody else?

{"content": "\"So, we'll move on to the first item on our agenda this morning, which is our inquiry into services for care-experienced children, exploring radical reform. This is our ninth evidence session. I'd like to welcome our witness this morning, which is Jane Shears. Jane is head of professional development, British Association of Social Workers. We're going to have a number of questions this morning. You're very welcome here. We'll start off with a general question, wondering about your views on the biggest challenges facing the workforce in children's services in Wales today, and perhaps you could comment on some of the scale of the changes that you feel are needed.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Okay, thank you. I just wanted to add an extra to my introduction. My substantive post is head of professional development at the British Association of Social Workers, and I want to thank committee members for inviting the British association here today. Since December 2022, I've been providing support to the BASW Cymru team in the absence of the national director, and the national director, following a period of sickness, won't be returning, so that's the capacity in which I'm here today. I also practice as a social worker in England as an approved mental health professional under the Mental Health Act 1983, and a best interest assessor under the Mental Capacity Act 2005. In preparing for evidence today, I've consulted with current practitioners and academics in Wales, alongside reviewing the publications relevant to the key lines of inquiry for the committee. I'd like to apologise for not sending written evidence in advance, but obviously I'll do my best to answer your questions today.One of the key issues that is mentioned across a number of different documents, and by professionals and social workers themselves, is the issue around recruitment and retention, and opportunities for career development. I think, first of all, there is a growing vacancy rate amongst social workers in Wales, and issues around the training of social workers into children and family and child protection posts is something that is a key topic, I think. I think it's helpful and useful to consider a range of different qualifying routes that are available now, including apprenticeship models, but, of course, apprenticeship models do take time, from the inception of people coming onto that programme to becoming qualified social workers.&nbsp;On the other side of that, there are the fast-track programmes in some areas, but, again, that has other issues to consider in terms of preparation for front-line practice. Bringing to front-line practice, I think there is a tendency that there's an expectation that, perhaps, the more newly qualified social workers will gather experience as case holders on the front-line, and that itself brings different challenges about the experience that's required to work when there are quite complex needs with families, systems and children and young people, and children in need and children who are looked after.&nbsp;So, I think one of the things that we could look at is the demographics of the workforce, the retention of the workforce. One of the observations I've made in preparation for today is that there are a number of really fantastic initiatives happening in Wales to support people in perhaps more specialist services, but the consequence of that is that perhaps people with more experience tend towards the positions that are available in those more specialist services, which then maintains and recreates the deployment of perhaps less experienced social workers in the front-line practice as case holders with children, families and young people.&nbsp;\" said by Jane Shears\n\"Thank you. We've got some questions now from Ken Skates.&nbsp;\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thanks, Chair. Thanks so much for attending today. One of the main things that's been raised with us during the course of this inquiry is the huge disruption and the upset that children face when there are frequent changes of social workers. What's your view on why this happens?\" said by Ken Skates AM\n\"So, one of the things that the British Association of Social Workers do annually is a survey of social workers. And some of the findings from the survey suggest that one of the key areas of churn in the workforce is the working conditions that social workers are experiencing.This year, we're just in the process of analysing the results of the 2022 survey, and the key things that have come from that so far are the bullying and harassment that social workers report that they experience in the workplace, and the abuse that social workers experience, both in the workplace, and with people with whom they work. And added to that is the cost-of-living crisis and the extent of poverty experienced by those with whom social workers are working. Seventy-five per cent of social workers in the survey said that people they're working with need more support as a consequence of the cost-of-living crisis. And 75 per cent of social workers said they felt more children would come into care as a result of the poverty and disadvantage that people are experiencing. So, I think there's a dual set of reasons. One is around the experience of social workers and their working conditions, and the other is the increasing level of complexity and need of the experts by experience or service users that social workers are working with.\" said by Jane Shears\n\"What is it with the churn that actually impacts on the young person? Is it the loss of a secure and trusted adult? Is it the anxiety that's caused by finding somebody new and having to retell a story? What are the main factors that impact adversely on young people when they're faced with multiple changes?\" said by Ken Skates AM\n\"From the evidence I've looked at, I think the main issue is the discontinuity. I think there are also some expectations around the role of social workers. Some of the evidence I've looked at suggests that it's not always clear whether the social worker is there in a capacity that brings statutory legislation and children coming in to be looked after, or whether that's more of a supportive friend-type role. I think that's also about expectations of the parents and the families of social workers, not just children themselves. I think the trusted adult, the person in position of trust issue, is something that might well be better explored too.\" said by Jane Shears\n\"Thank you. Just moving on, you've already pointed to the huge number of vacancies that there are in the system. I think the latest report from 2021 shows that there were more than 460 vacancies in social work teams across Wales, and around about 140 vacancies in children's residential care. You've already outlined some of the measures that could be taken. Are there any other things that should be done to address this really serious situation?\" said by Ken Skates AM\n\"One of the initiatives that the British Association of Social Workers is working on currently is looking at supporting overseas-qualified social workers to take up posts. It is actually a live project at the moment, and I'm happy to discuss or share that. In preparing for the committee, it was one of the issues, if you want to a bit more information afterwards. I'm happy to share how we're working around that to support people. &nbsp;\" said by Jane Shears\n\"That would be fantastic. Thank you. That would be wonderful. Thanks very much. Thanks, Chair.\" said by Ken Skates AM\n\"Thank you, Ken. It would be good to have that. And also, when you've analysed the results of the annual survey for this year, we'd obviously very much appreciate seeing that and hearing more so we can look at the comparisons, perhaps, to last year as well.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Yes, absolutely. We'll isolate the responses from the Welsh social workers and compare that with the whole data set.\" said by Jane Shears\n\"Brilliant. Thank you. Questions now from James Evans.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Diolch, Cadeirydd. Thank you very much for coming today. What we're seeing from data is that, since 2018, I think it's 32.4 per cent of staff now are agency staff working within children's services. Do you know why social workers are choosing to work for agencies? Do you understand what impact that's having on children's services department? What are you trying to do to lessen the amount of agency staff within the system?\" said by James Evans MS\n\"I think that's absolutely right; more people are choosing to work on an agency basis or as independent social workers or as locums. Obviously, one of the key drivers is salary, that people will probably earn as much as a third again or double what you can earn in a substantive post in a local authority, for example. I think one of the other things that I've already mentioned is the working conditions, when people are able to choose maybe short-term contracts, which again feeds back into the question around changes in social workers for children. So, those are two of the key drivers: working conditions and pay.\" said by Jane Shears\n\"I suppose with pay it's that vicious circle as well, isn't it, because people are always going to think on their feet if they can get more money, and then local social services departments need those people, so it just goes round and round and round. So, I do understand it's a difficult challenge.\" said by James Evans MS\n\"Another observation is that people will probably have done their first year supported in employment with a local authority. Anecdotally, I think, as far as the British Association of Social Workers membership is concerned, our independent members tended to be more experienced social workers that perhaps were moving into roles around practice education of student social workers. But what we're seeing\u2014and we are doing some more work on this\u2014is a change in the demographics, that perhaps more early-career social workers are choosing to become locum social workers.\" said by Jane Shears\n\"Do you think, when social workers, like you said, do their first couple of years' placements with local authorities, that there should be more, perhaps, strict rules around making social workers stay with those local authorities or within local authorities in Wales so they can't just leave after they've done their training to go and work for an agency?\" said by James Evans MS\n\"I think if people work through the apprenticeship route with the employer then there are contractual arrangements around how long they stay.\" said by Jane Shears\n\"Do you think they should be strengthened? Because people can find a way out of those. I was a councillor; I know people can find their ways out of those things.\" said by James Evans MS\n\"My understanding is that it's not legally binding. So, it might be that it would be under a contractual arrangement between the employer and the person.\" said by Jane Shears\n\"Okay. I'll move on then, Cadeirydd. One thing that we have heard through the inquiry was from social workers and people just the huge case load that social workers have. Do you or does your organisation have any practical solutions of how they can reduce case loads? Is the principle of legislating for maximum case loads for social workers something that's probably worth exploring?\" said by James Evans MS\n\"The issue around case loads is often revisited. I think there have been a number of different ways of trying to work out what would be a reasonably average case load, but it is quite complex in that it's not just a metric issue; it's far more complicated than that when you look at the amount of work that's required for individuals at different times. And obviously, people are dynamic; there's not a steady state of people's distress or their strengths. So, it is quite difficult to make a reasonably average guess at what should be an average case load. I think that extends to adult services as well. We had a recent article in <em>The Guardian</em> that talked about the average number of case loads, talking about between about 12 and 16. One of the things that I will say, which we might be coming on to later, is that if young people are placed in residential care out of area, then the social worker still has the accountability for the young person. And you can imagine, if somebody is placed quite a way out of area, then a visit is a whole day. So, I guess the answer is I don't think there is a case for legislative solutions to average case loads.\" said by Jane Shears\n\"Okay. Thank you.\" said by James Evans MS\n\"Thank you, James. Questions now from Buffy Williams.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair, and thank you for joining us this morning. Turning to social work training, we've heard concerns from front-line practitioners that social work students being accepted onto courses are becoming younger,&nbsp;meaning that, maybe, inexperienced young people are dealing with very complex and distressing cases, which they may not have the maturity and resilience to deal with. What's your view on that, and do you have any information about the age profile of students?\" said by Buffy Williams MS\n\"Sorry, could you just repeat the last part of the question?\" said by Jane Shears\n\"Do you have any information about the age profile of students?\" said by Buffy Williams MS\n\"So, any idea about how old those students are. Are there a lot more younger people in social work at the moment?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"There are certainly more routes to train as social workers than there used to be. I think there are two ways of looking at this. Previously, many years ago, it was unlikely that you would get on a social work course as an undergraduate, but, obviously, that has expanded, so you can start a social work course as an undergraduate. But there are also postgraduate programmes and an apprenticeship scheme, all the different kinds of training that I've mentioned. Usually, on a training course, people will have at least two placements, so there is a lot of placement experience that is integrated within the training programme. If you're in a second year, you do a 70-day placement, and in your third year, you do a 100-day placement. So, there is quite a lot of experiential learning that social work students experience through the course of their training. And then, obviously, there is also the supported year in employment. Obviously, not all social workers go to work for local authorities; around about 40 to 50 per cent work in non-governmental organisations. So, in terms of the support for social workers, There are different initiatives to support social workers, certainly through their training, to get practice experience, and into first-year support in employment, in whichever employment placement that is.\" said by Jane Shears\n\"Thank you. Thinking about the age again of the social work students, do you think that life experience comes into this? Do you think that they\u2014? How can I say this? I know you've just touched on it, but do you think the younger they are, the less likely they are to be able to cope with more challenging case loads and cases that are put before them?\" said by Buffy Williams MS\n\"Like us all around the table, we're not a homogenous group of social workers and we will all have different experiences. One of the strengths could be to think about an apprenticeship model from school through to supporting people into a social work qualification, particularly for, perhaps, Welsh-speaking school students who want to then move into that kind of work. But it's about a different kind of support process, through from secondary schooling into training as a social worker. That might be through an apprenticeship model or it might be through vocational qualifications into a graduate programme. I think it's about trying to be creative and thinking about how we support people with different experiences into social work training. There is another group\u2014I don't know whether the committee have engaged with it at all\u2014which is the Association of Care Experienced Social Care Workers. It may be that that would be a good question for that group. Because, obviously, people who are care experienced who then become social workers have that experience of being in both roles.\" said by Jane Shears\n\"That's really helpful. Can I just ask quickly as a follow-up from what Buffy was saying, just around the support that young social workers are getting from social workers that have been in the profession for a lot longer, just making sure that they're passing on their expertise over years, how is that expertise shared with younger social worker when they're actually in the job, as well?&nbsp;\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"When people are student social workers, they'll have an experienced practice educator, and that is somebody who will be experienced and be able to support the student through their placement. So, that's one area. The second area is that all social workers have supervision. It's a strong and important element of practice, and that will be either with somebody in their team or a more experienced social worker\u2014it might be the team manager, or a principal social worker, or a senior practitioner. That is how people have that level of supervision around their case load.&nbsp;I think one of the issues that was raised when people were not office-based through the pandemic was that there was a lack of that informal learning from more experienced practitioners in the room, listening to phone calls, having an informal chat. That kind of interaction with more senior staff, I think, was something that was absent, and, obviously, with some social workers returning to office-based practice, that can be something that can be re-established.&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Jane Shears\n\"Brilliant, thank you.

{"content": "\"We will move on to item 2 on our agenda today, which is scrutiny of the Welsh Government's draft budget for 2023-24, and our first evidence session with the Welsh Local Government Association. So, let me welcome our witnesses, then: Councillor Andrew Morgan, leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council and leader of the Welsh Local Government Association; Anthony Hunt, leader of Torfaen County Borough Council; Councillor Llinos Medi, leader of Anglesey county council; Christina Harrhy, chief executive of Caerphilly County Borough Council; and Chris Llewelyn, chief executive of the Welsh Local Government Association. So, croeso, welcome to you all.Perhaps I might begin, then, with some general questions by way of an overview, and firstly, then, for the Welsh Local Government Association to provide a brief overview of the current financial situation facing local authorities in Wales. Andrew, I guess that's you.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. If I can just start, and perhaps I'll hand over to my colleagues. I think it's fair to say that the pressure this financial year and going into the next financial year is on a scale that, certainly in my time of being a councillor, which is since 2004, we've not faced. In terms of double-digit inflation, it's bad enough, but there obviously is the pressure on the pay award, which is agreed across England and Wales, which is considerable this year, but not least as well in terms of energy costs and supply chain costs. If you consider food costs for things like school meals, our care home services and meals on wheels, food costs have gone up anything between 14 and 25 per cent. Our gas and energy costs are predicted for this financial year for local authorities in Wales to go up around 355 per cent for gas, and well over 100 per cent for electric. So, there are some real pressures on local authorities. I know every year we talk about the pressures on local government, whether it's service demand such as social services in particular, but this year I think it is quite exceptional.Local government is facing a significant overspend this year\u2014in excess of \u00a3200 million is the figure that we have collated between the 22 authorities. I think it's fair to say that since devolution, local government has never overspent \u00a3200 million in a single financial year. My own authority is set to overspend by around \u00a320 million this year, so we'll be using reserves, and most local authorities are looking to use reserves. And next year, even though we are having a very good settlement from&nbsp;the Welsh Government, and we are grateful for the additional funding that's been passported on, there is going to be significant pressure on local authorities to set a balanced budget. Thank you.&nbsp;\" said by Andrew Morgan\n\"Thank you very much, Andrew. Any other of our witnesses? Anthony.&nbsp;\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. The pressures are substantial. We estimate \u00a3784 million cumulatively to the end of the next financial year. Just in social care, for example, it's \u00a395.2 million of pressures, \u00a332 million from children's residential placements, adult residential placements \u00a312 million, adult domiciliary care \u00a37.5 million. Just to use my own authority as an example, our energy costs are estimated to rise by \u00a34 million, our social care costs by \u00a34 million, and our pay bill by just over \u00a37 million. Those are real pressures that can't just be managed away easily.&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Anthony Hunt\n\"Would any other of our witnesses like to add anything to what Andrew or Anthony have said? Llinos.&nbsp;\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"I think in addition to the cost pressures and inflation is the service demand as well that we're seeing a massive increase in, due to the cost-of-living crisis. So, it's a perfect storm of the demand on services and the cost of delivering the services at the same time.&nbsp;\" said by Llinos Medi\n\"Yes. Diolch yn fawr. In terms of the experience during the pandemic, where, obviously, local authorities again were under tremendous pressure, how would you compare the current situation with the situation at that time? Who would like to offer a view on that? Christina.&nbsp;\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"I think that the big difference here is that throughout COVID the Welsh Government helpfully provided us with some short-term funding. And as Llinos has already mentioned, as we're coming out of COVID, there's increased demand, but it's not only increased demand, it's increased complexity of demand. And then when you couple that with the depleted workforce\u2014. Because one of the things that has happened post COVID is that, for a number of reasons, a lot of public servants have decided to leave public service. Coupled with the reduced funding that we are facing, the increased demand and complexity, and a depleted workforce and difficulty in recruiting and retention, I think it's essentially a perfect storm. Thank you.&nbsp;\" said by Christina Harrhy\n\"Thank you very much, Christina. Llinos.&nbsp;\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"I will be speaking in Welsh; I didn't use the interpretation earlier. It's also important that we note that during COVID, normal services had a period where they weren't necessarily being provided, so we were focused on the COVID crisis. Now, we have a cost-of-living crisis on top of all the other crises hitting society, as well as the financial crisis that we as an authority are facing. But planning expectations continue, and public protection and all the other requirements placed upon us as an authority remain, and we can't cope with all of these crises as well as business as usual and public expectation on local authorities. And much of that, of course, is statutory, for example planning and so on. So, the pressure now is more intense because of that.&nbsp;\" said by Llinos Medi\n\"Diolch yn fawr, Llinos. Andrew, did you want to come in as well?\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Yes, just to add to and support what Christina Harrhy said. Obviously, during the pandemic, we did receive extraordinary amounts of funding, both to support communities and to support services, and certainly end-of-year funding as well, which has obviously helped our balances, carrying forward to this year, which has now helped us in terms of overspends. But the difficulty is of course that that was an exceptional amount of funding, and one-off funding, to deal with the short-term problem. In effect, the pandemic was a short-term hit for things like income, which has largely recovered in lots of areas, though there are some legacy issues there. But going forward now, general revenue, in terms of our revenue budget, is under massive pressure from four key drivers\u2014the inflation, the energy costs, the service demand, and pay pressures. All of them are almost like a perfect storm for public services across the board, and local authorities are no different.\" said by Andrew Morgan\n\"Thank you very much for that. Obviously, the potential impact on services is something that all of us will be very concerned about. Is there anything in particular you would like to say in terms of that potential impact? Is there anything that you'd like to highlight? Andrew.&nbsp;\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Every local authority will have to address this, obviously, as part of their budget-setting round and the various consultations they're doing. But even though we've had a relatively good settlement, it has to be said\u2014the average figure is much more positive than was anticipated, with consequentials being passed on\u2014there is a range from the low end, such as authorities like myself and Merthyr, to, I think, Monmouthshire, which is at the higher end this year, and Cardiff. So, there is obviously fluctuation in the formula, but the formula is there because it is driven by demand, such as population, school numbers, and various other drivers, which impact on that.But turning back to individual councils setting their budgets, there's no getting away from the fact that there will be some tough decisions. There is a balance to be struck between council tax increases at a significant rate, making savings where possible without impacting on services, but, undoubtedly, there will be other cuts to services, or service changes that, I think I'm fair in saying, all 22 local authorities will have to consider to a certain extent. That may be changing things like bin services, it could be cutting or closing some sports facilities; there is a whole raft of things that local authorities are considering, but it is obviously down to those individual authorities to make those tough decisions.\" said by Andrew Morgan\n\"Yes. Okay. Llinos.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"I know that you're already aware of this, so I don't want to be\u2014. But this is us making cuts to services that have previously been cut, so the options are very few and far between. And when we've been able to maintain some semblance of service in some areas, it may mean that may have to disappear, and clearly that's a real cause of concern. So it's important to note that we weren't in an ideal starting point. I sometimes fear that we forget about the decades of cuts that we've undertaken already.\" said by Llinos Medi\n\"Yes. Anthony.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"I just wanted to come back to the point that Christina made about workforce\u2014that's a very important one, looking to the medium term. This isn't just a cash issue, this is an issue with more and more people deciding to walk away from public services. They've seen their pay depleted by 20 per cent over the past decade, they're expected to continually do more with less, with fewer staff, and I really feel that we're staring in the face of a recruitment crisis within some key public services. We're seeing it in social care, in domiciliary care, and we're seeing it actually in more areas than I've ever seen before, where we're really struggling to recruit to key posts. And after all, public services are the sum total of the people who work in them, so I think that's an issue that we have to look into as well.\" said by Anthony Hunt\n\"Thanks for that. We will come on to these matters in a little more detail later on. Before I bring in other committee members, could I just ask one further question? I think it was Llinos who mentioned that demand is obviously significant, and so have others of you. We hear reports that Welsh Government, in response to the pressures that hospitals face, and emergency services face, will be encouraging discharges from hospital perhaps without care packages being fully in place at that stage. Is there anything that you'd like to say about that in terms of the potential pressure on local authority services? Andrew.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Yes. I think we've got to put into context that, first of all, we certainly wouldn't support anybody being discharged from hospital into our care, or home, without a care package, if we felt that they were at risk. And I have to say, in fairness, the local authorities and the health boards work together all the time on discharged patients, and we have to risk assess all the time around that\u2014whether somebody can come home, for example, before adaptations are put in, before handrails, et cetera, where they may not need a care package, they may just simply need some additional adaptations to their home. So, it is all about the risk assessing, but I think I'm right in saying, as all council leaders, we certainly would not support any discharge of patients who we thought would be at risk of harm if they did need a care package.But just to say, local authorities, I have to say, are really bending over backwards to support the health service. Our staff are under more pressure now, I would suggest, than at any time, even during the pandemic. We've got staff who are working back-to-back shifts, who are working overtime, because there is a real crisis in social care. And I have to say that, while we do hear health boards across England and Wales declare critical incidents and stand up their emergency plans, I would have to say that, probably all 22 local authorities, if we declared a critical incident every time our social services were under pressure, we wouldn't have been out of a critical incident for the last three years. So, I do think that, as local authorities, we are under intense pressure, and I welcome the fact that the Welsh Government has recognised that social services have to be funded alongside the health service. There is no point funding the health service unless social services get funding, because they have to work hand in hand. And I have to say, the pandemic has probably driven social care and NHS closer now than at any time previously, but we can carry on improving that relationship. And it is about working smarter and doing things better, but unfortunately, a lot of it does come down to funding. If we are to recruit and retain staff in social care, that means that it has to be funded.\" said by Andrew Morgan\n\"Okay, Andrew. Thank you very much. I think Chris Llewelyn has a hand raised. Chris.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Yes. Thanks, Chair. Just to emphasise how closely local authorities work locally with their health boards, but also at a national level as well. There's incredibly close working between local government, the Welsh Government and the NHS. The leaders present this morning meet fortnightly with the Minister for Health and Social Services and the Deputy Minister for Social Services, so these are issues that authorities take very seriously. But, as has been highlighted already, there are massive workforce challenges for local authorities when it comes to social care and domiciliary care. There are workforce challenges across every aspect of local government service. Costs are increasing, demand is increasing, but in social care in particular, the legacy of long-term austerity, of long-term underfunding in social care is being felt at the moment. And in effect what happens is that the private and other sectors are able to respond in terms of pay pressures relatively quickly; local government and the public sector find it far more difficult to respond. As a consequence, the supply of domiciliary care staff and other social care and community care staff is incredibly difficult, and I don't think anybody should underestimate the challenges that local authorities face within the sector.\" said by Dr Chris Llewelyn\n\"Okay, Chris. Thanks very much. Christina.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"This is also\u2014. Whilst it's about the local authorities in this space, in terms of provision of social care, we are heavily reliant upon the independent sector as well, and that independent sector is fragmented. And again, it's back to affordability. Just within my own local authority at this moment in time, our independent sector are asking for a 20 per cent increase, and we are only able to provide 10 per cent, because of our own financial situation. And the independent sector are not being unreasonable for the reasons that we've already articulated to you; they are facing them as well. But, if we are unable to bridge that gap financially, again that's going to make that sector even more fragmented and delve us deeper into the problems that we are already facing.I think, just coming back to domiciliary care and the packages of care question that you asked: the focus at the moment is very much on discharging people from hospital. But what is being missed is that 80 per cent of our demand is in the communities, and we are not able to meet the need within our communities at this moment in time, because the focus is on discharge from hospitals.&nbsp;And without us being able to meet that need within the community, there is more demand that is actually going to hit the front door of A&amp;E in our hospitals. So, it's that vicious circle that we are trying to address at this moment in time. And we are working with health colleagues, because what we need to focus on is reducing the demand and the flow that's coming into the front door of our hospitals, as well as dealing with the back end of the system. Thank you.&nbsp;\" said by Christina Harrhy\n\"Thank you very much. Okay, we'll move on, then, to committee members, and firstly, Sam Rowlands. Sam.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Thank you, Chair, and good morning, everybody. I appreciate your time on this Thursday morning, especially this time of year when it's really busy for you. Just in terms of the AEF\u2014the aggregate external finance\u2014we've seen, as mentioned, the increase in the provisional settlement at 7.9 per cent, and, I think, Andrew, you mentioned earlier that it was probably a little bit better than where conversations probably started at, I guess, a few months ago.I suppose you've probably commented on my initial question, which was around your assessment of the settlement, but I was wondering now how you're able to plan in the medium term, how you're finding that process, because I guess you are having to deal with such difficult challenges right in front of you today. How are you finding the ability to plan beyond even the next financial year, looking three, five years down the line, in light of the provisional settlement and some of the multi-year indications that you've had as well?\" said by ", "answer": "Sam Rowlands MS"}
{"content": "\"Good afternoon and welcome to today's Plenary meeting. The first item today is questions to the First Minister. Question 1, Mike Hedges.&nbsp;\" said by Y Dirprwy Lywydd / The Deputy Presiding Officer\n\"1. What action is the Welsh Government taking to reduce river pollution? OQ59418\" said by Mike Hedges AM\n\"I thank Mike Hedges, Dirprwy Lywydd, for that question. With ministerial colleagues, I have chaired two summits, bringing together all those bodies and organisations with a responsibility to reduce river pollution. The agreed action plan commits all participants to accelerate the practical measures that each can take to tackle pollution in our waterways\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"I thank the First Minister for that response. River pollution is a problem across Wales, but I only want to talk about the River Tawe. We have raw sewerage discharge, agricultural pollution and microplastics. Some suggestions: has the Welsh Government considered taking action to stop water run-off mixing with sewerage? Things I belive that could help include the planting of trees and bushes, making it a planning condition on new developments that impervious coverings are not allowed, except for a driveway with limited width, to have greater control over the use of fertiliser on farmland, and to completely ban microplastic use in commonly used materials such as cosmetics.\" said by Mike Hedges AM\n\"Well, Dirprwy Lywydd, I thank Mike Hedges for his unfailingly constructive suggestions as to how we might tackle the scourge of river pollution. A number of the points that he has mentioned I think we have embarked upon already. As far as separating water run-off from sewerage, then the future of sustainable drainage systems, I think, is fundamental to making sure that, for all new building developments, we can relieve pressure on the network, redirecting and slowing down the speed at which surface water enters the sewer system.The Member made a number of points about agricultural pollution. Of course, we are committed to making sure that we have greater use control over fertilisers on farmland, and the sustainable farming scheme will contribute to a number of other points that Mike Hedges made. It will offer support to those farmers who choose to take it, to tree plant, particularly along river banks, but also more generally. And as for the point that the Member makes about making the planning condition on new developments, the Minister for Climate Change has undertaken to write to all local authorities, reminding them of the enforcement powers they already have in this regard. There are restrictions on paving over front gardens, for parking or any other purpose, without planning permission. And Mike Hedges is quite right to point to the fact that the way in which, increasingly in urban areas, people have turned what were previously gardens into hard standing and parking, means that there is increased run-off into sewers, adding to the risk of flooding and impacting on water quality. So, I hope the Member can see from that that a range of the suggestions that he has made are being taken forward already, and there are other ideas that he has suggested this afternoon that we will be able to explore and see if they can add to that overall cross-Government effort.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"It's clear, at the moment, that you're getting your action plan together. It is fair to say the UK Conservative Government now has a clear plan for reducing river pollution. By 2035\u2014yes, they're well ahead of the game\u2014water companies will have to improve all storm overflows discharging into or near every designated bathing water, and they will have to improve 75 per cent of overflows discharged into high-priority nature sites. By 2050, this will apply to all remaining storm overflows covered by our targets regardless of location. Wales has six out of the 20 most polluted rivers in the UK, and I am sure that you will agree that 600,000 hours of dumping into our waterways and our Welsh rivers is completely unacceptable.&nbsp;So, First Minister, would you agree with me and back the stance of the UK Conservative Government\u2014the stance they've taken to address this issue\u2014by holding water companies to account, and, if so, when are you going to do the same here in Wales?\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"Well, Dirprwy Lywydd, I don't think this is an area in which there is competition between the different nations of the United Kingdom. I believe that we need to reduce river pollution in Wales, and I'm quite sure that the UK Government takes action in England to do the same thing. It is a shared ambition, particularly with rivers that cross the border, where only combined action can have the impact that we wish. Many of the things that the Member has mentioned are happening in Wales. By 2030, D\u0175r Cymru will have reduced their phosphorous pollution loading on our key areas by 90 per cent, and will have reduced it by 100 per cent by 2035. Of course, there is a great deal more that needs to be done. I agree with what the Member said that sewage dumping into rivers is not an acceptable practice, and that the industry has to invest more, and more quickly, to make sure that it tackles that. I believe that, in D\u0175r Cymru, we have a company in Wales, a not-for-profit company, that is able to invest in the Welsh infrastructure without profit taking elsewhere. I think we're fortunate to have a company structured in that way and, I think, with a genuine commitment to playing its part in reducing river pollution.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Good afternoon, First Minister. I live in Hay-on-Wye. The River Wye is the second most polluted river in Wales, after the River Usk, and the River Tawe is the third most polluted river in Wales. Many of us get our postbags filled with people writing to us about the state of our rivers. And I realise it's not a political point, but I am really disappointed that, once again, Conservative MPs voted against taking a tougher stance against sewage dumping by our water companies, something that would have helped us across the UK. I also would take issue in Wales here on D\u0175r Cymru. D\u0175r Cymru executives get paid quite a lot of money\u2014I think \u00a3600,000 was the last payment to a chief executive of D\u0175r Cymru. This is at a time when Wales's water bills are the second highest across the country. May I ask you, in terms of river sewage, First Minister, whether you would support measures to make sewage dumping illegal?\" said by Jane Dodds MS\n\"Well, Dirprwy Lywydd, of course the Member is right in her simple factual point about the way Conservative MPs voted on this issue. If sewage dumping were to be made illegal, then the question would arise as to what happens when storm overflows inevitably cause pressure on the system. And while I'm completely with the Member in wanting to see all of that addressed seriously and quickly, it is simply the fact that combined sewage overflows operate in a way that means that sewage doesn't come through the floors of private businesses and private homes. So, if you banned it tomorrow, you would simply displace the problem and make the problem, I think, even less acceptable to Welsh citizens. The truth of the matter is, Dirprwy Lywydd, that this is a complex issue, where you can only make a difference by gathering together all the different contributions from those who have a part to play. That's why our action plan has buy-in from the Welsh Government, of course, but the regulators, the developers, the farming unions, the water companies, and we will need to see it from communities themselves. In the case of the River Wye, 72 per cent of pollution in the River Wye comes from agricultural sources. So, while I agree that D\u0175r Cymru must play its part, and do it effectively, unless you're prepared to tackle the other sources of river pollution, then you won't make the difference that Jane Dodds and I would like to see.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"2. Will the First Minister make a statement on train services that run from Bangor along the north Wales coast railway? OQ59456\" said by Si\u00e2n Gwenllian AM\n\"I thank Si\u00e2n Gwenllian. Dirprwy Lywydd, many of the mainline services across north Wales are a UK Government responsibility, and they are delivered by Avanti West Coast. Poor performance and inadequate service levels on this essential route has placed additional pressure on regional services run by Transport for Wales and delivered an unacceptable experience for passengers across north Wales.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Thank you very much. And I agree with that analysis. But, in Bangor, we have one of the busiest stations in the north of Wales, and there are plans afoot to improve the facilities there. But the most far-reaching improvement that could happen for the benefit of rail users in Arfon and beyond is electrification of the north Wales coast line. Some of the funding that is due to Wales as a result of HS2 in England would be able to be used for that electrification. But, as well as investment, we need to have the powers over rail infrastructure and bring those powers here to the Senedd. Will you make the strong case for the devolution of rail infrastructure to the Government, and make that case robustly to the UK Government, and to your own party, indeed?&nbsp;\" said by Si\u00e2n Gwenllian AM\n\"I thank Si\u00e2n Gwenllian for those supplementaries, Dirprwy Lywydd. And I do agree that we need the full powers over railways, as well as the investment to go along with those powers. We have some powers already, and we have used those powers, as people can see, in the investment into rail lines in the Valleys and in Cardiff. If we could have full powers, then we could do a more comprehensive job of work in order to make things better here in Wales. But, to do that, the powers without the investment simply couldn't work, and that's why Si\u00e2n Gwenllian's points are important for us here in Wales.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Bangor station is already an important hub for university students and, now, with Welsh Government investing in a medical school, a dental academy and the National Slate Museum in its programme for government, Bangor station has significantly grown in importance. Do you share my disappointment to see that there will be just five services a day now between north Wales and London from May 2023, with no plans from the UK Government to restore the pre-COVID level of service? By awarding a six-month contract to Avanti, they are delaying a much needed reconsideration of the service provided, and such a short-term offer will not incentivise Avanti to improve the service or resolve any other outstanding issues. So, I am just concerned that this is another kick in the teeth for the people of north Wales and for trying to grow the economy there, and to get people to Bangor.&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Carolyn Thomas MS\n\"Dirpwy Lywydd, I thank Carolyn Thomas for that. She makes a very important point. The decision of Avanti West Coast to reduce services between north Wales and London was made without any prior notification to the Welsh Government or to Transport for Wales, despite the very obvious knock-on effect onto those local train services. Not only did it arbitrarily reduce those services, but, clearly, that was good enough for the UK Government, because, despite that, they've gone ahead and awarded a six-month contract extension to Avanti West Coast. Now, I am told that Avanti is committed to improving that service. I am glad to see that the new chief executive of Avanti West Coast has offered a meeting with our transport Minister to set out the actions they are taking, but the truth of the matter is, Dirprwy Lywydd, that the problems on the railway are more basic than any single franchise. The way in which rail services are designed and delivered across the United Kingdom simply does not meet the needs of the travelling public. In order to have a more fundamental review, you need what Si\u00e2n Gwenllian said in her original question\u2014you need the powers transferred to Wales and the investment to go alongside it, and then, in the way that we have taken those parts of the railway that are under our control back under public control, we will be able to do that and make a much better job of rail services in Wales.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"My colleague Si\u00e2n Gwenllian is absolutely right to raise concerns again about the train services in north Wales. And I must say, First Minister, you have a refreshingly honest Deputy Minister for transport who clearly has concerns about the state of the Labour-run rail service here in Wales as well. He was recently quoted as saying that Transport for Wales could be 'awful' and has been 'pretty bleak for a while'. Do you agree with him, First Minister?\" said by Sam Rowlands MS\n\"What I agree was the point that the Minister was actually making, because he was pointing to the decision of the UK Government to set out a future for rail services in Wales that can only be one of managed decline. That is the policy of your party and the Government that you support. That is why they have agreed the next period of investment for Network Rail that has Wales at the very foot of the league table. Every other region but one has better investment over the next period than is going to be offered in Wales, despite the fact that investment in the Welsh rail service has been dismal over the whole 13 years in which your Government has been in charge. That was the point the Deputy Minister was making, and it\u2019s one I think any person who takes an objective look at the facts of rail investment in Wales would endorse.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"We move on now to questions from party leaders, and, first of all, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew R.T. Davies.&nbsp;\" said by Y Dirprwy Lywydd / The Deputy Presiding Officer\n\"Thank you, Presiding Officer. Last week, First Minister, the COVID-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru issued a damning statement, in fairness, assessing the engagement so far the Welsh Government has had with the UK-wide COVID inquiry. Now, from these benches, we have time and time again said that there should be a Wales-wide independent inquiry; regrettably, the Labour benches have voted that proposal down, so we do rely on, obviously, the Welsh Government engaging with the UK inquiry to make sure that all the facts are presented and can be understood by that inquiry. Can you give us an update on how the Welsh Government is engaging with the COVID inquiry at a UK level? And are you as concerned as I am with the judgment that the COVID bereaved families have around non-disclosure and the timeliness of the evidence that the Welsh Government is submitting to the inquiry?\" said by Andrew RT Davies AM\n\"Llywydd, the Welsh Government engages fully with the UK inquiry. We are in receipt of numerous rule 9 requests to Ministers and to senior officials, and those multiple rule 9 requests are being complied with. The counsel to the inquiry said at the hearing that the Welsh Government had complied with all of those requests. They had asked for some further exhibits, as they are called\u2014supporting documents\u2014to go alongside the statements that had been submitted on time. Those further documents have now been submitted. It is part of thousands and thousands of documents that the Welsh Government has now provided to the inquiry.On the point that the bereaved families made about non-disclosure of witness statements to them, that is absolutely not a matter for the Welsh Government at all. Once the statements are in the hands of the inquiry, it is a decision for the independent inquiry to make as to when those statements are submitted to other core participants. The Welsh Government has no say in that at all, nor should we. So, the bereaved families may have a concern about it, but it is not a concern that can be laid at the door of the Welsh Government.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"So, for clarity, First Minister, the documentation that has been requested from the inquiry and the paperwork and other evidence that is required has been submitted on time, and actually the blame for non-disclosure is with the inquiry rather than the Welsh Government\u2014or are there genuine examples where all the information has not been sent over from the Welsh Government and this has caused, obviously, the inquiry not to release the information because they\u2019re only in possession of partial information? Because it is an important point to understand as to exactly why this information isn\u2019t coming forward to the COVID bereaved families, who have core participation status in the inquiry, and the module 1 is due to start only in seven weeks\u2019 time. They need that evidence to obviously be able to be in a position to present their case.\" said by ", "answer": "Andrew RT Davies AM"}
{"content": "\"Then we will move on to item 2, which is scrutiny of the Welsh Government's draft budget for 2023-24, and our third evidence session, with the Minister for Climate Change, Julie James. Welcome, Minister, and welcome to your officials, Emma Williams, the director for housing and regeneration, and Dean Medcraft, director of finance and operations. Okay, Minister, we'd better move swiftly on. Let me begin, then, with a general question: to what extent has the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 shaped the budget allocations within the climate change portfolio, and how has the Government's commitment to that Act been balanced with the need to address present-day cost-of-living and other pressures?\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. There's no doubt at all that we're facing one of the most difficult and challenging budget settlements in Wales that we've ever faced as a result of choices made elsewhere. Inflation has also eroded our budget to worryingly low levels, and local authorities and NHS organisations are reporting significant shortfalls in funding as a result of the inflationary increases, the pay pressures, and, of course, the rising energy costs. So, there's no getting away from the fact that this has required us to make really, really difficult choices, and the UK Government has just failed to address the significant funding gap that should have uplifted our budgets in line with inflation in order to maintain the vital public services that we all rely on. So, the reality is that we could not meet all the pressures identified to support cost-of-living interventions within the funding available.But, despite that, we always maintain our approach rooted in the well-being of future generations Act, so we've undertaken to maximise the impact of the available resources that we do have, balancing our short-term needs with the ongoing cost-of-living crisis and trying to make the longer term change and delivery that we want for our programme for government ambitions, including tackling poverty. This has resulted in the Government, across the Government, undertaking an exercise to review all of our budgets and prioritise our support where it was needed most, building on the actions that we already outlined as part of the spending review last year. I'm sure that the Chair is aware that the budget round this year has been supported by the work of the cost-of-living Cabinet sub-committee, which I'm a core member of.The result of that was that we put additional allocations into the discretionary assistance fund, homelessness services and the pupil development grant\u2014[<em>Interruption.</em>] Excuse me, Chair. The cost-of-living crisis and its impact on household budgets means that many people have been unable to pay their rent or other household bills, and, for my portfolio, the risk of them falling into rent arrears and subsequently facing eviction is a real, real concern. We do not want to push individuals towards seeking homelessness support from the local authority; we want them to go into homelessness prevention support, and we want to try to keep people in their homes where at all possible. I'm sure, Chair, that you'll remember from previous sessions with me, and I'm sure you've had evidence from elsewhere, that we continue to have very high levels of presentations for homelessness services right across Wales. So, I'm pleased to say that we have managed to find an additional allocation of \u00a310 million to put into the homelessness budget and to maintain our 'no-one left out' approach to be sure that no-one is forced to sleep rough. The additional funding is going to go into homelessness prevention measures, including where it cannot be prevented to meet the costs of temporary accommodation.I'm sure that the committee is also aware that we've had absolutely no funding commitment from the UK Government for the Homes for Ukraine scheme. We funded our supersponsor scheme, including accommodation and wraparound support using funding from Welsh Government reserves, and we continue to support people arriving from Ukraine. We've committed a further \u00a340 million to ensure that people fleeing the war continue to have a place of safety and sanctuary in Wales. We've committed \u00a320 million to supporting our Ukrainian humanitarian response as well, and that's to ensure that our really hard-pressed local authorities are able to continue offering the services that we've put in place.And then, Chair, I think what I really want the committee to understand is that, obviously, the part that you're looking at from my budget is part of a much bigger MEG, as we call it\u2014the main expenditure group. And so, we've had to look across right across the MEG to balance out how to get through the pain of this budget, and that's the word that has to be used. It's been a really, really, really difficult thing to do, and we've had to look at an enormous number of things that are essential to be able to push our progressive plans forward.So, we continue to outline a vision and our short and medium-term plans, including preventative plans, to push forward the reform. So, we continue, for example, to resource putting our homelessness legislation onto the statute book; we continue to look at embedding the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 ways of working across the piece, including transparency and impact reform; we also continue to try to maintain the longer term strategies that we have for things like decarbonisation, for retrofit, and so on, balanced with the real sharp-point crisis that we've been facing and trying to move the money around, so that we're both helping people in the here and now, but also not making it worse for people later on because we've moved that money around. There's no getting away from the fact that it's been a real, real challenge to do so, and, as I say, we've had to look right across the whole expenditure group to do that, and the money has been moved accordingly in an attempt to do that. I'll leave it there. I'm sure that you'll get into some of the specifics, but I want the committee to fully understand the sheer scale of the budget process that we've been going through in order to try and squeeze some of this cost-of-living money out of the budget.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Okay, Minister. Thank you very much for that overview and, as you say, we'll be coming on to many of those matters with subsequent questions. Firstly, Mabon ap Gwynfor. Mabon.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. Good morning, Minister and members of your office. May I apologise that I can't be there in person? I have personal reasons that mean that I am stuck here in north Wales at the moment. Minister, you mentioned in your opening statement about homelessness. Just in general on that point, do you feel that homelessness services and support services for homelessness are being prioritised in this budget?\" said by Mabon ap Gwynfor MS\n\"Diolch, Mabon. Yes, absolutely. So, the data shows clearly that demand is increasing. I've just said in my opening remarks that we know that the pressure on homelessness services across Wales hasn't abated and, in some places, has actually increased. We also know that the cost-of-living pressures that people are facing are adding to the drivers that drive people into home loss. We also know that prevention is the most effective and cost-effective way to address homelessness. So, we're not going to row back on our 'no-one left out' policy, despite the real serious pressures that we've facing. So, recognising those pressures, the prevention budget will increase by \u00a350 million in 2023-24, an additional \u00a310 million more than previously planned, and that takes our investment in homelessness and housing support to over \u00a3207 million next year.&nbsp;In recognition of the support services required to keep people in their homes as well, we increased the housing support grant budget by \u00a340 million in 2021-22 to \u00a3166.763 million, which is a 30 per cent rise. And I'm pleased to say that, despite the incredibly difficult budget pressure that we've had this year\u2014and it has been incredibly difficult\u2014we have managed to maintain that substantial increase in this year's budget, and then going forward into the 2023-24 budget. So, the answer, I suppose, in a nutshell is that there is obviously more that we could do; there's always going to be more we can do in the face of the current cost-of-living pressure. But, I'm very pleased that we've managed to maintain services at the increased level that we were able to put them in, and we've just managed to get another \u00a310 million into homelessness services themselves. We continue to scrutinise the budget every day, I assure you, looking for extra ways to increase money into this essential service.&nbsp;\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Thank you, Minister, for that response. If I may go to the narrative of the draft budget as I read it and as we saw it back in December, in that narrative, it mentions the effect of low pay and cost of living on the front-line staff of homelessness services. There was an example that 44 per cent of the workforce were unable to pay bills, that 11 per cent of them were unable to pay rent, et cetera. But, this, again, this year, is a flat settlement, compared to\u2014. I accept that you say that you've increased it in previous years, but in the last year, we've seen huge inflation, so this settlement, which is flat, is a real-terms cut in the settlement, which means that we will then see more of the front-line workforce leaving their jobs, and then more pressure on services. So, in considering the targets that we have\u2014you've mentioned some of them\u2014and the fact that we're likely to see more of that workforce leave and unable to do their work, and additional pressure, do you feel that this settlement is fair for that sector in particular?&nbsp;And do you believe that the \u00a310 million additional funding that you\u2019re putting towards these services that are provided is enough? [Translation should read: And do you believe that the \u00a310 million additional funding that you're providing is able to go towards these services that are provided by front-line staff?]&nbsp;\" said by Mabon ap Gwynfor MS\n\"So, the short answer to that is, no, of course, it's not enough. As I said, we could put a lot more in, if we had it, but the trouble is that we don't have it. Our own budget is eroded by inflation as well. It was an enormous struggle to maintain the increase in those budgets; those budgets were not what they call 'baselined' in the first place and we have managed to do that. And I know that that, on the outside, looks like a real-terms cut, because, of course, we're in an inflationary spiral and inflation erodes all of the money that we all have. But, I can assure you that I am acutely aware of the problems in housing support and my heart absolutely goes out to people on the front line. I pay tribute to them every single day; they do the most incredible job, particularly the housing outreach workers, who are amazing human beings. And, as soon as there is any available money, we will be putting more into this area.But just to give an example, what we've been doing with the \u00a310 million is we've been trying to help our local authorities prevent people from becoming homeless in the first place by, for example, making sure that, in certain circumstances, rent arrears are cleared. So, a very small investment of \u00a31,300, for example, can prevent a family from being homeless. Thirteen hundred pounds doesn't even cover the first week of a family being homeless, so it's clearly a good financial investment, as well as a hugely good humanitarian investment, because the trauma of homelessness is something that children do not overcome easily. So, we have been working with the local authorities to try and be as creative as possible to keep people in their own homes, and to make sure that the homelessness prevention services are as creative as is humanly possible for them to be. And we've got to put more into prevention, because, frankly, if we can't turn off the tide of people coming to homelessness services, there is no way that we could fund the kind of service that we would then have to do. And so, we have made the best of what is, as I said at the beginning, the most difficult budget I have ever faced in my time as a Welsh Government Minister. I do not say that lightly.So, we have managed to balance the books this year\u2014that has not been easy\u2014and we have tried very hard to prioritise all of the services across my entire portfolio that really matter to people. We are not doing any 'nice to haves' here; every single service we provide is an essential service. And, if I was to put more money into the housing support grant, which I dearly wish I could, then I would be taking it off somewhere else and you would be having the same conversation with me about wherever else that it had come from. And that is the stark reality of where we are. So, we have squeezed the cost-of-living support out as much as we can. With the co-operation agreement's help, we have put \u00a310 million out to the local authorities for homelessness services. We continue to scrutinise the budget, penny by penny. Dean and I have spent so much time together going through each line of the budget, trying to squeeze every single penny out, and Emma's team are very hard-pressed in trying to make sure that the money that we do have gives us the best bang for our buck. But I'm not hiding from it, Mabon, if I could put more money into it, I would.&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Thank you. Just to go back one step, you mentioned that you want to invest in preventative services and ensure that local authorities can provide those preventative services, to prevent people from getting to that level of becoming homeless and going into temporary accommodations to start with. That makes sense, of course, and I don't disagree with that. But, the unfortunate truth is that local authorities can't provide those services fully because they don't have the workforce, because they also are suffering from huge cuts. So, do you think that the settlement for local authorities is a fair one, to enable them to do this kind of preventative work that you are so keen to see them undertaking?\" said by Mabon ap Gwynfor MS\n\"Again, it\u2019s a similar answer, I\u2019m afraid. We have protected all of the programmes and put money back into people\u2019s pockets to every extent that we can. So, there\u2019s an extra \u00a318.8 million in the discretionary assistance fund, for example, to continue to provide emergency financial support to people facing immediate financial distress. We have had to make those difficult choices.It is absolutely the case that, by providing that immediate cash support into people\u2019s pockets, we hope that that will make them more resilient, and enable them to stay in their homes and to pay their bills, and not to get into the financial spiral of debt that it is inevitable when you can\u2019t pay even small sums of money out. We are talking about hard-working people who have got jobs and are trying to keep them, but who cannot pay their bills.The spiralling cost of energy alone has been absolutely horrendous, and might I just also say, Chair, that the spiralling cost of energy, of course, is hitting our public services as well? They also have to pay it, so their budgets are not going as far. There\u2019s no getting away from that, and there are no easy answers here.We have worked with our local authority partners. I meet very regularly with the leaders and housing cabinet members, for example, to try to make the best of the money that we have got and to try and understand where the worst pressure is, and to try and cover, between us, the worst pressure in the system. But every part of the system is under pressure, because we have a cost-of-living crisis, and spiralling inflation, and a stagnant economy\u2014the worst of all possible worlds.So, I\u2019m afraid that there are no easy answers here. I absolutely understand what you are asking me, and if I could have given more money to local authorities for the services that I support\u2014not just in housing, but in a number of other areas\u2014I would have. I know that my colleague the Minister for Finance and Local Government has tried very hard indeed to protect front-line public services in the settlement. We had an order of priority, as we always do, and front-line services are absolutely front and centre of what we are trying to do.We have a very close working relationship with our local authorities. We have this discussion with them very, very regularly. Emma\u2019s team has relationship managers in every local authority, working with them to understand what the individual pressures in each local authority are, and to try and help them through it.This is very much a collaborative piece of working, in line with the future generations Act. We are absolutely doing this on a collaborative basis, and I think that the local authorities will say the same to you. Of course, they could do with more money, but they are very appreciative of the amount of support that we are giving them from inside the Government as well.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Thank you. To go down that same route, you talked about collaboration and the need to ensure that you could uprate the support for homeless services. Of course, it's a policy for the Government to eliminate homelessness, by ensuring that the fewest number of people possible suffer from homelessness. So, to that end, do you think and are you confident that, across the portfolios, other Ministers have prioritised homelessness and the need to tackle this in their portfolios? What kind of collaboration do you have so that you can get the best out of every pound of public spending that goes into achieving those targets of ensuring that no-one is homeless in Wales?&nbsp;\" said by ", "answer": "Mabon ap Gwynfor MS"}
{"content": "\"Okay. Item 2 on today's agenda, the first of today's evidence sessions for P-06-1326, 'The Senedd should scrutinise the prepayment meter scandal in Wales'. I'm pleased to have Neil Kenward from Ofgem here with us today. Perhaps, Neil, you could introduce yourself for the record, to start.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Of course, Chair. As you say, Neil Kenward;&nbsp;I'm the director for strategy and decarbonisation at Ofgem.\" said by Neil Kenward\n\"Mr Kenward, I'm very grateful for your time. This is a serious matter that we're scrutinising in front of us today and considering on behalf of the Petitions Committee. I think it's fair to say that what we have seen over the last year is nothing short of a national scandal, as the petition suggests, when it comes to energy suppliers forcibly installing prepayment meters into the homes of some of the most vulnerable in society. It's my understanding that, as Ofgem, they are the regulator of these energy firms, and I think it would be a fair assumption to say that you are there to stand up and protect consumers, and that perhaps\u2014it's my opinion, and I won't preempt any committee opinion on this\u2014last winter, Ofgem didn't do that. Instead, you let some, or many, vulnerable people down. But perhaps, to open questions this afternoon, before we take questions from other members of the committee, can I ask: how did we ever get into a position where residents, not just in Wales, but across the United Kingdom as well, including many, many vulnerable households, were forced onto prepayment meters? I think the figures suggest that, last year alone, there were over 94,000 enforced installations of prepayment meters in the United Kingdom, for 2022. Why was that so high?\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. I should start by saying that I agree entirely that this is a really important issue, and that Ofgem's remit is absolutely to protect consumers\u2014that's what we exist to do, and we have particular roles with respecting the vulnerable, and our board take, and our executive take, that issue particularly seriously. Indeed, in the run-up to this winter, at this period when we knew energy prices were at record levels, we knew that that was going to put extra pressure on consumers across the board, but particularly the lowest income and the most vulnerable consumers. So, over the last summer and into the autumn, we were running market-compliance reviews, which are, essentially, audits of the entire energy supply sector, on issues like their preparedness for vulnerability, on issues like how they help consumers who are struggling with their bills. So, we ran a very comprehensive set of audits into that issue. And then, recognising that there could be a particular set of concerns around the installation of prepayment meters, in November, the director for retail\u2014one of my colleagues, Neil Lawrence\u2014wrote a very robust letter to all suppliers, reminding them of the rules and their obligations, which include the need to protect vulnerable consumers, and to only install a prepayment meter where it's safe and reasonably practicable to do so. And we had very clear rules about that at that time.We also launched, earlier this year, a market-compliance review targeted specifically on this issue of PPM installation. We realised it was important for consumers, but also an issue of considerable public interest. And of course, when <em>The Times</em> investigation broke, we launched immediately an investigation into British Gas, which is ongoing. We also have broadened out\u2014we're conducting audits, independent audits, of all the suppliers and their prepayment meter practices. And we asked all suppliers to stop all involuntary PPM installations for a period whilst we conducted the audit and whilst we reviewed the rules. And so what we\u2019ve been spending a number of weeks doing was developing a new code of practice, which we\u2019ve now published a few weeks ago, which sets out very clearly our expectations and defines in much more prescriptive terms than previously when we believe it is safe and reasonably practicable for a prepayment meter to be installed. So, we\u2019ve tried to remove any sense of doubt about when it is and isn\u2019t acceptable, to ensure that all suppliers meet the high standards that we have always expected of them.\" said by Neil Kenward\n\"Thank you, Mr Kenward. I think it's fair to say at the start that suppliers over the last year did not meet any standard\u2014high standard or gold standard\u2014that, as a consumer, we would expect Ofgem to protect. I have questions, but I'm conscious Members have questions as well, so perhaps we'll move straight to Rhys ab Owen first.&nbsp;\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"It's not actually a question I wanted to ask, but I was just thinking, whilst you were answering questions to the Chair now: what about people who were affected years ago, many years ago? They've already gone through the complaints procedure, they've already gone to the ombudsman, it has been turned down, and now they want to re-open their case. How are they to be supported?\" said by Rhys ab Owen MS\n\"We do have, as you say, rightly, a complaints procedure in the sector. Consumers should first try and get their problems sorted with their energy company, but if that\u2019s not satisfactory then there are avenues like Citizen\u2019s Advice and the ombudsman where they can lodge their case, and those cases that can\u2019t be resolved through those routes, we talk to Citizen\u2019s Advice and the ombudsman on a very regular basis and they pass us the difficult cases that we can then take forward and resolve with the suppliers.&nbsp;\" said by Neil Kenward\n\"I was thinking of cases that have gone through the procedure years ago, before this became a well-known issue on the agenda. How are these people to be supported, who've already gone through all the procedures and been rejected by the ombudsman already. What can we tell constituents who are in that category who get in touch with us?\" said by Rhys ab Owen MS\n\"So, if there are consumers who are on a prepayment meter and they don\u2019t believe it\u2019s safe for them to be on that, and they think they\u2019re coming to serious harm as a result, they should absolutely get back in touch with their supplier and tell them that they think they have vulnerabilities or other issues that make it not safe for them to be on a prepayment meter. We would absolutely expect a supplier to then revisit that decision and, if appropriate, return them to a non-prepayment form of metering.\" said by Neil Kenward\n\"Thank you. I want to move on to the code of practice. As we all know, it's a voluntary code of conduct. Where are you about making it legally enforceable?&nbsp;\" said by Rhys ab Owen MS\n\"Yes, that's absolutely a top priority for us. What we wanted to do was act quickly, and the quickest thing to do was to suspend all non-voluntary prepayment meter installations, which we did immediately, and put out a code quickly. So, we\u2019re setting out clear new rules that have to be met. There\u2019s complete clarity now on what is and isn\u2019t acceptable. But we recognise that, at this point, it\u2019s a voluntary agreement. Now, we\u2019re pretty sure the suppliers will be really keen to not break any of the new rules, but, to make absolutely sure, we\u2019re moving at pace to put it into the supply licence, at which point it is fully enforceable. So, that takes a little bit of time, and it does require a consultation to make changes to the supply licence, so that process will happen over the next few months. We are determined to get the new code into the licence so that it is fully enforceable before the winter, and we think that\u2019s the right sort of timeline. It enables the proper, consultative process to occur. But I think that should give some reassurance, and I can be really clear that we will be monitoring the industry even before it\u2019s in the licence, to make sure they\u2019re adhering to the code.\" said by Neil Kenward\n\"Okay. So, your evidence is that it will be legally enforceable before next winter.&nbsp;\" said by Rhys ab Owen MS\n\"Before the coming winter, yes.&nbsp;\" said by Neil Kenward\n\"Thank you. I just wanted to look at the different categories of risk. Now, high risk\u2014the age limit for that has been set at 85. I'm not sure whether you know that the average age of death of a Welshman is 78. Why has it been set seven years older than the average age of death of a Welshman in Wales?\" said by Rhys ab Owen MS\n\"So, we consulted a number of sources in terms of medical advice and other bits of guidance that set these limits. One of the things I'd say is that it's actually very difficult, and we recognise it's very difficult, to draw a line and say, 'Everyone over the age of 85 is somehow too vulnerable for it, and people under the age of 85 aren't.' But we had to provide some clarity, and what we require suppliers to do is, for every household that they feel that they need to install a prepayment meter in, they absolutely need to check the individual circumstances of that household, and, if there are any of the vulnerabilities that we have set out in our code, then they should not be going ahead with the installation. So, our priority absolutely is protecting vulnerable consumers.\" said by Neil Kenward\n\"But how is that to work in practice? Say now, for example, somebody could be in the medium-risk category who's 84, with Alzheimer's, with Parkinson's, with schizophrenia. How on earth are energy companies expected to assess these people to see whether it's safe and reasonably practicable for them to have a prepayment meter?&nbsp;\" said by Rhys ab Owen MS\n\"That's one of the reasons we've put in the precautionary principle. If there are people in that category who are vulnerable and cannot afford, or may struggle to afford, their energy bills\u2014so, if they're at risk of self-disconnection\u2014the rules are clear in the new code: they shouldn't install a prepayment meter.\" said by Neil Kenward\n\"But how can it be assessed, then, that's it's correct to give a prepayment meter to somebody in a medium-risk category who has an illness like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's? Are these energy companies supposed to send out a medical expert to assess these people individually? I'm just wondering how it actually works in practice.\" said by Rhys ab Owen MS\n\"So, it's something we already expect them to do, and, indeed, most of them do have these processes to make assessments. We would expect them to have enough expertise within their organisation to judge the vulnerability of these households and to judge whether it is safe and reasonably practicable. In my view, an 84-year-old with Alzheimer's does not sound like someone for which that would be an appropriate step to take.The difficulty, of course, is that every household is different and has its own circumstances. There might be other capable adults in the house, for example, which would change the picture. So, what we've tried to do\u2014. As I say, we'll be consulting on the details of this over the summer, so we're very open to continued conversation with consumer groups and charities, and, indeed, politicians and Governments, because we have been already having a good dialogue with consumer groups, and they've informed the rules we've set so far. But we will continue that dialogue to try to make sure we get it right. This is\u2014. I mean, it's genuinely a difficult area.\" said by Neil Kenward\n\"But, at the moment, you're unable to tell us exactly how these assessments should take place.\" said by Rhys ab Owen MS\n\"So, in a sense, what we require is that the assessments take place in a way that is done professionally and informed by experts\u2014people who know how to make these assessments. In a sense, it's not for Ofgem to say exactly how something should happen in that regard, but the suppliers must demonstrate that they are able to conduct proper vulnerability and affordability assessments.\" said by Neil Kenward\n\"Diolch yn fawr, Rhys. I'm going to bring Luke Fletcher in now, but, just to point to the 85-year-old age group that you've drawn a line under, I think it's noted that the NHS say that, if you are over the age of 65, you should not allow your house to go below 18 degrees C\u20143.2 million people were disconnected last year; some of them were going to be over the age of 65. I will, perhaps, pick up some more of this after Luke Fletcher. It worries me\u2014it deeply concerns me\u2014that 85 is not perhaps the right figure, and the consultations might want to look at that. Luke Fletcher.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Diolch, Gadeirydd. You actually brought up a point that I was going to bring up anyway, but\u2014. You mentioned that some campaign groups and consumer groups have informed stuff around the new code, but a lot of campaign groups have also said that the code doesn't go far enough. For example, coming back to the example of a person in their early 80s, under the new code they could still be, potentially, exposed to prepayment meters being forcibly installed. In fact, Tom Marsland, from the charity Scope, said that the changes would still allow energy companies to install prepayment meters in some disabled households. How would you respond to that, then?\" said by Luke Fletcher MS\n\"We're really clear that, if the household has a vulnerability where that person has a medical need for a warm home or continuous electricity supply\u2014for example, to run a dialysis machine or things like that, which often are in people's homes\u2014then a prepayment meter is just never an acceptable option, and, actually, we're asking suppliers to check existing PPM households to make sure that people are not in that situation. We've set out really clearly the sort of test, how they should be looking, what factors they should be looking for, around disabilities and other vulnerabilities that should determine whether it is safe and practical for a prepayment meter to be in someone's home.\" said by Neil Kenward\n\"Of course, this comes back to the point that my colleague Rhys mentioned earlier, around how do energy companies assess that themselves, and you mentioned that you would expect them to have a certain level of expertise around making that decision. How would you define that expertise then?\" said by Luke Fletcher MS\n\"So, what we've said is that, for example, there should be a welfare officer who is available either on a site visit or able to advise on the site visit, and we're requiring mandatory site visits ahead of prepayment meter installation or indeed a remote switch, which is, in a sense, the same thing. But there has to be a mandatory site visit, so that the actual circumstances of that household can be properly assessed in person. And people with the relevant skills, the relevant training, should be part of that site visit, and part of the installation team, so that there is proper evidence gathered and that prepayment meter installations don't go ahead if there is significant risk to the consumer.&nbsp;\" said by Neil Kenward\n\"Thank you, both of you. Can I ask: are those site visits happening now, and are they being measured?\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"So, right now, there are no prepayment meter installations going on that aren't wanted by consumers. But, prior to that, there were different practices. So, for some suppliers, they did do those site visits ahead of every installation, and for some, they didn't. So, one of the things we can do with this code and the new set of rules is to bring every supplier up to the best standards that existed in the industry and make those standards mandatory, so we're enforcing best practice across the sector.\" said by Neil Kenward\n\"Thank you for that. Picking up Luke Fletcher's points and your response about medical devices, well, I can tell you that that has happened over the last year. In fact, I had a constituent of mine and I'll quote their words to me: 'A family member relies on a medical device that has to be connected to mains electric when in use. So, I would urge energy suppliers'\u2014and we'll pick this up with energy suppliers afterwards\u2014'to, as you say, look into that and make right what is quite clearly wrong there.'If I can just bring some more scenarios to your attention, to just get some more reassurance for constituents of where this new voluntary code is at. The code of practice, as it is at the moment, of course, you stated would be mandatory before this winter. One example, and I'll quote again\u2014this is evidence that I've had sent to me and my office: 'My husband is an army veteran, reconstructed ankles, PTSD, and many other health issues.' There's a further one that says, 'My friend who I live with is bipolar, diabetic and has many other health issues.' In those scenarios, under the new voluntary code of practice, would you expect them to be protected?\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"So, what we've asked is that people with serious medical, physical or mental health conditions and disabilities should have a proper assessment done of their vulnerability and affordability. And, on that basis, if it's not safe and reasonably practical for that household to have a prepayment meter fitted, then that should not go ahead.\" said by Neil Kenward\n\"Okay. I'm conscious of when the voluntary code of practice comes back in, what process will be in place to make sure that those site visits do go ahead? How will you measure them? Because I'm conscious that they may not go ahead and forced installations could start again.\" said by ", "answer": "Jack Sargeant AM"}

Today we will take evidence from stakeholders to inform our work on this issue, and I'd like to welcome the first panel today. May I ask you to introduce yourself for the record, please? And I'll start with you, Chloe.\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Hello. Chloe Wenman, Marine Conservation Society, representing Wales Environment Link.\" said by Chloe Wenman\n\"Welcome. Thank you. Annie.\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Hi there. Annie Smith, RSPB Cymru. Also here representing Wales Environment Link.\" said by Annie Smith\n\"Thank you very much. And finally, Jonathan.\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Good morning, everybody. Jonathan Davies, senior ecologist at Bannau Brycheiniog.&nbsp;\" said by Dr Jonathan Davies\n\"Excellent. A very warm welcome to the three of you here today, and thank you for giving of your time. May I start by asking you for your general views and comments on the COP15 global agreement, and whether you can focus your comments on our ability to meet the targets and whether there is sufficient clarity on what's needed at a domestic level? May I turn, first of all, to you, Chloe, perhaps?\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Diolch. Well, I'd actually like to start by just wishing everybody a happy World Oceans Day. So, I look forward to discussing the role that the ocean can play in reversing biodiversity decline today.COP15, well, it was talked about as nature's Paris moment, wasn't it? I think there's a lot to be said there. Could it have gone further? Yes, possibly. That's the nature of international agreements, isn't it? You reach the base level. But, we were really pleased with what was decided. We're talking today, of course, about domestic implementation; it's useless if we can't implement it. Welsh Government's made a really good start here with the biodiversity deep-dive recommendations, and we were really pleased to be involved there.The key thing that you'll hear us talking about today is our ask for a nature positive Bill, and again we were really pleased to see the commitment to a White Paper this year on that. We can go into this a little bit more later, but essentially we're asking for legally binding nature recovery targets and an independent environmental governance body. The Minister herself has recognised that the main challenge here is finance, and I'd like to refer here to our 'Pathways to 2030' report, which we submitted as written evidence, which goes into habitat level recommendations and ballpark figures on what needs to be invested.In terms of a summary of my key asks for the ocean\u2014that's mainly what I'm here to talk about\u2014recognition for the ocean is probably No. 1 there. Welsh seas are 35 per cent larger than the land mass. It's huge, and that needs recognition. You'll hear me talk a lot about marine spatial planning today; that's our No. 1 ask for Welsh sea biodiversity. We think it can make a huge difference.Other things, really quickly, on the marine side: quality not quantity for marine protected areas. We have protected 30 per cent of our seas already, but they're not properly protected, are they? So, there are some actions we can do there. And that's it, really. Targets within the Bill\u2014we'll go on to that later, but really to emphasise that we need these as a way of driving action, not just for their own sake.&nbsp;And the final thing I'd like to just note is that the COP15 agreement really highlighted the role of communities, and again the Minister has recognised this, and I'd like to really hammer that home, that underneath all of this target setting and everything, we really need societal change, behavioural change\u2014we need to bring the people along with us. So, I'll leave it there.\" said by Chloe Wenman\n\"Thank you. Annie, may I turn to you next?\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Diolch. Chloe's covered so much, there's not much for me to add. I agree with the sort of overarching comments about the global agreement. But the important thing, I guess, to stress, is that there's a really ambitious global mission in there to halt and reverse nature loss by 2030, so that we see recovery to healthy, thriving ecosystems that benefit people and nature by 2050.You asked about specificity, and I think that's one of the things that could have been improved on, the kind of detail of some of the targets. But among the critical points for us is that there are specific targets in there on species, so a recognition that we've got to address species recovery as part of the package. So, increasing species abundance and reducing extinction risk are clearly there in the framework. The 30x30 target is obviously one that's been talked about a lot and it was the focus of the deep dive. It sounds quite specific, but there's a lot that comes under that in terms of understanding how to deliver it. So, I think there's plenty of work to do to deliver it.I would just echo Chloe's comments that what we have learnt over the decades is that these global agreements on their own don't drive the accountability and the action that we need to actually meet the goals. We need those legally binding targets in legislation, so that the Convention on Biological Diversity becomes the business of the whole of Government, across sectors and society, as Chloe said. So, legally binding targets, in a parallel framework to the climate change framework, are critical to make that happen, we believe.\" said by Annie Smith\n\"Thank you very much. I'm sure colleagues will be asking more in-depth questions around that as we progress. Jonathan, can I turn to you for some initial comments, please?\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Thank you. Yes. We adopted nature positive, actually, as the nature mission target for the recently launched management plan for the national parks, so that's certainly something that we endorse and we want to contribute to. Obviously the one that stands out a lot for us and the designated landscapes is the 30 per cent target\u201430 per cent of land and seascapes. I won't get it right if I try and remember the exact wording of the target, but Wales is close to 30 per cent of all land protected in designated landscapes. But, of course, we know that there are significant areas of land in the designated landscape and national parks and the areas of outstanding natural beauty that are not significantly better than land outside, and, in some cases, maybe even worse. So, that seems like a really obvious opportunity for Wales to really improve the way nature recovery takes place within the designated landscapes, so that as much of that 30 per cent as possible is recognised as being protected for nature.There are other targets that seem to get a lot less recognition. There are 23 targets, aren't there, under the whole CBD agreement, the COP15 agreement, and some that I think probably could get more attention and that would really help nature recovery, certainly within the national parks and designated landscapes. The target of 10 on agriculture stands out. We don't talk about the CBD process when we're talking about the sustainable farming scheme, and yet 80 per cent of all the land in the national park is managed by farmers. There's a lot we can do, actually, to leverage the SFS, within the national park, to make sure that designated landscapes are delivering more for nature than anywhere else and really leads the way, a really good exemplar in that area. I'll stop there. There are other things that'll come up later in the meeting, I think. Thanks.\" said by Dr Jonathan Davies\n\"Thank you very much. Can I turn to Joyce Watson to lead us on the next two questions, please?\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Thank you, and I'm just going to refer you to my register of interests, because I'm a member of&nbsp; the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. So, I'm going to ask about nature recovery targets and how nature positive should be represented in Welsh legislation.\" said by Joyce Watson AM\n\"Thank you. Thank you, Joyce. Nature positive is a kind of description of that global goal that I just described, so we need to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030, so bend that curve and then see substantive recovery by 2050. So, we would want to see in legislation those goals\u20142030, halt and reverse biodiversity loss, 2050, recovery\u2014and then some specific duties to set,&nbsp;through regulations, binding targets based on different measures of biodiversity.So, key measures include species abundance, species extinction risk and also habitat quality and extent, including protected areas, extent and condition, linking back to the 30x30 target. So, we'd expect the detailed targets to sit in secondary legislation, but for the primary legislation to be very clear about what was needed and what those targets needed to do. We'd then expect a regular system for reporting on progress against the targets and, critically, for the primary legislation to require the interim targets be set, so we don't just want to look at 2030 and 2050; we want to look at points between, so that Governments\u2014. The point of having legally binding targets is to lock in commitment, isn't it, so successive Governments are driving in the same direction. And we don't want the option to be there for action to be pushed to the last five years; we need to see progress all the way through. So, a legally binding requirement for interim targets to be set is really critical.The Environment (Wales) Act 2016 has established a policy setting and an evidence reporting cycle so that\u2014. It might be possible to enhance that through the nature targets framework to make those key vehicles in that cycle, potentially. And I think we also talk about, don't we, the need for independent environmental governance, and the role of an independent watchdog is really critical in helping the Senedd and society as a whole to scrutinise the Government as to its progress, whether it's the actions that it's committed to, to show how it's going to meet those targets, whether it's a natural resources policy or another vehicle, whether that's adequate, likely to be sufficient, and how then both delivery and progress have been at the end of the relevant period. So, I think those roles are all really important.&nbsp;\" said by Annie Smith\n\"Can I\u2014? In terms of what is the relevant time period, how do you see that being arrived at\u2014through discussion to set that, or\u2014?&nbsp;\" said by Joyce Watson AM\n\"The critical thing, I guess, is having legally binding targets. If you think of the impact of the climate change targets, it's really clear that Government is answerable to that, isn't it? If there's a piece of advice they don't follow, or, as we've seen, the Climate Change Committee says progress has been inadequate, then we need to see a response to that, and that plays out in the Senedd, also in the court of public opinion. So, reporting needs to be regular enough, so that it's not only kept alive as an issue, but also so that progress can be tracked\u2014you can make adjustments, if needed, kind of thing.&nbsp;So, I think there is discussion to be had around that. I think there's a role\u2014. I would say there's a role for the five-year cycle that's established in the environment Act, where we have evidence updated towards the end of the Senedd and the policy actions set out at the beginning. So, the Westminster Environment Act that was passed in 2021 has a requirement for an annual progress report, and I think we'd need to see a statement of that kind about how progress is going towards the targets. So, I think there's a combination of levels, probably.\" said by Annie Smith\n\"Thank you. Chloe.&nbsp;\" said by Joyce Watson AM\n\"Jonathan has his hand up to come in, if I may bring him in.&nbsp;\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Thanks again. We adopted nature positive by 2030, as I said earlier, as the headline goal for nature recovery for the national park in our management plan. And for us, what we're focusing on is habitats\u2014making sure that we stabilise or improve the extent and particularly the condition of different habitats within the park. To do that, the way we conceptualise that is we say that if we're going to be nature positive by 2030, it means, in 2030, nature should be\u2014and I'll do this with my hands on the camera here\u2014at the same level as it is when we start, which is now, this year, which means that if nature is currently in decline, we have to reverse the decline and be on an upward trajectory in 2030. And then the question about, 'What's the future goal?', well, that's a lovely debate for 2030\u2014'What's the potential when we get beyond neutrality?' But even setting that as a goal is very ambitious.When we were looking at it and debating whether to adopt that, we looked at target 15.3 under the sustainable development goal, which is for land degradation neutrality, which isn't discussed much in the UK, but it follows essentially the same principle and it was adopted by the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, so one of the sister conventions to the CBD. And they've done quite a lot of work to develop a framework for that target, which I think could be worth looking at and seeing if that can inform a similar nature positive target here.\" said by Dr Jonathan Davies\n\"Thank you.&nbsp;\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"And the lessons from England\u2014have we got any lessons from England in terms of bringing forward domestic biodiversity targets?\" said by Joyce Watson AM\n\"Yes. Because the Environment Act 2021 has taken that step of creating legally binding biodiversity targets, that\u2019s definitely a really important model to look at. The model is similar to what I described in terms of having headline commitments to target setting on the face of the Act, with the targets themselves following in legislation. And they do have a flagship species recovery target on the face of the Bill. What\u2019s missing from that Act are legally binding interim targets, so there is no requirement to set targets at a shorter time frame\u2014. I\u2019ve totally lost my thread.&nbsp;The one other thing\u2014I know you\u2019ve got stuff to say\u2014was that a thing to look at is the time frames within that. So, the Act was passed, I think, in November 2021, with a requirement that regulations setting out the targets be laid in Parliament in October 2022. The UK Government missed that target by a couple of months, but still, within a little more than a year of the Act being passed, the targets had been set in law. So I do have a concern about the potential to build in further protracted time periods between the primary legislation and the regulations. I think we should follow the example of that Westminster Act and stick to short time periods. As Chloe said, it\u2019s great to hear that there\u2019s a White Paper on the way this year, but we really need to know urgently that we will get legislation soon enough that the Senedd can pass it, and pass regulations to set us up going forward. I think a critical bit of that is making sure that we don\u2019t tackle everything in stages, but in developing what the legislation looks like there\u2019s also work going on about what the actual targets look like, so that we\u2019re ahead of the game in terms of the need for regulations.&nbsp;\" said by Annie Smith\n\"I agree with a lot of what Annie said. I was going to say some of that, too. I think there are also some lessons in terms of specific targets that we're missing. So, for example, marine\u2014the marine target is that 70 per cent of designated features in the marine protected areas network are in favourable condition by 2042. So, that's very MPA focused. There's nothing about marine species there. Obviously, MPAs are hugely important, but they can't be the be-all and end-all of how we restore biodiversity in the sea, so we would like to see some thinking go into marine-specific targets. I know that the Office for Environmental Protection suggested a target for the achievement of good environmental status more generally for the England targets, and that was dismissed, so potentially some more discussion on that. There was also no overall target on river quality in the English targets. There were targets, I think, on sources of pollution, but no overall river quality targets. So, yes, some suggestions there on something\u2014. I don't know, Annie, if there were some terrestrial\u2014?\" said by Chloe Wenman\n\"I think, actually, it's a really important point that, on the terrestrial side, there\u2019s a legally binding species abundance target, but not one related to terrestrial protected areas. So they\u2019ve sort of done the opposite approach, and actually we want to have a comprehensive approach to this and see the land, freshwater and sea are addressed in target setting, but also that those critical measures of species, abundance and extinction risk, habitat, extent and condition, including the protected sites, which is critical to that 30x30 target, are covered.&nbsp;\" said by Annie Smith\n\"Thank you.

So, I was aware, obviously, of the commission and the work that's been discussed over a number of years now, and an appointment wasn't made. And I received a phone call from Odgers&nbsp;Berndtson, the recruitment company that were dealing with this, to ask whether I'd be interested in the role. I hesitated for a moment, spoke to my wife, and said, 'Yes, absolutely, I really would be interested'. So, that was the process as far as I was concerned.\" said by Simon Pirotte\n\"I'm just going to bring James Evans in. James.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Yes, thank you. Good morning, Simon. I'm just interested: what changed your mind? Obviously, the post was advertised before. You didn't apply when it was first advertised. I'm just interested as to why you changed your mind and, obviously, when approached, you said you were interested.\" said by James Evans MS\n\"<em>Cwestiwn</em>&nbsp;<em>da\u2014</em>that's a really good question. I think when the post was advertised last October, around nine or so months ago, I was in the throes of the new term at Bridgend College. We have quite an ambitious strategy there\u2014lots of things that were occupying my mind, and it was something that wasn't really on my mind. And, to be honest, my thoughts were around planning retirement and buying a camper van, if I'm being really honest. So, I knew that the process was going ahead, and then, when I received the call, I think I was in a different place. I think Bridgend College was in a different place in terms of where we were at, in terms of some of our plans coming to fruition, and it felt right. I think sometimes things seem to happen for a reason. If I track my career, sometimes things have just happened and it just felt right. I'm incredibly excited about the work of the commission and always have been since Professor Hazelkorn's work, really, and the report in 2016. I think it's a really ambitious plan, and the more I talk to people across the various parts of the education sector, it's just a wonderful opportunity for Wales to do things differently, I think, in the future.\" said by Simon Pirotte\n\"Thank you. I'm just going to bring in Ken Skates.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thanks, Chair. Hi, Simon.

Thanks, Chair.\" said by Ken Skates AM\n\"Thanks, Ken. Laura.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you.

I have held several board positions in the past, but I don't think there's anything that I do that has any potential conflicts of interest. I'm currently a principal of an FE college. I understand that sector. That's where I've been working, quite a lot, in my recent time. But I've got a broad spectrum of educational experience as well across other parts of the sector.\" said by Simon Pirotte\n\"Thank you. What are your reflections on post-16 education in Wales at the current time, and how will the implementation of the Tertiary Education and Research (Wales) Act 2022 affect the sector, do you think?\" said by Laura Anne Jones AM\n\"I think that, as I said previously, it's a really wonderful opportunity. I think we're pioneers here. I'm interested in some of the work that's happening in, maybe, countries like New Zealand, but across the world it's quite unusual to have a Government that is actually taking this initiative and bringing together these various strands of the different aspects of the post-16 landscape in Wales.I think there obviously will be anxieties. People will be concerned and worried about their own institutions, the learners in their institutions and the implications that this has, but I think, for me, it's about focusing on the opportunities. If we get this right and make the most of this wonderful opportunity, then maybe some of the things that are troubling us in Wales at the moment, looking at participation rates, quality of outcomes, responding to the needs of employers and the economy, all these things in a more joined-up way, hopefully we'll be able to make a better impact for our nation, moving forward.\" said by Simon Pirotte\n\"Thank you.\" said by Laura Anne Jones AM\n\"Okay, thank you, Laura. Questions now from Sioned Williams.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you very much and good morning. Are there any aspects of the post-16 education and training landscape in Wales that you feel less familiar with? We've seen from your cv that you have been engaged with many of the areas that this new commission will have to tackle, but are there any areas that you feel less familiar with, and how will you inform yourself about the full range of provisions that will come under the commission's oversight?\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"Diolch yn fawr. I've been lucky in my career to work in a range of areas in higher education, FE, in schools, in England, Wales and abroad. I've got a good knowledge of apprenticeship provision in terms of the work that we're doing; we're part of the B-wbl Consortium, led by Pembrokeshire College; really good links in terms of our strategic alliance with the University of South Wales; and adult community learning. So, a whole range of different aspects.I think, probably, the area that is more of a blind spot for me would be around research, but I'm really looking forward to working with Julie Lydon as chair, with a breadth of experience in HE, and David Sweeney as well, as deputy chair, with a huge background in research. I see us very much as, hopefully, an effective triumvirate, really, bringing together our skills and expertise and knowledge of different aspects of the sector, so that we are able to cover any gaps of knowledge that any one individual might have. I'd also add that I'm extremely impressed with the staff that we have in the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales and the Welsh Government at the moment\u2014huge expertise. And no one person in this role is going to have all the knowledge and experience, but my success, I think, in terms of my career in education, has really relied on putting brilliant people around me that really have those skills and knowledge and expertise that I can drawn on.&nbsp;\" said by Simon Pirotte\n\"Thank you. So, you're suggesting there some kind of holistic approach, particularly, perhaps, you were talking about HE and policy, and developing a strategy in that regard. Would that be accurate? And how would you\u2014? Do you think that co-operation and partnership with the HE bodies in Wales would be vital for that kind of holistic approach, in terms of the commission? Will you try to make sure you engage continuously with partners in that sector specifically?\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"Totally agree. I think that\u2014. It's tempting, isn't it, when we're beginning with a new organisation, and bringing people together from the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, and from Welsh Government, to just have people doing what they've already been doing, because it could be effective, and that can work. But I think that would be a missed opportunity. I think that we need to think holistically in terms of the whole tertiary sector, and setting up this commission is the great opportunity now, at the beginning, to have some of those conversations.&nbsp;I'm glad you mentioned collaboration, because I see myself as a really good collaborator, and, again, some of the successes that I've had are around building a positive culture, about listening\u2014I think listening is often an underestimated skill of leaders\u2014listening to the concerns, but also focusing not just on challenges, but the opportunities as well, and what can we achieve by working together. And I have to say, in some of the work that I've done across the four nations, as part of the commission on the college of the future, there's a lot of interest in Wales at the moment, in terms of what we're doing and what we're trying to achieve. And we have a lot of really positive things going on, but we can do so much more, I think. And hopefully, this holistic view that you talked about there, in terms of joining up the thinking and the strategy for post-16, will be better for our people, better for our economy, and better for our nation as well.&nbsp;\" said by Simon Pirotte\n\"Thank you. Could I ask you\u2014? There will be change; the commission represents a big change in the way that we are overseeing this sector, the post-16 sector. So, how will you use any previous experience of managing organisational change during the process of establishing the new commission?\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"I think someone once said that the only thing that's constant in education is change, isn't it? We've seen a lot of change in recent years. I think it's about my experience, and, particularly, my recent experience in the last 10 years working at Bridgend College is, as I've said, around the positive culture, about being clear about not always starting with the whats and the hows, but why we do what we do, and creating that compelling vision of what we want Wales to look like in the future. We've got groundbreaking legislation around the well-being of future generations that is encouraging us all to think longer term. And sometimes we get bogged down with the here-and-now challenges. And they're real challenges, and they are difficult. We saw during the pandemic, didn't we, how we had to regroup and think really quickly to deal with a crisis.&nbsp;But I think that, in terms of what I've learnt around managing change, it's about bringing people together under that common vision. And, in my experience, anybody that goes into education, just like I found when I drifted into teaching, because I didn't know what else to do, but I knew within the first minute of being in front of a classroom that was my vocation, and that's what I wanted to do\u2014. And just as teachers transformed my life, in terms of my background, that's something that I wanted to do as a practitioner. And as I've become a leader in organisations now, it's still the same, and would still be the same if I am successful and you are happy with me doing this role.&nbsp;It's about bringing people together, a common vision, a common purpose, and making things better for the people of Wales.&nbsp;\" said by Simon Pirotte\n\"Thank you. And, of course, the commission will have a significant budget, one of the highest allocated to an arm's-length body in Wales. So, could I ask you: what experience do you have in dealing with this scale of organisation and budget?\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"I'd love to be able to tell you that I've handled a budget of this size; I haven't. But I'm not fazed by that. I know, whatever the size of a budget, the books need to balance, and we need to have conversations about how we're actually using the resources that we have. Yes, it is a significant responsibility with a budget of that size. But, as I say to colleagues in work with me at the moment, when they look at the size of their budgets and sometimes get a bit anxious about it, it's just some added zeros on the end, and we still have to think about where we allocate those resources and use that in the best way. But, no, I haven't. But I'm not sure I know anybody that's handled a budget of this size in the past.\" said by Simon Pirotte\n\"Thank you very much. Thank you, Chair.\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"Diolch, Sioned. So, just focusing on measuring success, what are the main long-term outcomes that you want to achieve in this role? And how might these change as the new commission is established?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"So, I think there are three important strands for me. There are the 11 strategic duties of the commission, the well-being of future generations Act, as I've mentioned as well, in terms of those well-being goals, and there will be a statement of priorities that will come from the Minister to the commission as well. So, I'm mindful of those three pillars, if you like, in terms of producing and working with stakeholders to produce the strategy.There will, obviously, be key performance indicators, and we'll look at numbers in terms of participation rates, the number of learners that are studying through the medium of Welsh; there's a whole range of things that we could look at there. But I'm also interested in some of those things that sometimes are difficult to measure, but sometimes are really important. There were some questions earlier around collaborating and working together. Sometimes that's to do with the feel\u2014the feel of the sector, the temperature, really, of how they feel that they're being listened to and how the shape or direction of travel is going.So, obviously, a big part of setting up the commission is thinking about that strategic plan, with key objectives and things that will need to be achieved, with some measurables against it, but also, I would come back as well, it's to get that feel of the culture of the organisation and the sector as well.\" said by Simon Pirotte\n\"So, you talked there about how you'd feel about that and how you'd measure that, and some of the KPIs, as you said. But how do you think you'll measure success in this role? And what will that success look like by the end of your tenure?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"I think two strands. One is it's not going to fall over on 1 April 2024, and there are some technical, pragmatic things that need to be done to ensure that there's a smooth transition into the commission, and a learner that is studying in higher education or in FE or in a school sixth form or out in the community in the adult community world shouldn't feel that change, in a sense. So, that's one measure of success.But I think the other one is about grabbing the opportunity as well\u2014the whole adage of, if you do what you've always done, you'll get what you've always got. There are things that we can do better, I think, in Wales. So, I think we need to start, from the get-go, really, having some of those conversations, what that could look like. I'm acutely aware that, when we talk about change, some people love it and can't wait\u2014I've already had some stakeholders saying, 'You need to do x, y and z on day one'\u2014to others that might be saying, 'It needs to stay as it is because that's really, really working.' So, it's gathering those opinions, listening to people, and I think the measure of success towards the end of my tenure is in terms of that the hard-nosed KPIs should be improving and going in the right direction, but also how do people feel, how do people actually feel about the way that we are operating as a commission, and where we go next.\" said by Simon Pirotte\n\"Brilliant. Is there anything you'd like to give perhaps more detail on, on some of the things that you think could be done better?\" said by ", "answer": "Jayne Bryant AM"}
{"content": "\"We'll move on, therefore, to item 2 this morning. We're looking at the challenges facing the creative industry workforce. We have an evidence session with national broadcasters. May I ask our witnesses to introduce themselves for the record? I'll go from left to right as I'm looking at you, starting with Si\u00e2n Doyle.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Good morning. I'm Si\u00e2n Doyle. I'm S4C chief executive officer.\" said by Si\u00e2n Doyle\n\"Thank you. Sian.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Sian Gwynedd, head of people, culture and partnerships at BBC Cymru Wales.\" said by Sian Gwynedd\n\"Thank you. And Nia.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Nia Britton, operations manager, ITV Cymru Wales.\" said by Nia Britton\n\"It's great to have the three of you with us this morning. We'll go straight to questions and I'll go straight to Heledd Fychan.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Thank you, Chair, and thank you for joining us today and thank you for the evidence that you provided beforehand. Perhaps the questions will overlap with your evidence, but it's an opportunity to have a wider discussion, if that's okay. The first question is if you could outline, please, what you feel is the current health of the creative industries workforce and how has this been affected by shocks such as the pandemic, Brexit and increased costs of living. Do you want to go from left to right?\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Thank you. It is a very challenging time, but I think it's also an exciting time in the creative industry in Wales. We know that Wales now is a very busy hub for people to come in from outwith Wales, to come in to film in Wales, and there are really exciting productions taking place in Wales. So, it is an exciting time and, from S4C's point of view, we're very busy and we are commissioning the length and breadth of Wales with our independent partners.The challenges are looking at skills. Because it is such an exciting, growing sector, that does create many challenges for our productions as regards finding editors or whatever they need. I think that the pandemic has arrested some of the development in getting the right skills growing throughout the sector, and so some skills are rarer than others. Also, I think the cost of living is now starting to bite, because there is a lack of these skills. There's so much going on in Wales and the cost of living is increasing as well, so it's a very challenging time for our partners and for S4C, and we're seeing costs starting to increase across the sector.\" said by Si\u00e2n Doyle\n\"As Si\u00e2n has said, to start with, I think it's important to say that we welcome the growth that we're seeing in the sector and how positive that is. As you know, we've seen growth since 2016, and a number of major productions have come to Wales. So, we welcome that and see that picture as a very positive one.But, as Si\u00e2n has said, that also gives us challenges, in particular in terms of skills and the shortage of skills in some areas. I'm sure we'll talk about that later, but that is challenging for us. I also think that we see wider challenges in terms of the fact that the licence fee has been frozen for two years in terms of the BBC. That is challenging, and when you then look at the impact of inflation on production costs, the fact that there is a shortage of skills means that there's been an increase in the cost of skills and competition for those. So, I think currently there are concerns because of inflation of costs, and that is having an effect on the industry.\" said by Sian Gwynedd\n\"In terms of ITV, we're involved in current affairs and news production, so that's the perspective I can speak from. I would agree entirely, really. We've had two years where everything had come to a halt, as it were. What we found internally, and we've lost freelancers who went to other positions\u2014. For example, I had one person in ITV who left ITV just before the pandemic to become a freelancer in the open market, and he had 18 months of work in the pipeline, and he lost all of that within, I think, a fortnight. He left us, he went freelance and he lost all of that pipeline of work. So, I think that that kind of thing now\u2014. These are decisions for people to make in terms of the way that they work. I think that that impacts those people who do work as freelancers now. But we've found, exactly as you said, really, that trying to find freelancers now is one of the major challenges. There are some sectors that are finding that particularly difficult, and we can focus in on those in terms of targeting skills in future, to find those people.&nbsp;But, again, the cost of living\u2014. What I would say is that people now, I think, who would have remained with us in the past, because of what ITV can offer them as a business, when someone such as Amazon or Netflix comes to them and offers them \u00a310,000 more for doing the same job, they will move, whereas, in the past, they perhaps wouldn't have done so. So, of course, there's the cost of living\u2014people have to think about their own lives and that's certainly having an impact at the moment.&nbsp;\" said by Nia Britton\n\"Thank you. You mention that there are some&nbsp; skills gaps. Are there specific roles, therefore? In your evidence, a number of you referred to skills in terms of online and digital content. It would just be good for us to know in what sort of skills and what sorts of posts particularly you are seeing a shortage.&nbsp;\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"What I would say is that it's\u2014. Digital journalists\u2014they're one of the major factors here. I think, with a post such as that, because people have been working from home for the past two years, what we've found recently is that the training that we're providing to people\u2014. It's had an impact on the kind of training that we can provide. So, as regards bringing people back to the office now, even though we are trying to strike a balance between how people live and allowing people to work from home part of the time, it is important that we try to bring them back into the office too. One of the things that we've found is that when people work from home, their training opportunities decline, in a way.So, digital journalists is one post that I would point to. Craft editors, people who edit the images, there is a shortage of those in Wales, definitely. I know that Boom, who we work with very closely, are finding the same issue. Also, multi-skilled producers\u2014somebody who can shoot, people who can edit the images themselves, someone who can do all of that\u2014there is a shortage of those, we're finding, in the business, too.\" said by Nia Britton\n\"We are seeing a shortage. In television, perhaps, where we're seeing a shortage is senior producers, production managers and series producers. So, there is great competition for those skills. And, once again, it's positive that all the work is there and that the industry is so busy, but there is a shortage. I do think, with some of the projects and courses that we offer, such as the Cynllun Carlam Ffeithiol Cymru scheme that we're doing jointly with Creative Wales, S4C, Channel 4 and the BBC, we're trying to look at the requirements in terms of training. That is training for freelancers, but it's only a limited number that we can train at any one time.&nbsp;Also, I think the work that the National Film and Television School is doing is valuable in this field. They're trying to work with the sector and with broadcasters to look at what the requirements are, but, in a way, the industry is growing so quickly and, being so successful, it's difficult to meet the demand quickly enough. I know that Creative Wales is working on this in terms of the scheme they have, in looking at the skills and training that are needed, and I would welcome seeing that work and working in partnership.\" said by Sian Gwynedd\n\"Thank you.&nbsp;\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Can I just add that, because we do everything through the medium of Welsh, our pool is even smaller? Wales now has such a good reputation in terms of attracting people into Wales because of the amount of work that is ongoing in Wales through players such as S4C. I agree with Sian that EPs, executive producers, editors, those people who do have that reputation, people go after those individuals and they then have a choice in terms of where they work. So, being a freelancer is difficult. We do most of our work through our independent partners, and, as regards, skills, what concerns me is that they're not coming through from the bottom up and starting from the ground up, and I think there needs to be a major focus there. And that's one of our priorities in S4C, with Creative Wales, to look at how we bring&nbsp;in apprentices and that we combine that with the ability to speak Welsh, and we help those people with their Welsh language skills so we have that flow coming through in the medium of Welsh. And of course, we want them to move on to other positions, but we need to ensure that we have that flow and pipeline coming through. There is a shortage in that regard at the moment. But the challenge is more difficult for us because we want people who speak Welsh, of course.\" said by Si\u00e2n Doyle\n\"Thank you very much. Perhaps just to expand on that, obviously in terms of S4C and moving to the Egin and so forth, your role in terms of commissioning and skills is geographical. Are there challenges now\u2014? And Sian Gwynedd, you also mentioned in terms of the BBC having to reduce the numbers of staff across Wales. Are there challenges in terms of ensuring that the industry continues to be an option wherever you are in Wales?\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Yes, but that\u2019s across Wales. Many of our productions\u201430 per cent of them\u2014are in north Wales. We ensure that we operate across Wales. One of the things we do in S4C, picking up on what Sian said about the licence fee\u2014. We have the most challenging two years, when you look at inflation and so on, if you look at the OBR. There's next year and the year after that, and then we\u2019ll be going down to a flat rate. Our settlement increases in two years, so we have to absorb those costs for these next two years.What we\u2019re doing in S4C, exactly to your point, Heledd, is collaborating with our partners, and we\u2019re looking at how we can\u2014. We\u2019re doing roadshows at the moment with all of our partners to speak to them to see how we can be more flexible. We\u2019re starting to commission the work over a year, perhaps, where we know that there are peaks and troughs, and that we then help them with our commissioning to provide that collaboration with our partners. Can they share resources?We\u2019ve had good conversations with TAC and some of the major corporations such as Rondo; we\u2019re seeing Cwmni Da on Friday. We\u2019re doing this with everyone to see how we can share some of our skills and share some of our resources. I was with Gelert yesterday; they\u2019re helping one of our smaller companies, Carlam in Carmarthen, Heledd. So, we want to ensure that we help to create that network of collaboration across Wales. I think it\u2019s vital that we are part of the solution rather creating the problem, and in S4C we do want to be working with our partners to do that.We have to be clear: there is a shortage, but how can we work together? Because from S4C we want to be ambitious, we want our priorities to be achieved, but we want to do that through collaboration rather than us creating more problems in the sector.\" said by Si\u00e2n Doyle\n\"From the BBC\u2019s point of view, it\u2019s important for us that our content reflects the whole of Wales in terms of audiences across Wales. So, we\u2019re working very hard with companies across Wales, including north Wales, mid Wales and west Wales. I know the English language tv commissioner worke&nbsp; with about 35, 36 independent companies last year, and they were across Wales. Radio stations are also working with companies across Wales. It\u2019s worth saying that we\u2019ve also got offices across Wales. We have about 100 members of staff in Bangor, for example. So, having staff and content and stories that reflect the whole of Wales is vital, and it\u2019s something that we will be working very hard to continue with, because we do see that that has a benefit to audiences and is also beneficial to our content as well.\" said by Sian Gwynedd\n\"I would just say, in terms of Wales, that one of the things we have been doing is we have a new reporter in north Wales. We have three ITV Wales reporters in north Wales, and a new one in west Wales as well, and that\u2019s the important thing for us\u2014that we reflect the entirety of Wales. So, one of the things we have been doing recently is ensuring that that happens, and we are allocating more of our resource in the north.\" said by Nia Britton\n\"Thank you very much. May I\u2014?\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"If it\u2019s quick.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"A quick question. You spoke about inflation. Is that going to be having an impact in terms of how much you\u2019re going to be able to commission? Do you think there\u2019ll be a decline in the number of productions as a result of inflationary costs? Is that a risk?\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"I think it is a risk. I think there are financial challenges at the moment in terms of the BBC and the licence fee currently, and the cuts that we\u2019re facing. And also, if you are looking at increasing costs of productions, it\u2019s happening across everything, and inflation has an impact on everything, doesn\u2019t it? So, I do think there is a risk.&nbsp;Clearly, for BBC Cymru Wales, we've managed to make savings by moving to Central Square, using new technology, and looking at how we're working more efficiently. We're looking at working more in partnerships, as Si\u00e2n said. That's vital to us to work more effectively with partners. And, clearly, what's important for us is that we are providing the best possible content for our audiences, and we'll be doing our best to protect that. But I think it's worth saying there is financial risk at the moment, because the financial challenges, perhaps, are bigger than they've ever been, and as inflation adds to that, I think there are significant challenges.&nbsp;\" said by Sian Gwynedd\n\"I'm sorry. We'll have to move on, I'm afraid. I know that there is a great deal to say on this issue, but because of time pressures we'll move to Hefin David. I think we have a problem with Hefin's sound. Can you hear me now? Okay. We can't hear you, Hefin. We'll go to Carolyn and then we'll come back to you, Hefin, because we can't hear you. Can the sound operators help Hefin, please? We'll go to Carolyn for now.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Thanks. I can't actually log\u2014. Oh, it's come back. I was going to ask you a question about equality and diversity within the industry. How thorough and accurate do you think the data is regarding equality, diversity and inclusion in the screen industries in Wales, and how can it be improved? That's the first question.&nbsp;\" said by Carolyn Thomas MS\n\"From our perspective, we've got quite a lot of work to do from a data perspective. We're just putting in Diamond so that we can measure that. We've made a conscious effort to move towards being inclusive across Wales and representative of all of Wales, but I have to declare we've got work to do; it's one of our biggest priorities to do that. I think it's across all areas, though, from disability as well as equality of socioeconomic, and we're looking at all of that and how we can reflect Wales. One of the biggest things that we've done is put Gogglebocs on tv, which is very reflective of all of Wales and very visible as well. And it's made a difference in terms of perception, and so on, of the channel. It's a real priority for me, very close to my heart, and things that we are looking to do. However, we do work with a lot of people like It's My Shout and ScreenSkills to make sure that our priorities\u2014. And therefore we can see that diversity coming through, not only in front of the camera but also behind, and that comes with its own challenges as well. But I can't tell you that my data is as good as it should be, and hopefully in a year's time when you speak to me, we will be in a much better place as a channel to be able to quote back where we're at in terms of our representation of across Wales.&nbsp;\" said by ", "answer": "Si\u00e2n Doyle"}
{"content": "\"We're delighted to have with us, for a short period today, the Minister for Climate Change, Julie James\u2014thank you very much for joining us, Julie, and also, Ed Sherriff, deputy director of energy.We're going to turn directly to the main first item on our agenda, item No. 2, which is the Welsh Government's legislative consent memorandum on the Energy Bill. This is a short session and we want to go straight to the crux. We don't look at the intricacies of the policy issues here; we look at it very much through the lens of the Legislation, Justice and Constitution Committee. And what we want to focus on, Minister, is the process by which we've got to the laying of this LCM here. So, let me cut straight to the chase, then. We're trying to work out why it's taken 51 weeks to get a legislative consent memorandum laid on the Energy Bill, and not least because we're aware that the Scottish Government laid its memorandum 10 months ago and a supplementary memorandum six months ago. So, for us, we're trying to find out\u2014. We're trying to get to the nub of this, keeping the Senedd up to date with developments, so that's why we asked you to come and try and explain to us why we're in this predicament.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Diolch, Cadeirydd. It's good to be with you. I'm afraid, I do need to give you a short history of how we got here since that's very germane to the question in point. So, the Bill was first introduced back when Kwasi Kwarteng was the Secretary of State for the then Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The UK Government paused work on the Bill to rush through the Energy Prices Bill. By the time they'd done that, the Bill was then led by the new Secretary of State, Jacob Rees-Mogg, and is now under its third Secretary of State within a new UK Government department. So, it was less than clear to anyone at all what was going to happen with this Bill, to put it mildly.We do what we can to ensure that our legislature gets the opportunity to properly scrutinise UK legislation, which engages the Sewel convention. I genuinely do want the Senedd to be able to scrutinise that. It's very useful to the Government as well and, anyway, it's the right thing to do. But late engagement from the UK Government puts extreme time pressures on that. We would have very much wanted for the Welsh Government to have been involved in the development of the Bill months before the Bill was published. We would have had detailed discussions with UK Government Ministers on matters within our competence and so on. Not a single scrap of that happened at all. Nothing, absolutely not. So, we're continually challenging the UK Government to improve its engagement on this. This causes us really serious resource issues, because they literally come out of the blue. So we haven't had any build-up to it. You're just suddenly presented with something that officials have got to get themselves up to speed on, et cetera.&nbsp;The devolution settlement for Wales relating to energy is complex and difficult, unlike the devolution settlement for Scotland, which is much more clear-cut. So,&nbsp; Scotland would have had a much more clear-cut position from an earlier stage than we do, because it's so complex here with the varying levels and competencies and so on, and, in all honesty, Scotland, has a big team of civil servants who are used to dealing with energy, because of their oil and gas history and so on, and we don't. So, today, Chair, another colleague, Rhiannon Phillips, should be here, as the person who's dealt with this all the way through. She has a very bad virus\u2014not COVID\u2014but is out of action, and so the deputy director is here, because there isn't anybody else. You have to bear in mind the resource constraints that we're operating under. Some of the issues in the Energy Bill are novel, so they're carbon capture and storage, for example, or hydrogen, where the Welsh Government hasn't necessarily got a developed policy to bring into play, so we're trying to twin-track some stuff. And, frankly, I'm quite annoyed by the situation the UK Government has put in where we're struggling to keep up with the changes in a Bill that are rapid and don't involve us at the right level at all. To lay an LCM, we have to be able to tell the committee what the LCM is going to do, whether we think it's a good idea for it to happen or not, and so on; we just haven't been in that position, that's the truth of it. We've gone back and forth, back and forth. As we are, we're not happy with the situation we've ended up in. It's not the situation I would have liked to have been in at all, both from the point of view of scrutiny, but actually from the point of view of the Bill itself, which is not at all what we want it to be. Like it or not, that affects our ability to lay the LCM and the officials that are working on it.So, this is not a position I am proud of or would want to have happen, but I absolutely understand the poor policy officials who've been trying to twin-track this as they go along. I'd have loved to have been in a position to update you on the lovely inter-governmental work on the Bill and the fact that we were going to approve the LCM because we'd got it to where we\u2014. That's not where we are, I'm afraid.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Thank you for that frank and honest assessment of why we are where we are. By the way, we extend our sympathies to the member of your team who was going to be with us today and can't be with us. You've laid out the issues of late engagement and difficult engagement of the UK Government, resource issues where you clearly say that the Scotland resourcing is more significant than it is here in Wales, that it is a more straightforward devolution picture in Scotland than it is in Wales, and parts of this Bill are novel. Okay, that's quite a stout argument of why we are where we are.But then, if I can extend it, how do we then avoid this situation, recognising what you've just said, Minister? And by the way, we don't bring a Minister here in this situation in any way to put them in the pillories and so on. It's to try and understand how we can improve the scrutiny. I know you realise that as well, and you've expressed your regret. This would not be an ideal situation to be in. But how do we avoid the situation where we have to explain to the Senedd as a committee that, actually, what we're now being asked to do is to fast-track a piece of scrutiny within a matter of two or three weeks, when it's been 51 weeks in the offing? That's a difficult one to actually rationalise on the floor with elected Members.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Yes, I completely and utterly accept that. So, part of the complexity, forgive me, has been in trying to understand where the devolution settlement is in this and what parts of it are engaged. Assuming you accept our view, it's slightly easier, but I do accept it's not ideal.Just to make the offer, Chair, our officials stand ready to support the committee both in understanding the Bill and the LCM, and are very happy to extend support to the clerking team over the summer if that's of any help at all. We do understand the difficulty.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Yes, we appreciate that.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"There are new sections as well in the Bill, so we're going to have to put a supplementary LCM to you. We're going to work on that as soon as possible, but this isn't even the end stage, I'm afraid. So, this is an ongoing\u2014. I mean, there's just nothing good to say about the way the UK Government has treated the devolution settlement. The Bill has been drafted without any nod to devolution whatsoever. If I'm honest\u2014forgive me, Ed, I know the civil service wouldn't express this view, but from a political point of view, I would say that it's news to the energy team [correction: the UK Government energy team] that there is such a thing as a devolution settlement. It's been a hard-fought battle to get them to even understand what we're trying to say.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"We'll come to James now, who'll take us into that territory, but one of the things we appreciate your frankness on, to be honest, as well, is the issue of resources and the constraints. I suspect this is something that we've flagged up on a number of occasions on different policy areas with Welsh Government, and to have it laid out as starkly as that, I think, is quite telling. James, over to you.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Diolch, Gadeirydd. Minister, it's interesting what you say, because in paragraph 9 of the memorandum, you did indicate that the Welsh Government was involved with some engagement with the UK Government and that Welsh Government asked for some clauses to be changed and included in the Bill. What specific engagement did take place and what clauses did UK Government share with you, and how did all this engagement take place, because what we've just got from you is that no engagement took place at all?\" said by James Evans MS\n\"Well, I didn't say that no engagement took place at all. I said that it took place very late after the Bill had been largely drafted and that I would have expected to have been involved in the run-up to the Bill, not involved once the Bill has been submitted. So, in normal circumstances, if there was a Bill in the offing, we would work closely with the relevant sections of the UK Government on the draft Bill in the run-up. So, by the time we got anywhere near having to consider an LCM, we would have been involved all the way through. Well, that just did not happen in this case. So, what I would say, James, is that we\u2019re playing catch-up all the time once that\u2019s happened and the Bill has been drafted in that way.So, there are a number of new policies in the Bill, so the British energy security strategy, which was published in April 2022, for example, there was absolutely no engagement with us prior to the strategy being published. So, the priorities and policies in it and the subsequent incorporation into the Bill reflect the UK Government position only, and don\u2019t reflect our position at all.&nbsp;There were technical engagement sessions on some of the policy areas, but that was really around how we would deploy carbon capture and storage, rather than around the governance and regulation bits of it, which were the ones that we were interested in in a devolution sense, although in a policy sense, we\u2019re obviously interested in all of it.We had small extracts of the Bill shared in isolation, but all 346 pages of the Bill were shared the evening before it was published. And I will say, Chair, I have, a number of times, not just in this instance, been summoned to speak to a Minister of the UK Government at 17:30 with no idea of what they want to talk to me about, only to be told that tomorrow morning, they\u2019re going to publish X, so that they can say they\u2019ve consulted us. Well, I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s sufficient consultation at all. The officials have made themselves available for engagement and so on, but it\u2019s been really, really difficult to do that, because the business models for hydrogen and CCS, for example, we have to develop the policy at the same time because of the way that they\u2019ve done the Bill. So, you\u2019re trying to twin-track both the Welsh Government\u2019s policy development and the Bill. It\u2019s just not ideal at all.But they didn\u2019t seek our views before publication, as would be normal, and nothing at ministerial level has fundamentally changed since it was introduced, really. So, I\u2019ve had one ministerial meeting with Minister Bowie, which lasted 15 minutes, where it was very clear to us that UK Ministers were not going to have regard to devolution whatsoever. There are a number of letters that I have received no response to, including a letter requesting a meeting with UK Ministers to discuss the offshore wind environment improvement package, for example.I mean, I\u2019m sorry to be in this position, but really, it is what it is, so this has not been a happy development of a Bill. And I will say: it isn\u2019t normal for it to be like this. We do normally have much better engagement. So, that\u2019s why I say\u2014and I want to be very clear that it\u2019s a political view, and not the view of the civil service\u2014but I think that what we\u2019re looking at here is somebody who just did not realise that there was any devolution issue in it until the last minute.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"It\u2019s interesting you\u2019ve raised that, Minister, because what my supplementary question was actually going to be to you was: is this something you\u2019ve seen across your portfolio? Because as you said, there\u2019s normally engagement at an early stage. Is it just this individual Minister or individual department from UK Government that has caused these problems? Because we\u2019ve heard from other Welsh Government Ministers that some departments are very engaging with the devolved Governments and get them involved early. So, is this something just from the energy side of it, perhaps from UK Government, because that\u2019s something we could follow-up on as well, then?\" said by James Evans MS\n\"It\u2019s really hard for us to say, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s a new department, so it could be that people are being brought together from across\u2014. Or I can speculate, but it would be speculation; I don\u2019t really know. But it\u2019s not normal for it to be like this. It\u2019s happened a number of times more recently, which I\u2019ve highlighted, but I\u2019ve been a Minister for long time now, and this is getting more frequent just recently, but it hasn\u2019t been the normal way to work. And I think from a policy point of view, our officials are used to working up the policy before a draft Bill even arrives. So, we\u2019re in a far better position to understand what the draft Bill is going to do; we understand whether it requires an LCM or not; we understand what our governance and constitutional arrangements need to be to go with that Bill, and we can put that in train. We can get the Trefnydd to announce it in the right way, and so on. Well, if you\u2019re just dumped with a Bill the next day, it\u2019s near impossible to do any of that, and I\u2019m afraid that that\u2019s the situation we've found ourselves in here.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Okay.\" said by James Evans MS\n\"Can I just give you an example of some of the engagement? A week before the Bill was introduced, we were shared some of the clauses around the new powers for the oil and gas authority to oversee and implement the carbon capture use and storage regulations, so we had those six clauses, all relating to the powers for change of company ownership for carbon capture and storage, and we said, \u2018Well, okay, that\u2019s fine, but what is the regime that the oil and gas authority are overseeing? What\u2019s the detail, what\u2019s the policy?\u2019 And that wasn\u2019t shared to us, so we saw a very small detail, a detail that comes in at, I think, clause 92 to 95, that covers all parts A and B, and we didn't see the policy intent.\" said by Ed Sherriff\n\"That's characterised the approach for this Bill.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Yes, for this Bill\u2014absolutely.\" said by Ed Sherriff\n\"Minister, as you said, it's not an ideal situation to be in, and you've outlined that you don't think it respects the devolved competencies of the Senedd or Ministers, but we are where we are. What I'm interested in is, when you've written to the UK Government, what amendments to the Bill have been sought here for Welsh Ministers, on the face of it. Just so we can understand what you're trying to get out of this Bill as well.\" said by ", "answer": "James Evans MS"}
{"content": "\"Good afternoon and welcome to this Plenary meeting. The first item on our agenda this afternoon is questions to the First Minister, and the first question is from Jane Dodds.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"1. Will the First Minister make a statement on ambulance response times? OQ59013\" said by Jane Dodds MS\n\"I thank Jane Dodds, Llywydd, for that question. Record levels of demand have placed real pressures on ambulance response times, with lengthy delays for some patients. Nevertheless, in December\u2014the most difficult month\u2014the service responded to the highest ever number of red calls within the eight-minute target.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Thank you for that response.\" said by Jane Dodds MS\n\"It's 13:30. If somebody phones 999 now because they have chest pains, when would you expect an ambulance to arrive? I'm sure you'll recognise that question from the leader of the Labour Party in Westminster, Keir Starmer, to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister refused a straight answer, so I'm hoping that we can get a straight answer from you this afternoon. But, from NHS Wales stats, we know that, for the person who's just called 999 with those chest pains\u2014surprisingly not a red call, but an amber call\u2014they will likely wait over an hour for an ambulance to arrive. If the person who'd just called 999 was in a life-threatening situation\u2014a red call\u2014they could wait as long as 15 minutes in Powys. The target, as you know, for those red calls, is eight minutes, and the last time those targets were met was July 2020, and the figures have been in free fall ever since.&nbsp;Our ambulance staff work incredibly hard under very difficult circumstances. 'Diolch' to them all. So, could you tell me when you expect these targets to be met? Will it be another two and a half years before the red call targets can be met? Diolch.&nbsp;\" said by Jane Dodds MS\n\"Well, Llywydd, let me, first of all, answer the specific question that Jane Dodds asked in introducing her supplementary question. The management information provided in the Welsh NHS suggests that, last week, the week beginning 16 January, had it been a red call, the standard waiting time\u2014the median waiting time\u2014from the minute a call is dispatched to it arriving with a patient was seven minutes, 43 seconds. That means, given the time that a first question on a Tuesday normally takes, by the time the question is over, the ambulance would have left and arrived. And if it were an amber call, as Jane Dodds suggested, then the average response time last week\u2014the standard response time\u2014was 38 minutes, 52 seconds.&nbsp;On the broader point, when the ambulance service last reached the target that we have set for it, it had done so for 48 months consecutively. And what happened was, in July 2020, the impact of the pandemic undid those four years of absolutely consistently meeting the targets that had been set. It is a slow recovery from all of that. But, Llywydd, as I said, it is not necessarily because the supply of service has diminished; it's because the demand for the service has gone up. In December, more calls than at any other time\u2014more than any month in that 48-month period\u2014more calls were answered within the target time. It is simply that the volume of calls far exceeds anything that happened in any one of those months, and despite, as Jane Dodds very fairly said, the enormous efforts of ambulance staff, when you have a rise in demand of that sort, the percentage of calls that are answered within the target time cannot be sustained.&nbsp;The combination of additional investment and, particularly, additional staff, is the way in which we will succeed in returning the ambulance to the level of achievement that it itself would wish to see for its patients.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"First Minister, in December, less than 40 per cent of life-threatening calls received an ambulance response time within your Government's eight-minute target\u2014a record low. And if that isn't a crisis, then I wonder what is a crisis. But, given the pressure on the ambulance service, which I understand the reasons for, the Wales air ambulance service is, of course, all the more crucial for constituents like mine in mid Wales. So, given the state of the overall ambulance service in Wales, can I ask if the current service levels will be taken into account in the Wales air ambulance review, which is currently under way, and, if they aren't, do you think they should be? As you know, there is great respect and support for the Wales air ambulance, and it's greatly appreciated by the people of mid Wales. There is anxiety at the moment with people who are waiting for an ambulance, and their families as well, but there's even greater anxiety in mid Wales, and I hope you can understand how the current proposals are causing significant anxiety across my constituency.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Llywydd, as I know Russell George will be aware, the chief ambulance service commissioner is leading a review on behalf of the Emergency Ambulance Services Committee. That review is now in the period of formal engagement; no decision on the outcome has been made. And the points that the Member makes, and makes powerfully on behalf of his constituents, will of course be heard in that review, alongside all the other evidence. The aim of the Wales air ambulance service, which is absolutely a very highly respected and very effective service, is to use the resources it has in a way that reaches the largest number of patients and delivers them that effective service. That will be the basis of the review.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"There are so many things, of course, that contribute to the pressures on the ambulance service, the kinds of pressures that forced a constituent of mine to wait 24 hours for an ambulance, having broken her hip. Now, the five-point plan for health and care services, published today by Plaid Cymru in partnership with many health organisations, touches upon some of the elements that could help in the short term and the longer term in responding to those pressures: the need to settle the pay dispute, supporting the workforce, improving patient flow through the system, and operating in a more preventative way in order to reduce pressures on the ambulance service and other services. It all interweaves. Does the First Minister agree with me that what we are seeing in the pressures on the ambulance service is the best example, possibly, of the unsustainable health system that we have, and a health system in crisis, and that we must acknowledge that in order to start providing solutions and resolutions?\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"Llywydd, I thank Rhun ap Iorwerth for that question. I've had a brief opportunity to have a look at the plan that Plaid Cymru published today. What the pressure on the ambulance service means is that demand for health services over the winter has been very great\u2014greater than at any time in the history of the NHS. We have a plan already. Of course, we're willing to consider the points in the Plaid Cymru plan to see whether there is more that can be done. But, through the financial investment that we're making, but also, as I said in my reply to Jane Dodds, our investment in more people to work in the area, that's the way to try and help us to do better in the future.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"First Minister, it is important that all of us here in Senedd Cymru, the Welsh Parliament, are candid about the real challenges facing our beloved national health service right across the four nations of the United Kingdom. In England, in December, calls from people with life-threatening illness or injuries saw an ambulance response time of 10 minutes and 57 seconds. In Wales, in December, the average response time was 10 minutes, where previously the average, over the four years up to that month, was six minutes. So, two neighbouring countries with almost identical ambulance response times in December for the most urgent calls. Yet, there is one fundamental difference between Wales and England: Wales is led by the Labour Party, which created the national health service and will do all that it can to forever ensure that it continues to be free at the point of care for those who call on its services, whilst in England, the Tory UK Government and ex-English health secretary Sajid Javid are openly theorising about introducing changes and charges to even see a GP\u2014privatisation through the front door. First Minister, what assurances, then, can you give the people of Islwyn and Wales that our NHS will be prioritised in Wales as a truly national, free public health service that lives up to its illustrious legacy, is fit for purpose and offers peace of mind that, when 999 is called, an ambulance will promptly arrive?&nbsp;\" said by Rhianon Passmore AM\n\"Well, Llywydd, the urgent call ambulance that was dispatched when Jane Dodds asked me her question has now been at the scene for the last three minutes. I say that just to give colleagues here some sense of the service that continues to be provided in every part of Wales. I give Rhianon Passmore an assurance, of course, that here in Wales there are no plans to use the pressures faced by the national health service as an excuse to do away with that service. There's no doubt at all, is there, that there are elements in the Conservative Party nationally who think that the pressures that the health service faces are an excuse to undo the work that that service provides across the whole of the United Kingdom. We will never do that here in Wales, where the health Minister and the First Minister, who are responsible for these services in Wales, are able to give Rhianon Passmore exactly the assurance she was asking for.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"2. Will the First Minister make a statement on the accessibility of public transport for those who are visually impaired? OQ59018\" said by Joel James MS\n\"I thank the Member for that question, Llywydd. We recognise the importance of making public transport in Wales safe, welcoming and accessible to everyone. We will continue to work with Transport for Wales, local authorities and the public transport providers to ensure services are designed and delivered with the involvement of those with direct experience of visual impairment.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Thank you, First Minister. As I am sure you'll agree with me, the experience that some disabled people have in Wales when they're accessing public transport still falls woefully short of the standards that we expect and they deserve. I regularly receive communication from residents in my region complaining about the lack of thought and care for them and their needs, and a recent e-mail from a resident who has just lost her eyesight shows how frightening and dangerous travelling by rail from the Valleys into Cardiff, and then on to elsewhere, can be. There was no assistance available for them when boarding or departing any of the trains, which was terrifying for them because of the large gap between the train and the platform. They also received no help whatsoever in trying to get through the ticket barriers, which caused considerable panic as they struggled to find the ticket slot. Moreover, not only were they unable to purchase a ticket prior to travel, as there was no ticket office and the machines weren't suitable for those with visual impairment, but they were even prevented from using their railcard by the onboard ticket collector as they had not purchased their ticket prior to travel, which was actually the wrong course of action. Therefore, First Minister, I'd like to know what assessment has the Welsh Government made of the problems of those who are visually impaired or suffer from blindness are experiencing when using rail services in Wales? And what assurances can you give that assistance will be made available for those with visual impairment and other disabilities when accessing the new south Wales metro system? Thank you.&nbsp;\" said by Joel James MS\n\"I thank Joel James for that. It's never good to hear of the sort of experience that he has set out, but I am able to say to him and to the Chamber that this topic was absolutely at the forefront of a recent meeting of the ministerial disability equality forum, chaired by my colleague Jane Hutt, at the end of November\u2014a meeting that focused on the experience of people with disabilities, including a good representation of people who are themselves visually impaired, together with the chief executive of Transport for Wales and senior Welsh Government transport staff. That meeting will be followed up with a further meeting in February. The meeting did explore some of the barriers that people who face difficulties in using public transport have experienced in making their voices powerfully heard with the providers of that transport. But it was a very full and frank exchange of those views, and the conclusion was that it had opened up the way to make sure that, for those people who give their time voluntarily to be part of the accessibility panel that Transport for Wales holds, the work can be more effective in making sure that services are properly available to people who are visually impaired or have other disabilities in the future. That disability panel has been there for some time; it has already had an impact on the work of Transport for Wales. I'm sure, given the account that Joel James read out, he will want to congratulate Transport for Wales on its decision not to close ticket offices in Wales as has been announced for every station in England.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"First Minister, turning to bus services, which are, of course, the most heavily utilised part of our public transport system, and, obviously, in light of the fact that the Welsh Government is developing its proposals for legislative change and a new model for running bus services, talking signs are one solution whereby people affected by sight loss can access travel information at bus stops. Has any consideration been given to introducing similar schemes here in Wales in light of the proposals around the future of our bus services?\" said by Vikki Howells AM\n\"Llywydd, I thank Vikki Howells for that. The White Paper that we published in advance of the bus Bill set out plans to include passenger voices at the very top level of a new bus system, to make sure that direct feedback from people who use that service, and particularly those who need additional assistance to do so, are heard powerfully in the system we intend to create. The idea that Vikki Howells has suggested of bus stops being able to provide information that you can hear as well as information that you can see is something that we will discuss with local authorities as part of a wider programme of work to make bus stops more accessible to a wider range of people. The legislative proposals that we will bring in front of the Senedd will certainly make it easier to share high-quality and up-to-date information about bus services and, therefore, to make them more accessible to passengers.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Questions now from the party leaders. Leader of the Conservatives, Andrew R.T. Davies.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Thank you, Presiding Officer. First Minister, many of us would have watched the tv programme last night and found it deeply uncomfortable, the revelations on BBC Wales about the culture, and the weekly and monthly difficulties that women in sport, in Welsh rugby face. These allegations, obviously, some are proven and some are unproven. I make no direct allegations against any individual, but the programme set out a very troubling sequence of events that was corroborated by several witnesses who had been at the coalface at the Welsh Rugby Union.I understand that the Deputy Minister for Arts and Sport has spoken with the Welsh Rugby Union today, or certainly very recently. Are you able to update what actions the Welsh Government are taking to engage with the Welsh Rugby Union in light of these allegations? And are you minded, on what you've seen so far, to engage further so that these allegations can be put to rest, and make sure that whoever chooses to play rugby here in Wales, whether they are men or women, plays in a safe environment, an environment that values the contribution that they make to the sport and, above all, the national position that the Welsh Rugby Union holds within our great country?\" said by Andrew RT Davies AM\n\"Llywydd, I entirely agree with the sentiments with which the leader of the opposition ended his question. The meeting between Dawn Bowden and the Welsh Rugby Union took place yesterday afternoon. The Welsh Government, in that meeting, made it clear to the WRU that we need to see urgent and transparent action that helps restore confidence in the WRU itself, and that requires a public recognition on the part of the WRU of the scale and nature of the issues that were rehearsed in that programme. We will absolutely continue to engage with the WRU. As Andrew Davies says, it occupies a place in Welsh public life and it needs itself to recognise that significance. We will continue to be in a challenging, where necessary, conversation with them to make sure that a future is set out for the Welsh Rugby Union that commands the confidence of all of those who are players of the game and who are engaged in wanting to see it have a successful future.\" said by ", "answer": "Mark Drakeford AM"}
{"content": "\"Good afternoon, and welcome, all, to this Plenary meeting. The first item on our agenda this afternoon is questions to the Minister for Finance and Local Government, and the first question this afternoon is from Si\u00e2n Gwenllian.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"1. How will the Welsh Government support the successful efforts taking place in Arfon and elsewhere to attract more women to be county councillors? OQ59302\" said by Si\u00e2n Gwenllian AM\n\"I welcome the actions being taken across Wales to encourage individuals to put themselves forward for elected office. Diversity delivers better, more inclusive decision making. In advance of the 2027 local elections, work to encourage diversity includes the programme for government commitment to extend the access to elected office fund.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Since the county council elections a year ago, around 35 per cent of councillors in Wales are women. In Arfon, we succeeded in increasing the number of women standing for Plaid Cymru by 21 per cent. This was the result of intentional work by some of us, a great many encouraging conversations, training, mentoring, and the support has continued over the past year for them since the election. But do you agree that we need statutory measures to create the genuine change across Wales's councils to reach a position of equality? And what work is ongoing to create that statutory change that is needed?\" said by Si\u00e2n Gwenllian AM\n\"A range of work is ongoing at the moment in order to try and ensure that we have a more diverse group of people putting themselves forward for election, for both town and community councils, and county and country borough councils, in future. And those include the reviewing of the access to elected office fund, which was very successful in supporting a number of candidates to become town and community councillors at the last elections, but also looking to see how job sharing, for example, can be extended to more roles within councils, to recognise how important that is for becoming a more attractive option for a wider range of people. We know that women, in particular, and those with caring responsibilities, find that particularly attractive. And we've also been exploring what more we can do in terms of widening the access to hybrid meetings as a way of working, which, again, supports a more diverse group of people. But in terms of making those things statutory\u2014I suppose we're talking about gender quotas here\u2014I think there is a conversation to be had about that, but it's not one of our key proposals at the moment in terms of reforms, but, certainly, something that we should be having a discussion about. I'm very keen to have more of a discussion with Si\u00e2n Gwenllian about her ideas in that space.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"I've been proud to host and speak at both the 2022 and 2023 Equal Power Equal Voice Senedd events, celebrating the Equal Power Equal Voice project, a mentoring programme aiming to increase diversity of representation in public and political life in Wales. Equal Power Equal Voice, or EPEV, is a partnership between Women's Equality Network Wales, Stonewall Cymru, Disability Wales, and Ethnic Minorities and Youth Support Team Wales. And I was also pleased to participate in last month's north Wales regional meet-up for the EPEV programme, at the Autistic UK office in Llandudno, meeting and getting to know more about the mentees in north Wales. Although most of those attending were women, both men and women also identified inter-sectional issues, including disability and sexuality, which combined to create barriers for them. What positive action is the Welsh Government therefore taking with people to address this, in order to increase diversity of representation in public and political life in Wales?\" said by Mark Isherwood AM\n\"I'd like to begin, really, by joining Mark Isherwood in recognising the importance of mentoring schemes. I've been a mentor myself in one of the schemes, and I found that probably as valuable to me as to the mentee, so I would absolutely encourage all colleagues to look at opportunities to support those kinds of schemes. One of the things that we have been doing is trying to widen our evidence base, looking at protected characteristics, and we undertook a survey of members of the public about their perceptions of local councillors, but then, also, our candidates surveys. And those surveys do show that there is a real lack of diversity, and they did give us some kind of insight, really, as to what the barriers are, in terms of allowing people with protected characteristics\u2014often, one or more of those protected characteristics\u2014being able to participate fully in local democracy. So, building on that suite of research, we've been able to hold a range of workshops, whereby we invited elected members, but also representatives of a range of organisations representing diverse, protected characteristics, to talk in a bit more depth about the barriers that there are to people becoming involved in elected politics. And I think that those workshops have been really helpful. They've recently concluded, so now we're looking at all of the learning that we had from those workshops in order to try and help us set out the next steps in this important agenda.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"2. How is the Welsh Government supporting local authorities to provide access to local crematoriums? OQ59305\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Local authorities are burial authorities and responsible for their own cemeteries and crematoriums. It is for local planning authorities to identify suitable sites for new crematoriums. Proposals for new crematoriums would be subject to planning and environmental law.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Thank you, Minister, for your answer. There is no crematorium in Powys. Many of my constituents have to travel into England, and the vast majority of my constituents have to travel over an hour to the nearest crematorium. So, clearly, this is not ideal for grieving families or friends, or, indeed, very sustainable at all either. Most crematoriums, of course, in Wales are owned and managed by local authorities, but I'm keen to know how the Welsh Government can support either a local authority or a private business to build and provide crematorium services in my constituency. And I ask the question in the context that there was an application in my constituency in north Powys from a private developer to build a crematorium. It was supported by the local authority in principle, and through the planning process as well, but it was rejected by Welsh Government after a call-in.&nbsp;So, what I'm very keen to understand from you, Minister, is how you can support, and Welsh Government can support, either a local authority or a private developer to build a crematorium and provide those services in my constituency, because a private developer isn't going to do that unless they know that their risk is minimalised and they have the support of the Welsh Government. So, can you perhaps give advice to me, and any private developer that wants to build a crematorium in north Powys, to support my constituents?\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Thank you to Russell George for raising this issue this afternoon. I am aware of the particular application to which he refers, which was called in and then subsequently refused. The reasons for that are set out in the decision letter, and, because it is open to the applicant to challenge the decision in the High Court, I won't say any more about that application today. But I understand the more general request for information, and, I suppose, the advice would be for the interested private business to have discussions with the local authority in the first instance, because assessment for the need for crematoriums is locally led, and local planning authorities will need to take into account a range of factors, such as drive time, catchment for the existing provision\u2014Russell George has set out some of the challenges there\u2014the capacity of existing provision, and population and demographics, as well as planned housing developments in the area. And, obviously, the authority would want to take into account the views of the local residents as well. Guidance on the establishment of crematoria, including meeting the requirements under the legislation, is available from the Federation of Burial and Cremation Authorities, and that might be another source of useful information for the individual concerned, and for Russell George.&nbsp;\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Questions now from party spokespeople. The Conservative spokesperson, Sam Rowlands.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Diolch, Llywydd, and good afternoon, Minister. As I'm sure you'll gladly recall, earlier this month I wrote a letter to you regarding council tax exemptions, in particular relating to the 182-day regulations for self-catering businesses in Wales. In this letter, I asked for an update on what exemptions will be made in relation to those regulations, and I was grateful to receive your response following the explanatory memorandum published on 6 March. Minister, you will know that these new regulations, with such limited exemptions, will mean that many genuine, well-established businesses in Wales will now pay thousands of pounds in tax that they previously had not done, or had not had to plan for, some of that being retrospective, therefore making some of these businesses unviable. So, Minister, what is your assessment of this?&nbsp;\" said by Sam Rowlands MS\n\"The Welsh Government has tried to set out a position where we recognise the pressures on businesses, but also believe that the owners of properties should be making a reasonable contribution to the communities in which those properties are situated. We have recognised that some self-catering properties are restricted by planning conditions, preventing permanent occupation as somebody's main residence, and, in the regulations, which we laid on 6 March and which come into force on 1 April 2023, we recognise that in terms of the letting criteria and the maximum council tax premium. It is important, though, that where statutory exemptions are clearly definable in legislation and would be appropriate in all circumstances where they apply, that we use that as the format and the basis for taking our decisions, because planning conditions, I think, do satisfy those requirements as being clear and permanent and having their own legislative basis, and, where they apply, they apply in a consistent way. So that, I think, is an appropriate basis upon which to take decisions. I know that colleagues have provided a long list of other potential areas for exemptions, and we have looked at all of those in detail, but the regulations as laid, I think, set out a reasonable approach to move forward.&nbsp;\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Thank you for that answer, Minister. As you've outlined, the main exemption put in place in relation to planning conditions specifies properties may only be used for holiday lets et cetera. But you also noted in your response just then the other exemptions that were sought by these businesses in Wales, and, in particular, this included an exemption for registered charities that provide respite for carers and properties that cater for those people with special needs. So, in light of this, Minister, will you reassess your council tax premiums and look at introducing an exemption for those who provide respite care in Wales?&nbsp;\" said by Sam Rowlands MS\n\"We have looked at the case made by you and by others in respect of where a property is run by a charity, and I think that the circumstances will depend on the particular situation relating to that property. Some will already be covered by an existing exemption or by the new exemption, and, in cases where that's not so, authorities do have discretionary powers that they can use. The nature of charitable lettings can vary, and it would be difficult to define a specific category for this, but I think that there are cases where local authorities will be looking to the revised and refreshed guidance, which the Welsh Government is providing to help them take those decisions, when they believe that there is a real case for a individual property or a group of properties or a category of properties locally to be exempted.&nbsp;\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"I thank you, again, for that response, Minister. I'm sure you would be the first to acknowledge the importance of these self-catering businesses in supporting our communities, both in the jobs that they create and sustain and the difference that they make to their communities, and I'm sure you'd also acknowledge and accept some of their anxiety and worry due to these 182-day regulations that they're facing at the moment, and many hoped that there would be some sensible exemptions to the premiums, but, clearly, this hasn't been delivered, and I think this needs to be reiterated here today. But, in light of this, Minister, will you today commit to working closely with this really important sector to ensure that we don't see these legitimate, hard-working businesses close, which would consequently result in loss of jobs and, therefore, an impact on our communities here in Wales?&nbsp;\" said by Sam Rowlands MS\n\"The Welsh Government does work very, very closely with the tourism sector, and we do listen very carefully to the representations that they make on behalf of their members. I think that Sam Rowlands will recognise that we are trying to strike a balance here between supporting the tourism industry and allowing that to thrive and supporting that to thrive, but at the same time recognising that there is an important issue in terms of underused properties, particularly in some of our more rural and coastal communities, where there's a great deal of tourism but not opportunities for local individuals to rent or buy a home. So, I do think that we are trying to strike a balance in what is quite a challenging situation.&nbsp;\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"The Plaid Cymru spokesperson, Llyr Gruffydd.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Diolch yn fawr iawn, Llywydd. Minister, the Barnett formula all too often ends up being a rather convenient reason, some would say, for the Welsh Government to delay implementing transformative policies. The most recent case in point, maybe, relates to public sector pay here in Wales. Because we do know that, very often, the lack of action in England leaves Welsh Ministers sitting on their hands\u2014you would say, 'having to sit on our hands', I'd imagine. Do you agree that the recent UK Government budget and the continued fiasco around HS2 funding, and now the even more absurd decision on no consequential funding to Wales from the Northern Powerhouse Rail work, has again underlined what Plaid Cymru has long advocated\u2014that we need to move away from the current arrangement to a needs-based funding formula, delivered through an independent office of fair funding, which would have a legal obligation to deliver a fairer economic balance across the nations and regions of the UK, legally bound to ensure that public money delivers equality of outcomes right across the United Kingdom?\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"I would say that the Barnett formula and the fiscal framework that was agreed by the First Minister when he was in this role with the UK Government actually does provide some advantages to Wales in terms of the fact that the Barnett formula does recognise relative need. I think that's important and that's certainly something that we wouldn't want to move away from. I think that, where there are challenges\u2014as the First Minister, I think, set out in First Minister's questions yesterday\u2014is where the UK Government is the judge and jury in terms of the application of the Barnett formula. I think that that is where some of those real challenges arise, for example the classification of HS2 as an England-and-Wales project when it self-evidently isn't. HM Treasury's own analysis suggests that it will have a disbenefit to south-west Wales. I think that all of those things do lead us to the point where I think a more independent look at the Barnett formula and how it's applied is important. I think that the work that we've done in terms of inter-governmental relations is important as well. When we get to the point of testing some of this through the disputes mechanism, I think it will be an important moment for us to make those arguments quite clearly to the UK Government, using the process that we've agreed.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"I'm not sure any of us would relish having to run through those processes, to be honest, because I fear that we maybe know what the outcome might be. But there we are; we won't go there.Really, it sounded a little bit as if you were making excuses for Barnett earlier on in your answer, but we know that by placing relative need first and foremost within the arrangement, we'd then be able to direct more public finances to address some of the socioeconomic and environmental challenges that we face here in Wales. Needs arising from our ageing demographics, for example, would then translate into increased funding for health and social care. Low employment would incentivise increased spending on education and training. Climate adaptation would necessitate funding then for more green energy investment. Without such reform, Wales is just going to be locked into the current cycle where we depend on a UK Chancellor making spending commitments for England before we can then subsequently act here in Wales.What commitment can you give, Minister, as a Labour Minister here in Wales, that any incoming UK Labour Government would actually overhaul Wales's funding settlement to achieve that fairer, economic balance across the regions and nations of the UK\u2014something, of course, that would fiscally empower you as a Welsh finance Minister to deliver on our priorities here in Wales, rather, of course, than having to wait, as we do currently, for England to act before we can make the investment that we so desperately need here in Wales?\" said by ", "answer": "Llyr Gruffydd AM"}
{"content": "\"Good afternoon and welcome to this Plenary meeting. The first item this afternoon is questions to the First Minister, and the first question is from Laura Anne Jones.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"1. What consideration did the Welsh Government give to the Scottish gender recognition reform Bill when creating the 'LGBTQ+ Action Plan for Wales'? OQ59239\" said by Laura Anne Jones AM\n\"Llywydd, I thank the Member for that question. The commitment to seek devolved powers related to gender recognition, and to support our trans communities, was included in our programme for government and is part of the co-operation agreement. The LGBTQ+ action plan has included this commitment since its first draft. These are policies made in Wales, not in Scotland.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"First Minister, last month, you stated your intention to copy the Scottish self-ID Bill with the release of your LGBTQ+ action plan, which intends to make it easier for biological males to enter women-only spaces, push gender ideology in schools, and unfairness in sport. First Minister, there was outrage in Scotland at the gender recognition reform Bill, with polling consistently showing that the Scottish public did not agree with the move. And it's clear from public opinion across Wales and the UK that people see the importance of protecting women and girls, and why such a Bill would put that in jeopardy. Yet, you still push ahead with your plans. Did you learn nothing from the debacle in Scotland? This move to copy Scotland would only serve to deny biological fact and appease a small minority in your party. Men and women up and down the country are genuinely concerned with your blinkered vision on this, and are also concerned by the shadow Secretary of State's sharing images directly from your Welsh Labour conference inciting hate against those standing up for women and girls. First Minister, do you condone their behaviour, and do you finally understand the genuine concern at your plan and your intention to copy the Scottish self-ID Bill?&nbsp;\" said by Laura Anne Jones AM\n\"Llywydd, transgender people who are going through the process to change their legal sex deserve our respect, support and understanding. That is what the Conservative Secretary of State for Scotland said on the floor of the House of Commons when introducing the Government's proposal to block the gender recognition Act in Scotland. I think the Member could do very well to take what the Secretary of State for Scotland said to heart, and think about what she has said on the floor of the Senedd this afternoon through that lens.&nbsp;There is nothing in what this Government intends to do that would merit the description that the Member has offered us here this afternoon. We will pursue, as I said in my original answer, Llywydd, not policies developed elsewhere, but policies that we will develop here in Wales\u2014policies that were in our manifesto, on which we were elected, policies that have been there in our programme for government since the start of this Senedd term, and policies that are set out in more detail in the LGBTQ+ action plan, with its 46 different policy proposals. Those are based on that sense of respect, support and understanding, and if this debate was more characterised by those qualities, it would be a lot better for it.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"2. Will the First Minister make a statement on the Government's response to the roads review? OQ59264\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"I thank Rhun ap Iorwerth. The Government\u2019s response was set out by the Deputy Minister for Climate Change in a statement to the Senedd on 14 February.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Simply put, what I'm asking the First Minister to do today is to hold a genuine review of the decision not to proceed with the scheme for the Menai crossing. I note that the Burns commission has received a request to look at different options. I have put forward an argument to that commission for reviving this scheme. Of course, the roads review's focus on the environment was mainly the basis for the announcement. But I have a copy here of the consultation on the options for what kind of bridge to construct and what route to follow, and it shows that the Welsh Government itself selected the scheme that would be most damaging in terms of the impact on biodiversity and the environment, and would create the biggest increase in traffic. And it shows too that smaller schemes would be more cost-effective, potentially.&nbsp; I have to say that I had foreseen something simpler\u2014the dualling of the Britannia, to all intents and purposes, with active travel routes.So, I want the First Minister to look again at the original needs for the crossing and how to deliver them, and at the need to improve safety, opportunities for active travel, and the economic boost that comes from having a more resilient crossing\u2014for delivering on the free port, for example. The roads review itself shows that a new bridge would deliver all of those benefits. And part of the work, Llywydd, which needs to be done urgently, is to look again at how we can deliver that in a way that has the least negative impact on the environment. Will the First Minister agree to do that?\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"Well, Llywydd, I recall the context at the time when the then First Minister said that we would be continuing with the third crossing across the Menai strait, because I was Minister for finance at that time, and the context was that of Wylfa B. And I remember everything that we discussed at that time with the company responsible for the Wylfa B project\u2014whether it was possible to draw funding in for a third crossing, because there would be far more traffic flowing to Anglesey and off Anglesey. I also recall the discussions with the National Grid, and the original suggestion from the National Grid was to create a tunnel under the strait, and we were discussing with them whether it would be possible to use that funding to help with the cost of a bridge. So, the context has fundamentally changed, hasn\u2019t it, because everything that was on the table with Wylfa B isn\u2019t there now.But what I can tell the Member today is what is set out in our plan. We say that we want to see options for a crossing of the Menai in a way that helps us in our effort to create a shift in the way in which people currently travel. We\u2019ve asked Lord Burns and the commission looking into transport in north Wales to look at how we can do that and to make recommendations to Government on that basis. And that\u2019s how we want to proceed. We are open to whatever Lord Burns recommends, and everything that was contained within the report that Rhun ap Iorwerth has referred to this afternoon is available to Lord Burns and the commission that he leads.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"The national road traffic projections 2022 study, published by the UK Department for Transport in January, shows that road traffic in Wales and England could grow by as much as 54 per cent between 2025 and 2060, with a 22 per cent rise under the core scenario, and the most modest estimate being an 8 per cent increase. Despite this, under all the projections, emissions are projected to fall by as much as 98 per cent as motorists move towards greener vehicles. However, following publication of the Welsh roads review, your Government stopped or scrapped all but 17 of 55 road projects, including all but one of 16 projects in north Wales. Whilst I've long opposed the red route in Flintshire, many of these projects were badly needed, from work on the Menai crossing referred to, to the scrapping of plans to upgrade the A483 around Wrexham. And only yesterday, their council leader told me this was a broken promise, which had already cost them hundreds of thousands of pounds, and the Welsh Government millions. What, if any, action will you therefore now take to ensure the well-being of future generations by planning ahead to meet the needs identified in the 2022 road traffic projections study?\" said by Mark Isherwood AM\n\"Well, Llywydd, there are some basic things that the Member needs to take into account, particularly when he refers to the needs of future generations. The crisis of our time is a crisis of climate change, and it is those future generations, if we do not act now, which will be left with the consequences of our refusal to face up to that challenge. The roads review is the first root-and-branch review of road building in Wales for many generations. It challenges received wisdom on road building, but it needs to challenge that received wisdom because it is that received wisdom that has got us into the position we are in today. We have to reduce our carbon emissions. Transport makes up 15 per cent of our total emissions in Wales and it has been the most stubborn sector in reducing those emissions. That's why we have to face up to that fact and take the action that will leave those future generations in a better place than they would be. If we simply accepted those very challenging figures that Mark Isherwood set out in the opening of his supplementary question, are we prepared simply to see a future in which traffic goes on growing in that way and emissions go on growing alongside it? Well, this Government is not. That is why we have the roads review, and that is why, when it comes to schemes such as the Menai and such as Wrexham, we're not saying there isn't a problem, we're not saying there isn't something that needs to be done; we're simply saying that the plans of the future have to be based on our responsibilities to tackle that climate emergency, and simply carrying on with the solutions of the past is guaranteed to make that problem worse and not better.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Fist Minister, you will, of course, be aware that for any projects that weren't given the green light by the roads review, the advice to local authorities has been to go back to the drawing board and to consider, in accordance with WelTAG 1, alternative measures to mitigate, for example, local problems of road safety. What specific help can Welsh Government provide to local authorities around this? And, most importantly, are there any plans to revise the criteria for the Welsh Government's road safety grant, for which evidence must be provided to show serious or fatal road traffic incidents before a local authority is able to gain financial assistance?&nbsp;\" said by Vikki Howells AM\n\"Well, can I thank Vikki Howells for what is a very timely question. Llywydd, the road safety framework for Wales dates back as far as 2013, and, although there was a midway review of it in 2018, now is the time when we need to bring forward a new road safety strategy, one that will align with 'Llwybr Newydd' and the national transport delivery plan. And because the roads review is about reprioritising the investment we make on roads, it means that money that might have been spent on new roads can be reprioritised into improving existing road infrastructure, and, of course, that does include safety as well. When the Minister brings forward the new road safety document, then reviewing grant criteria will be developed alongside that new strategy, and I know that the Minister's officials are very happy to discuss specific schemes with local authorities in that context.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Questions now from party leaders. The leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew R.T. Davies.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Thank you, Presiding Officer. With your permission, Presiding Officer, I'd like to put on the record that our thoughts and prayers are with the family of the man who was killed yesterday in the tragedy in Swansea, and, also, I'm pleased to hear that two of the three people who went into hospital have now been discharged, and thank the emergency services and first responders at what must have been an apocalyptic scene when they arrived there to deal with the fallout from whatever the report into it will determine caused that devastating scene that we saw in the news reels last night and in the papers today.&nbsp;First Minister, last week, one of your Ministers called the Royal College of Nursing an 'extremely militant' organisation. He also said they were'determined to have a fight',and aren't seriously willing to negotiate. That's a direct quote. Is that your take on the RCN and the dispute that they're engaged with with your Government over nurses' pay? &nbsp;\" said by Andrew RT Davies AM\n\"Well, Llywydd, can I begin by agreeing with what the leader of the opposition said about events in Swansea yesterday? It must have been a hugely frightening experience for others who live in that locality. And the leader of the opposition is right, isn't he\u2014we expect our emergency services to run towards sources of danger that other people will be running away from, and they are immensely brave, and the response they mounted yesterday was, thankfully, effective. Of course, our thoughts are with the family of the particular individual who lost their life, while we are glad to see the recovery of others caught up in that very frightening incident.As far as the second part of the leader of the opposition's question, I'm First Minister, not a commentator on what other people say. What I can do is to be clear about the Welsh Government's position: we approach all industrial matters as a Government on the basis of social partnership. The RCN is a long-standing and valued member of the social partnership arrangements we have in health, and they are there today in the room discussing with employers and the Welsh Government ways in which we can continue to improve the performance of our national health service and the way in which those workers who we rely upon within it can be properly rewarded for the work that they do.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"I'm pleased that you clarified what the Government's view is on what the RCN stands for\u2014it is a view that I have\u2014and also I declare an interest in having family members who are members of the Royal College of Nursing, a dedicated professional body of people who look after us in our time of need in hospitals and community settings. But do you not think it would be appropriate for a Minister, Deputy Minister, to actually apologise for those remarks that have caused upset to nurses within the profession, who do not want to be on strike, who are not a militant organisation&nbsp;and aren't up for the fight? They just want to get on with the job of looking after the patients who they care so passionately about.&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Andrew RT Davies AM\n\"I've never known any public sector workers who want to be on strike. Llywydd, the truth of the matter is is that members of the RCN have been to driven to express their reaction to a decade of austerity, followed by galloping inflation on the money that they have to manage with every week. And you will never find a Welsh Government Minister who would say that public sector workers driven to that way of doing things don't deserve to be respected, and they are respected here in Wales, and they are included, as I say, within the social partnership arrangements. We'll have an opportunity tomorrow to vote on the Social Partnership and Public Procurement (Wales) Bill. I look forward to the support of the leader of the opposition and his members in that\u2014. Oh, it's today, I beg your pardon\u2014later today. So, I look forward to his support then.&nbsp;Many people say, in the heat of the moment, things. I've been reading what was being said between the Secretary of State for Health and the Secretary of State for Education when they competed with one another to criticise teachers during the COVID outbreak. I think those things are better put on one side. I've set out the position of the Government, and unambiguously that is one of inclusion, respect and joint approaches to problem solving. &nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"First Minister, you said that a Government Minister has not said that and doesn't support it. I gave you a direct quote of what the Deputy Minister said. That is a matter of fact. It is a matter of record, and people will see what the Minister said in the context of the Royal College of Nursing. Last week, you voted with the Conservatives\u2014which was very pleasing, thank you very much for voting with us on our motion about the roads review\u2014about the lack of consultation, the lack of the ability for the roads review panel to speak to communities, public representatives, businesses, the third sector. There was no ambiguity in what you were voting on, yet you clearly believe that there has been a lack of engagement in formulating this important policy that the Government has brought forward. If you believe there's a lack of engagement and constructive dialogue to formulate this policy, how can people have confidence that this policy stands the test of scrutiny and will deliver on your aspirations when you vote against the policy, as you did last week?&nbsp;\" said by ", "answer": "Andrew RT Davies AM"}
{"content": "\"Good afternoon and welcome to this Plenary meeting. The first item on our agenda this afternoon will be questions to the First Minister, and the first question is from Jayne Bryant.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"1. Will the Welsh Government provide an update on the use of social prescribing in south-east Wales? OQ59374\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Llywydd, I thank Jayne Bryant for the question. There are many examples of social prescribing services in south-east Wales, including the Ffrind i Mi project, which supports those who are lonely or isolated. Recent research demonstrates a clear year-on-year increase in referrals and use of social prescribing in all parts of Wales.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Diolch, Prif Weinidog. And it's good you've mentioned Ffrind i Mi\u2014a great organisation. I fully welcome the Welsh Government's commitment to developing a national framework for social prescribing. At a time when A&amp;E and GP surgeries are under pressure, it's vital that we grasp every opportunity at preventative care. One example of where this is happening is at the laundry garden at Tredegar House, which is run by the National Trust. Members of Growing Space, a mental health charity, help care for the garden, while members of Woodland Routes to Wellbeing use the garden to gain skills and improve people's mental and physical well-being. And I had the pleasure of inviting you, Prif Weinidog, to see Growing Space back in 2021, so I know you've seen first-hand the excellent work that they do.&nbsp;This project in my constituency is an excellent example of using our past and our heritage to improve the well-being of the present. As a country, we pride ourselves on our castles, estates and landscapes; it would be fantastic to see more of them utilised in this way. Prif Weinidog, how are the Welsh Government working with partners like Cadw, Museum Wales, National Resources Wales and the National Trust to promote social prescribing projects, and how are bodies such as these able to work with NHS boards to ensure that front-line staff are aware of the local opportunities so they're best able to refer residents?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Well, Llywydd, I thank Jayne Bryant for that. And I've been fortunate enough to have a number of opportunities to visit Newport and to see the sorts of projects to which Jayne Bryant referred. In fact, I was with John Griffiths only on Saturday at the Maindee Triangle, where the Ffrind i Mi project operates, and not only was I lucky enough to be at Tredegar House for the Growing Space project, but, of course, the Member for Newport West invited me to the Road to Nature project, another example of where social prescribing\u2014those non-clinical, community-based projects\u2014connects people with nature in a way that we know to be so good for their own physical and mental health.&nbsp;Llywydd, around 20 per cent of all GP consultations are with people who primarily have a social rather than a medical need for help. And what social prescribing does is it allows those people to be put in touch with that vast range of different services\u2014befriending, book clubs, choirs, running clubs, community gardens, the national exercise and referral scheme. The list goes on and on of things that people can be put in touch with, and, if they're able to take up those opportunities, then it makes that long-term difference.&nbsp;What the Welsh Government seeks to do is to create a national framework where we have an agreed model, a common understanding, and a shared language that promotes social prescribing even further. There's been a consultation on all of that, and the plan is to publish the final framework, and an action plan to support it, later this summer.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Firstly, I'd like to thank my colleague for asking this important question. Now, I wholeheartedly agree with the need for social prescribing, as the service will undoubtedly help individuals whilst also reducing the pressure on GPs. Recently, I had the pleasure of meeting with the Caerphilly-based company, Signum Health, which uses artificial intelligence and cloud-based technology to deliver remote healthcare and social prescribing within harder-to-reach communities. This Welsh company has already used its technology to cut waiting times in England, managing to clear a dermatology backlog in Swindon in just six months.&nbsp;Most importantly, patients, GPs, pharmacies and other alternative health services can connect directly and share information, meaning patients can connect with local community providers without a GP appointment. Given that we are looking to reduce waiting lists, First Minister, and reduce pressure on primary care services, as well as increase access to important services such as social prescribing, what conversations has the Welsh Government had with companies such as Signum Health to assist in this area, First Minister? Thank you.&nbsp;\" said by Natasha Asghar MS\n\"Well, I thank Natasha Asghar, Llywydd, because she makes an important point, and it's one that's been made a number of times on the floor of the Senedd, that the future of health services has to be based on increased use of those contemporary opportunities that developments in technology and artificial intelligence bring us. We learnt a great deal of this during the COVID pandemic, and, as you know, the Welsh Government has an ambition that, in future, many more consultations will take place remotely, allowing people to avoid difficult journeys, and to increase efficiency in the system. I think the practical examples, through a Welsh company, that the Member has raised this afternoon sound very consistent with that general approach. And I know that the Minister has a very direct interest in making sure that we maximise those opportunities, so that the health service is able to provide in a way that takes advantage of opportunities that weren't there in the past but definitely need to be part of the future here in Wales.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"2. Will the First Minister provide an update on the Welsh Government's engagement with the UK COVID-19 inquiry? OQ59377\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"I thank Heledd Fychan for the question. Llywydd, the Welsh Government has been granted core participant status in modules 1, 2, 2B and module 3 of the public inquiry into COVID-19. Through our legal status as a material provider, the Welsh Government is supplying a significant volume of evidence to the inquiry to enable it to properly scrutinise action taken in Wales.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Diolch, Prif Weinidog. Following last week's visit to the Senedd by COVID-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru, a number of constituents from South Wales Central who lost loved ones to COVID-19 have contacted me regarding the nosocomial investigation. I understand that the interim report is imminent, but many bereaved families are concerned, as they still haven't heard anything at all in relation to their loved ones, whilst others have received letters telling them that COVID wasn't the cause of death, despite it being on the death certificate. Their understanding is that only a coroner would be able to change the cause of death, yet families are being told this without being presented with any evidence to support the change. So, rather than receive answers about how their relative contracted COVID-19 in hospital, they are now having to fight, once more, for the cause of death to be acknowledged. Can you please confirm what the purpose of these investigations is: learn lessons and provide answers to families, or is it an exercise to try and reduce the official number of COVID deaths in Wales? Surely, this once again illustrates the need for a Wales-specific COVID inquiry.\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Wel, Llywydd, the Member's allegation is both offensive and absurd. Of course the efforts that are being made are not some conspiratorial effort to change the number of people who died from COVID here in Wales. What an utterly, utterly absurd allegation to make here on the floor of the Senedd. The efforts that are being made are led by clinicians\u2014are they part of your conspiracy as well? The purpose of the investment that the Welsh Government has made, the efforts that those clinicians are making, are to provide for family members an understanding of the way in which their family members were treated and what happened to them while they were in the care of the health service. By the end of February, 5,765 cases had been reviewed, with a further 2,301 in progress; there are still a further 10,320 cases to be investigated. Now, in line with everything that was said here on the floor of the Senedd, a national report of learning from this programme is due to be published by the end of this month, and that will lead in time to a comprehensive national learning report, to be published in 2024, at the end of the programme. Individual organisations will also publish their own reports, in line with the reporting requirements that the Minister set out for them when the additional funding to support them in this work was found. The Deputy Chief Medical Officer for Wales, Llywydd, meets with COVID-19 Bereaved Families for Justice; he met with them last on 16 March. Where there are concerns about the way the system is working, there are ways in which that can legitimately be raised, and those concerns, which are not founded on the sorts of allegations that the Member made, can be properly investigated, and if there are things that need to be improved, then, of course, we will want to see that happen.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"As the First Minister will be aware, COVID-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru have submitted considerable concerns to the UK COVID-19 inquiry abut the capability of the Welsh NHS during the pandemic. The list is quite substantial, and one particular point I would like to pick up is their concern regarding the lack of long-term investment in IT infrastructure and digitisation of NHS Wales. We know that NHS Wales is lagging considerably behind its English counterpart on its IT infrastructure, and this ultimately has an impact in many different ways. For example, we have particular issues in interoperability of systems between primary and secondary care and between health systems and the police, which is vital in terms of helping to address mental health issues. With this in mind, First Minister, does this Government have any plans to now ring-fence resources for digital transformation to enable upgraded and new IT systems? And do you believe that we should have a national minimum standard for IT equipment in NHS Wales? Thank you.\" said by Joel James MS\n\"Well, Llywydd, I certainly agree about the importance of digital investment in the health service, and, here in Wales, we have a national digital service, there for many years. I don't accept what the Member said in one of his throwaway remarks about Wales 'lagging behind'. In fact, we have shown the way in Wales as to how a genuinely national service can tackle some of the very real issues there are in other parts of the United Kingdom, where the service has been atomised, where there is no national approach and where there are real vulnerabilities as a result. I wish we had more money to invest in this area, Llywydd, of course I do, but, as Joel James will know, in the second year of the spring statement period, we have \u00a31 million for every capital need that we have in Wales. We invest, I think, significantly and in a sustained way in making sure that those digital opportunities that Natasha Asghar mentioned are made available here in Wales. If we had more opportunities, through a proper capital settlement, then we would be able to do more in that field as in many others.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Questions now from the party leaders. The leader of the Conservatives, Andrew R.T. Davies.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Thank you, Presiding Officer. First Minister, last week, the former chairman of the Betsi Cadwaldr University Health Board wrote an opinion piece for the press. He's also written to you, to which he says he hasn't had a response; he might have, by the time I'm asking you this question, had that response. But some of the assertions within that opinion piece do deserve a public answer from you, as leader of the Welsh Government, notably the concerns that were raised by him and the board members with the health Minister and the director general of the NHS here in Wales back in September, when he raised long-standing concerns and issues that simply went unaddressed\u2014his words, not mine. Why did the Welsh Government not respond to these concerns and support the board at the time?&nbsp;\" said by Andrew RT Davies AM\n\"Well, Llywydd, I don't accept at all that those things went unnoticed, because the Minister and officials were in very regular dialogue with the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, including the board. The board has responsibilities. You don't discharge your responsibilities simply by telling somebody else that you've got a problem. You have an obligation, as a board, to address the issues that are within your legal area of responsibilities. So, while there was undoubtedly a dialogue, and while the Minister and officials here were always responding to concerns that were raised with the Welsh Government, to simply say, 'We told the Welsh Government about that', as though that is the full extent of your responsibility, I simply don't think that that is the way the system is ever intended to operate.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"I don't believe that was the point that the chairman was making in his opinion piece. Bear in mind, this was a chairman who was a former chief constable, had served the public for 30 years plus, and then chose to do another public service role by being chair of the health board that covers the whole of north Wales. And he made, in his column in the press last week, that clear categorisation that he was not getting the support from the Welsh Government. He raised this as chair with the Welsh Government, which is the sponsoring body of any health board, because they send the cash and they set the priorities for the health board. I take it that you say that the former chair is not speaking the truth when he says that his concerns and those of the board were not responded to back in September, because that is quite an assertion from you, First Minister, if you believe that the former chair is seeking to mislead public opinion by saying that the Welsh Government stood back and didn't support the board when those concerns and long-standing issues were raised with the Minister and the director general as well.\" said by Andrew RT Davies AM\n\"Well, Llywydd, I think the leader of the opposition must allow me to answer his questions, rather than to tell me in his question what I have said. It's my answers that lie on the record, rather than his interpretation of them. First of all, let me say that I do share what the leader of the opposition said about the many years of distinguished public service that the former chair of the board had rendered in north Wales, and I include in that the service that he gave as chair of the board.The assessment of the Minister and the Welsh Government was that the reports that we had received from independent bodies of the dysfunctional nature of the board could not simply be allowed to lie there without action being taken. That is the culmination of a long dialogue between the board and the Welsh Government, a dialogue in which the Welsh Government took action time after time in order to support the board: significant additional investment above and beyond what its population share would have justified through the normal formula, intervention through national programmes, giving advice, attempting to support the board in the efforts it was making to improve services. Nothing in what the Minister decided should be read as indicating that the board and its chair were not making efforts to put things right. It is simply that the conclusion of independent oversight was that those efforts were not succeeding and that it would have been impossible to put the board as currently, or as then constituted, in a position where it could successfully address those challenges. That is why action was taken. It was necessary action and it will lead, I believe, to a better platform for improvement in the future.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"First Minister, my question was relatively straightforward: why didn't the Welsh Government offer the support when it was requested back last September? I've used two of my three questions and I don't feel that we've advanced any further forward in trying to find out why the Minister or the director general did not respond to that direct\u2014and these are the words of the chairman\u2014that direct escalation of matters to the Welsh Government. That stands on the record, those are his comments, not my comments. I've relayed them to you, and we don't seem to have made much progress towards finding an explanation for why Welsh Government did not respond to those comments. But, you've identified the audit report as being the flashpoint for intervention by the Welsh Government and making sure that the board changed and the chairman was removed. In the same article, the chairman highlighted that there were, in his words, clandestine moves to recruit replacement board members to form a new board at least four weeks prior to the publication of the audit report. So, if this clandestine recruitment was going on, can you today tell us when the recruitment process began to find new board members, even though the existing board was in place? And what would that do to give confidence that the Government was working with the then board to rectify matters in north Wales?\" said by ", "answer": "Andrew RT Davies AM"}
{"content": "\"We'll move on, therefore, to the second item of this meeting, namely the scrutiny work that we're doing on carbon budget 1 and Net Zero Wales. And today, of course, we welcome the Minister for Climate Change. We received very interesting evidence from Lord Deben last week, so we'll probably be referring a lot to that during the course of this session. So, I welcome Julie James, the Minister for Climate Change, and her officials. Jon Oates is deputy director for climate change and energy efficiency; Lucy Corfield is head of decarbonisation with the Welsh Government; and John Howells will be joining us\u2014there are some technical difficulties currently\u2014and he's director of climate change, energy and planning with the Government. So, we'll go straight to questions, and I'll ask Huw to lead us in the first questions.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Diolch, Cadeirydd. Bore da, Gweinidog. Could I begin by asking you to set out the key Welsh Government policy decisions that led to Wales meeting and exceeding both the carbon 1 budget and the 2020 target? And could I ask you also just to respond to the very good evidence session we had with Lord Deben, where he asserted that the 2020 target and the carbon 1 budget were exceeded because they were too low, they were insufficient?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Yes, thank you, Huw. I'm familiar with Lord Deben, obviously. We have had a lot of interaction with him and with the committee. Yes, so, the final statement that we issued was focused on the first carbon budget only, and although the Environment (Wales) Act was introduced in 2016, the first plan was only published in 2019 because we were out of synch for that first legislative cycle. So, it is important for the committee to get the timeline right. So, the first plan was in place for less than two years of the first carbon budget. So, it's important to take that into account. Also, most Welsh emissions occur in non-devolved policy areas. So, we rely on UK Government action to deliver emissions reductions in several key areas, which I'm sure the committee will come on to later on. So, we need absolutely to work in harmony with the UK Government so that they continue to deliver policies that reduce emissions here in Wales.The final statement that we put out explains the monitoring and reporting system. I will say, Huw and Chair, it's incredibly technical. So, I usually like to get across all of this myself, but I'm going to rely on my officials for some of the technical expertise here, because you really do need to be a technical expert in some of this stuff. So, depending on the level the committee wants to go into, officials will fill in some of that. I'm sure you know that the final statement is split into sectors. So, power, the transport industry and waste are the main contributors to Wales's success over carbon budget 1. So, the final statement goes into our policies and which achieved the desired direction of travel, and they provide a qualitative update, but we're continuing to improve the monitoring and reporting system as we go forward.There have been a number of areas where we have made progress: implementing energy consenting powers arising from the Wales Act 2017, the 'Planning Policy Wales' documents, and the Welsh national marine plan are all now in place. In January 2021, alongside other Governments of the UK, we implemented the UK emissions trading scheme, and, in terms of existing homes, the Warm Homes scheme has seen increases in the funding provided and its reach. We also have\u2014and I know the committee has discussed this with me a lot of times\u2014the innovative housing programme, targeted at new homes, which has provided grants totalling over \u00a3180 million, or just over 2,000 homes, between 2017 and 2020. We've also got support in the public sector for schemes like the Welsh Government energy service, which had \u00a350-something million for energy efficiency public sector projects between 2018 and 2020. And the big piece for Wales, of course, is reducing the amount of waste sent to landfill, encouraging the adoption of what we call the blueprint waste collection systems, which is the Welsh Government's recommended way to collect household waste in Wales. We've had some really good successes, even just very recently, as authorities finally swap across to blueprint, having been able to demonstrate its efficacy. And we've also, of course, increased the number of social homes compliant with the Welsh housing quality standard.Going to Lord Deben's particular point, the 2020 target and carbon budget 1 were placed in regulation in 2018 and they were entirely based on the Climate Change Committee's advice. I guess it's a self-criticism in a way. We agree they were too low for net zero, because we only passed net zero into law in 2021. It wasn't possible to amend the 2020 target or carbon budget 1 to align with net zero, because originally the climate committee's advice to us was that we would not get to net zero. We set the 2020 target in 2018, so we were on the pathway to the original 80 per cent reduction by 2050. That followed their recommendations at the time. Then, obviously, we received advice on the net-zero target in December 2020.For carbon budget 2, we followed the CCC's latest recommendations to make it more challenging. We accept the view that Wales will need to outperform the revised CB2 to be on track for CB3 and beyond. Just to put that the other way around, we know we will make carbon budget 2, but we need an awful lot to get to carbon budget 3. We need to well exceed the targets to be on track for carbon budget 3. The latest advice in December 2020 recommended we increase carbon budget 2 from a 33 per cent average reduction to 37 per cent, because the Aberthaw power station had closed earlier than had been allowed for in its original advice. They also advised us that the economic uncertainty arising from the COVID pandemic, and the significant influence of UK Government action on Wales's short-term emissions, meant they did not recommend setting a higher carbon budget 2 in law. But they did recommend that we outperform the 37 per cent statutory target, to get on track for carbon budget 3, which is 57 per cent, and the 2030 target of 63 per cent. Again, to put that the other way around, Huw, we'll need to do twice as much in the next 10 years as we did in the last 20, so it's quite scary stuff.I think, broadly, we agree with Lord Deben, but we were following their advice. I think this demonstrates that the world is changing in this regard. We are getting a much better grip of what needs to actually happen and some of the really quite radical changes that will have to be made to get anywhere near these targets. And again, Chair, and Huw, just to say, if you want more technical detail there, I've got various officials on the call who are much more expert than me in the technical details of it.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Minister, thank you very much for that. It's a comprehensive and a very frank assessment of where we are, why those targets were set, why they were exceeded, but how much further we need to go. Others will go into some more detail on the technical aspects that your officials might want to help with, but can I just ask you\u2014? You seem to be very, very clear that what the Welsh Government needs to do is not rest on the individual COPs and not rest on the individual five-year cycles or the targets for 2030. There is a genuine attempt, it seems to be, from what you're saying in the Welsh Government, to ratchet up, as the phrase goes, year by year and to adjust and to accelerate the level of ambition year by year.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Very definitely, Huw. This isn't some kind of weird technical exercise; the world is changing around us and we need to do this. Every single nation has to play its part. There's no good pointing the finger elsewhere; we all have to play our part. And we can only do that on a global stage if we are doing everything we can do at home. And so, absolutely, we have to do that. And let's just be clear: these are not easy, nice-to-have things; a lot of these things are very, very difficult and they need a substantive change across society to get there. But I'm not at all convinced\u2014. I don't want to be too fearmongering; I don't think apocalyptic talk is necessarily good. But, genuinely, the world is in real danger here and we need to really, really change what we're doing.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Thank you, Minister.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Thank you, Minister. Janet.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"You may have touched on this, but I didn't quite catch whether you had. Why did you carry over the surplus emissions from carbon budget 1 to 2, especially when the Climate Change Committee's unequivocal advice was that there shouldn't be a surplus carry-over at all?\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"Well, we haven't carried the surplus over, Janet, so\u2014\" said by Julie James AM\n\"You asked to carry it over, didn't you, Minister?\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"No. We explored all of the options in front of us, including whether we should carry it over, and we explored with the committee whether carrying forward a surplus would be sensible. We needed to test our situation against all the circumstances that might arise in the future. This is a bit of future-gazing, isn't it? So, in one world, you'd say, 'Well, do carry the surplus over because we don't know what's going to happen, and we need to be able to make sure that we can do it\u2014it's a huge change.' But I'm very pleased to say that, having gone through all of the arguments in the Cabinet about the pluses and minuses of both of them, and following my very firm recommendation, we did not carry it over.It goes back to the answer I finished the last question with, which is that this is not a technical exercise\u2014this is something we absolutely have to do. If it was a technical exercise, then of course we should carry it forward, we should take all the leeway we've got. But it's not a technical exercise; it's an exercise in changing what we're doing. And so we didn't carry it forward. But of course, rightly, we explored all of the various options before making that decision.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"That clarifies it for me. Thank you.\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"Thank you. Joyce.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Good morning, Minister. You've already alluded to the challenge in reaching carbon budget 3, and I'm sure that that's the case. What I would like to explore is what are the main challenges that we face as a nation to get to that carbon budget 3.\" said by Joyce Watson AM\n\"Thank you, Joyce. I mean, gosh\u2014many and various. I just think it's worth pointing out here that reducing carbon isn't the only problem that we face. Reducing carbon is fairly easy if you don't give a stuff about anything else. So, if you don't care about jobs and society and the way that people run their lives, then we could just do it tomorrow. We could shut down Tata Steel and all the power stations and all the rest of it and we'd all go back to not having any steel and not having any power and we'd have a lot less carbon. I'm being facetious, just to make the point, because clearly that is not the way we want to do it. We put social justice and a fair transition at the heart of our carbon-reduction policies. We need to do this in conjunction with also worrying about our economy, our environment and our social equity. And that's the problem, Joyce\u2014trying to calibrate it so that you have a transition arrangement, so we get where we want to go, but we take everyone with us, and, frankly, the burden of it doesn't fall on the shoulders least able to bear it. The people with the most challenging socioeconomic conditions now actually have the lowest carbon footprints, but, generally speaking, policies in the past have not reflected that, so we really, really need to make sure that we can do all of that.We've got an average reduction of 37 per cent against baseline over the five-year period of the second carbon budget. The plan has 123 policies and 100 pledges for action\u2014I've said that so many times now, it's like a mantra. Our modelling at the time of publication showed that delivering that plan would actually put us on track to outperform it. We thought we'd get to a 44 per cent reduction against the baseline. But it's a Wales plan\u2014it's important for the committee to really understand that this is a Wales-wide plan. It requires actions to be taken by others, including the UK Government, not just the Welsh Government. It requires actions to be taken by many parts of our society, not just the Welsh Government. We need to make sure that the conditions are in place for everyone to step up to that.The CCC told us in 2020 that, by around 2050, about 60 per cent of the changes needed in Wales were influenced by powers mostly reserved to Westminster. In Net Zero Wales, we very much put that on the UK Government's plate, making sure, for example, that the real levels of investment are there to get our industries that we rely on entirely, like the steel industry, to transition to clean and sustainable futures. There are many others; we've met with the cement industry, and the oil and gas industries down there in your neck of the woods, Joyce. All of these industries want to work as fast as they can to be as carbon neutral as they can manage it, along a trajectory. But we also don't want to push them out of business, and, very importantly, we don't want to export our emissions. You could shut them all down in Wales, and then just import stuff from elsewhere, but we know that steel imported from elsewhere has higher carbon footprints than we have. We're very keen that we don't export our global footprint in that. We're on trajectory for that. And then, carbon budget 3 has a 58 per cent average reduction, and the 2030 interim target is set at 63 per cent reduction. So, we need to get carbon budget 2 under way, but also we need to make sure that we've got the increase in ambition for carbon budget 3.The committee is watching us make some very difficult decisions, and they are not easy and not welcome. Changes in transport behaviour, for example, are very, very challenging, and you can see the reaction\u2014it's dividing opinion in Wales, isn't it, the roads review, the 20 mph thing. I have at least as many people urging me to go faster as I have people telling me that I've lost possession of my senses on all kinds of social media platforms. But we have to do these things if we're going to get anywhere near these carbon budgets. Setting the targets is the easy part, isn't it? It's actually carrying through the necessary changes in the way that we live our lives and the way that we put our investment in order to get anywhere near meeting these targets. And I can't emphasise to the committee enough that this isn't about setting ambitious targets\u2014it's about delivering it, and that is not easy.&nbsp;\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Thank you. That was a very clear message. Of course, it's not easy. If we are going to transition in terms of energy production, there are two sides. One is the transition into the cleaner, greener energy, because nothing is carbon neutral, but also the production of whatever we decide to use to deliver that for us. Because, again, if we're importing everything that we use, there's going to be a carbon cost to that. So, how aligned is this with a few things\u2014the skills agenda in the first place, but also the manufacturing of those goods?&nbsp;\" said by ", "answer": "Joyce Watson AM"}
{"content": "\"We will go into part 1 and focus on the cost of living. First Minister, I very much appreciate, as Members do, that many of the levers are not always with the Welsh Government, but it's about what the Welsh Government can do in tackling some of the issues we deem important to the people of Wales. To start those questions, therefore, can I ask Jack Sargeant?\" said by David Rees AM\n\"Thank you very much, Chair. Good morning, First Minister.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"As the Chair said, the UK Government has many of the levers to alleviate the cost-of-living crisis. That said, the UK budget was an opportunity for the UK Government to do just that. First Minister, you've already said, in response publicly, that the budget delivered less than the bare minimum. The finance Minister herself, Rebecca Evans, has said that they've fallen well short of providing the support to support people during the cost-of-living crisis. With that in mind, I think it's pretty clear the Welsh Government's view on the spring budget. I was just wondering if you could comment to the committee on what the remaining gaps are in terms of support for households. How will the Welsh Government look to address those gaps within its limited budget?\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Chair, thank you very much. Maybe in order not to have to repeat this many times during the morning, I'll just address some very brief contextual matters. Because when we say that the budget provides less then the bare minimum, what we are referring to is the fact that the budget is worth \u00a3800 million less in spending power than it was when the budget was set by the current Prime Minister, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, during the comprehensive spending review. The comprehensive spending review did not return the purchasing power of the Welsh Government to where it was before the decade of austerity began, and now we're nearly \u00a31 billion below what a Conservative Government believed we needed. That's the point I need to emphasise. This is not some figure that we have invented; we are comparing what we have now with what the Conservative Chancellor believed we needed back at the point of the November comprehensive spending review. And we are very, very far short of that following the spring statement.The spring statement was a disappointment for a whole range of reasons. Let me say, trying to be fair, that we were glad that the energy price guarantee was sustained for a further period in the budget and there were some practical measures in relation to prepayment meters\u2014by no means enough, but at least a recognition for the first time that the interests of prepayment meter customers are different and need to be protected. But if you look at the things that drive poverty, the budget left them wholly untouched: not a penny piece for people who are working poor\u2014we know that most people in this country who are poor are working for their poverty, as campaigners would say\u2014and for those families who depend upon the benefit system; nothing to abolish the benefit cap and the two-child limit, the single greatest driver of child poverty; nothing to deal with the five-week wait for universal credit, and the single greatest call on our discretionary assistance fund comes from people who are left with nothing while they are waiting and therefore need emergency help; nothing to deal with the direct deduction policy in universal credit\u2014so many people who depend upon what are breadline benefits don't even get that level, because deductions are made from their benefits before they even see them; nothing to increase local area housing rates, which are very, very draconian and have a major impact here in Wales; and nothing to restore the cuts in funding for discretionary housing payments.Those are just some of the gaping gaps that remain in the field of poverty as a result of the spring statement. The Welsh Government's ability to fill all these gaps simply doesn't exist. We continue with a whole series of major programmes that we provide, which leave money in the pockets of people where otherwise that money would not be available to them. Free prescriptions is 20 years old this year. It's \u00a39.55 for every prescription in England; in Wales, that money stays in the pocket of the poorest households. There's the council tax reduction scheme\u2014the single biggest, at \u00a3244 million, which we invest to make sure that the poorest households don't pay the council tax. That scheme was abandoned across our border. Even the poorest households in England pay on average \u00a34 a week towards the council tax. That money stays in the pockets of the poorest families here in Wales. Those are just two examples. There is a much longer list, which I won't use up time with this morning, in that same social wage field where, as a result of actions of the Welsh Government, money remains in the budgets of those families who struggle the most to meet their everyday needs.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Thank you for that, First Minister. I know colleagues will have questions that may delve into some of the comments that you've made there, but I'm going to stick with energy for now. You've mentioned already the energy price guarantee and the extension for that. There were numerous calls\u2014I think Martin Lewis, the money saving expert, led numerous calls from charities, with over 50 charities supporting that call for it to be extended. You've mentioned the price guarantee, but just in terms of energy bills as a whole, when setting the Welsh budget and looking at support for what the Welsh Government can offer, have you anticipated the energy bills level changing and, if so, how have you factored that into any of the decision-making processes?\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"The paradox, Chair, for families in Wales is that, while they will see the price of energy falling, their own bills will go up. I should have mentioned in my answer to Jack Sargeant's first question that another major omission in the spring statement was that the \u00a3400 that the most vulnerable households have had ends in April. So, if you are the poorest households in Wales, your bills go up by \u00a3400 on 1 April. So, although the energy price cap has been extended, the energy bill support scheme, which offered help to the poorest households, comes to an end.Now, I anticipate that energy bills will fall at a wholesale level. That, I think, is what most commentators believe. The price of gas fell to below \u00a31 per therm earlier this week, for the first time since the energy crisis began. I think most commentators suggest that bills will come down to around \u00a32,000 by September/October of this year\u2014annual bills. There are two systemic things, though, Chair, that we would still need to factor into our thinking. The first is that in the autumn, wholesale prices might start to creep up again. Two things have been on our side during this winter. First of all, the enormous success of our European Union neighbours in increasing stocks of energy in advance of the winter. So, if you look at what Germany and France did, they stored energy in advance of the winter, and they've been able to use that store, and that has kept wholesale prices down. The other thing that's been on our side is that the winter has been mild in many parts of Europe as well, so the demand for energy has been suppressed below where it would have been in a cold winter. If either of those things aren't true next winter, if European nations aren't able to restock\u2014. And of course our own stocking capacity is at an all-time low, because it was closed by the current UK Government. If our European neighbours aren't able to restock, or if it's a cold winter, then the down-turn in prices could easily be reversed.The other strategic thing, which lies at the heart of so much of this, though, is simply the way that energy markets are constructed. I have had a string of people ask me why their bills are going up when the price of wind and the price of the sun hasn't gone up at all. Fifty-two per cent of all the energy used in Wales last year was from renewable sources. That hasn't been driven up by the war in Ukraine or other factors, and yet it is priced at the most expensive therm bought on the day before. That's the way energy price markets are constructed. We need to disentangle the price of electricity from the price of gas and for renewable energies not to be priced in the way that they currently are. The European Union is doing a lot of work to do that. We need to see the same thing happen here.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Diolch yn fawr, Prif Weinidog. My own view on the energy price market and the associated system with it is that it's absolutely broken. The regulator themselves, Ofgem, is not fit for purpose. You mentioned prepayment meters before, in your first answer, First Minister. It will be no surprise that I'm going to ask a question on prepayment meters, I'm sure. The Senedd, on Wednesday of this week, unanimously backed\u2014all parties in the Senedd unanimously backed\u2014a motion, which I led the debate on, on the forced installation of prepayment meters and its associated scandal, which I think is a big signal to UK Government. I think both UK Government and Ofgem in particular were slow at the wheel when it came to the forced installation of prepayment meters. On Monday of next week, the Petitions Committee will launch an inquiry into the scandal and how it has affected residents in Wales and households in Wales\u2014many of those who have been the most vulnerable, as you've mentioned already. One of the key things we seek to do\u2014. Again, the powers lie and the levers lie with the UK Government, but I think there are some things Welsh Government could do.Firstly, the energy advice pilots that were run a few years ago now\u2014I think there could be an extension into those. The best advice being available is the best way to keep people from crisis. Is there also room for the Welsh Government to look into how they can support tenants so that landlords can't forcibly change them onto a prepayment meter? Finally, the conversations that you have\u2014. I must say the Minister for Social Justice, Jane Hutt, and Mick Antoniw, the Counsel General, have been very, very good on this issue. They've grasped the seriousness of this issue. I had Grant Shapps, who was then Secretary for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, I think\u2014he's now the energy Secretary\u2014on 22 December or 23 December claim to me that there was no problem with prepayment meters, and I don't think we should forget that. Ofgem, of course, have extended the voluntary suspension of forced installations, but this is only a voluntary remit. I saw a story yesterday, where an energy supplier has broken that voluntary suspension, which they can do, which is clearly not good enough. I'm just wondering, in your conversations\u2014you were with the Prime Minister yesterday\u2014and your officials' conversations, would you continue to call for the complete stop of the installation of prepayment meters in future conversations that you have?\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Well, Chair, thanks to Jack Sargeant for those further questions, and I want to congratulate him particularly on the work that he has done on the floor of the Senedd, and through the Petitions Committee, on this issue. If there's further work to be done by the committee, I will try and find a copy for the committee of a report that I wrote with Jane Davidson, a former colleague of ours, in 1995. So, that is nearly 30 years ago. It was called 'Token Gesture?', and it was an inquiry into the very early stages of prepayment meters, which, at that stage, were also being introduced in the water industry. And D\u0175r Cymru, as it was at the time, were a leading advocate of the use of prepayment or trickle-flow meters, as they were called. If you didn't pay your water bill, your water got cut off, and you were to be offered a trickle of water, sufficient to allow you to fill a kettle in about an hour. It was an absolute disgrace, and we worked very hard with Michael Meacher, the Minister responsible for water policy in the 1997 Labour Government, and that's how you are not disconnected from water if you run into problems with your water bill. So, there's a long history in Wales of campaigning on these issues, and it's great to see it continuing today.&nbsp;I did raise prepayment meters with the Prime Minister in the first meeting I had with him, very shortly after his appointment, and I do want to acknowledge the fact that I think those conversations have had some impact on the actions we saw in the spring statement. So, I think he did take those points seriously, and I think we can continue to try and make the case with the UK Government.There are things we can do in Wales, and, as Jack said, Chair, both Mick Antoniw and Jane Hutt have been particularly engaged on this issue: Mick, in dealing with the problems in the justice system\u2014there was a Welsh court involved in mass issuing of warrants that allowed companies to break into people's houses; that is now at an end\u2014and Jane has met absolutely regularly with the companies themselves, and with Ofgem. Her next meeting with Ofgem is on the twenty-seventh of this month, the start of next week.What I want to focus on is what I think is the scourge of self-disconnection, the notion that people choose to go without electricity or gas in order to help them with the way they deal with their week. If a company cuts somebody off, if a company makes the decision to disconnect you, they have to report that, and they have to include that in their annual report. I believe they should have to report self-disconnection figures in exactly the same way. One of the reasons why all of this has not received the public attention it has is that it's a problem that doesn't appear in those public ways; it's suppressed. It's the privatisation of poverty into the lives of individuals, rather than it being a public policy responsibility of the suppliers. We need companies to report publicly and regularly on the number of people who find themselves unable to pay for those lifeline supplies through prepayment meters. And I think if those figures were regularly in the public domain there would be a level of attention on it that would shift the policy dial on this issue, and that's one, alongside a series of other issues, that the Minister for Social Justice is pursuing in those conversations. Some companies have made some offers about better publication of that data. They have it. They know what it is. They should put it in the public domain.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"John has got a supplementary, and then I need to move on to Jenny, because I need to move on.&nbsp;\" said by David Rees AM\n\"Yes. I just wanted to pick up on some of the remarks we've heard already from yourself, First Minister, and indeed, Jack Sargeant, in terms of the levers available to Welsh Government to tackle inequality and poverty because, you know, we have here in Wales a Welsh Government committed to social justice, and poverty continues to be a blight here in Wales, just as it is across the UK and, sadly, across the whole of the world. And it's very frustrating, I think, for all of us committed to that agenda of tackling those problems when we haven't got all the levers we might have available to our Welsh Government. And I think one aspect of that, First Minister, is devolution of administration of welfare benefits. When I meet local jobcentre staff, they're very committed to doing a good job for local populations and communities, but, obviously, they operate within a system set by UK Government, although there are important partnerships with devolved services. And I think some of the issues around sanctioning, which you've mentioned, First Minister, and the impact that has on vulnerable families and communities, some of the waiting times, some of the arrangements around payment of the housing benefit element direct to the landlord or not, some of the issues around split payments between couples\u2014there are so many areas, I think, where we could do much better if Welsh Government was making those arrangements and facilitating those arrangements rather than UK Government. This has been discussed, First Minister, I know you've given your own commitments on this, and I just wonder where we are at the current time.\" said by ", "answer": "John Griffiths AM"}
{"content": "\"Item 2 on the agenda today is Petition of the Year 2023. Over the last couple of weeks, the people of Wales have been voting for the five petitions the committee nominated to be our Petition of the Year 2023. The five nominees were: ban greyhound racing, care-experienced parents, endometriosis healthcare, metastatic breast cancer care, and water safety. Sharing the story of these five petitions and the impact they are having right across Wales is designed to inspire other people to think about using our petitions system to make your voice heard, and ensure that your Parliament is talking about the issues that you care about. I hope that people have been inspired, and we look forward to receiving your petitions in the future. But for now, I'm delighted to announce that this year's Petition of the Year award for 2023, as voted by the people of Cymru, is Mark Allen's law. Congratulations especially to Mark Allen's mum, Leeanne Bartley, and all of those who contributed to this piece of work.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Item 3 on today's agenda is new petitions. Item 3.1 is P-06-1338, 'Extend the bus emergency scheme and develop national bus recovery plan'.'During the pandemic the Welsh Government launched the bus emergency scheme (BES) to safeguard the bus network. The Welsh Government are now looking to bring this scheme to an end, despite passenger numbers not recovering to pre-pandemic levels. We want to see both the funding secured for this financial year, and a national bus recovery plan co-produced with bus operators, passengers, local authorities and others, in order to build more comprehensive, sustainable bus services.'Additional information is available to Members in their packs. This was submitted by Andrew Jenkins, with a total of 1,025 signatures. If I can bring Members in to discuss this petition and any actions they may wish to take. Rhys ab Owen.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Diolch yn fawr, Cadeirydd. This is a matter that has been discussed extensively at Plenary. We had a response from the Deputy Minister, but subsequently we've had a statement at Plenary stating that further funding is going to be made available to protect as much of the network as possible\u2014\u00a346 million in total. That's been relayed to the petitioner. He is concerned about the lack of promotion of public transport, has raised concerns about how are we going to reach targets of use of public transport without further promotion, and he's asked a number of questions to the Deputy Minister.I suggest that we write to the Deputy Minister to ask whether a financial solution has now been secured for the remainder of the year, as noted in his May statement, as the May statement said that they nearly reached a solution. So, ask for an update on that, and send the helpful questions that the petitioner has sent to us on to the Deputy Minister. Diolch yn fawr.\" said by Rhys ab Owen MS\n\"Diolch yn fawr, Rhys, for that suggestion. Are Members content? They are. Just to put on the record as well and declare an interest, I know Unite the Union, their Welsh branch, has also done a Back Your Bus Route campaign; I've had many e-mails and letters from people signing their campaign. And to note that I'm a member of Unite the Union as well. But I congratulate the petitioner to date. As Rhys says, it's been raised extensively in the Senedd Chamber; Carolyn Thomas, in particular, I think is one that's done that. So, I congratulate Unite and her as well.&nbsp;Item 3.2, P-06-1339, 'Require all new Welsh homes to be fitted with solar panels as a condition of planning permission'.'The world is facing an urgent energy crisis and we are all facing a daunting climate and nature crisis. This is why it is so important that the Welsh Government should lead the way in securing future renewable energy sources.'This is why all new industrial, commercial and domestic builds (who are not shaded or north facing) should include solar energy as part of their planning consent.'The sun produces more than enough energy to meet the whole world's energy needs and it's not going to run out.'There's additional information available to Members in their packs. It's submitted by Robert Curtis with 268 signatures. I invite Members to discuss the petition and any actions they may wish to take. Joel James.&nbsp;\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. I want to thank the petitioner for raising this important petition. It does challenge the Welsh Government to try and be more innovative in its approach, but I'm conscious of the response that we've received from the Minister for Climate Change. There isn't any budging on this and she's outlined the reasons why\u2014chief amongst them, the cost of rolling this out. I support that statement; it would be quite an expensive undertaking. I don't really know what much more can be done, other than to accept that there are two opposing arguments, really, that we can't necessarily get a resolution to. I suppose we might just have to close the petition and thank the petitioner, nonetheless, for raising it.&nbsp;\" said by Joel James MS\n\"Thank you for that suggestion, Joel. Are Members content? I can see they are. You're right; the Minister is very clear, but we do thank Robert Curtis for submitting. I think he's submitted a number of petitions now and I'm sure we'll see some more in the future as well.&nbsp;Item 3.3, P-06-1342, 'Fund more specialist school places and staff for children with additional learning needs in Wales'.&nbsp;'To look at funding provided for specialist provisions in Wales for children with additional needs it\u2019s far from acceptable children with a high level of need being forced to stay in a mainstream environment due to spaces in schools and schools being underfunded and understaffed!'Again, there is additional information available. This was submitted by Stevie Pyne with 1,429 signatures. I invite Members to discuss this petition. Rhys ab Owen.&nbsp;\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Diolch yn fawr, Cadeirydd. We've received a response from the Minister for Education and Welsh Language. In his response, he acknowledges capacity issues. He highlights unprecedented demand for additional learning needs services. He also mentions additional funding of \u00a320 million that's been made available in 2022 to support improvement and creation of inclusive spaces and facilities in schools to enable learners' needs to be addressed. The Children, Young People and Education Committee is currently scrutinising implementation of the new additional learning needs system. It was highlighted in a Plenary debate by the Minister that Estyn are undertaking a thematic review of the implementation of the additional learning needs reforms, and that they're due to report in September. I suggest that we write to the Chair of the education committee to raise awareness of the petition with them in light of the current inquiry, and that we wait for the publication of the Estyn report in September. I note that we haven't received any comments from the petitioner yet, so maybe give them the additional time to provide any comments for us.&nbsp;\" said by Rhys ab Owen MS\n\"Diolch, Rhys. Any other comments from Members? No. Content.&nbsp;Item 3.4, P-06-1343, 'Provide free public transport for all secondary school pupils'.'I believe that all children in secondary schools in Wales should have the right to free public transport so that they can travel to their catchment area secondary school safely.'We live 2.4 miles from our children's secondary school but our council states that free transport is only available to those who live 3 miles (or further) from their catchment secondary school. Walking to school would take between 50 minutes and an hour from our house along busy and congested roads. There is no safe cycle path.'As a family we spend over \u00a380 a month on bus tickets for our 2 children. It's money we really can't afford but for some parents finding \u00a340 a month (per child) is impossible and so their children are forced to walk along dark, busy, dangerous and polluted roads to get to the school. This is unfair and discriminates against the poorest children in society.'Again, there is further information available to Members. This was submitted by Elin Wyn Davies with 349 signatures. I invite Members to discuss this petition and any actions the committee may wish to take. Joel James.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. This is quite an important petition. I know we've dealt with several other similar ones, and I know we've got a watching brief on a few of them. This something that I quite support. I'm conscious that the Youth Parliament are currently doing a survey, and to be fair to them, they've had thousands of responses. But I know that closes in the summer, and I was thinking whether or not it might be beneficial for us as a committee to look at that response, because that's coming directly from schoolkids, really, and maybe even invite them in so we could speak to them as a Petitions Committee.&nbsp;Another issue I was wondering if I could raise is that I know last year, in June\u2014or was it March? I can't remember\u2014it was mentioned that there was going to be a review of the learner travel Measure, and I was just wondering if we could get an update on that, really, because I think the response on that would be quite important in formalising our response, I suppose.\" said by Joel James MS\n\"Diolch, Joel. Any further comments? Agree? Yes. I must say, I think it's a great idea to bring the Welsh youth parliamentarians here to present their findings to us, but in the meantime, of course, seek that update from the Minister.&nbsp;Item 3.5, P-06-1348, 'Commission suitable NHS services in Wales for people with EDS or hypermobility spectrum disorders'.'Historically, those showing signs of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes EDS or HSD have been referred to rheumatology departments. In 2021, they were directed to stop seeing these patients in favour of their diagnosis and management in primary care, which is not currently equipped for this role. A unique tertiary service in England has also closed to out of area patients. This situation has led to inequalities in access to healthcare for those with EDS and HSD in Wales resulting in unacceptable suffering.'Again, there is further information available to Members. This was submitted by Natasha Evans-Jones with 1,122 signatures. I invite Members to discuss this petition and any particular actions they may wish to take. Rhys ab Owen.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Diolch yn fawr, Gadeirydd. This petition was part of a UK-wide petition, and we've received a helpful response from the Welsh Government. They have developed a Wales rare disease action plan for 2022-26, and helpfully, as part of that plan, there's also an implementation group, which oversees the delivery and monitors progress of the plan. There has been a progress report, and things seem to be going along with all the priorities for this year. That's been welcomed by the petitioner, but they have raised a few very important questions and concerns, which in my view should be shared with the health Minister. So, my suggestion is that we write to the health Minister with the important questions and concerns raised by the petitioner and ask for a response to those. Diolch.&nbsp;\" said by Rhys ab Owen MS\n\"Diolch, Rhys. Joel James.&nbsp;\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. I'll be honest, it would be remiss of me not to come in here, because unfortunately a number of my family members suffer from EDS, and I know the debilitating illness it is, and what they go through. So anything we can do as a committee to try and support them I think would be a big boost for them, and I welcome my colleague's recommendations there as well.&nbsp;\" said by Joel James MS\n\"Thank you, both, and we'll certainly follow up on Rhys's suggestions in writing back to the health Minister.&nbsp;\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Item 4 on today's agenda is updates to previous petitions. Item 4.1 is P-05-1161, 'Routine collection and publication of data of how many babies/children return to their care experienced parents care at the end of a Parent and Child Placement'. This was submitted by Nicola Jones, with 60 signatures, and I remind Members this is a petition we did do a piece of work as an inquiry on. We published our committee report in March of this year. The Government have just responded back in June, 9 June, accepting or accepting in principle the six recommendations that we made. It's also worth noting the Children, Young People, and Education Committee have published their report 'If not now, then when? Radical reform for care experienced children and young people', making 27 recommendations to reform the wider care system.I just want to take this opportunity to note the fact that we will be debating, alongside the CYPE committee, both reports on 12 July, so next week, and the Minister will be responding to both as well. I just want to put on record my thanks to both the clerking teams of this committee and CYPE committee for establishing this initiative and innovative idea, and thanks to the Chair of that committee as well, Jayne Bryant, for agreeing that we could do it in this way. I very much look forward to that debate taking place next Wednesday. Any other further comments from Members? No.Item 4.2, P-06-1232, 'Stop the proliferation of intensive poultry units (IPUs) by legislating and introduce a moratorium until this can be achieved', submitted by Gill Marshall, with 5,920 signatures in total. I will bring Members in to discuss this petition now. Joel James.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. I'm conscious we've had this petition for some time now, and I know, from recent correspondence with the Minister, that the Minister is considering a request to call in poultry farm or poultry unit applications in the Powys County Council area. I know that the petitioner has come back with some follow-up questions in terms of further responses that the Minister has said and looking for timescales and that. I suppose it's probably best to seek if we can get clarification on that, and then maybe review this again later in the year, then, after recess, about October time or something.\" said by Joel James MS\n\"Diolch yn fawr, Joel.

This is the fourth time we've discussed this petition. We've had a firm response back from the health Minister, saying that she's unable to intervene in this matter, that it's a matter for the health board. We haven't received any further comments from the petitioner. Whilst I have real sympathy about the difficulty caused by the closure of any GP surgery, I don't think there's anything further that this committee can do, so my recommendation would be that we thank the petitioner and close the petition.

I'm conscious, in the past, that I've led quite heavily on this, because the petitioner has contacted me as his regional Senedd Member, but I agree with my colleague's comments here. I think there's not much more, as a committee, we can do on it, so it's probably up to us now to link up with the petitioner as a constituency Member or regional Member and link up in that way to see what can be done sort of thing.\" said by ", "answer": "Joel James MS"}
{"content": "\"So, as we don't have any apologies, we can move directly to item No. 2 on the agenda. It's our first substantive item here, and it is the Welsh Government's draft budget for 2023-24, particularly focusing on spending in relation to justice, and general scrutiny as well. So, we have with us\u2014delighted to see you here again\u2014Counsel General and Minister for the Constitution, thank you for joining us, and alongside you, we have James Gerard, the deputy director of justice policy, Welsh Government; Sophie Brighouse, deputy director, constitution and Welsh tribunals, Welsh Government; and Dr Robert Parry, deputy director, European transition, Welsh Government. So, welcome to you all.We'll try and keep this as free-flowing as possible, and Counsel General, if you want to bring in your colleagues or if they want to contribute, feel free. We've got quite a lot to cover there, so we'll see how far we go. Now, I'm just going to do, as per normal with the Chair, a broad opener, and then I'm going to turn to my colleagues to come in with some forensic analysis of where we are on justice and the budget. So, one of the things we're aware of is that there are pressures on the resources available to Welsh Government, so we'd like to ask to which areas you've given prioritisation within the budget, and which ones have duly been deprioritised in the field of justice within the draft budget. Counsel General.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Thank you for the question, and of course, you'll appreciate it's an incredibly difficult environment financially. The Welsh Government's budget overall has been impacted not only by long periods of austerity up till now, but potentially also significant impacts because of inflation, and of course, the estimate is over the next couple of years that there is a loss in real terms of about \u00a33 billion in terms of the Welsh Government's budget.Can I also say that in terms of the budget with regard to justice, of course, I don't have, in that sense, a specific budget per se? Because my function as Counsel General and Minister for the Constitution, of course, overlaps into, really, all the other portfolio areas that are impacted by justice, and in particular, the Minister for Social Justice and many of the justice elements that are made up are actually within Jane Hutt's ministerial portfolio. So, whereas I have a sort of engagement and, of course, work very closely with the Minister for Social Justice, the budget I have is, or the areas that I work in predominantly relate to, I think, what are staffing costs and some research and policy development areas. So, there'll be areas where it's probably difficult for me to talk about, because they're questions that probably should be going to specific Ministers, but in general, we have tried to and we've kept, I think, the core budgets for justice, for social justice as well. The areas in terms of the Thomas commission, for example, the justice transformation programme, are, I think, slightly down on previous years, but have essentially been maintained. Some of the important areas\u2014for example, single advice, and so on, and community support\u2014have been retained.There has been, as you know, a Government overview of reprioritisation because of the particular circumstances we're in, and there are three priorities that have been set. One is protecting public services, the other is protecting those who are feeling most acutely the impacts of the cost-of-living crisis, and the third is supporting business through, really, recessionary times. So, that is where the focus of Welsh Government is in terms of maximising the best use of it.But in terms of the justice elements, I think those have essentially been retained. I don't see any major impact in terms of us being able to continue what we are doing. I would love it if there was more money to be able to look at additional things we could do or how we could do things better, and it may be that there are some things that we end up doing more slowly, for example, or we can't do as much of as we wanted to, but, essentially, we've retained the core elements of the justice budget.\" said by Mick Antoniw AM\n\"Thank you, Counsel General. Peredur, before I bring you in, can I just\u2014Alun, you wanted to come in on this.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Yes. I'm grateful to the Counsel General for that introduction. You say you've retained the core elements of the justice portfolio, and, of course, one of your roles, as you say, is to take an overview of different matters, rather than be a delivery Minister in the way that Jane Hutt would be, in the way that you've described. One of those core elements, of course, is the provision of legal support to Ministers, and one of the things we've heard throughout this Senedd, actually, has been that Ministers don't have sufficient resources to legislate and so they need to use the legislative consent motion process. So, I was wondering if you felt now, with this budget, that you have sufficient resources to ensure that Ministers will have those resources in place where they need to legislate.\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"What we do have\u2014. I think perhaps I'd turn the question round a bit in answering it\u2014\" said by Mick Antoniw AM\n\"It's all right. I'm quite happy with the question I asked.\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Well, no, I have to answer it by saying what we have is we have the budget that is set in terms of the functions that we have. Where the challenges come might be, for example, in the area of retained EU law. We're not quite sure precisely what that is going to mean and what the implications of that are going to be. The other thing, of course, is that much of it is actually staff and lawyer time, et cetera, looking at UK Government Bills as one element, and if those change or those increase, or new Bills are introduced\u2014we now have, for example, the Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill coming through, which raises all sorts of issues in respect of Welsh Government responsibilities. So, those are all things that are new that come in that then have to be accommodated, and they will be accommodated, as we will do with the retained EU law, it's just it's difficult to be precise about it, because you're budgeting for what you expect to be there, and you don't have an enormous amount of leeway within that.\" said by Mick Antoniw AM\n\"Counsel General, I understand completely that when you've got a chaotic situation in London all sorts of different things can happen, and retained EU law is an example of a chaotic process. I accept that, and I accept that you can't budget against that process. I understand that. But do you accept or do you believe that the resources that have been placed within the different departments to support and to sustain that department's legislative programme are sufficient to meet their needs?\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Yes, I do, and I believe we will deliver on that legislative programme.\" said by Mick Antoniw AM\n\"Okay. That's fine.\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"That's good to hear. Thanks, Alun. Peredur, over to you. We're going to delve deeper now into justice and the draft budget.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Diolch, Gadeirydd. Counsel General, you talked there about protecting the core functions, which suggests there are non-core elements, so they will be negatively impacted by reducing budgets. Could you give us an outline of what's been deprioritised?\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"There is nothing that we have deprioritised. There are things that we have worked to retain, and we've retained by keeping budgets at the same as what we planned to do, but what we haven't been able to do is, of course, to take into account what the impact of, for example, inflation might be, the fact of the reduction in the value of the budgets that we actually have. So, that doesn't mean that we're not going to deliver, but, undoubtedly, it may well impact in terms of how quickly we deliver or the extent to which we deliver, and that is a little bit that's unknown until you are into it.For example, the single advice fund, we've protected. That's \u00a311 million, and that was introduced and was increased in past years to make up for the impact of UK Government cuts in legal aid. There is never enough money. I've got a feeling in the cost-of-living crisis, et cetera, there are so many things we might want to do, so many things we might want to expand, but we have to work within that budget and within the value of that. So, it's more a question of we're continuing to do what we've planned to do, but how far that money goes in being able to complete that remains uncertain at this stage.\" said by Mick Antoniw AM\n\"In your discussions\u2014you've talked about the social justice Minister\u2014what sort of evidence and data have you been using to come to budget-making decisions and some of those things that you were talking about there?\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"Really, the data is, for example, the past performance. For example, if I take the single advice fund again as an example, we know how many cases there are that we've had in, we know how much money's been recovered, we know what the scale of the debt problem has been. What we don't know and what we have to continue to monitor is the extent to which that is going to escalate. That is unpredictable. I think certainly it will increase. I think the strains in terms of being able to deliver as much as we want to are going to be very, very difficult in the forthcoming year. That is one example.&nbsp;Another example might be, for example, in terms of tribunals. The tribunals operate independently. They're part of the judicial system. There is a very slight reduction in the budget there. The tribunals came under budget during the last financial year, partly because of more online hearings rather than face-to-face hearings. That may change. There may, of course, be more cases. That part of the justice system has to be able to deliver. It's one of those things where you have to monitor as you go along to ensure, but the fact of the matter is that it has to be delivered. We do have to have those cases. They have to operate and they have to operate within the correct judicial environment, and independently of Government, et cetera. We think the budget will manage that, but it's one of those things where we have to be ongoing in monitoring it. That is clearly a priority area as well.It's the same with the funding that's been available\u2014again, it's not my budget\u2014in terms of the police community support officers, and so on. They are there. That is set. That funding is absolutely committed. But, of course, there are imponderables that may impact on these things, like wage issues and so on. At the moment, those budgets are there, those things have been prioritised. We're retaining nearly all the key justice elements. When I say 'core', I think core in terms of what we're doing at the moment. The challenge will be all those additional things that might impact upon us over the coming year that are unpredictable at this stage. That's why we have to keep a very close eye and monitor the development of those particular justice services.&nbsp;\" said by Mick Antoniw AM\n\"Those services and the impact on your three elements\u2014the most vulnerable and the cost-of-living crisis\u2014what do you foresee is the impact on the tribunals, on PCSOs? In real terms, it's a cut because of the inflationary pressure. So, in terms of numbers of hours or people on the ground, that sort of thing, what is the actual impact to people in our communities?\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"At the moment, there is no impact, in the sense that we will continue to support the numbers that we have. The impact on communities may well be coming in the extent to which we can manage and cope with the scale of demand, for example, for single advice that's required. The pressures that may come will be where there are additional cost elements to be added on that are unpredictable at this stage, and so on. So, the answer is that we're moving into an area of a degree of uncertainty about what the full impact is going to be. It's one of those things you have to monitor.But, I do have to stress again that these are budgets in other people's portfolios. These are not my portfolios. I engage in the broader sense on these. I know because I chair the justice Cabinet sub-committee that we do take a look at the overall picture in terms of the developments, what is happening in social justice, what are all the projects that are there. In that committee, we don't go into the budgets; those are left to the individual portfolios. And of course, you'll notice that some of those budgets go into health, they go into social services and local government issues, they go into education as well. So, in many ways, the specific budgets there are ones where I can talk generally about them, but I think any detail on them you probably need to put to the specific Ministers in terms of their portfolios.\" said by Mick Antoniw AM\n\"And finally from me for the moment, you've talked about the conversations you've had, you've talked about the budget and protecting some of that core funding and core elements, but what's been the hardest decision you've had to make?&nbsp;\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"I don't think the hardest decision we've had to make has yet potentially materialised. I think the decisions may well come depending upon what the future pressures might be. I think, because of the approach the Welsh Government has adopted in terms of the importance of the impact it's having on people going through these particularly difficult times, the social justice elements in particular are the ones that have been very much supported and haven't been impacted, other than that they may be impacted if costs and things like that rise, and if inflation impacts on the scale of it. At the moment, I don't think there are major hard decisions that I've had to take, or that other Ministers have had to take, but that will be for them to consider in due course.\" said by Mick Antoniw AM\n\"So you haven't had to make any hard decisions yet.\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"Not yet, but I've got a feeling that the next year is going to involve lots of hard decisions.\" said by Mick Antoniw AM\n\"Thanks, Peredur. Before I bring Alun in, Minister, one of the areas that is covered by your portfolio is the work that's ongoing with the Welsh Government justice transformation programme, formerly the justice commission in Wales, and so on, which includes, of course, the aspects of taking forward the Welsh Government's proposals on devolution of justice. It's small, but it is one of the areas where there is a decrease within budget allocations within the draft budget for the year ahead. Should we take this as a signal of something? Do we take from this that this is lower down the priority ranking, at least for the foreseeable future, and what does it mean for post 2024?&nbsp;\" said by ", "answer": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM"}
{"content": "\"So we'll move on to the main item on our agenda this morning, which is evidence session 3: do disabled children and young people have equal access to education and childcare? I'd like to welcome our witnesses here this morning. You're very welcome. We have with us this morning Kat Watkins, United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities development officer for Disability Wales, and we have Megan Thomas, policy and research officer, Disability Wales. So, you're very welcome here this morning. So, Members have a number of questions to put to you today, so I'll make a start, and the first one is a general point in terms of, in your opinion, to what extent are children's rights to an education being denied due to their disability? Who'd like to start? Megan.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"In our opinion and experience, based off our extensive conversations with members for the past couple of years\u2014for example, directly asking them about their access to education and the rights of disabled children under the United Nations convention on the rights of disabled people\u2014there are very significant barriers to accessing education faced by disabled children. So, these barriers come in a lot of different formats, which I'm sure we'll be discussing further on, but there is a significant number of disabled children whose education is either affected, or they have limited access to education because of being a disabled person. And something we would also like to quickly comment on is also some of the language used. So, we use a social model of disability, so we'd be using terms like 'disabled children', as opposed to 'children with disabilities'.\" said by Megan Thomas\n\"Okay, thank you. Kat, is there anything you'd like to add?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"I do quite a lot of visiting schools, so these barriers are very evident when you visit a school\u2014that you can only get into one room, because there are steps everywhere. Even into the one room you can get into, there is a big step, so, thankfully, I had a ramp with me, but, obviously, this doesn't help disabled children wanting an education, because their local school is inaccessible to them. So, what are they going to do? They're going to have to travel miles just to get an education, so it's a big barrier, inaccessible schools.\" said by Kat Watkins\n\"Yes. Thank you. Are there any particular issues for access to education and childcare where children and young people may have multiple disabilities, for example, a learning disability and a physical disability?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"So, in terms of direct examples, there's not much that's been brought up to us, but I'm sure that some of our wonderful colleagues in Learning Disability Wales will be able to expand, but we have seen multiple barriers. So, as Kat just mentioned around the built environment and the school buildings themselves, the make-up and the access of them can be extremely inaccessible. But then we've also heard from disabled people with a learning disability or impairment that they can have quite limited options of which courses they can take, or which schools they can go to, depending on whether or not they're going to meet their access needs.\" said by Megan Thomas\n\"And to what extent are children and young people with a disability able to access all areas of education, including extra-curricular activities? Are there any differences for learners with different types of disabilities? Kat.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"This is obviously going to depend on the layout of the school, because if a school doesn't have a lift, they're not going to be able to get to the classrooms that are, say, for science or English, or something like that. And whilst they could move these lessons downstairs or to another part of the building for their disabled learners, it shouldn't be a need. These education settings should be set up so that disabled children and young people can access every single part of the built environment, and they should be set up so that they don't have to choose what they are educated in and that they can just access everything and have the education that they want, not the education that's forced upon them.\" said by Kat Watkins\n\"Absolutely. And to what extent are you aware that there are issues of access to childcare provisions for families with a disability?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"We don't have as much information on access to childcare\u2014most of our information that we've gotten has focused around education. But it is something that we want to look further into and potentially come back to you on, with more in-depth information about access to childcare.\" said by Megan Thomas\n\"That would be really helpful. If you can send us any information that you do collect, we'd be really grateful. Thank you. Questions now from James Evans.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Diolch, Cadeirydd. Bore da. Good morning. To what extent do you feel that children and young people and their families have been directly or indirectly discriminated against because of their disability?\" said by James Evans MS\n\"Quite a large extent. So, we have multiple incidences from members of discrimination, both direct and indirect, as a result of them being disabled people. So, for example, one person reached out to us who was a grandmother to two autistic grandchildren, one who has a diagnosis and one who was suspected to be autistic but they hadn't been able to access a diagnosis yet as they are very difficult to access\u2014it can take a very long time. And they'd found that, between the two children, the access to the extra-curricular activities that they could go to and the access to support services that they could access was very, very different, despite them both needing quite similar support. We've also heard amongst parents that some of their concerns aren't really taken as seriously or that there are instances of parents not getting full access to all the information that they require. We've had one incident of a disabled person who was told that they shouldn't bother taking their education courses because they'd never be able to work anyway. So, yes, we've seen some really explicit discrimination.\" said by Megan Thomas\n\"Kat, did you want to add anything?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Yes. With my work that I have been doing on education, I've set up a project advisory group and had input from disabled parent carers. And one person in particular, both parents are disabled but so are all four children, and they're all made to go to different schools, which, obviously, is quite a challenge with four different sets of transport. And also, when they asked the schools to administer certain things for their children, or not to give them certain things, or just do certain things, they're not actually taken seriously. And they then wonder why their child\u2014. Well, the school wonders why the child has an outburst, but the mother has already told them that if they're given certain things, it will affect them\u2014it will affect their blood sugar, it will affect their mood, but the schools still do this, and it's because they're just not being taken seriously as parents because they're disabled.&nbsp;\" said by Kat Watkins\n\"James.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you. I was going to ask a question about unconscious bias, but I think you've answered that in answer to that question, and some of the discrimination that people do face. One question that I did want to ask is: to what extent do you think local authorities consult with parents of disabled children? Do you think they're actually helpful, or do&nbsp;they tend to do things to families and not actually in consultation with them?&nbsp;\" said by James Evans MS\n\"It can depend a lot on the local authority, but we tend to\u2014. In most cases that we've seen, the parents felt like it was more that the local authority has done things to them. And it had been noted by one participant that they felt that certain parents were listened to more than others, so parents who were educated, who had further education, who were articulate or non-disabled; they felt like they were being listened to or able to be engaged with more.&nbsp;\" said by Megan Thomas\n\"Do you think schools are a bit like that as well, or is it a bit hit and miss? Like you say, some schools are very good and others just do things to people rather than ask them, 'What do you actually want?'&nbsp;\" said by James Evans MS\n\"I don't think that there are lots of instances of co-production. I think that there are a lot of instances of 'we know best', not 'parent knows best', or caregiver who is with the child, apart from the school hours, 24/7, so they obviously know their child very well. But schools tend to take the view that, because they have them for seven hours, five days a week, they should know what the child needs, not the parent. And if the parent is disabled, then they take that attitude even further.&nbsp;\" said by Kat Watkins\n\"Okay. Diolch, Cadeirydd.&nbsp;\" said by James Evans MS\n\"Thanks. Questions now from Buffy Williams. Buffy.&nbsp;\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair, and thank you for joining us this morning. To what extent do you believe that children with a disability are able to attend their local mainstream school?\" said by Buffy Williams MS\n\"Who wants to start on that one? Kat.&nbsp;\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"It's going to obviously depend on the built environment whether they can actually access the school. So often they can't, so they have to travel further for this, which is obviously then a challenge with transportation, especially in the rural areas of Wales, we all know that transportation is not easy. It will also depend on whether they have the capacity for the children, because sometimes, it's easier to educate children who don't have extra needs, and they just haven't got the time or patience for it. So, they're going to just say, 'No, we don't want them', and not really give a specific reason, but just force them to look for other education settings. This isn't right\u2014it should be that all schools take a child no matter who they are, disabled or not, because there shouldn't be discrimination when a child wants an education.&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Kat Watkins\n\"Megan, is there anything you want to add?&nbsp;\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Yes, absolutely. Just to agree with Kat, it's very much dependent on the situation, but for a lot of disabled children, we see that they don't really have many options when it comes to schools, plus there are educational settings that aren't appropriate for them, because that school doesn't have everything that it needs to be able to support that child. But they also have limited other options for education in their area. Even in instances where we see disabled children being able to access, being able to go to their local state school, that education that they may be receiving within that state school may still not be able to fully meet their needs.\" said by Megan Thomas\n\"Thank you. How desirable and realistic is it for Wales to have a fully inclusive education system, as envisaged by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities? Are there any instances where having some form of segregated education may be in the best interests of a learner, such as special schools or schools for the deaf?\" said by Buffy Williams MS\n\"So, we don't believe it\u2014. We believe it would clearly take significant change to our culture within education, and it would take significant work on the part of the Welsh Government, local authorities and schools. But we don\u2019t believe that it would be unrealistic to be able to attain what is set out in the United Nations convention on the rights of disabled people under education. We believe that, really, that is the baseline of what we should be looking to achieve, that all schools are accessible and available to all children, that all schools can fulfil their purpose and provide a good-quality education to any child in their area, that deaf children can access British Sign Language, that there is full-access education for those children. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s completely unrealistic. We think that it will just take\u2014. We are concerned that the amount of work that it will take is something that is not being reflected in current policy.\" said by Megan Thomas\n\"Kat.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"I don't think I have anything to add to that.\" said by Kat Watkins\n\"No, that's fine. Buffy.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you. Thank you, Chair.&nbsp;\" said by Buffy Williams MS\n\"Questions now from Laura Jones.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you. I think you\u2019ve both just covered my first question to you, which was: what are the barriers to providing an inclusive statutory education for children? And the barriers around that, of course, and how accessible the school estate is\u2014what have you heard from disabled children, disabled people, about their experiences in school, or current experiences in school, in terms of the school estate being a massive barrier?\" said by Laura Anne Jones AM\n\"I could use my experience. I had to go across the border to England to get my education, so that I had something that would meet my needs, because my local comprehensive didn\u2019t want me and wasn\u2019t willing to provide anything\u2014like lifts, or things like that\u2014so I could access the built environment. So, mine is quite an extreme case.\" said by Kat Watkins\n\"Can I just pursue that? The local authority that you were in\u2014was that close to the border, or was it quite a way into Wales?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"No, Powys.&nbsp;\" said by Kat Watkins\n\"Powys.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Yes, the Brecon area.\" said by Kat Watkins\n\"So, a rural area. Sorry\u2014carry on.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"It is not uncommon for children to have to travel for their education.\" said by Kat Watkins\n\"The physical barriers are clear to us all, I think, immediately, as soon as we visit a school, about the accessibility side of things. But what about for those children who are deaf or struggle with their sight? What do you think about the barriers there?\" said by Laura Anne Jones AM\n\"They are very much significant. These are certainly quite significant barriers. We have quite a few examples from, specifically, the parents that you mentioned, but one of the problems is the lack of resources within schools to be able to meet the individual needs of disabled students. And one other barrier that we come across quite a lot is attitudes within schools\u2014so, discrimination from staff within schools is also something that we do see. One particular story that I've heard is that someone with dyspraxia who's had some problems with drawing, and whose drawing was used as an example in front of the class, basically as a way to shame them. We've seen&nbsp;significant issues with teachers just not understanding the needs of the children in their class.Something we also come up against is that a lot of the access to support is dependent on a diagnosis. And so a lot of children may not be able to obtain a diagnosis for a variety of reasons. For some conditions, it is very difficult, for some conditions, a diagnosis may not be possible. But it is very difficult to access support without having that paperwork.\" said by Megan Thomas\n\"Yes, 100 per cent. We're seeing there's a massive waiting list in terms of getting diagnosed quickly at the moment, isn't there, and, therefore, we haven't got the teachers and support in the classroom that are needed. How much do you\u2014? What do you think about teachers and\u2014you just touched on it\u2014staff, any teaching staff, being adequately trained enough, and what more do you think we could do in that regard to make sure that they are aware of physical and mental needs and are able to deal with them, particularly neurodivergent needs? Thanks.\" said by Laura Anne Jones AM\n\"Can I come in on that? So, with my project that I've been doing, it is looking at education, about promoting the UNCRDP and disability rights and the social model of disability, and I've worked with a few schools on this\u2014well, with quite a few practitioners. Each time, I get, 'Oh, I didn't know about the social model of disability,' or 'I didn't know about these sorts of disability rights.' If they don't know about these things, then what hope do disabled children have? It comes down to training, and whilst there are practices in place to educate the practitioners more about disability rights and stuff, it can't really properly be learned from a piece of paper, it needs to have some context behind it from a disabled person, just to get the message clearly to people so that there's full and transparent meaning.&nbsp;\" said by Kat Watkins\n\"Absolutely. Thank you. Do you want to\u2014?\" said by Laura Anne Jones AM\n\"Can I just\u2014? Thank you. I think, additionally, one of the problems, as we have touched upon previously, is that it is so dependent school to school, so you don't have that consistency of, 'I'm a disabled child, this is how I'm going to be treated in this school,' or the consistency of how schools approach disabled students and attitudes within. I think that that training, specifically disability equality training that's been co-produced and delivered by disabled people, is absolutely essential. Something that, actually, Kat has told us before about working in schools is that, often, you've been maybe the first disabled person that they'd have met, and I do believe that is a problem when it comes to being able to fully deliver and fully support disabled students. We obviously see that a more inclusive curriculum has been proposed, and I think that's a wonderful thing, but we need to back that up with understanding, with making sure that teachers and administrative staff fully understand disability equality.\" said by Megan Thomas\n\"Absolutely. Thank you. To what extent do you think think learners experience bullying within schools as a direct result of being disabled? Do you think that the support and intervention are adequate?&nbsp;\" said by ", "answer": "Laura Anne Jones AM"}
{"content": "\"Good afternoon and welcome to this Plenary meeting. The first item on our agenda this afternoon is questions to the First Minister, and the first question is from Rhys ab Owen.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"1. What assessment has the First Minister made of the impact on Wales of the two-year delay on the Birmingham to Crewe leg of the HS2 railway line? OQ59295\" said by Rhys ab Owen MS\n\"Llywydd, the decision to delay aspects of the HS2 line was taken without reference of any sort to the Welsh Government or Transport for Wales. This further explodes the myth that this is an England-and-Wales project.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Diolch yn fawr, Brif Weinidog. I don't want to dwell on the great train robbery that is HS2 for Wales, and I don't want to dwell on the comments of Keir Starmer at Llandudno recently, when he refused to commit to giving Wales its fair share of HS2. I don't expect you, Prif Weinidog, to write the next UK manifesto\u2014albeit I'm sure it would be much better if your thumbprints were on it than some UK Labour members\u2014but I want to concentrate on where extra funding could be of assistance, where it would make a huge difference. Transport expert, Mark Barry, has called the Cardiff West junction in Canton a 'bottleneck'. To unblock that bottleneck would enable four trains an hour on the city line. That would transform the rail network in the capital and increase connectivity with the Valleys to no end.&nbsp;Would you, then, commit, Prif Weinidog, to writing to Network Rail and to the UK transport Minister to unblock that junction, and perhaps the leader of the opposition might do the same? Diolch yn fawr.&nbsp;\" said by Rhys ab Owen MS\n\"Well, Llywydd, I thank Rhys ab Owen for what he has said. And he will understand that I have to take care not to confuse the responsibilities I have as the Senedd Member for Cardiff West. In that capacity, I'm very familiar with all the arguments Rhys ab Owen has set out, and, in that capacity, I write on behalf of Cardiff residents in the way that he has suggested.&nbsp;As First Minister, I always have to be careful that I don't act in any way that could be taken as suggesting that I use the position I have here in this Senedd unfairly to advantage the people who live in my own area. But the Government as a whole quite certainly makes the points that the Member has raised, and makes them for all the reasons that he has set out.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"First Minister, it's clear that the UK Government is determined to make public transport a more viable option for the public, unlike in Wales, where the Government is forcing people out of cars but not putting strong alternatives in place. Yes, I won't deny that the HS2 has been slightly pushed back, but it will ultimately increase rail capacity and boost growth. We have an extremely shoddy rail network in Wales, with trains often running late, or sometimes not even turning up at all. Only this week, we were being told to expect rail disruptions well into April following a spate of fires on class 175 trains. More than 100 services were cancelled or delayed as a result, and we were originally told to expect the work to be completed weeks ago. But here we are again, First Minister, facing prolonged chaos on our rail lines. So, First Minister, don't you think it's important to get your own house in order, and a good place to start might be by sacking the Deputy Minister for Climate Change?\" said by Natasha Asghar MS\n\"Wow. You couldn't make it up, Llywydd, but no doubt somebody did for the Member, because she read it out for us. Look, what we've heard, even with the thinnest of material, wasn't worth the time of the Senedd. The notion that the UK Government is serious about public transport, the idea that HS2 has been slightly pushed back, where it now disappears well on the other side of the general election\u2014. Let me just repeat the figures. I know we've heard them before on the floor of the Senedd, but they tell you everything you need to know about the record of the UK Government. While we will electrify, in those parts of the network that are under the control of the Senedd, over 170 km of railway line here in Wales, for those lines that are under the control of the UK Government, while in the UK as a whole, 38 per cent of those lines are electrified, and, in England, over 40 per cent are electrified, here in Wales, the UK Government has managed to electrify 2 per cent\u20142 per cent for Wales, 40 per cent for England. Does the Member really think that that is a record she's prepared to defend?\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Good afternoon, First Minister. I'm calling it the great Wales train robbery\u2014that's what the Westminster Government are doing to Wales by claiming yet again, and you've referred to this, that HS2 is an England-and-Wales project, which actually means that Wales will lose \u00a35 billion-worth of funding. And then, to add insult to injury, last week's announcement that the Northern Powerhouse rail will be classified as an England-and-Wales project, without a metre of track being in Wales, means that we lose a further \u00a31 billion-worth of funding for our transport system. For a fraction of that, here in Wales, we could actually make free public transport available, not just to under-25s, but actually to the whole of the population. And this is on top of decades, as you said, First Minister, of underinvestment in rail. I do want to think constructively, though, and I hope that, in your role and your relationship, I hope, with Keir Starmer, and given that there will probably be a UK Labour Government next in power, would you restore this lost funding to Wales, or, given the recent comments by Keir Starmer, has that train already left the station? Diolch.\" said by Jane Dodds MS\n\"Wel, Llywydd, first of all, the Member points to what is the fundamental difficulty at the root of what we have seen with HS2, and now, indeed, maybe with the Northern Powerhouse as well: it is the arbitrary ability of the UK Treasury to make classifications of the sorts to which Jane Dodds referred, and which ends up with the Northern Powerhouse being an England-and-Wales form of investment. It is plainly not; it is nonsensical to suggest that it is, but the Treasury is judge and jury in this matter\u2014it sets the classification, and, if you wish to challenge it, it is the Treasury, which made that classification in the first place, that decides on whether or not they got it right. And surprisingly enough, they almost always conclude that they did. So, there is a fundamental unfairness in the system. In the negotiations carried out with the UK Government to reform inter-governmental relation machinery, we succeeded in introducing an independent element into disputes with the UK Government, where a devolved Government wished to raise an issue, other than in decisions made by the Treasury. And that is because the Treasury itself refused, even in Whitehall, and even under pressure, as I believe, from the Cabinet Office, to submit its decisions to any form of independent oversight. And that fundamental flaw continues to operate, to the detriment of Wales.I'm grateful for what the Member said about the chance of an incoming Labour Government. And if we were in serious politics, we would understand that, if you are preparing for Government, you are not going to make a series of one-off decisions in an interview when you're asked that question. A Prime Minister preparing for Government will be making decisions in the round; we will continue to make the case\u2014of course we will\u2014over HS2. A mature opposition, preparing for Government, is going to have to make a whole series of difficult decisions in the round, and you don't do that by responding to requests for large sums of money in an interview.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Do you agree with me, First Minister, that it's quite instructive that the Welsh Conservatives would prefer to support the UK Government than they would to stand up for Wales? I must have got my geography lessons terribly wrong at school, because I just discovered on the weekend that the Huddersfield to Leeds railway serves Wales, and that Crewe to Manchester serves Wales, but only if you're a Tory. Because at the end of the day, when I look my constituents in the eye, they see the Welsh Government searching for funds to invest in the Ebbw valley line, as they are in Maesteg as well, and they look across the valley at Rhymney, they look across at Merthyr, they look across at Aberdare, they look across at the Rhondda, where rail infrastructure is devolved, and they see the investment that the Welsh Government is making, investment that the UK Government is not prepared to make in Wales. First Minister, do you agree with me that if we're going to end the farce of the Tories telling us that Crewe, Manchester, Leeds and Huddersfield are actually in Wales, then we need to devolve the whole of the responsibility for investment in rail infrastructure to Wales and do it here ourselves?&nbsp;\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Well, Llywydd, the record of the Welsh Government speaks for itself: over \u00a3800 million already invested in metro developments across Wales, a further \u00a3800 million invested in new train fleets across Wales\u2014trains made here, now, in Wales. What a contrast with the figures I gave you on electrification. What we need, Llywydd, is we need the devolution of rail infrastructure here in Wales, together with a fair funding settlement, and there's no point in having the first if you don't have the second, and, I'm afraid, the record of dealing with the current UK Government gives you very little confidence indeed that you would ever get a fair deal.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"2. What is the Welsh Government doing to attract health professionals to work in mid Wales? OQ59322\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Llywydd, we work with partners to retain existing workers, recruit locally and bring new clinicians to the area. While challenges remain, and are real, mid Wales continues to be an attractive place to work, live and train. The workforce of the Powys local health board has increased by over 700 full-time posts over the last decade.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Thank you, First Minister, for your answer. There's a real issue in my constituency in accessing a GP, often having to wait for a considerable time to see a GP, and there are, obviously, the consequences of that. What I would ask, First Minister, is: what do you see as the barriers for GPs and, indeed, dentists, coming to work in mid Wales and how can those barriers be removed? In particular, I think of the performers list. There is a performers list that GPs, dentists have to apply for in order to work in Wales, and correctly so, in my view, for patient safety reasons. But we are aware, of course, of the long-standing issue where, if you graduate or live in England, you can apply for the English performers list, but there's a disincentive then to come and work in Wales. So, can I ask what you are aware of, in terms of a UK-wide performers list or a joint Wales-English performers list, or, indeed, automatically enrolling people on a Welsh performers list, if the Welsh Government is satisfied with the criteria in England and the process in England? But, ultimately, what can be done to remove any barriers to allow dentists and GPs in particular to come and live and work in mid Wales?&nbsp;\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Well, I thank Russell George for those further questions. I was able to discuss recruitment in Powys with the chief executive of the Powys university health board yesterday. She said to me that Powys has only one managed practice and that there is a realistic hope that new contractors will be found, happy to come and take over that practice as well, and, while recruitment is challenging, as it is everywhere, it is holding up in the Powys health board area with some recent recruitment in parts of their responsibility.I talked with Carol Shillabeer about the performers list. I don't agree that there should be a single performers list. You need to know, if a GP is practising in Wales, that they understand the way in which the policy landscape operates in Wales, the different way in which services are deployed on the ground. It's not good enough simply to say, because you are okay to practise on one side of the border, you can just automatically assume that you are fit to practise somewhere where the landscape is very different. What I believe, though, is that the transferability should be made as specific and easy as possible. There should be no artificial barriers to people being able to practise in England and Wales. You do need to be sure and confident that somebody who practises in Wales is fit to do so in the Welsh context, and a great deal of work has gone on between the English NHS and the Welsh NHS to make sure that it is as easy as possible to be able to be recognised on either side of the border. It does work both ways, because there are many people who live in England who get their primary care from staff who are employed here in Wales, and the English system would, equally, wish to make sure that people providing those services are recognised properly as competent to do the work that they are asked to do.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Questions now from party leaders. The leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew R.T. Davies.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Thank you, Presiding Officer. Last week, First Minister, the Chancellor presented his budget. A centrepiece of that budget was the childcare offer that will be exclusive to England, because, obviously, those powers and responsibilities reside here in the Senedd and with the Government. Many people have come up to me over the weekend\u2014it's quite surprising the amount of people who have taken note of this particular policy\u2014assuming that it would be here in Wales as well. Can you confirm that the Welsh Government will be bringing forward a policy that will have a childcare offer for nine months to two years, and then, obviously, building on what is already the offer here in Wales?\" said by Andrew RT Davies AM\n\"I'm quite sure that in those conversations, the leader of the opposition has been able to explain to those people that what we see is an attempt in England to catch up with services that are already available here in Wales. It's quite certainly not the other way around. The promises\u2014the aspirations, we might say\u2014that the Chancellor set out, all of them carefully calibrated to make sure they land the other side of a general election, are simply attempting to catch up with the services that are already available here in Wales.For three and four-year-olds, here in Wales, families get 30 hours of childcare for 48 weeks of the year. In England, that's 38 weeks of the year; 10 weeks fewer in England than you get in Wales. Here in Wales, just last year, in our co-operation agreement with Plaid Cymru, we have extended the reach of the childcare offer for three and four-year-olds to people who are on the cusp of employment, and 3,000 more parents are able to take advantage of that childcare offer here in Wales just on that one aspect.My understanding is that the Chancellor says that 60,000 more people will enter the workforce as a result of his investment in childcare. We've already got 3,000 as a result of what we did for three and four-year-olds alone last year, and our record of expanding childcare for two-year-olds is something that is simply an aspiration in England. So, the real answer to the people who come up and speak to the leader of the opposition is: we already do far more in Wales than they do in England, and they'll be very lucky indeed if they catch up with where we are already.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"First Minister, it was a simple question: are you going to bring a provision forward for one and two-year-olds here in Wales? You're getting the consequentials for the moneys that are being spent in England. It is a realistic proposition that people want to see delivered here in Wales. So, a simple answer could come from you, 'Yes, we will deliver it, because we're having the money, and we will deliver it by this date.' So, can we have clarity around this question? Will you deliver childcare for one and two-year-olds?\" said by ", "answer": "Andrew RT Davies AM"}
{"content": "\"Then we will move on to item 2, which is the committee's first evidence session in our inquiry into local authority library and leisure services. I'm very pleased to welcome, joining us here in person, Glenn Bowen, interim chief executive of Cwmpas, and, joining us virtually, Jennifer Huygen, head of policy and strategic partnerships for Community Leisure UK, Owen Hathway, assistant director for investments, insights, policy and public affairs for Sports Wales, and Lyn Cadwallader, chief executive of One Voice Wales. Thank you all very much for coming in to give evidence to committee today. Perhaps I might begin with some overview questions, and, firstly, could you summarise the key benefits and value of leisure and library services to communities and those that use them, the impact on communities when services are withdrawn, as well, please? Who would like to begin? Jennifer, thank you very much.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"I can start us off.\" said by Jennifer Huygen\n\"Yes, please.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Good morning, everyone. I think the key benefits of leisure and library services to communities really cannot be overstated. They promote physical and mental well-being through various programmes and partnerships and that includes adult education, early years provision, school holiday programming, and, of course, the national exercise referral scheme. So, they reduce inequalities and ill health, they reduce the time that patients spend in hospital on NHS care, and they do that, really, by contributing to developing the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015&nbsp;through integration of arts, culture, sport and leisure. So, it's not just a library for a library's sake, book lending, or sport for sport's sake\u2014no, it's actually a well-rounded community offer there. So, when those services are withdrawn, of course communities lose critical support for health and well-being, but also they lose educational opportunities, they lose employment opportunities, and there's just a loss of social cohesion, because, libraries and leisure centres, they are those community hubs; they are anchor institutions within their communities. So, that is a real threat to the health and well-being of our communities, and I'm sure colleagues on the call and in person will elaborate on that.\" said by Jennifer Huygen\n\"Thank you very much, Jennifer. Who would like to add to that? Yes, Glenn.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Yes. Thanks, Chair. Adding to the previous comments, obviously, in terms of health and well-being and prevention, I think most people would agree that they add to that immensely in terms of the support to the community sector. But, from our perspective within Cwmpas, the economic development impact\u2014. I think, particularly when you look at the ones that have moved away from local authority provision, by creating that economic anchor locally, providing the good quality jobs close to where people live in terms of from a foundational economy perspective, but also by creating an independent economic anchor away from the public sector, there's potential around the social value supply-chain work and procurement. You find that actually, they find that slightly easier, moving away from the sort of public sector procurement regime by becoming more independent, to try and get that spend to remain local as well. So, definitely prevention, the health and well-being agenda, all that I think most of us would agree with, but the power of the economic anchor institution, particularly in some of our communities where we have less impact by the private sector, creating economic value and economic wealth.\" said by Glenn Bowen\n\"Would you say, Glenn, that that economic development advantage in the way that you describe it is fairly well established and evidenced?\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"I think so, because there are larger trusts out there now, more established. We've got some very small organisations just running one facility, and, obviously, they will have a smaller impact from an economic development perspective. But some of those larger ones out there, there are examples now, and if we use one like Awen Cultural Trust\u2014. I'm not sure if you're going to be talking to Richard as part of the evidence\u2014\" said by Glenn Bowen\n\"Yes, yes.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"\u2014but, obviously, they started in Bridgend; they're now delivering services outside of Bridgend. So, they are growing as an anchor institution, but they remain anchored within Bridgend. So, there's a good example there of how they are growing and will continue to grow in developing their services as an economic anchor organisation.\" said by Glenn Bowen\n\"Okay, Glenn. Thank you very much. Okay. Owen.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Thanks, Chair. Good morning, everyone. Firstly, I just fully concur with what Jen and Glenn have said there. I'll try not to repeat too much, because I think they've made the case quite strongly, but, certainly, I fully agree with the health and educational benefits that those facilities and provisions provide. I think one of the critical aspects of public leisure services in whatever format they may take\u2014and there are different mechanisms and operating models across Wales\u2014is that there is a duty on them, obviously, to be representative of the communities they are based in. So, it's an opportunity to ensure that delivery models are looked at through the lens of equalities and tackling the undervalued or underrepresented groups that you may not necessarily see if it's a sport-specific model or a commercial-specific model.A couple of the other points I thought I'd pick up, just to be slightly different, I guess, in terms of the perspective, are, when we look at, say\u2014. Sport Wales, for example, really push this principle of non-early specialisation in sport. We know that anyone can have a lifelong enjoyment of sport; they might just not necessarily have found the sport that most appeals to them. So, having multisport offers is really critical to that exposure to different sporting opportunities, which then bring about different skill sets both within a sport and physical context, but also different skill sets that set people up for life, from communication skills, leadership traits, self-confidence et cetera, and, very often, those local public leisure services are that multisport offer. It's central in terms of its location very often, but also houses a wide range of different sporting opportunities, in a non-competitive environment, that can be done at leisure, so I think that's a really important critical component.And then secondly, that setting as well\u2014we do know that it's really difficult to engage families\u2014in family offers. Particularly through the pandemic, where we did see some positive traits in terms of physical activity trends, it was around family activities. And that particularly had an impact in terms of female participation in sport and, again, those local leisure services do create family offers, which you might not necessarily see in other services. So, I think that is also a really critical component that local leisure services can facilitate that we might not often see in other delivery models.\" said by Owen Hathway\n\"Okay, Owen, thank you very much. Anybody else like to add anything? No. Okay, let me move on then to ask you about the key challenges that local authorities and leisure trusts face. There are certainly many challenges around at the current time, but what would you say perhaps are the three\u2014if you had to choose three, what would be the three key challenges facing local authorities and leisure trusts in managing those services at the moment and investing in community provision?\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"So, I don't mind going first.\" said by Owen Hathway\n\"Yes, Owen, yes, please.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Only because I can see that my mike is already on, so it'll save someone the job of having to switch it on and off. And I imagine that I'm probably likely to repeat what at least Jen will certainly say, and maybe others as well, which is that I think the three for me that stand out are the operating costs, especially those with swimming pool facilities. We've seen major increases, increasing costs, to facility providers in recent weeks and months, and so managing that is going to be a key challenge.If I give you just one example: we run a capital funding scheme at Sport Wales, where local authorities and leisure trusts have been able to bid in over the last year. We'll be reopening that in April as it goes. There were a number of instances in the last round of that funding where Sport Wales agreed significant\u2014hundreds of thousands of pounds in fact\u2014awards to some applicants, but there was a match funding element to that and, just within the weeks when those applications came in, some of those leisure trusts and local authorities were not able then to see that through, because the picture had changed so dramatically for them. In one instance, that was a 90:10 split in favour of Sport Wales providing 90 per cent of the funding, but that 10 per cent was no longer able to be found just because of the increase in energy costs and inflation. So, you can see the pressures that are there.Second is the issue around the cost of living. We've seen that impact individuals and communities quite heavily. That obviously has an impact in terms of their ability to spend or prioritise leisure investments. We've seen, through our quarterly Wales activity tracker that we do with Savanta ComRes, that there's a significant proportion of the population saying that they're changing their physical activity habits\u2014they're having to source free or cheaper physical activity offers, or indeed reduce their physical activity to not doing it. That has an impact in terms of footfall and then the spend that those facilities are receiving. And then I'm sure there are issues around staffing, both retaining and recruiting staff into those facilities as well, and the cost-of-living awards that are associated with that.So, that's almost\u2014. Coming out of a pandemic, the sector was quite resilient. It did a lot of really innovative work to protect itself, and the Welsh Government invested in leisure services to protect them through the pandemic. We were probably in a slightly better place in Wales than most other areas of the UK, as a result of some of the work that had gone on through the pandemic. Unfortunately, that perfect storm of staffing, the cost of living and operation costs and inflation and the energy crisis that have come about now have almost, to an extent, undone a lot of that work, or at least set us back to a point\u2014. We would have thought this would be a really positive, redemption year almost, if I can use that term, and, instead, it's just firefighting new and emerging challenges.\" said by Owen Hathway\n\"Thank you, Owen, that's very useful scene setting. Thank you very much. Carolyn. Carolyn Thomas wanted to come in at this point, Carolyn.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Yes, so, it's just on something that Owen said. So, there is capital funding available. Is that for decarbonisation to help with energy costs, such as cladding, solar or alternative forms of energy? And also I'd like to take the opportunity to raise with you now that we visited a community group that runs the Plas Madoc Leisure Centre in Wrexham\u2014their energy costs have gone up from \u00a36,500 to possibly \u00a316,000 to \u00a317,000, which is huge. And they thought they wouldn't be able to apply directly to Sport Wales, that they would have to do it through the local authority, even though they manage on their own, not through the local authority. Are they able to go direct to Sport Wales? I just thought I'd clarify while you're here.\" said by Carolyn Thomas MS\n\"Yes, of course. So, to answer those two questions in turn, yes, they are able to access funding for decarbonisation projects through that capital funding stream, but it isn't exclusively to that, so we have a number of\u2014. We've funded athletics tracks, or pump tracks for cycling, so actual projects that are delivering new facilities\u20143G pitches, et cetera\u2014through that fund. But we've also funded a number of projects that are around reducing energy costs and decarbonisation.Where we've invested in solar panels, we've actually done that on the basis of a 50/50 split, because we know there's a return on investment to the facility. In a perverse way, actually, that return on investment is slightly better now, because of the increases of energy costs. Whereas the repayment might have taken seven, eight, nine years in the past, it's now going to take two or&nbsp;three years, because the energy costs are so high. But to answer the question, certainly, they are able access funding for energy costs.&nbsp;In terms of who can access the funding, it is specific to national partners that we fund, local authorities and national governing bodies, because those three groups are on our capability framework, so, giving us assurances around where we invest public funding. However, there is nothing, in theory, stopping those organisations that you noted there having conversations, and the local authority, an NGB, or a national partner coming in on their behalf, and we have funded a number of organisations, be they specific clubs, leisure trusts, community-run facilities. We have had community-run facilities and co-operatives in the past that have accessed that capital funding through local authorities, that have acted as the interim, both in terms of, then, supporting, and there are some VAT benefits, where actually going through the local authority is beneficial to the individual applicant as well.&nbsp;So, they should have those conversations with their local authority, and any governing bodies that may be relevant to the sports. But, certainly, they're able to access it via that third party.&nbsp;\" said by Owen Hathway\n\"Okay. Would any of our witnesses like to add anything to what Owen said about the three main challenges facing these services at the moment? Jennifer?\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Thank you. I definitely agree with everything that Owen has said. I just wanted to give a bit more context to two of them. In terms of the utility costs\u2014and we really welcome the Sport Wales capital investment that Owen just talked about\u2014I just wanted to give that context on the utility costs. There's obviously the high increases in gas and electricity prices that is causing the bulk of this challenge, but one of the main areas contributing to this is that a lot of our leisure and culture facilities are dated buildings. So, they're past their expiry date, if you can say that. And, also, the free energy service from the Welsh Government, and the audits that can be done by local authorities through that, have found that leisure facilities are consistently in the top five of high-emitting buildings from local authorities. So, obviously, that contributes to the scale of the problem, because, obviously, our buildings are unfortunately not as efficient as they can be.&nbsp;The second element to add to what Owen said around staffing, is we have, of course, from 1 April, a 9.7 per cent increase in the national living wage, which is the right thing to do, but to be able to afford to put a 9.7 per cent increase across all pay scales in an organisation adds a lot of pressure on the bottom line. So, in addition to the recruitment and retention challenges, there is that risk, and that threat, to keeping differentials, because, obviously, the national living wage increases it so much. So, that means that, in some cases, those on the national living wage, or just above, will get a 9.7 per cent increase, but that might not be for everyone in the organisation; they may get a 3 or 6 per cent increase, because 9.7 per cent is unaffordable across the organisation. And that's not to say that operators do not want to pay; of course they do want to pay that, it's just talking about budgets and the affordability of that.&nbsp;And, then, the third one, just to add to what Owen said, in terms of our key challenges, there's also the high inflationary costs in the supply chain. So, things like food\u2014yesterday, I heard an example of tomatoes, and how much they cost now for one box, which, obviously, is a key ingredient in cafes and that kind of thing, but operators are unable to pass that on to customers. So, obviously, that puts another pressure on budgets. Thank you.&nbsp;\" said by Jennifer Huygen\n\"Thank you, Jennifer. And Glenn.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Thanks, Chair. It was interesting that Carolyn said about Plas Madoc. I was talking to their chair last week, and she was making the point quite strongly that the main thing is the subsidy around the energy costs. And what I would say, in terms of energy reduction, from my knowledge, a lot of\u2014particularly the smaller ones, the community pools, have done a lot over the last 10 years to reduce their ongoing revenue costs by looking at energy efficiency. But now, the main issue right here, right now, is the cost of energy and how they can cover that cost, particularly those swimming pools.If I could add one other challenge, which is a little bit leftfield from what's been said so far, and that's governance. In terms of those independent trusts and organisations, and particularly those smaller, really focused in smaller communities, they work really hard initially to set up. Lots of them come from the starting point of setting up a pressure group to save the facility, and they have a board, and we can support them and train them to develop good governance. But good governance never ends, so, actually, the challenge is when board members, who are volunteers, leave and it's actually how you replace them and how you ensure that they're representative\u2014I know that Owen talked about representation earlier on. But that is a constant need to support those smaller organisations, because without good governance, some of those facilities will fail at a point in time in the future. So, I think we've really got to keep an eye on the governance, and support the ongoing governance within those independent trusts.\" said by ", "answer": "Glenn Bowen"}
{"content": "\"So, I'll move swiftly on this morning to our first item on the agenda, which is the scrutiny of the Welsh Government's draft budget 2023-24. It's our first evidence session, and we are very pleased that the Minister for Education and Welsh Language is here this morning with us, Jeremy Miles. And you have with you your officials, who are Owain Lloyd, director of education, social justice and Welsh language, and Jo Salway, director of social partnership and fair work. You're all very welcome, and I shall say this: happy new year to you as well.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you very much.\" said by Jeremy Miles AM\n\"Welcome. Before we go into questions, I'd just like to put on record our thanks for the really comprehensive paper that we received from you, and the time that went in from officials to put that together as well. We're really grateful for that piece of work; we know the work that has gone into that. We did ask a lot of questions, so we are really grateful for the paper that we have received, and this has helped us greatly in our preparation for today's session.So, I'll move swiftly to questions, and I'll start, Minister. Perhaps you can briefly set out the main principles that have guided the allocation of your budget across education and Welsh language, and perhaps you could touch on how you've taken into account COVID, the pandemic, and if that's continued to influence any of your thinking, or if you've taken into consideration pressures such as the cost-of-living pressures that we're seeing at the moment.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair, and good morning, and a happy new year to you all. Thank you for your initial comments on the research paper\u2014that is appreciated, so thank you for that.\" said by Jeremy Miles AM\n\"I should say\u2014and I think all Ministers will probably be saying this when they are being scrutinised on their budgets\u2014it was probably one of the toughest budgets during devolution, really, to write. The economic backdrop is punishing, both in terms of the inflationary pressures, but cost-of-living pressures more broadly, obviously the effect of the war in Ukraine and the obligations we've taken on as a Government in relation to that, but also, as you were alluding to in your question, the ongoing effects of the pandemic. We obviously know that COVID is still with us, and the effects of COVID in school, clearly, are with us, and in colleges and universities as well. The funding settlement that we received from the UK Government was not sufficient to meet the current pressures in the budget, let alone future plans. So, against that backdrop, I think that where we and other Ministers have been able to maintain the level of funding, that itself has been challenging and has been an accomplishment in its own terms, just to maintain the level of funding.But the principles that we've brought to bear, in writing the budget, have been probably twofold, really: one is to make sure that as much money as possible is reaching the front line. We know that there are all sorts of pressures, for example, in schools at the moment, and teachers are providing a whole range of other support to pupils and students, which they ordinarily perhaps wouldn't. So, making sure that we can continue to support the workforce on the front line has been a really important priority. And the twin priority with that, I guess, has been to make sure that, where there are particularly vulnerable groups, that they get the additional support that they need. And vulnerability comes in many forms: one is in relation to the impact of COVID, but, as you also say, the impact on the cost of living as well.So, on the question of COVID, there is no longer a funding stream coming from Westminster in relation to that. There is no longer a central COVID reserve in the Welsh Government, so I and other Ministers have been looking for provision within our own budgets to make sure that we can address the ongoing pressures\u2014in my case, in the education system. I was very pleased to be able to make sure that we can continue the level of funding for the recruit, recover, raise standards programme, which has been very welcomed by schools, because it's flexible and gives schools the scope that they need, at a local level, to address the needs of their particular cohorts of pupils. We had thought that this year we would need to start tapering that down quite significantly and, obviously, also next year, but we've been able to maintain the level of that budget rather than reduce it this year, which is a difference of about \u00a35.5 million, so I think that's a very important part of the response to COVID. That helps us to recruit and maintain roughly 1,800 posts in schools, so that's a significant contribution to the workforce, operating in a very flexible, tailored way in schools.And I guess the other part of your question was in relation to the cost of living: there are a number of interventions in that space. Perhaps the most obvious, though, is in relation to the pupil development grant, where there's an additional \u00a39 million that we've been able to find to increase that. You know, that pot of money was already very significant; it's one of the largest single items that we fund schools directly for, and that's now been increased by \u00a39 million this year. So, those, I suppose, are two examples of how those principles have directly shaped the budget this year.\" said by Jeremy Miles AM\n\"Thank you, Minister. Can you briefly summarise how sustainability and the interests of future generations have been reflected in the budget?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Well, I suppose, in a way, it is defined by the needs of future generations, really, isn't it, given it's an education budget. It's all about making sure that we give future generations the best start in life. In a sense, that's the organising principle of the entire budget. One of the key principles in the legislation, of course, is to act in a way that is preventative\u2014and I would argue again that is a theme that applies throughout the entire budget. I've talked a little bit just now about PDG\u2014that's partly a preventative measure, isn't it, to make sure that we can seek to address some of the disadvantage that some pupils face. Also, the additional funding in relation to the additional learning needs reform programme that we've been able to find for this year also has a preventative theme underpinning it. The new curriculum is designed to enable us to meet the four purposes and obviously contribute to the principles of the legislation. I think that's\u2014. We'll probably come on and talk about that, I imagine.On the capital side, I think there are some very strong examples in the budget in relation to that. You already know that, as of the beginning of last year, all new capital investment, through sustainable communities for learning, as it's now called, needs to be deployed in net-zero schools and colleges, so that's a significant contribution to the sustainable development principle. And Members may recall that I launched an initiative last year, the sustainable schools challenge, which is designed to bring the curriculum and the capital programme together in some way. So, it's a package of funding that will fund two schools\u2014one in north Wales, one in south Wales\u2014where the schools have been built from sustainable materials, natural fabrics, where that's possible, and where the staff and pupils of the school have been involved in the design of it. That was based on actually visiting a school in south Wales where I saw at first-hand young people help design part of a building and I thought, 'Well, actually, there's some scope here to do this more broadly.' So, I'll be announcing the winners, as it were, of that challenge in the next few weeks\u2014I hope before the end of this month. We had 17 bids for that, so it was a very popular scheme. That's an example of how we're trying to bring all parts of the portfolio together and have an underlying principle of meeting the obligations in the Act.\" said by Jeremy Miles AM\n\"Brilliant. And you mentioned in your opening statement just about how difficult financial times are at the moment and how difficult it's been setting the budget. Are there any programme for government or co-operation agreement commitments that you've not been able to take forward fully or as quickly as you would like due to those budget constraints?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Well, that's been where we\u2019ve focused our efforts, really, to make sure that we don't need to do that. I think the programme for government and the co-operation agreement, obviously, are at the heart of what we're promising to deliver, so we've been able to prioritise that. So, we've been able to maintain or, indeed, as I've just outlined, extend some of the funding in relation to the programme for government commitments. In the co-operation agreement, the funding for universal primary free school meals, for example, and the funding to the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol, <em>y ganolfan dysgu</em>\u2014those have been important. It's been important for us to preserve the commitments and the funding that goes with that.\" said by Jeremy Miles AM\n\"Thank you. We'll move on to some questions now from James Evans.&nbsp;\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you. Good morning, Minister. I want to talk about cost-of-living pressures on learners and families, and you just touched there on free school meals. I'd like to know from which budget line the \u00a311 million to finance the extension of free school meals during the holidays until February 2023 is being sourced in the 2022-23 budget. Is that coming out of the universal provisions of free school meals budgets, as the provisional local government settlement suggested? And can you confirm that there are no negative impacts on that priority?\" said by James Evans MS\n\"Yes. Our principle in relation to that policy has, obviously, been to maximise the roll-out, really, as quickly as possible, given the cost-of-living pressures that families are under. There's been an increasing eligibility for free school meals, but we also all know that there is a large cohort of families who don't qualify, but are finding it very, very hard. So, that's been a top priority for us to do that as quickly as possible.The direct answer to your question is that the \u00a311 million, which is being used to finance the extension until the end of February, is from an underspend in the projected funding set aside for delivery of the programme. It isn't surprising that there are some underspends in that because it's a novel programme being delivered at speed, so you make assumptions in the budget about who's ready when to draw the budget. So, we've been able to find that money from that underspend, so it's not affecting the speed of the roll-out. That is driven solely by the capacity of the system to deliver rather than the availability of funding. But, having found it, we've been able to deploy that then to extend through holidays.\" said by Jeremy Miles AM\n\"Okay, fine. As you said, it's coming to an end in February 2023, is that still going ahead as planned, or are you perhaps going to extend it?\" said by James Evans MS\n\"Well, as with every other time\u2014. Every other time we've been able to extend it, we've been able to do that very near the point at which it's gone live, if you like, and the reason for that, I think, is twofold. One is that we want to identify the existence of a need\u2014well, clearly, we know that that exists now. Secondly, we need to identify a source of funding for it. We've been able to fund it by looking at other programmes that are demand led, but the demand isn't what we projected, and freeing up funding from that. That's just a part of prudent budget management, really. And so, that's where we are today. We haven't yet got funding identified for extension, but we are having those discussions this time, like we have every other time. We've been able to find \u00a3100 million so far to do that, so those discussions are ongoing at the moment.\" said by Jeremy Miles AM\n\"Okay, because you've also got a pilot, haven't you, in year 7\u2014free school breakfasts in secondary education, and that was introduced in 2020. That's coming to an end at the end of this academic year. Have you considered extending that at all, and what assessment has been made of success on that?\" said by James Evans MS\n\"Yes. The pilot for that was extended to the end of this academic year. It was slowed down because of COVID, effectively, so we ran it longer. So, the pilot does come to an end at the end of this academic year. There are 45 schools running the pilot for us. I don't know yet what the plan will be after that because we haven't had the evaluation. The Welsh Local Government Association are working on that now. I'm expecting to get that, I think, in February, so it will be an interim evaluation that will help us get a sense of where we are. And, then, obviously, there'll be a full evaluation after the pilot's completed, and, when I have that, we'll be able to make some judgments.&nbsp;\" said by Jeremy Miles AM\n\"Okay. Thank you very much. Moving on to post-16 education, you say that the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales are working to monitor the impacts of cost-of-living challenges, and that universities are actually using their own funding a lot of the time to fund students, and using their own resources. What consideration, then, have you given to non-domiciled Welsh students living here, considering that they don't get any support from the Welsh Government with regard to the education maintenance allowance?\" said by James Evans MS\n\"Was that the\u2014\" said by Jeremy Miles AM\n\"The Welsh student support package.\" said by James Evans MS\n\"Yes, okay. Well, they obviously don't get the Welsh student support package, and, generally speaking, that [correction: other support packages], obviously\u2014certainly within the UK and internationally\u2014is [correction: are] not as supportive as the funding that we've been able to provide students. So, the support for those students in universities comes in a range of different ways. The hardship funding that universities provide is available not only, obviously, to Welsh domiciled students, but also to students elsewhere. I expect that we will see, when the data's available for the take-up of hardship funds at the end of the academic year, that there's been a significant number of claims on those funds by non-Welsh domiciled students.There is a little bit of a tension in the system that universities do recognise, which is a little bit of a perception amongst international students specifically that there may be risks to their visa criteria if they apply for hardship funding. &nbsp;\" said by Jeremy Miles AM\n\"Yes.&nbsp;\" said by James Evans MS\n\"So, universities are very alive to that and have a very good understanding of who's applying for funding and how to make sure that those perceptions are addressed. But there are also other sources of support that are available to non-Welsh domiciled students. So, the mental health funding that has gone into the system is available to all students from all backgrounds, and the other support that universities themselves are providing\u2014extended opening hours, discounted food, recycled laptop equipment; there's a range of different initiatives across the system\u2014obviously, those are available to students whether they're Welsh domiciled or not.&nbsp;\" said by Jeremy Miles AM\n\"Okay. Thank you. I just want to move on to the EMA, because the current level is being retained at \u00a317.4 million. Given the changes to the economic situation in the country with regard to inflation and the cost of everything going up, how did you calculate and assess the potential demand from learners, and what changes were you considering to the level of support? And is this something that you're monitoring quite closely just in case things have to change as we go along?&nbsp;\" said by ", "answer": "James Evans MS"}

I'm chief officer of social care in Wrexham and currently the president of ADSS.\" said by Alwyn Jones\n\"Thank you very much, and a very warm welcome to you.\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"Welcome to everybody. We'll crack on. As I said, we've got quite a bit of ground to cover. Obviously, the NHS budget, and the social services budget, is a huge chunk of the Government budget and is under the spotlight at the moment as well. I'd like to start. The Welsh Government says it's reprioritised its funding based on three priorities. What are your views on these? Is it clear from the budget documentation how these have been reflected in the allocations and how will the funding address these priorities? We could maybe start in the room. Sally or Darren, you choose.\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"I'm happy to open. Thanks very much for the opportunity to talk to you today. I think in the way that the Welsh Government budget is described around protecting front-line services and protecting future ambitions, you can't argue with any of that. We know that front-line services in health and social care have been under extreme pressure for a considerable period of time thorough COVID and pre COVID. The area that we're most interested in is protecting the future ambitions, particularly around training and retention of the workforce\u2014so, looking after the future\u2014and continuing to provide help for those most impacted. We've got the health challenges and social care challenges, but also the cost-of-living challenges, which are having a knock-on effect on people's health, so another very important area. And supporting the economy, because we know if the economy is doing well, people's health is improved, and particularly mental health. So, all very sensible things, but, like most budgetary issues, the devil's in the detail.&nbsp;\" said by Darren Hughes\n\"Does anybody want to add to that\u2014Sally, maybe?&nbsp;\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"The ambitions are really helpful and clear. I think it's about, as Darren said, how these then get operationalised. At the moment, I think what we're facing is pressures in the NHS that are higher than we've ever seen before. I've been in the NHS for 32 years. This now feels very, very difficult in terms of both the demands facing us, but also inflationary pressures and, clearly, those workforce challenges that have grown up over a number of years, compounded by some of the issues that have occurred for people during COVID. People are burnt out and are struggling in some ways with the workload that's now facing them. There's been no respite. And I think that means that we really do need to focus, as Darren says, on that future\u2014how do we build resilience in our current workforce, retain people, but then also make sure that we're training the workforce for the future as well.\" said by Sally May\n\"Alwyn.\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"I've not got a lot to add to that. I think the reality is that the current budget does support us in terms of protecting front-line public services. I think maybe where there's a challenge in the budget is in terms of our ambitions for the future. Clearly, we have lots of ambitions in terms of strengthening the workforce available to support social care, and I think there is probably some way to go in terms of being able to support that through this current budget. But certainly in terms of protecting front-line public services, I think the budget achieves that. In terms of our ability to continue to fund those, and clearly in terms of being ambitious around being able to recruit, train, and strengthen that workforce, I think we've probably got still some way to go.&nbsp;\" said by Alwyn Jones\n\"So, do you think you're having to curtail your ambition because of what's happened?\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"I think that would be fair. I think in terms of where we want to go in terms of parity of esteem for workers in social care, and strengthening that workforce, I think that's going to be difficult within the current budget\u2014probably not possible.&nbsp;\" said by Alwyn Jones\n\"Anything to add, Dave?\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"Nothing specifically. I think Alwyn's covered that off. Obviously, in terms of the issue around providing help to those most affected, there's a lot of publicity around people waiting for domiciliary care, and the impact on the NHS. I don't think we would want to lose that. I know we are in unprecedented times in the context of people waiting for mental health support, and indeed the impact that COVID has had on children's services.&nbsp;\" said by Dave Street\n\"Thank you. Coming back to you, Darren, last week the Minister for Health and Social Services said to the Health and Social Care Committee\u2014and Russ was there\u2014that the NHS has to focus far more clearly on a smaller number of points, and she hoped you would agree streamlining is the right direction to go in. Do you agree with that approach? Is it sensible and is it clear what needs to be prioritised?\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"I think when everything is a priority, nothing is a priority. We're here today to talk about some of the limitations on resource, and the biggest limiting factor for the NHS is workforce, in terms of being tired, in terms of absolute numbers, in terms of training.&nbsp;The six priorities the Minister's listed\u2014I'll just make a few brief points about each, if that's okay. In terms of delayed transfers of care, that's a huge issue for the NHS, with around 12 to 15 per cent of NHS beds with people in them. It's not the best place for those people to be, for their well-being, but also it's really difficult then for the NHS to function effectively with the huge increase in demand of people coming through the front door. The 111 calls and 999 calls, and the number of people visiting GPs, is something we need to focus on, and the limiting factor there is workforce. Access to general practice, yes, is something we all agree with, and people getting the care as close to home and as soon as possible. There've been workforce challenges around dentistry. Again, big challenges there, and people's oral health declining. Declaring an interest as I'm married to an optician, but opticians are doing a lot more than they've done previously in terms of emergency eye care\u2014the Welsh eye care initiative. If you look at the complete list there\u2014supporting urgent and emergency care, planned care, recovery, mental health\u2014it's still a very extensive list, and the things that sit under those headings are still very broad. I think it's fair to say we're facing challenges on all of those fronts, and if there was one factor common to all of them, it's that sustainability of the workforce.&nbsp;\" said by Darren Hughes\n\"So, do you think that the relative priorities\u2014? Are they getting it right? Or is it\u2014?\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"I think the priorities are right, and they are the things we should focus on; it's our ability to deal with them is the challenging bit.&nbsp;\" said by Darren Hughes\n\"Russ.\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"Thank you, Chair, and thanks, Darren, for your answer. I suppose if you're clear on what the Welsh Government say their priorities are, as you've outlined, are you clear what is not a priority, or what is a lesser priority for the Welsh Government?\" said by Russell George AM\n\"From an NHS point of view, I think everything we do sits under those priorities, and the focus is our ability. In planned care, we've seen the size of the waiting list going up not just in Wales, but in all parts of the UK\u2014waiting lists growing, and people's condition deteriorates the longer they're on the waiting list and, often, their mental health does. So, these are priorities. But our ability to provide urgent and emergency care has to be protected. We've seen news stories about the challenges there.&nbsp;\" said by Darren Hughes\n\"I suppose, almost, if everything that is a priority for you is in the Government's priorities, what's the point of having priorities?&nbsp;\" said by Russell George AM\n\"We do need to focus, and there are things you have to with a finite amount of resource. The NHS, through the difficult times, has focused on the areas where people are in the most clinical need. The urgency when you\u2014. You really feel for the people who've been on waiting lists for considerable periods of time, but it's the life threatening and more serious\u2014\" said by Darren Hughes\n\"I suppose what I was trying to get out is do you have a sense, if the Government has got priorities, that something else has got to give. Do you feel that you've got from the Government an understanding of what has to give in order to make the other areas priorities?&nbsp;\" said by Russell George AM\n\"I think it is that focus\u2014focusing the finite resources that you've got on things that\u2014. I'm sure if you asked patients, you'd get a similar answer. We're hearing stories from family members about difficulty in accessing dentistry. It's very urgent for those people, and there is that focus on clinical need. But also\u2014and colleagues onscreen have touched on that longer\u2014we need to invest in the future workforce to enable us to deliver in the future whilst delivering today. And I think probably the biggest frustration in terms of a financial point of view is clarity around what we can afford in terms of training the workforce for the future, because we know what the problems are now and how to address them from a workforce point of view, but you can't do that overnight.&nbsp;\" said by Darren Hughes\n\"Mike.&nbsp;\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"I just want to raise primary care. Now, I'm fairly confident, when we have the budget coming out and it goes to health boards, the percentage increase into the health boards will not be equalled by the percentage increase for primary care. It never has done since primary care and secondary care were merged, which I think was a complete and utter disaster for primary care. But if we don't get primary care right and people don't see the GP at the right time, then they end up at A&amp;E. What are you intending to do\u2014and I think this is probably aimed at somebody working in health\u2014to try and get people seen on time by GPs in order that they don't use A&amp;E as the alternative and, secondly, that they don't end up getting worse so they have to use A&amp;E?&nbsp;\" said by Mike Hedges AM\n\"If it's okay, I'll say a few things about the general picture, and go to Sally for some specifics from Cwm Taf Morgannwg. I think it's slightly over-simplistic to say it's just about GPs. We've heard about\u2014. I'm talking about community care, as I would describe primary care, because I think we fall into the trap of saying primary care equals GPs, where pharmacy is playing a huge and increasing role, and the amount spent in pharmacy for the minor ailments service so that people don't need to see GPs. In many parts of Wales, recruitment of GPs is a huge issue. My generation of friends and people I know who are GPs, their ambition was to buy into a GP practice. They worked hard, saved hard, bought into a GP practice as a great career ambition. Now, in many parts of Wales\u2014Cwm Taf Morgannwg being a particular example\u2014we're unable to recruit GPs into those areas where GPs are now directly employed. The pressure on community services is huge. I can't give you a figure, but I can come back to the committee after about the proportion of health board budgets spent in community and spent on secondary care. But, I think the challenge on this one, like many others, is that workforce and sustainability. There are vacancies in my local GP practice, and similarly for colleagues around the table in your areas as well.&nbsp;\" said by Darren Hughes\n\"From the Cwm Taf view, or from your view?\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"That and a broader view. So, clearly, there are challenges in terms of recruitment of GPs, but we need to think about the broader primary care team and workforce diversification. So, many practices in the cluster development space are using pharmacists in a different way. We're starting to see paramedics used in a different way, and a team approach around the patient, which I think is more responsive. Over time, we also need to think about how people are supported by digital and the different interaction. We're seeing the NHS app developing. I think that will be really helpful for people to be able to hold and see their own records, and it empowers them.But, from the Cwm Taf Morgannwg perspective, primary care is a focus for us. We've just reorganised ourselves into care groups. Primary and community care is one of our care groups. We deliberately created that to give it that focus. And we are thinking about our resource framework about how we show that we're moving resource from acute out into primary and community care. The challenges with that are that, obviously, the demands at the front door almost drag resource into the wrong place, and we need to have a planned approach to trying to move that. That's what we're trying to create as we move forward, but the challenges at the moment are that we're opening additional capacity just to get through the winter because of the challenges of delayed transfers of care, high demand and high acuity.\" said by Sally May\n\"So, is it clear from the budget, and is it transparent from the budget that you've seen from the Minister and, effectively, from the Government, that there is a floor in the budget that says you can see a direct line to that, or is there some opaqueness in where that money is to be spent?\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"In terms of primary care, absolutely, because each of the contracts has got a separate\u2014. We understand how that comes in and the resources allocated. Some of the budgets, like dental, are ring-fenced and, so, that's clear what the funding is and how it will be spent, and we have to set that out at the start of the year. Community care is probably less clear as a direct funding stream, but we are clear in terms of how we set out our expenditure, our budgets, so that we can try and track that movement over time.\" said by Sally May\n\"And then, maybe bringing in colleagues in social care, what about that link between the two, because one doesn't work without the other, and then it becomes that link between who funds what, especially getting people out of hospital into a social care setting? Alwyn or Dave, have you got an idea of that transparency from that point of view? Would you understand where the money has been allocated and how you're dovetailing that to make it work? Which one of you would be best placed to talk about that?\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"I think there is a knowledge of where the money has been allocated and where it's been spent. I think that some of the other challenges that colleagues from the NHS Confed have referenced there are almost mirrored in social care as well. On your comment around how the money is spent when people are discharged, I don't think that's a major factor at the moment. I think the real hindrance in terms of our ability to get people out of hospital is our sheer inability to recruit staff, both as local authorities and, indeed, in the independent sector.\" said by Dave Street\n\"Okay. Great. I know Rhianon wanted to come in, but I'm conscious of time, so I'm going to move on, and we'll do that in a bit.\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"That's fine. I'll dovetail.\" said by Rhianon Passmore AM\n\"What's your assessment of the Welsh Government's draft budget for 2023-24, which allocates funding increases for health and social care as well as local government? To what extent, in your fields, will that protect front-line services?\" said by ", "answer": "Peredur Owen Griffiths MS"}
{"content": "\"Item 2 is in regard to the Health Service Procurement (Wales) Bill, which has been referred to our committee for Stage 1 scrutiny.

I'm Leanne Roberts. I'm the policy lead for healthcare procurement reform.&nbsp;\" said by Leanne Roberts\n\"Eluned Morgan, health and social services Minister for Wales.&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Eluned Morgan AM\n\"Dafydd Evans, senior responsible officer for the Bill.&nbsp;\" said by Dafydd Evans\n\"Nick Lambert, Welsh Government legal services, Treasury team.\" said by Nick Lambert\n\"Thank you very much. Welcome back to some of the panel, who were with us for a technical briefing. We appreciate that, Minister. That was very helpful in our early discussions of the scrutiny process. So, thank you for that. Perhaps I'll ask the Minister: what does the Government want to achieve from this Bill? What's the Government seeking to achieve?\" said by Russell George AM\n\"In order to answer that, if you don't mind, I'll just give a little bit of a background to how we came here, because it is a little bit complicated, and this is not the most exciting Bill you will have had in front of you as a committee. So, what happened is, after we left the European Union, the UK Government said, 'Look, we'll do things differently when it comes to procurement.' And the health team in the UK Government said, 'Oh, well, you know what? We might want to carve ourselves out of whatever you're going to do with the rest of the economy. We want something specific for health, and we want to do things differently for health.' And, as it happens, there was the Health and Care Act 2022 that was going through Parliament. They, therefore, effectively, have written something so that they can have a separate selection regime, so a separate procurement approach from the rest of the economy.Now, because health is devolved, that was effectively an English-only Bill, so they just cracked on with that and didn't actually think about the implications for us, and obviously we live cheek by jowl with the English NHS. They have a huge market, we have 3 million people that we have to service. So, suddenly, we're in a situation where we're going to find ourselves in a different procurement place from England, and there are potential implications for that. So, what we're doing here is we're plugging a gap that has been created by some of the actions that have happened in England, and allowing us the opportunity, should we wish, to align ourselves to the new health procurement regime in England. Now, the problem is they're still going through that process at the moment, so we're not quite sure where it's going to land, in terms of what's going to be covered, but what we want through this Bill is the opportunity and the ability to be able to align, should we wish to do so. I hope that's given a little bit of a background, because it's quite technical, but that's a little bit of the background.&nbsp;\" said by Eluned Morgan AM\n\"Can I come in straight away, just with a little supplementary? You said that you want to give yourselves an opportunity, as a Government, to align with changes in England. Do you see it exclusively in that way? Or do you see this also as an opportunity to differentiate yourself and head in a different direction, if you so wish, if you're not happy with what you're seeing developing in England?&nbsp;\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"So, that's an opportunity as well. We're going to have to see what they do and whether we want to follow that. At the moment, we don't know what they're going to put in, so what we didn't want to do was just say, 'Chuck us in that Bill', because we don't know what they're going to come up with. But this will give us the opportunity to follow or not follow, as we see fit.\" said by Eluned Morgan AM\n\"Okay, thank you.&nbsp;\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"What do you see, Minister, as\u2014? What's your vision, I suppose, for health procurement in Wales?\" said by Russell George AM\n\"I think what's important is to understand that procurement in itself is not what we're about. We're about delivering our vision, which has been set out in 'A Healthier Wales', and what we need in terms of procurement is a system that will enable us to deliver the vision that we've got. What we have been advocating for a while is, perhaps, more collaborative working, making sure we've got high-quality services that are delivered efficiently, that are focused on patient outcomes, but making sure we also have the right checks and balances, which ensures that we spend the little money that we have efficiently on services.\" said by Eluned Morgan AM\n\"Quite rightfully, Minister, you talk about patient outcomes, and you said earlier this isn't the most exciting Bill, as well. What would be your advice if I was to get back home this afternoon and a constituent said to me, 'What have you been doing?' I'd say, 'Well, I've been scrutinising this Bill.' How would you explain to your constituent, for example, how this Bill is going to make the health service better for them or the outcomes better for them?\" said by Russell George AM\n\"I guess until we see the regulations, it's difficult to say, so let's remember this is what they call a framework Bill. It gives us a holding place where we can then make regulations underneath that, so it gives us the authority and the ability to make rules in future\u2014\" said by Eluned Morgan AM\n\"Can you give us an example, perhaps?\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Okay. I think what's clear is that there are examples of where there may be barriers to entry for, perhaps, smaller providers, because the procurement rules at the moment could be quite onerous, could be quite high in terms of administrative need. What this will give us an opportunity to do, for example\u2014at the moment, the default position is that everything's got to go through procurement\u2014what this will do for us in future is allow us, for example, the opportunity to roll over contracts that exist already. If they're being well serviced, if we're getting efficiency from the system, we could roll over those contracts. So, that's one thing. It's very difficult to do that now; we have to go through the whole onerous activity. And if, for example, we could see that there was only the possibility of one tender coming up, then we could, perhaps, look at a direct contract being awarded. And then, of course, competition is the third factor. But, at the moment, it's just assumed everything goes out to competition. So, it just gives us a lot more flexibility in future that should save, or could potentially save on some administrative work. I don't know if Dafydd would like to expand on that.\" said by Eluned Morgan AM\n\"Thank you, Minister. We've heard from a number of places that there are things that would want to be looked at through the regulations, so, exploring some of the things. But, currently, because of the way that procurement is done, and it's quite formal through that tendering\u2014. People have talked to us about wanting to explore things like clusters, so where a health board may work with GPs and others in the third sector to come together to collaboratively put that best service together, perhaps, for communities. So, by having a process that is more collaborative, as the Minister's described, rather than it starting with formal procurement, there may be examples there where you could look at services slightly differently and bring a collaboration together to give those better services. So, those are the things we'd want to explore, I think, through the regulations and through consultation. But a Bill that is competition last, which is what this is, a provider selector regime, rather than competition first, which is what the default the Minister has described is, gives you that opportunity. We won't be able to explore those as well without.&nbsp;\" said by Dafydd Evans\n\"I think the other thing is the third sector. There are real opportunities for the third sector here, as well. That's something I'm particularly interested in.\" said by Eluned Morgan AM\n\"I think what Dafydd has outlined, and yourself, is what we've heard ourselves in the earlier evidence sessions. So, certainly, we've had that view from some stakeholders that it's a complex landscape at the moment in terms of commissioning. Minister, are you happy, and your officials as well, with the level of engagement that you've had with the UK Government?\" said by Russell George AM\n\"I think it's fair to say that in the early days it wasn't great. They were just cracking on with this Health and Care Act and the provider selector regime development, and hadn't really thought about the impact it would have on us. So, after I wrote to the Minister, we have had better engagement. We have seen, for example, an early draft of their regulations, but we haven't got the final draft yet, so what I am hoping\u2014. Things have definitely improved and they've agreed to liaise with our officials on cross-border arrangements as part of developing their guidelines. So, it's certainly improved, but it wasn't great at the beginning, I think it's fair to say.\" said by Eluned Morgan AM\n\"Have you had any opportunity at all to feed into the UK Government's policy development in regard to the PSR?\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Not really, and not early on. I think it's just kind of having a look at what's coming our way, because obviously, we don't have to follow everything that they're doing; health is devolved. So, once we know what they're doing, we can make a judgment then as to whether we want to follow it or not.\" said by Eluned Morgan AM\n\"Okay. Thank you. Jack.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Thanks, Chair. Good morning, Minister. We've heard the same from officials and other evidence sessions that we hold. I'm just trying to gauge the risk of absolutely not doing this and how real that risk is.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"So, I think, what we've had as a response from the people we've consulted with, so the people who commission, is a very clear, 'We want to align', okay? So, that's the line they've heard from us. So, there may be examples\u2014. So, at the moment, for example, if you look at some very complex mental health support, we currently commission some of that from England, and what we don't want is a situation where those organisations in England that are providing a service to us now, for what is quite a small market\u2014because you can imagine, we're not talking about a lot of people\u2014they might just say, 'That's a completely different procurement regime. We're not playing; it's just too much trouble for us.' So, that's the danger is that we lose some of those services that exist at the moment. That's one of the dangers, anyway.\" said by Eluned Morgan AM\n\"That's a good example as well.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Gareth and then Rhun. Gareth.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Thanks, Chair. I just want to ask on maybe a technical level; we see a lot of LCMs going through the Senedd that are replications of or passages of UK legislation that comes to the Senedd, so, in that sense, if we're taking a lot of the elements of the Health and Care Act from the UK, why was that not an LCM, and why is it a procurement Bill? Is that the will of UK Ministers to have something different in Wales, or is that the will of the Welsh Government to say, 'We want to take different elements and make our own Bill', as a consequence of the Health and Care Act going through the UK? I appreciate it's quite a layman's question, but just on a technical level, I'd just like to know.\" said by Gareth Davies MS\n\"So, had we gone down the LCM route and asked them to put us under the Health and Care Act, then we wouldn't have had any possibility of diverging from whatever they're going to come up with. And at the moment, what we're talking about is a framework Bill and the interesting bit of this legislation will come when we're looking at the regulations. So, what is it that's captured in the regulations? And until we see that, it's difficult for us to assess whether we want to align or not. So, we need the flexibility through this very short Bill that we're bringing through here to allow us to either copy or to say, 'Well, we'll take most of it, but there may be some areas where we don't want to play the same way you're playing in England.' So, that's why we didn't go down the LCM route.\" said by Eluned Morgan AM\n\"Rhun.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"I want to go back to the response to Jack's question. I understand in principle why officials would be afraid that service providers could decide that they don't want to provide services to Wales again. That would raise concerns about losing services. But to what extent have you been able to prove that that would happen, by speaking to providers who say, 'Do you know what? We don't foresee that we would want to be part of a health regime in Wales if there was a different procurement regime'?&nbsp;\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"Dafydd, do you want to come in here?\" said by Eluned Morgan AM\n\"So, most of the conversations we've had in the informal engagement so far have been with the NHS and specifically with the people in the NHS who manage all of the procurement and all of these relationships with the providers. So, I think it's their operational advice in the way that they currently manage these that\u2014. They know that there are already tensions sometimes in being able to get services even under the current level playing field, because, as the Minister said, we're a small\u2014we're sometimes a small market. So, we had a very clear message from the procurement experts in the NHS that, if you change the level of the playing field again\u2014. There were some services, which we talked about last time\u2014renal services, mental health services\u2014where they're saying there's a very real risk of this.\" said by Dafydd Evans\n\"It would be very useful to us as a committee if we were able to have this\u2014even if it's unattributed, even if it's fairly confidential\u2014so that we can understand better those actual concerns that arise from actual contracts that are currently held between the NHS and providers, if that might be available.\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"Well, I guess it's their information to give, so\u2014\" said by Eluned Morgan AM\n\"Indeed.\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"\u2014we'll have to ask them whether they\u2014. But you could ask them that directly, couldn't you, as a committee?&nbsp;\" said by Eluned Morgan AM\n\"We'll do that.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Our hope is that you already have it, that you could pass it on.\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"Yes, I mean that's part of the consultation\u2014that's what has been fed back to us.\" said by Eluned Morgan AM\n\"Thank you. That's a good suggestion. Jenny, I want to come to you, but then do you want to come on to your set of questions after you ask your supplementary?\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Yes, okay. So, just to clarify, it's a really helpful initial explanation, and I understand your desire to have flexibility, where you want to have a partnership approach, involving the voluntary sector et cetera, but, on the really big-ticket items of procurement, we're talking procuring from very large companies\u2014the pharmaceutical industry is way bigger than the Welsh Government\u2014so, on those big-ticket items, is it normally quite\u2014? I would assume, or I wanted to explore whether you would normally want to be involved in that provider selection regime in negotiating those really difficult prices that pharmaceuticals try to extract from the NHS for new medicines, for example.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"So, I think it's really important for us to make sure there is an understanding that this is about clinical services, so, not goods.\" said by Eluned Morgan AM\n\"Okay, not goods. Okay.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Okay. So, that makes a big difference, obviously. So, we are talking about quite niche services. But there are opportunities as well. We were talking about services in England, as the example I gave, the mental health one\u2014very complex mental health\u2014but there's an opportunity also for Welsh companies, organisations, to be providing services to England, don't forget. So, we've got to remember that there's a different side to this as well. So, they might want to procure services from Wales and, under the new system, it may be that particular third sector organisations here in Wales may say, 'Actually, those barriers, some of those barriers have been removed now in a way that we wouldn't want to get involved in the past'\u2014that, actually, there's an opportunity not just here in Wales, but actually to get into the English market as well.\" said by Eluned Morgan AM\n\"Okay.

{"content": "\"Prynhawn da. Before I call on First Minister's questions today, and on behalf of us all, I want to express our condolences with our colleague Carolyn Thomas, after the sudden and cruel loss of her son, Ben. Our thoughts and prayers are with you, Carolyn, and your family.And, also, as we begin our proceedings today, I'm sure we are all horrified by the death and destruction we're witnessing in pictures from Turkey and Syria. Our thoughts as a Senedd are with the people of that region as they seek to rescue, to survive and to grieve.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"The Trefnydd now will be answering questions on behalf of the First Minister today, and the first question, <em>cwestiwn</em> 1, Rhun ap Iorwerth.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"1. Will the First Minister make a statement on the Welsh Government's response to the 2 Sisters Food Group's consultation on the closure of its site in Llangefni? OQ59108\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"Diolch. Welsh Government had no prior knowledge of the announcement of the 2 Sisters Food Group's consultation. We are committed to doing all we can to support the people affected and ensure all parties work together to deliver a sustainable future for the local economy.&nbsp;\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"Thank you, Minister. It is now almost a fortnight since the announcement of the consultation\u2014it was a short one anyway. And, although it was clear from the outset that the risk was that this was a decision that had already been made, it is crucial, of course, that the priority is to see whether there is anything that can be done to change the company's mind. But, we must simultaneously prepare for the worst. We are talking about a huge impact on the community\u20143 per cent of the whole workforce on Anglesey.&nbsp;In light of that, would the Minister agree with me that the response must be significant and swift, from the Welsh and UK Governments, given that so much of what has driven this, from Brexit to energy costs, is the responsibility of the UK Government, and, from significant investment in job creation to support with the cost of living, that Ministers in London and Cardiff need to make an early statement that the community, the council and the economic development plans can expect significant financial support?\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"Thank you. I think 2 Sisters Poultry Ltd are maintaining it's a meaningful consultation and no decision has been made. But, I think you are quite right\u2014we do need, obviously, to prepare for the worst. As I say, we had no prior knowledge of that. I think it would have been helpful had we have had some prior knowledge. We worked very closely with that plant, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic; you'll remember it did have an outbreak, and we worked very closely with them. We have had a relationship with them, so I think it was disappointing that they didn't contact us ahead of the announcement.&nbsp;As you know\u2014and you're absolutely a part of the discussions\u2014we are all working in partnership together. On the day of the announcement, both I and the Minister for Economy met with the leader of Ynys M\u00f4n county council. Then there were further discussions. The First Minister himself met with the authority on the following morning, and, then, I know you met with the Minister for Economy last Tuesday, and, obviously, the taskforce has now been set up. It was held for the first time on 3 February, when all the partners that you referred to were there, along with the trade union and the Department for Work and Pensions. And I think it is absolutely right that\u2014. This is another example, isn't it, of where Brexit, inflation and the energy crisis are having an absolute detrimental effect on all of our communities, creating that perfect storm that we really don't want to see. But, these are real people who are being affected by this, so we are, once again, urging the UK Government to act quickly to support Welsh businesses, and, as a Government, we will continue to do all we can.&nbsp;\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"I'd first like to echo the comments made regarding the devastating impact of the proposed closure of the 2 Sisters Llangefni site, and the real importance for both the UK and Welsh Governments to work together to achieve as positive an outcome as possible. So, I certainly support the Member for Ynys M\u00f4n's calls for that.&nbsp;It has been positive, Minister, as I'm sure you'd agree, to see that there are companies on the island and beyond looking to offer further employment to those people who are affected. I'm pleased also that Virginia Crosbie, MP for Ynys M\u00f4n, has been working with employers to see what opportunities can be provided to those impacted as well. You mentioned, Minister, the taskforce that Welsh Government have set up, and it's certainly good to see that happen as quickly as possible. But, I wonder what further assurances you can give that this taskforce will ensure those impacted are supported through the 45-day consultation period, and what work they are doing to look at the long-term viability of the site. And, then, furthermore, what analysis will that taskforce be making of the impact on the wider community of Ynys M\u00f4n&nbsp;and beyond? Diolch yn fawr iawn.\" said by Sam Rowlands MS\n\"Diolch. So, the taskforce does include Welsh Government, Ynys M\u00f4n council, UK Government, the Department for Work and Pensions, the company itself and Unite trade union. There are going to be two parts to it: there's going to be a leadership group, which will obviously have the ministerial input, and then there'll be an operational group, which will be at an official level. And that's to ensure that work progresses at pace. I think that it is really important that that taskforce looks at what we can do to support the affected employees and the communities. It is a really devastating announcement. I absolutely agree with you around that, and I'm aware that the taskforce, on Friday, did absolutely reaffirm its full support.\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"2. What assessment has the First Minister made of the safety of buildings owned by Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board? OQ59098\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board is responsible for the condition of its own estate. Business cases can be submitted to Welsh Government for capital funding for the health board's assessed priorities, which have to be considered against the backdrop of significant capital pressures across NHS Wales.\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"Thank you, Trefnydd. Now, shockingly, some 74 per cent of the buildings owned by this board comply with statutory health and safety requirements, only 64 per cent comply with relevant statutory fire safety requirements, and only 62 per cent are operationally safe. And that's a very worrying concern for my constituents and also patients across north Wales. At Ysbyty Gwynedd, the design and layout actually presents infection prevention and control risks. The hospital that you're directly supporting, Ysbyty Glan Clwyd, now has a maintenance backlog of \u00a337 million. And Bryn y&nbsp;Neuadd, in Llanfairfechan, has a backlog of \u00a327.7 million, and 70 per cent of its occupied floor area recorded as 'not functionally suitable'. And that particular hospital has some very, very vulnerable patients there. They deserve better.Now, the health board's estate strategy states that,'physical condition and statutory compliance of the estate has got worse since the 2019 Estate Strategy'.Now, whilst I'd like clarity as to what financial assistance you will be providing, this is simply not a good state of affairs for a health board that swings from one crisis, or one scandal or story, week by week. Now, at some stage, when are you going to actually look at the management of this health board? And, actually, in something like this, if I was responsible for the maintenance and the upkeep of buildings in a managerial position, I would be expecting some kind of repercussion to come from such a poor report. So, what steps are you taking, Trefnydd, to make sure that my constituents, and other patients across north Wales\u2014\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"I have been extremely generous, Janet Finch-Saunders, so just ask the question now.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Okay. So, what steps are you taking to ensure that my constituents, and patients across north Wales, can actually receive their medical treatment in safe facilities? Diolch.\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"Well, I know what steps you could take, and you could put some pressure on your Government in Westminster to increase our capital budgets. Our capital budgets have not been increased by the UK Government. However, we have committed more than \u00a3335 million towards important NHS and social care capital projects this financial year, and a further \u00a3375 million next year to support those organisations, because it's right across Wales. We know we have a lot of our buildings, across all hospitals and health boards in Wales\u2014. Some of them are over 30 years old. So, we know that there has been an increase in backlog figures, for instance, and I know that the Minister for Health and Social Services has met with the chair of the health board and the interim chief executive of Betsi to discuss what prioritisation the health board has, because, as I said in my opening answer to you, it's up to them to identify the priorities that they have, and then put in the bids to the Welsh Government. But you must appreciate the pressures on our capital budget.\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"Questions now from party leaders. The leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew R.T. Davies.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Thank you, Presiding Officer. Could I identify with the comments that you made earlier in this session, Presiding Officer? And could I ask you, Trefnydd, in light of the horrendous scenes that are coming from Turkey and Syria, and the size of the death total that's going up in the hundreds, if not the thousands, every hour, what assessment has the Welsh Government made of the assistance that we in Wales will be able to give? Very often, that involves search and rescue teams, it involves humanitarian aid and medical supplies generally. Obviously, the UK Government will be leading on this, but Wales has a proud tradition of helping out in situations like this, and speedy and timely intervention is critical. I assume you've made an assessment that the Welsh Government can make a key contribution. So, what will that contribution be and what dialogue have you had with the UK Government to make sure it happens in a timely manner?\" said by Andrew RT Davies AM\n\"I know the Minister for Social Justice has asked her officials to begin those discussions with the UK Government. She herself will be making a statement to the Senedd\u2014probably a written statement, I would imagine. Those discussions have started and, as I say, further information will come forward. You're absolutely right, we do have a very proud tradition. I'm sure there are already people being identified to go and support the rescue operation. As you say, it's just devastating for the region. I do think the number of people killed is going to be significantly in the thousands, as you referred to.\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"I'm sure, as Members, we'd be greatly appreciative of an update as soon as possible, because not unreasonably, obviously, constituents and organisations that are able to help are getting in touch with us, and that would be most welcome. I can see the Minister indicating that will be forthcoming.&nbsp;Last week, we had from the auditor general the report on the purchase of Gilestone Farm. It made for interesting reading. The description by the risk assessment board of the Welsh Government was that the process that was used to buy Gilestone Farm was 'novel'. Some people think of <em>Yes, Minister</em> or <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em> in the civil service speak when you think of such language. But, when you look into some of the comments within that report, it identifies six meetings over the period when key decisions were being made with officials and the Green Man Festival. They were on 22 October, 26 January, 28 January, 11 February, 7 March and 23 March. Not one single note or minute was taken of those meetings. Not one single note or minute. You're a Minister of some considerable standing, leader of the house, and have been in Government some considerable time. Can you think of a situation where an interested party would be so heavily engaged in discussions where they could potentially be such a beneficiary of a considerable sum of public funds and not a single minute, note or record of six meetings was taken during that time?\" said by Andrew RT Davies AM\n\"I have to say, I am a Minister that does make a lot of notes. I've always done that, and I've always dated them. I think that's really important. But, I think what we need to look at in relation to the auditor general's letter\u2014. I think it did make for interesting reading. There were a lot of positives in there, which I'm sure you won't welcome, but there were a lot of positives around the way that Welsh Government did use that funding. Sometimes we have to be a bit more innovative. Government, by its very nature, is risk averse, and that's absolutely right when you're dealing with public money. You have to be very careful. But I did think, for me, I took a lot of positives from that letter. The pressures on our budget have been very well documented, especially the real-terms decrease we face. Any decisions to make use of funding, regardless of time of year, must ensure the proposals present value for money, and they've got to be clearly aligned with our policy priorities and they need to follow due process. I didn't see anything in that letter that didn't say that we did that.\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"Minister, there are businesses the length and breadth of the country who apply to Welsh Government and the UK Government for support, sometimes for several hundred pounds, sometimes for thousands, sometimes for tens of thousands, if not millions. Here we have an intervention by the Welsh Government of \u00a34.5 million where you cannot pinpoint a single note or minute of the interaction between the potential beneficiary of that intervention and the Government officials that were making decisions to advise the Minister at that time. In fact, the same Government officials commissioned the valuers and the legal firm to undertake the work without ministerial advice. Their advice was finished before the Minister actually said that they could spend the \u00a360,000 on the procurement of that service.My point is that many businesses the length and breadth of Wales\u2014and you'll be familiar with this from your postbag as a constituency Member\u2014bemoan the fact of all the level of information they have to provide to support grant application. We understand that there have to be the checks and balances, because it's public money. But why, in this case, was there not a single\u2014not a single\u2014note that could be drawn on to show the level of interaction and what was discussed, given the very quick intervention and turnaround time that the Government used in this particular aspect of purchasing the farm, which the auditor general highlights. There was no time pressure, because there wasn't another purchaser chasing the property. It's in his report. I can see the Minister turning round saying, 'That's not true.' It's in the auditor general's report. He could not find any other time constraint other than the self-imposed time constraint of Welsh Government. So, I ask you again: what examples in your ministerial career can you think of where such an interaction would not have had a minute, a note, a record so that that could be held in the accountability and transparency process and people can feel that they will get a fair crack of the whip when they apply for Government funding?\" said by Andrew RT Davies AM\n\"I think it's fair to say there had been discussions with Green Man about potential sites for some time. This wasn't just something that happened very quickly. Those discussions had been going on for some time, and the high-level outline business case that had been provided was enough to progress with the purchase. So, as I say, I think there were a lot of positives in that letter from the auditor general and we very much welcome that, and obviously we will look to learn lessons as always. There are always lessons to be learned.\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"Leader of Plaid Cymru, Adam Price.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Diolch yn fawr, Llywydd. When Plaid Cymru suggested in November that you used a combination of the Wales reserve departmental underspends and unallocated funding to fund a better pay offer for NHS staff, the Minister for Health and Social Services told us there was no unallocated spending available, there were no underspends, and that you couldn't use the Wales reserve. 'Even if we did have underspends,' she said,&nbsp;'let's be clear that this could not be used to fund pay awards.... Reserves can't be used for everyday spending.'She said,&nbsp;'They can only be used once, and they're held for emergencies.'For months you refused to negotiate, for months you refused to admit more money could be found, and for months you refused to acknowledge that we were in an emergency. Now, you've effectively u-turned on all of that. What took you so long?&nbsp;\" said by ", "answer": "Adam Price AM"}
{"content": "\"We'll move on to the first item on our agenda, which is our first evidence session of 'Do disabled children and young people have equal access to education and childcare?'. I'd like to welcome our witnesses this morning. Here today, we have Rocio Cifuentes, Children\u2019s Commissioner for Wales, and Sara Jermin, head of communications and performance. Thank you, you're very welcome here this morning.We're going to go straight into some questions; Members have a number of questions for you this morning. To what extent do you think that children's rights to an education are being denied due to their disability, learning disability or being neurodivergent? Do you think that there are any differences between these wide groups of children and young people?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Diolch yn fawr am y gwahoddiad. Thank you very much for the invitation today and the opportunity to share with you on this really important topic. I'm going to be sharing with you what I've heard, based on the first year in my role, and, also, based on an extensive survey we conducted, with over 8,000 responses, with children across Wales; and, also, building on previous experience that I've had prior to this role, working with young people with disabilities, and previous work that my office has done on this topic. In recent weeks, I've also been able to speak to a number of young people in different settings, including two different special schools, to hear from them directly what they think about these questions.Overall, what I have heard has been very concerning and does indicate strongly that there is a clear difference in the way that children and young people with disabilities can access their education, and a clear difference in how they feel about that access. I'm going to go into all of those issues in a lot more detail, but, overall, just to give you some headlines before I get into the detail, I am hearing a lot about experiences of bullying and discrimination that children and young people with disabilities have told me about, and that includes physical and learning disabilities and neurodivergent young people. I'm also hearing a lot about what they perceive as a lack of awareness, but also, sometimes, problematic attitudes towards them from education professionals as well as in wider society. I've also heard a lot about difficulties that they have experienced in relation to accessing provision and activities, particularly outside of school, so, extracurricular activities are a key area of concern.That is difficult to access for different reasons, one is that there is limited provision anyway that is accessible to them. But another huge barrier is transport, and being able to access those facilities and services outside of school is impossible for most of the young people I spoke to, due to transport barriers. Thirdly, in relation to the information about the services that they can access and that they're entitled to, this seems to be a confused picture. There seem to be difficulties in getting clarity and clear information. I heard different examples of the roles of the local authority and schools in that sense. Then, fourthly, huge anxieties but also a huge gap overall in relation to information, planning and support for where they go after school for that post-19 provision and pathways to employment, pathways to further education. All of that seemed to be an area that was, overall, significantly weaker than what children without disabilities might expect. So, they are the overarching issues that I'm going to go into more detail on.\" said by Rocio Cifuentes\n\"Thank you very much, and I'm sure we've got more questions, and you rightly said you're going to go into some more detail on that. Just for clarity, do you think there's a difference between those three groups that I mentioned, whether it's a disability, learning disability or being neurodivergent? Are there differences between those three groups of children and young people? Are you saying that you feel there is or\u2014?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"I think, yes, there are differences. One of the main differences relates to the extent to which their disabilities may be hidden, and, therefore, the support or the attitudes that they experience because other people don't know that they may have a disability. I think that was a clear theme across the conversations that I have had. Often, when a child or a young person does have a disability that is not visible, or is hidden, they feel that they experience a higher level of, sometimes, lack of awareness, but it can sometimes turn into outright hostility or a very negative reaction, or it could be that that child is then disciplined in school for behaviour that is in fact related to their disability, but instead, they are seen as being naughty and challenging.One comment that I heard from the Ambitions for Wales survey that I carried out, from a professional, is that we need to move from talking about challenging behaviour to talking about behaviour that challenges, and to think about why are teachers, professionals and adults feeling challenged by that young person's behaviour: is it to do with lack of capacity to respond, with lack of awareness, with lack of time or space? I thought that was a really interesting comment\u2014that it's not the behaviour that is challenging, it is the people around them who feel challenged by that behaviour.\" said by Rocio Cifuentes\n\"Thank you very much. We'll go on to some questions now from Sioned Williams. Sioned.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair, and good morning. A couple of questions more specifically now on access to childcare: to what extent are you aware that there are issues with access to childcare provision for parents of children with a disability, or a learning disability, or those who are neurodivergent?\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"Thank you for the question, Sioned.\" said by Rocio Cifuentes\n\"In terms of preschool childcare, there is very little provision available that is specialist, and this is a huge gap that's been widely acknowledged. When there is provision, very often, there's a financial cost to that. In terms of after-school and out-of-school provision, again, there is very little that is accessible to children and young people with physical and learning disabilities, and even when that provision is there, transport to access that provision is a significant barrier.So, those were the main barriers that I\u2019ve heard about, and I think overall, what I heard from parents is that not being able to access that childcare for their disabled child in the same way that they might for a non-disabled child has really increased the burden on the parent and the whole family, but also their sense of isolation. And sometimes, that added pressure on the whole family just has a huge impact on the well-being of the whole family, and particularly, it can often be very difficult for families to access suitable childcare, because they might be geographically very far away, and in terms of trying to then arrange, maybe, if\u2014. A parent told me that, perhaps, because they had to take their child to a very specialist provision, when they were running late, for their non-disabled children, they could call on a wider network in that locality to pick up the child, but for their disabled child, because they were in a very far-away location, that wider support network was not there.And I think overall, what I wanted to mention earlier is that that there\u2019s a very different experience for children and families who are accessing specialist provision, which is specialist for disabled, whether it be physical or learning disability, to the experience of children who are in mainstream settings, and experience a very different set of challenges. And I think that tension currently between mainstream or specialist provision is something that, as a committee, you may like to explore further.\" said by Rocio Cifuentes\n\"Thank you. You mention there that there is a general lack of provision available, and you suggested in your answer there that that, perhaps, varies from area to area, and that some people have to travel far for the appropriate provision. Do you have evidence, therefore, of the level of childcare provision that is available for parents of children who have a disability or a learning disability, or who are neurodivergent?\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"I have anecdotal evidence, mainly, but I\u2019m aware, obviously, that local authorities are expected to undertake a childcare sufficiency assessment, but I can refer to comments that were made to my office as part of our work on the 'no wrong door' approach and the report that we published recently, which was a book of experiences of families with children who are neurodiverse. We worked with and spoke to one charity based in Mountain Ash, which was the co-founder of a charity called ASD Rainbows, which was a particular service for pre-school children with autism. I\u2019ll just read her quotes. She said that they were so unique in the service that they provide, and that parents were reaching out and are desperate when they go to them. She said that, if they weren\u2019t here, she really wouldn\u2019t like to think where the parents would be and that children are waiting up to three years for a diagnosis, and in the meantime there is no support available. So, I think there is very little provision for this particular group of children with these needs.\" said by Rocio Cifuentes\n\"You referred there to local authorities. To what extent are schools and local authorities consulting with learners and their families on their accessibility strategies and plans?\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"Diolch, Sioned. I don\u2019t know, but from what I have heard from children, young people, parents and professionals, I think very little or not enough seems to be their experience of being consulted. There seems to be a real difficulty in parents finding out about the accessibility of different schools that are in their areas. I'm aware that local authorities are required to publish plans around the physical accessibility, but this doesn't seem to always happen, or that information is not easily accessible on websites, and parents are really struggling just having to research for themselves how accessible different schools are, having to undertake visits, and, even when they do have their children in schools, full accessibility is a real rarity and it seems that\u2014. The comments that I've been hearing are that it doesn't seem that people with disabilities have actually been involved in the planning or the specification, sometimes, particularly with new builds. Sometimes there are very obvious but very specific changes that, had they been made, would have made a huge difference to the accessibility of those schools, and I think, overall, it is\u2014. One comment that I heard talked about the lack of disabled teachers in the workforce, and I think that that could be something that the committee could reflect on, because, similar to the work that's been done on race and the need for representation of ethnic minority teachers in the workforce, I think the same could be argued for teachers and educators with disabilities, so that that lived experience really feeds into the whole planning of the system throughout.\" said by Rocio Cifuentes\n\"Thank you. What you have told us so far suggests very strongly that children and young people and their families feel that they've been directly or indirectly discriminated against because of their disability. Would you agree with that? Is that how you feel in hearing this evidence from young people and their families?\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"Diolch, Sioned. Sorry, was the question to what extent do children and young people feel directly discriminated against because of their disability? Yes. I think there is a range of experiences, and for some children and young people they are not as aware of being directly discriminated against, but for many they are aware of it, and I think one feature of my ambitions for Wales survey, which as I mentioned earlier had over 8,000 responses from children and young people, was the high prevalence of those young people who had experienced bullying and identity-based bullying or bullying because of their difference.From those 8,000 responses, around 6 per cent of those had a disability themselves, and of those children, over 60 per cent had themselves experienced bullying. So, I do think that bullying is one type of direct discrimination that those children and young people had clearly experienced, and then the other comments that I heard about were more indirect discrimination, you could call it, in terms of lack of awareness and sometimes poor attitudes towards their disability, particularly towards more hidden disabilities.But also, I heard about examples from parents of children with physical disabilities, that they felt that they were made to feel grateful for the support and entitlements that they felt their children\u2014. Well, their children are entitled to education, as is every other child in Wales, but there was a sense that they should feel grateful or that they should have to be thanking people because of special arrangements or provisions that had been made for their child.So, I think it's a spectrum from direct to indirect discrimination, but I think the underlying message that I heard is definitely that children and young people with disabilities are made to feel different, that they do feel that they are not treated equally to others, and that this does impact on their experience of education, whether it's them being bullied in a classroom, whether they're not being treated in the way that they should be by teachers, or whether they're not able to access the same activities as their friends after school. It's the reality in their lives, unfortunately, that it's not the same for them.\" said by Rocio Cifuentes\n\"Thank you. Thank you, Chair.\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"Diolch, Sioned. Questions now from Laura Jones. Laura.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. Yes, you paint a very stark picture, a really concerning picture, commissioner, but it's something that I recognise from my own postbag and it's very abundantly clear, just within my own region, that there's a postcode lottery when it comes to provision here. But, it's really reassuring to hear you recognising all of the problems that I'm hearing. What do you think\u2014? In terms of one of the main barriers that I've recognised, that children are not being identified quickly enough, as you said\u2014you outlined it yourself just now, actually\u2014it's something I've brought up with the Minister numerous times about them not being statemented quickly enough and therefore the money not following to the schools quickly enough, and then them not getting the one-to-one support that they need, or perhaps the adaptations. What do you think are the barriers and challenges to providing inclusive statutory education and childcare within mainstream and specialist schools? Thank you.\" said by Laura Anne Jones AM\n\"There are many barriers, I think, going through, starting with attitudes and awareness, then there's the clear need for more training and support for teachers; there's a need for more resources; there's a need for more physical space often in schools to meet the needs of children with a range of disabilities. So, those are kind of all, I guess, cultural and attitudinal barriers and also physical. There is a need, I think, to make sure that it has to be\u2014. The words 'whole-school approach' are a little over-used, I think, but it has to be from a whole kind of fundamental, from top to bottom, in terms of how a school is equipped to identify, respond to, and manage the different needs of their different pupils. A really inclusive education should be able to see the needs of each child as unique, and be able to respond to that child's needs quickly and inclusively.My 'A No Wrong Door Approach to Neurodiversity' report and work has highlighted the problems when needs are not recognised quickly enough, and then, when they are recognised, when they're not responded to quickly enough. I'll just quote one quote from that report, which was from a clinical psychologist, Dr Mair Edwards, who said that,&nbsp;'Without doubt...children and young people have suffered long term harm because of the unreasonable delay before their needs are officially recognised. How can it be acceptable for a child to wait years for an assessment of their needs when research shows clearly that appropriate support and intervention in the early years is so important?'&nbsp;So, it's the lack of recognition of needs; the length of time that it takes to actually officially recognise and diagnose needs; and then the lack of support that's available after those needs are diagnosed. The ability currently of mainstream schools to respond to that is limited because there is a huge burden on schools anyway; they need more resources, more capacity, and in terms of specialist schools, the same is true, actually. The school I visited only last week has doubled in size in the last seven years due to increasing demands for their provision. So, it is a huge challenge that I think is one\u2014. I'm so glad that this committee is looking at this in such focus.\" said by Rocio Cifuentes\n\"Thank you. Laura, I'm just going to bring in James on this point. James.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you, children's commissioner. It's good to see the things that you've highlighted, what your office is doing, but what are you doing with those to make sure the Government's being held accountable for these things? Because it's very good making reports, but also your job is to hold the Welsh Government to account over these matters. I'm just interested to know what you are actually doing to hold the Government to account over it rather than producing a report. What conversations have you had with Ministers about it?\" said by James Evans MS\n\"I have\u2014. We do produce reports; we do produce recommendations; we make formal recommendations to Government, which Government then respond to, and that is the structure through which I hold Government to account. I cannot, unfortunately, force Government to do anything, but I can make strong recommendations and I can scrutinise the progress that they make, or not, towards those recommendations. I have made many recommendations relating to this issue, and my office has historically done so also. We published a series of reports, two different reports, looking at accessibility, physical accessibility to schools. We have published a series of reports, again, looking at neurodiversity, and I will continue to highlight and challenge different Ministers and members of the Government on their progress on this important issue.\" said by Rocio Cifuentes\n\"I'll come back to it later. Thank you.\" said by ", "answer": "James Evans MS"}
{"content": "\"So, I move to item 5, and this is the very first evidence session of the committee's inquiry into gynaecological cancers. And just to set the scene on this: the inquiry will be looking at the experiences of women with symptoms of gynaecological cancer and how women are listened to and treated by healthcare professionals, and also looking at how services empower, care for and look after women diagnosed with gynaecological cancer, and ensure that their physical, psychological and practical needs are met. So, this is the very first session today.I know the Senedd's engagement team has been undertaking some work and preparing us this morning to look at a couple of videos, ahead of having some further discussion as well. So, Rhayna, can I pass over to you to perhaps give some explanation for this morning's session?\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Thank you, Chair, good morning, everyone. Yes, I'll be here to represent the citizen engagement team, but I'm also joined by Judi Rhys, Tenovus's chief executive, and Lowri Griffiths, who's Tenovus's director of support, policy and insight, and we will hear from Judi in a moment. But I would just like to open with a little bit of background on the engagement to date, which is still ongoing. I'll then pass to Judi for some comments before we introduce the two videos that we have prepared for you today.So, as the Chair was saying, the committee looked to hear from women with lived experience of gynaecological cancer, with the intention of hearing about how they are listened to and treated by healthcare professionals, and how services empower, care for and look after women diagnosed with gynaecological cancers. We worked with Tenovus and other cancer charities to invite women to share their stories with the committee. Women were interviewed on and off camera, and we still have women coming forward to share their stories with you. For example, last week I travelled to Anglesey to interview a wonderful lady, and that interview is now being prepared for you. We will keep the window of engagement open for as long as possible to collect stories and, from this point on, we will then collect those stories to inform the engagement summary that will be prepared for committee towards the end of the inquiry.When speaking with women, we gave them the opportunity to tell their story, but we also focused some questions on the information available and the awareness of the risk factors, the barriers to securing a diagnosis, and whether they felt listened to by healthcare professionals. So, before we hear from the two women interviewed, I would like to hand over to Judi for any comments that you would like to bring to the table as well.\" said by Rhayna Mann\n\"Thank you, and thank you very much for inviting us along today. I think one of the first things I'd want to say is that we're here really to comment on the emotional experiences of the women that have approached us. So, we have supported a number of women who wanted to come forward and tell their stories to you. Tenovus Cancer Care has also submitted some written information, but we have very much supported the videos that you're going to see shortly, and of course ones that will be shown a little bit later\u2014the ones that Rhayna just referred to. I think the ones that we see today are specifically around ovarian cancer; of course, this is a gynae inquiry, but I think what we will see is that some of the themes that come through from these videos actually speak to all those gynae cancers, and perhaps I can say a little bit more about that once we've listened to the videos.&nbsp;I'd also like to say that, clearly, this is not the experience of every single woman; we understand that. But of course, just one bad experience is one too many, and one of the things that we have found when we have listened to the videos and supported the women bringing their stories to you is a real sense that people feel missed opportunities around diagnosis, but particularly the fact that people have felt fobbed off or not listened to, and I think the emotional impact of that is being felt. People don't know their own bodies, really\u2014they're essentially being told that. That's a huge thing, and then, when people have had the diagnosis a bit later, the regret and the emotional misery that accompanies that missed opportunity because of that later diagnosis. So, I think that's the real theme and what we're concentrating on in this evidence session.&nbsp;So, my plea really is for you to listen to the videos, to take these women's stories very seriously, and for us all to think about how we can improve this, so that it doesn't happen to other women. Thank you.\" said by Judi Rhys\n\"Thank you, Judi. We now have a video from Claire O'Shea.&nbsp;\" said by Rhayna Mann\n\"I'd just like to thank Claire for speaking with us so openly and honestly. Chair, I'd like to pass to you, if you and the Members have any comments, before we also bring in Judi.\" said by Rhayna Mann\n\"Thank you, Rhayna. I think on committee, we take evidence in writing, and people come and sit before us and give us evidence, but nothing is more powerful than a real-life experience, and that was probably one of the most powerful evidence sessions, if you like, that I think we've received on this committee, so my thanks to Claire for being prepared to speak to the engagement team&nbsp;and relay her story. That was just so powerful. So, thank you, Rhayna, and thank you to Claire for setting out so powerfully her situation and her story and her journey. There might be some Members who have questions. I can see\u2014. I should have said at the beginning that this is a hybrid session, so, we've got Sarah Murphy and another committee member joining us as well virtually. Did I see that you had your hand up? Did you want to come in, Sarah?\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Yes, thank you, Chair. I just wanted to say that I know Claire personally and I just wanted to say to Claire directly, I suppose, if she's watching this, and I will message her as well, but I was unaware of the extent of her experience. She's been incredibly brave. She covered so many areas of this and, as she said, the impact it's had on others as well, and I just cannot imagine the distress, like she said, of calling 72 times like that and knowing that her cancer was growing back. It's unacceptable what she's been through and, yes, as you said, Russell, I'm incredibly grateful to her really\u2014it was very powerful and I think it will resonate with many, many women out there. So, thank you very much, Claire.\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Thank you, Sarah, and I know Claire is joining us in the public gallery today, so, she has heard what you have said. Are there any other Members with questions at all? I think, for me, what struck me\u2014I was surprised the medical professionals were somehow uncomfortable talking about the subject. That really surprised me to hear that. Is there anything, Judi or Lowri, you could comment on\u2014is that a normal experience and experiences that other women report?\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Can I just say, first of all, thank you to Claire for that? Because I listen to lots of stories in my job, as you can imagine, that are very harrowing, but that one completely moved me beyond\u2014it's an incredibly distressing story. I think Claire has talked very openly about her particular experiences. My view\u2014and I really don't know; these are just my thoughts\u2014is that, if it's happened to her, it's happened to others. And so, I'm sure that there are other women as well out there who perhaps are not as switched on and as assertive and intelligent and don't feel that they have that capacity as well to actually speak up and to phone 72 times. There are some people who think, 'I'm not going to phone at all, because I don't want to bother the services'. So, I think a lot of the points that Claire has made here resonate, because there are potentially many other women out there who would give up at that first hurdle when they are told, 'Oh, it's IBS', or 'It's a fibroid' and 'Just don't worry about it'.\" said by Judi Rhys\n\"I suspect that there are lots of questions that stem from Claire's story, but we're probably all, between us, holding back until we begin the other sessions. So, over to you, Rhayna, if you want to introduce the next video.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. So, our next video\u2014the final video for this morning\u2014is from Linda Drew.\" said by Rhayna Mann\n\"And, again, thank you to Linda for speaking with us and telling her story to us. And, Chair, I'd like to pass to you, if you have any comments or any discussion points from the Members.&nbsp;\" said by Rhayna Mann\n\"Well, I'll reiterate my earlier comments\u2014it's just powerful to hear the real-life experience. We can have papers in front of us, but to hear someone's story is more powerful than anything else. And my thanks to Linda for being prepared to speak to the engagement team and tell her story.I suppose I'm opening up for just general discussion with Members here, and Sarah virtually as well. If there are any questions, perhaps, just to remind us, we've got Judi Rhys with us, who is the chief executive of Tenovus Cancer Care, and Lowri Griffiths who's the director of support policy and insight for Tenovus Cancer Care. So, thank you for being with us as well. So, I'm looking around to see if Members have got any questions, but, I suppose, from me\u2014. This is the very first session. We've had this powerful evidence session this morning in terms of the videos that have been sent to us and the stories from Claire and Linda. But, as this is the first session, tell us what questions should we be asking the witnesses that have come before us? What is the best outcome of our piece of work? What should we be asking and putting to the Welsh Government, and the Minister when she comes before us, and what, ultimately, would you believe is the successful piece of work that we can do? What's the outcome that you would like to see?\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Okay. So, there are a few elements to that, and, obviously, these videos, as you said, are incredibly powerful and really sort of hit home. And the themes that come out of those videos, I think\u2014you've seen two, but we've heard other stories as well\u2014the general themes there are these feelings of real missed opportunities along the pathway, and, I think particularly, that initial diagnosis. So, I think Linda talked about not really being aware of the symptoms, so perhaps there is a piece of work there about how do we really encourage women to understand what those symptoms are, what those red flags are, and, actually, to empower women to be able to come forward to their GPs and not take 'no' for an answer.One of the things that I feel\u2014and certainly in the stories I've heard while I've been with Tenovus Cancer Care\u2014is people, women, know their own bodies, and I think that came through in both of the testimonies that you heard this morning. We instinctively know when there's something not right, and if you are being dismissed as being neurotic or, 'It's just a bit of wind' or, 'You're overweight', actually, in your heart, you know that's not the case.&nbsp;So, it is a case then\u2014that's the next part\u2014that when you first have that encounter with primary care, it's so important that people are listened to and that those red flags are addressed. But what people want to know is, 'Okay, it may just be IBS, it may be something and it's not going to be cancer', but how do you actually eliminate that? Because with all of us, when we go forward to the GP, whatever it is, we don't want that bad news, do we, but we want to be reassured that sufficient tests and investigations and diagnostics have been done, that we can actually say, 'No, you haven't got cancer' or, 'You haven't got the worst-case scenario'.&nbsp;So, I think there is a piece of work there about, first of all, awareness, and we need to do something about that in terms of how GPs actually interact with the patients. And I think as well, when Claire talked about some of her experiences with some of the male doctors, what's going on there, I suppose, in terms of the education, the way that the doctors are taught\u2014. I know that GPs and other doctors throughout their training will have modules on communication, but increasingly, when people come to us, that is the thing that seems to let people down\u2014that they're not feeling listened to. So, that's an important part of it, I think.And then it's about those diagnostic delays and, clearly, it's imperative, whatever the type of cancer, that it does get diagnosed at an early stage. That's been alluded to already. The differences between being diagnosed at stage 1 or stage 3 and 4 really, really impact on survival outcomes and treatment options as well. So, it is about looking at that pathway. One of the things that really struck me is that, often, we talk about, 'Oh, we need more money, we need more resources, we need more in the workforce'\u2014and I'm not saying that we don't\u2014but, actually, a lot of these mistakes or delays that are made along that pathway are just either human error or a lack of communication. Turning up for an appointment and perhaps not having read the scans. Well, why is that? Or not having access to the scans or not knowing other bits of the puzzle. So, it's not very joined up, and we see that quite a lot and, actually, that is something. It is about developing the processes so that they are more robust. So, that's another part of it.And then, obviously, that's the diagnosis, but then when we get into the treatment, we need to make sure that women have access to the best possible treatments and that that is not down to a postcode lottery\u2014where they live, who they happen to see, what happens to be the specialty in that area. So, that's another part of it.And I suppose the final part, really, is that all of the developments in terms of diagnosis, treatments and, therefore, outcomes are very much linked to the amount of research that goes in. So, where are the clinical trials, where is the access to clinical trials for women who are diagnosed, to have access to? So, that's the pathway, really.So, I guess all of those things we would like to get listened to. But the big message here is to really drive home the impact that this has on women's emotional health, and not just the women, but all of the people who are around who love them, their family and their friends. What's happening with that communication, why are they not being listened to, and why are women, who are intelligent and articulate, know their bodies, being told that they're neurotic and being fobbed off? That's unacceptable.\" said by Judi Rhys\n\"Thank you, Judi. I have some questions, but do you mind if I bring Jack Sargeant in, and then I'll bring you in, Lowri? Perhaps you might be able to address Jack's question. Jack.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Diolch yn fawr, Cadeirydd. It's just my assessment, really, and perhaps not really too much of a question, from the videos that we saw, from both Claire and Linda's stories, and deeply troubling stories as well. I wrote something down on the top of my paper in front of me from Claire's video: 'medical gaslighting'. You've talked a lot, Judi, about communication and perhaps lack of or poor communication. The assessment from me, from the two videos I just saw there, is it's perhaps not the communication. The communication module in university or whatever is not going to solve that problem, and it seems to me that, as a committee, we need to look as to why medical gaslighting is happening. Whether it's naivety from doctors\u2014some doctors might be very good, some might not\u2014but it seems to me that communication, perhaps, is an issue, but there's an issue under that, which is the gaslighting. Is that a fair assessment of what I've witnessed here? Because, it's in both, to me. Obviously, Claire mentioned that quite directly, and with Linda, it came across in that story as well, that that was happening to her, 'Well, it's IBS. You're overweight', et cetera. This is people going to the doctor, and they may, in the future, need to go to the doctor for something else, but you wouldn't want to, would you? So, it seems to me that the committee needs to find a way of looking into that in our evidence sessions. But I just wanted to gauge if I'm on the right lines here and I haven't got that wrong.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"And before I bring, perhaps, Lowri in, can I just say, the big question for me, in one word, is 'why'? Because a GP or a health professional go into the profession to help people, and help people through an illness, and they want to reduce people's anxieties and concerns\u2014that's what you would have thought, that's what motivates people who work in the health profession. So, why have we got those experiences? What sits behind that, I suppose? Lowri.\" said by ", "answer": "Russell George AM"}
{"content": "\"Good afternoon and welcome to this Plenary session. The first item will be questions to the First Minister, and the first question this afternoon is from Peredur Owen Griffiths.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"1. How is the Government supporting home owners in South Wales East who are facing increased mortgage payments? OQ59749\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"Llywydd, we're doing everything we can to support people through this cost-of-living crisis by providing targeted help to those who need it the most. Forty million pounds has been allocated to bring forward schemes to support people in mortgage difficulty at an early stage to enable them to stay in their own homes.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Diolch, Prif Weinidog. It's good to hear that those plans are progressing, because many, many households are in a desperate situation. One of my constituents showed me his mortgage statement, which shows that, on 30 November this year, their current payment, which is \u00a3617.81, will rise to \u00a3932.96. If there are more interest rate rises in the meantime, that monthly payment might well increase again. They do not know where they will find that extra money. Meanwhile, Rishi Sunak is asking people to 'hold their nerve'. That's easy to say when you've got an estimated family wealth of \u00a3529 million. The mortgage rescue scheme is something that Plaid Cymru's&nbsp;Jocelyn Davies developed to great effect during the One Wales Government.&nbsp;As part of the suite of plans to protect home owners, will you consider a rent freeze in the private housing market to protect tenants who will also suffer unless action is taken? The SNP Government has passed legislation that has protected tenants. Tenants in Wales deserve the same security, First Minister.&nbsp;\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"Well, Llywydd, thank you to Peredur Owen Griffiths for that set of questions. I agree with him, of course, that so many households in Wales are faced with rising mortgage bills, where they do not know how they will manage with the rises already announced, and do not know what further rises will come in future. The schemes that the Welsh Government is devising with that \u00a340 million will travel under the broad banner of Help to Stay. So, they are aimed at early stage mortgage difficulties, where it's possible to take action that will allow people to remain in their own homes. The scheme to which the Member referred from the One Wales Government has never closed; it's been open over the whole of the period since. Of course, for a long period, with mortgage rates very low, the take-up of it was very modest. But it remains there, and it remains an option for local authorities particularly to help people much further down the mortgage difficulties path.&nbsp;As to a rent freeze, it's a blunt instrument; it has many unintended consequences. We know in Scotland that it has led to a reduction in properties available for rent, because people who have bought properties on a buy-to-let basis themselves face mortgages that have now gone up significantly. The Bank of England estimates that it will take a 20 per cent rise in private sector rents simply to cover the additional costs that buy-to-let landlords now incur. Even the Scottish scheme is not a rent freeze for everybody; it is a rent freeze for some people, in some circumstances. In Wales, we believe there are other measures, and less blunt instruments, that allow us to respond to the people who are in exactly the difficulties that the Member described.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"First Minister, I'd like to begin with a quote:'There is no answer to the mortgage crisis without building more homes'.Those aren't my words, First Minister, but the words of Labour MP, Lisa Nandy, in an interview this weekend. These are incredibly uncertain and worrying times for home owners, and I was pleased to see the UK Government reveal a series of measures to help residents only last week. However, for many people in Wales, the thought of owning their own home is nothing more than a far-flung dream, and that's due to the Welsh Government here overseeing a major housing crisis, and, unfortunately, not doing very much to fix it.&nbsp; The Government is barely building 6,000 homes a year, First Minister, when, in fact, we need around 12,000. We have some 90,000 people here languishing on social housing waiting lists, and we've got more than 10,000 people living in temporary accommodation. Two councils in Wales had households on social housing waiting lists for more than 17 years. That's shocking, First Minister.&nbsp;Most people can see that the key to solving a lot of problems is to, in fact, build more homes. So, First Minister, do you agree with Lisa Nandy that there is no fix to this mortgage crisis without actually building new homes? And if so, given Labour is in power here, and has been for 25 years, when can we see the Government stop shirking responsibility and take action\u2014[<em>Interruption</em>.]\u2014into this?\" said by Natasha Asghar MS\n\"We need to have some quiet so that the First Minister can hear the question. The noise was coming from your own back benches, by the way, just in case you need to know that, First Minister. [<em>Laughter</em>.]\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"I could hear. Llywydd, well, of course, Lisa Nandy was right that building more homes has to be part of the solution to people who don't have homes at the moment. She will have been replying to the retreat of the UK Government from the plans that the Conservative Party had announced earlier in this Parliament\u2014the abandonment under the pressure of Conservative backbenchers that has meant that Michael Gove has had to throw away the plans that he had to build more homes in England. That is the point that Lisa Nandy was making.Here in Wales, we remain committed to 20,000 new homes for social rent, built to the highest possible standards. While mortgage rates continue to go up under the stewardship of the UK Conservative Government, then of course house builders are not going to be encouraged to build more homes. That is what house builders are telling us. As the cost of borrowing rises, it rises for them, it rises for businesses. We've heard already this afternoon the effect on home owners and people who look to rent their homes. But it's not just that, is it? It's people who run businesses, including house building businesses as well, who now find their bills going up, and the ability of ordinary people to afford houses that are being built goes down. So, this is not simply a matter of building more homes, desirable as that is; it's a matter of the affordability of those homes as well. And that is why the rate rises that we have seen in recent months are having such a choking impact on household budgets and the ability of markets to supply basic needs.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Of course, Lisa Nandy, you, First Minister, and I and everybody in this Chamber knows that this isn't an interest rate crisis; it's a Tory interest rate crisis, created as a consequence of a hard Brexit and economic mismanagement. We all saw\u2014[<em>Interruption</em>.] You can shout as much as you like. We all saw the way that Liz Truss crashed the economy. It's not Liz Truss who is now suffering the consequences of it; it's people that we all represent here, home owners and renters alike. And the Member for London can cry as many crocodile tears as she likes about the situation facing home owners. First Minister, do you agree with me that the Tory economic mismanagement has failed home owners, has failed renters, has failed us all, and the best thing we need is a Labour Government able to rebuild this economy?\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Llywydd, of course Alun Davies articulates the most important solution to the difficulties that ordinary people in Wales face. This is a crisis made in Downing Street, by successive occupants of 10 Downing Street. I've listened in the last week to UK Conservative Ministers tell us that austerity was a very fine thing because it prepared us better for coronavirus. I've heard Tory Ministers say that we were lucky to have the crisis of Brexit&nbsp;because the crisis of Brexit meant that we were better prepared for the crisis of COVID. [<em>Interruption</em>.] That is what Oliver Dowden\u2014[<em>Interruption</em>.] That is what Oliver Dowden said; he said it not just once, he said it time after time again. In fact, what he said was that the disaster of Brexit\u2014the disaster of Brexit\u2014meant that we were better placed for the disaster of coronavirus. And now they want to say the same thing again\u2014that their disastrous record somehow entitles them to an opportunity to put that disaster right. It's writ large in the lives of people facing mortgage interest rate rises. Those people know where the responsibility lies. They know where the blame lies too, and that's why we'll have that next Labour Government.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"2. What action is the Welsh Government taking to promote economic development in mid Wales? OQ59767\" said by Joyce Watson AM\n\"Llywydd, we're working actively with our partners to explore opportunities for the region through the delivery of the mid Wales growth deal. The collaboratively produced regional economic framework for mid Wales sets out our shared priorities for the region.&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Thank you for that answer, First Minister. The Welsh Government is, indeed, supporting and creating jobs in mid Wales, and that is key to keeping and attracting more young people to that region. But I read with deep unease media reports about alleged threats to remove investment from Wales if the Welsh Government continues to pursue activity in Gilestone Farm. I also note that the leader of the opposition has tabled no fewer than 60 written questions on this single investment. Can you shed light on the story? And do you agree with me that it's essential that the Welsh Government is consistent and fair in dealing with all potential investors?\" said by Joyce Watson AM\n\"Well, Llywydd, the Member makes a very important general point about the importance of growing the economy in mid and west Wales, and particularly jobs that retain young people in the communities in which they have grown up and where they wish to make a contribution to the future success of those economies. It's why we are working with the mid Wales growth deal; it's why we are pursuing those major opportunities that will come from renewable marine energy along the coastal strip of mid and west Wales.In relation to the specific point that the Member made about Gilestone Farm, the vast majority of businesses and investors we work with approached the Government with professionalism, integrity and a passion for the contribution they make to our economy. Where it is, sadly, made necessary, the Welsh Government will be robust in making clear that ministerial decisions will not be changed as a result of undue pressure or, indeed, threats. And it is, of course, important that all Members consider and test the seriousness of the proposals brought to them to ensure that the cases they advance are genuine and not driven by ulterior motives.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"First Minister, it is often said that the backbone of the Welsh economy is small businesses, and that couldn't be more true, of course, in mid Wales. The vision for the Growing Mid Wales plan and the growth deal allude to 95 per cent of businesses in mid Wales being small businesses. An issue that's most raised with me by small businesses, as they feel it's an obstacle to growing their business, is around the planning process. Often, they feel obstacles are being put in their way, and there are often huge costs associated with a planning application that are often too much of a risk for a business then to develop or pursue the growth of their business. I wonder, First Minister, if you could outline what steps are being taken to ensure that the planning processes are more closely aligned to the economic growth priorities for the region.&nbsp;\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Well, Llywydd, the planning processes are there to balance out a whole series of different interests. Businesses have very legitimate and important interests when they're seeking to grow and they need to pursue those through the planning process, but so will people in the areas in which those businesses seek to expand. And the planning process is there to make sure that anybody who has an interest in a planning proposal has an opportunity to make sure that their voice is heard, and that the eventual decision is a rounded decision taking all those interests into account. Sometimes, that can seem cumbersome, but it's because of the need to ensure that everybody feels they have had a proper opportunity to make their contribution known and for it to count in the decision making. The Welsh Government encourages local authorities, where there are scarce planning resources, to combine those resources into wider, regional capacity so that planning applications can be pursued in a timely manner and people aren't held up in being able to make the advances they seek to make, whether that is in business or any other sphere of life. Because of the undoubted strains on local authority resources, pooling capacity, working on a wider footprint is one of the ways in which fragile services can be sustained and strengthened.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Questions from the party leaders now. The leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew R.T. Davies.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Thank you, Presiding Officer. In your earlier answers, First Minister, to questions, you seemed to blame all of the ills of Wales on the UK Government. One of the figures that came out last Thursday was quite clearly an area that you have complete control of, and that is the increase in NHS waiting times. An extra 6,000 people were added on the pathway list; now, nearly 750,000 people in Wales are on a pathway. We also saw a miniscule drop in those waiting two years or more; in excess of 30,000 people are waiting two years or more. One in five people who are on an NHS pathway here in Wales are waiting one year or more\u2014one year or more to see themselves progress on those waiting lists. What hope can you give to those individuals who are waiting two years or one year, and those who have been added to the waiting lists time and time again, as each month passes by, that these lists will decrease and that by the end of the year we will see the elimination of the two-year waits here in Wales?\" said by Andrew RT Davies AM\n\"The hope that we offer people is to recognise the enormous efforts that the health service is making and the success that the health service is seeing in those efforts. Two-year waits did fall again last month for the thirteenth month in a row, 52-week waits for out-patients fell again last month, and department performance improved last month. In the figures, challenging as the situation is, there are signs that the investment that the Minister has made, and the plan that she has for the NHS in the post-COVID period, is succeeding. Just to think of it in this way, to help the Member, in the six months to March 2023, the last full year, waiting lists in Wales decreased by 2.6 per cent, while they increased in London by 2.7 per cent\u2014a 5 percentage point gap in performance to the advantage of the Welsh NHS.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"First Minister, I want to know what's going on here in Wales and what hope you're offering to people here in Wales. But if you want to use the English statistics, 5 per cent of people are waiting one year or more in England and 20 per cent of people on a waiting list are waiting one year or more in Wales. You talk about the decrease in two-year waits; 261 people came off that two-year wait. There are still over 30,000 people waiting two years or more here in Wales. In England, they have all but been eliminated, and in Scotland as well, so this is an outlier that's happening here in Wales on your watch. This isn't my comment; this is the Royal College of Surgeons' comment, when they say that these figures are a 'wake-up call' to see what the Welsh Government can do now that they might have a bit of space before we get into the winter pressures.So, again, what actions are the Welsh Government taking to reduce these stubbornly high waiting lists, and will you stand by a commitment to say that two-year waits here in Wales will be eliminated by the end of this calendar year? It's not much to ask, because you used to have a target to eliminate those two-year waits. Have you given up on them?\" said by ", "answer": "Andrew RT Davies AM"}

I can't see any other witnesses with us currently. Thank you all for joining us.&nbsp;If I could start, therefore, by asking you\u2014clearly we have a challenging financial settlement currently, in the culture and sport areas specifically, and we have heard of a number of challenges in terms of that. Could you please outline any prioritisation exercise that you've undertaken when developing this draft budget?\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Yes. If I talk in overall terms, then Dawn can talk about more of the specific portfolio areas that this committee has. In terms of our overall approach to the budget, we have, as a Government, prioritised health and care. We've prioritised local government, including education. Now, those are relative prioritisations, because, of course, we haven't had a flatline budget; we've actually had reductions to our budget in real terms, for reasons that everyone understands within inflation, but also, choices made by the UK Government at the last financial statement. That means that, to address the challenges that we all see around us, in our health and care system, in local government, and indeed, in education, that extra money comes at a cost, as it were, to other parts of Government. Now, that's a whole-Government strategy, so I'm signed up to that, this department is, and that has meant that we have had more challenging decisions to make to make sure that the budget passes.&nbsp;In my previous budget scrutiny, I've explained that that means that, in some areas, we're not able to proceed, or we're proceeding at a slower pace. In this particular area, there has been relative protection in some areas. I think you'll find that we're still going to proceed with lots of our programmes in this section, but it does mean that there have been very difficult choices, and, obviously, if this, or any other committees want to call for extra spending in areas outside the priorities for the whole Government that I've stated, that means that the money has to be found in more reductions to other areas. So, it's an honest, but a very difficult challenge that will be familiar to lots of households, businesses and large organisations.&nbsp;\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"Alun Davies, if I can bring you in.&nbsp;\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"I'm grateful to the Minister for that, and he's absolutely right, of course\u2014the easy thing about not being in Government is that there are no decisions to be taken, and everything can be seen as a priority. And I think we've all been through enough budget scrutiny sessions to have witnessed that.But I want to understand, within Government and within budgets, the decision taking that you're making at the moment. You and I represent two very different constituencies\u2014Cardiff South and Penarth and Blaenau Gwent\u2014and I'm interested as to how you see the equality element or principle, if you like, of budgeting, because my constituents have access to far fewer cultural and sporting facilities than your constituents, so, I would anticipate the Government taking a principled decision that there would be a relatively greater investment in poorer parts\u2014more deprived parts of the country\u2014than in parts that don't suffer that deprivation in terms of availability of facilities, I'm talking about now. So, to what extent has that guided your thinking?\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"There's an overall perspective about the relative protections for healthcare, local government and education that actually is about recognising the stark socioeconomic differences in different parts of the country. And, actually, my constituency\u2014some of it is a very pleasant, popular, middle-class town in Penarth, but actually, the southern Cardiff part of my constituency is actually pretty poor. If it was a local authority, it would be poorer than Merthyr, but bigger. So, the challenge, though, is that actually, for some of those people, even though they're physically close to a range of the assets that you refer to, in practical terms, it's a challenge. When we look at the individual parties within the portfolio, those are things that I think Dawn can address with her team, about how that then leads to what we've chosen in the programme for government to keep moving and how that does provide real access to facilities in communities, because I recognise the point that you're making.\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"Shall we bring the Deputy Minister in then?\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Yes, on that specific\u2014\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"Sorry\u2014\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"I wanted to challenge the Minister, actually, on his answer, if I could. I don't disagree with the Minister's response. I recognise that there are parts of the Cardiff South and Penarth constituency that have very, very serious levels of poverty; I don't pretend that that isn't the situation. But my question wasn't about that and it wasn't about local government, and it wasn't about health, and it wasn't about the other things; it was about access to facilities. And what we all know is that the city of Cardiff provides a far higher level of sporting and cultural facilities than a community such as the communities I represent or, in fact, the Deputy Minister represents. So, I was wondering\u2014and this is a question for the Minister rather than the Deputy Minster\u2014how does he wish to see the equality element of budget process address that access-to-facilities question?\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Well, the facilities in this area, though, is an area that the Deputy Minister takes a lead on\u2014the overall resources available, and then, how they're deployed across the country to deal with practical access for different communities. And it goes, not just in this portfolio, but it's something that Lynne Neagle will be especially interested in\u2014\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"Yes, yes, I get that.\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"\u2014with her brief on public health, to make sure that there's practical access\u2014. And, actually, with respect, again, if you lived in east Cardiff, even though, geographically, you're close to a range of facilities within Cardiff, actually, our practical challenge in getting access for people is not necessarily straightforward. But it's why we have a programme of investment: the capital investment that we're making; the investment we're making alongside governing bodies and the way that we're supporting local government, because a lot of what you were talking about would be local government-sponsored and run as well. So, the overall prioritisation in those areas is about protecting a range of those assets to provide practical access to communities across the country. So, I'm not trying to disagree and say that there isn't a challenge for us to address, but it is about the level of the detail in those choices that the Deputy Minister and other Ministers will make, because it actually matters to the whole-Government priorities that we set out at the outset.\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"But may I expand on that please, Minister? Obviously, you referenced in terms of prioritising health and so on, but we've also been outlining, in terms of sport and culture, the benefits in terms of the prevention agenda as well and especially with issues like mental health. Have there been discussions with colleagues around the health budget in particular around how that works in terms of both culture and sport, specifically?\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Yes. We have regular conversations about the whole-Government works together. I had a meeting with the Deputy Minster for Mental Health and Well-being on a range of areas that go across our two portfolios, recognising\u2014[<em>Inaudible</em>.] The challenge, though, is that, when you're setting all of these different priorities, everyone can make a case about how their area of activity adds to a broader preventative agenda and adds to a broader public health approach, and those are fair cases to make. You still, though, have to make choices within the budget available. Every good positive step we would want to take you can't take, because you just don't have the elastic to stretch that far. In the Chamber, we'll talk about all the things about treating people in emergency care, about people waiting for care, about general practice, and there's everything else as well.\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"Thank you, Minister. If I may bring the Deputy Minister in now.\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Thank you, Chair. I think that is an important point. I think the Minister has answered Alun Davies's point around the prioritisation. The cross-departmental and cross-portfolio work that is going on is quite significant and is important to this preventative agenda. We've been saying for a long time that the preventative benefits of sport and culture are there for all to see. It's not just a sport and culture budget issue. This is an issue for many other departments.We've got budget allocations, obviously, from my budget and from my portfolio. We've seen budget support from health through the transformation fund. We saw \u00a30.5 million this year from the transformation fund, just as an example, to deliver the Fit Fans pilot between 2022 and 2024, running across six main football teams. That's a pilot that will be reviewed to see whether that has made a significant difference. That's come from the health budget but using sport and working with the FAW.&nbsp;Obviously, the Minister's referred to local authority budgets. One of the things that the local authorities are responsible for and is their responsibility and their priority is around how they deliver culture and sport within their local authority areas and how that fits into their health and well-being agenda, as well as the health and well-being agenda of the Welsh Government. So, there's a local authority input to that, there's an education\u2014\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"If I may, Deputy Minister, just on that point specifically, obviously, a number of those services are non-statutory services. How concerned are you about the impact we may see across Wales in terms of culture and sport because those elements are non-statutory? What considerations have been given in terms of budget planning in terms of those challenges? Because obviously, as you've rightly outlined, these are crucial services in our communities, but obviously non-statutory. So, I'm just interested in your view there.\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"They are non-statutory, but we still have an expectation around what a local authority needs to do to deliver on its well-being goals and on the well-being goals of the Welsh Government. That is reflected in the priorities that the Minister set out at the beginning. We have prioritised local government and health in terms of our budget allocations, and all local authorities have seen a much better than expected allocation this year. Certainly, in my area, the local authorities had not budgeted for anything like the settlement that they are receiving. So, it then becomes a decision for those local authorities about how they are going to prioritise issues over and above those statutory services.Even within that, I think it is worth setting out that we have, for non-statutory services, allocated considerable amounts extra in a number of areas. Those are set out in the budget papers in the evidence brief that you had from us. Again, it goes across portfolios. We've talked about\u2014. Well, I hadn't got to talking about the amount of money that's been allocated, for instance, to community-focused schools and the \u00a324.5 million that's been put into the education budget around the sustainable communities for learning programme and so on. Those are non-statutory services that are being funded through other budget allocations as well as just from the culture budget allocations.\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"Thank you. If I just may ask one more question before we move on to another Member. Has there been, or are there plans to conduct, an assessment of the number of cultural and sporting venues that may be forced to close because of the economic situation?&nbsp;\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"In terms of assessments, my officials met with the chief leisure officers of Wales at the end of last year, and that was after the local government settlement had been published. From that, we have been made aware that there are no imminent threats because of the better than anticipated situation that I just referred to. We've seen some examples already, for instance, of local authorities that had been planning on taking particular actions, but they have rowed back from those having seen their budget allocation\u2014Powys County Council being one case in point. They were going to close their swimming pools, and decided in light of their budget allocation that they are not now going to do that. So, we are not aware of any imminent threats to facilities, but we are very conscious and very aware of the very real threat to the leisure sector, particularly swimming pools. The fact that swimming pools have been left out of the UK Government's energy bill discount scheme, I think, is hugely important. I am having, immediately after this meeting, which is why I do have to leave at 11:00, a meeting with Swim Wales to discuss this very issue. This is a critical issue for some of these organisations where we have to try to bring pressure on the UK Government as well to include swimming pools and leisure facilities into that energy discount scheme, because if we don't do that, then I think that there is the danger of\u2014\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"Thank you, Deputy Minister. Certainly, we have had evidence as a committee that supports that view, and we all know its importance. But, obviously, there are also cultural venues. As a committee, we've received correspondence about the Museum of Cardiff, formerly known as Cardiff Story, for instance, public libraries as well, which are being looked at for closure or scaling back and being volunteer led. So, can you perhaps comment on the cultural aspect specifically?\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Yes, sure. We have also made additional provision for areas within the cultural sector. Again, that's all set out in the evidence that we presented to you. We have provided \u00a33.7 million in the financial year 2022-23 to the National Library of Wales, National Museum Wales\u2014\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"If I may stop you\u2014apologies. I meant specifically around local authority and non-statutory provisions rather than the national organisations. I believe my colleague Hefin David will be picking up specifically on national organisations shortly.\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"There has been significant support put in in terms of local museums. My officials meet with the local museum sector on a regular basis. At this point, it might be worth me asking one of my officials to give a little bit more detail about the work that has been done there and the additional support that we've put in. I don't know whether Nicky or Jason want to comment on that.\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"Shall I come in, Chair? Is that okay? Thanks, Chair. I think on that question, similar to what the Minister said on the leisure side, we work really closely with local government around the non-statutory services as well. As the Minister outlined, we have provided additional support for that sector in this budget round. But we keep our ear close to the ground on this, and where we do hear of institutions or smaller organisations that are at risk, we do try our very best to work with the local authority and the relevant governing body, arm's-length body, to try to do everything that we can to sort that. Obviously, the whole sector is nervous at the moment\u2014everybody is, with the cost increases. But, fortunately, so far, we've been able to keep things on a relatively even keel. We've got to watch this space really closely, and we always will do, but so far the support that we've been able to provide has kept these organisations going, which is a good thing. But we've got to keep a close eye on this.&nbsp;\" said by Jason Thomas\n\"Thank you. If I can move on to Hefin David now for questioning. Thank you.\" said by ", "answer": "Heledd Fychan MS"}

We were in public session earlier on, and then we went into private to deal with a number of issues, but we're back in public session now to continue with our business for the day, and we begin with item No. 7. Item No. 7 is notifications and correspondence under the inter-institutional relations agreement, and we have first on this agenda item\u2014item 7.1\u2014correspondence from the Minister for Rural Affairs and North Wales, and Trefnydd in respect of the Plant Health and Phytosanitary Conditions (Oak Processionary Moth and Plant Pests) (Amendment) Regulations 2023. The letter informs us of her intent to consent to the UK Government making and laying the regulations by 2 May 2023, following a request from Lord Benyon, the Minister for Biosecurity, Marine and Rural Affairs. And within the letter, the Minister notes that the major changes introduced in the regulations only apply to the London area at present, and the other changes in the regulations are minor and technical in nature. The Minister goes on to state that'divergence in regulations between Wales and England would cause greater confusion and burden for delivery bodies and industry',and that she considers that,'On this occasion...legislating separately for Wales would be neither the most appropriate way to give effect to the necessary changes nor a prudent use of Welsh Government resources given other important priorities.'It's a form of words that we're familiar with previously. Shout at me if there's anything that you want to raise on these, otherwise I'll proceed, and we'll note them.We then move to item 7.2. We have correspondence from the Minister for Rural Affairs and North Wales, and Trefnydd in respect of legislative amendments to allow a change in salmonella serotyping. The UK Government has requested the consent of the Minister to progress GB-wide secondary legislation to amend four pieces of retained EU law concerned with targets for the various requirements for sampling and testing for salmonella, and the Minister notes that although the Welsh Ministers are the appropriate authority in relation to Wales, a concurrent-plus power is being used, which allows for a GB-wide statutory instrument if consent of the relevant devolved Governments is provided. And the Minister states that the Scottish Government has requested the UK Government takes this approach.The Minister also states she has fully considered the risks and benefits, and is minded to provide consent for a number of reasons, including working in accordance with the outcomes of the inter-governmental relations review of 2022, and the existence of robust governance arrangements. And the Minister, just finally, notes that the statutory instrument is anticipated to be laid in the UK Parliament on 13 July 2023.Then we go to item 7.3, which is a written statement to note, by the Minister, in which she confirms she has given consent to the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to lay the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (Amendment) Regulations 2023 in the UK Parliament. These regulations extend the transitional deadlines for the registration of existing chemicals with the Health and Safety Executive by GB businesses following EU exit by three years. In the statement, the Minister notes that the delegated power to amend the REACH regulations can only be exercised by the Secretary of State and are not exercisable separately by Welsh or Scottish Ministers. However, the Secretary of State must seek the consent of Welsh Ministers if the exercise of the regulation-making function is within devolved competence.&nbsp;\" said by ", "answer": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM"}

My name is Mark Llewellyn, I'm professor of health and care policy at the University of South Wales.\" said by Professor Mark Llewellyn\n\"Bore da. My name is Fiona Verity, professor of social work at Swansea University.\" said by Professor Fiona Verity\n\"Thank you very much, both, for being with us today. The first set of questions, and an opening question, from Mark Isherwood.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Bore da. Good morning. Obviously, time is short, and we'll go through the findings in more detail later in this session, but I'd be grateful if perhaps you could start by briefly outlining your main findings of the evaluation and the main conclusions you reached.\" said by Mark Isherwood AM\n\"Thank you. I think it's probably helpful if we do that by addressing three things, and we'll do that jointly. The first is about the approach that we took, so you've just got a grounding in that; secondly, something about the context; and then something about the evidence that we collected. So, Fiona\u2014between us, we're going to provide that perspective\u2014on the approach.\" said by Professor Mark Llewellyn\n\"Thank you, Mark. In undertaking the evaluation, we used an approach called a principles-focused evaluation, developed by Michael Patton. We did that for two particular reasons. One is that his approach is about how do you evaluate interventions, whether it's a project, a programme or a service, in environments that are changing quickly at a pace, environments that are complex, and how do you then understand whether something implemented is having the desired result in this complex, changing world. We thought that approach fitted this evaluation. The Act is a complex piece of public policy. There's diversity across Wales, historical variations, provider differences, complex needs, so all of that fitted. And then we considered that the Act has, within it, five key principles, so there was a match there in terms of this particular Act, as what ought to happen, the duties, and what might happen, is informed by principles as guidance.&nbsp;So, we put that together and we thought that was a good fit for our approach. So, that was a methodological approach we took in the evaluation, and that led to us having 11 separate studies devised and developed and implemented, undertaken by different experts.\" said by Professor Fiona Verity\n\"Thanks, Fiona. The approach was, essentially, a collaborative one; we were trying to replicate the co-production principle and that was a separate part of our study that we\u2019ll come to later, I\u2019m sure, but we were very keen to ensure that it was a collaborative piece of work, so, working in partnership with a range of stakeholders. The second thing was about the context. We wouldn\u2019t be good academics if we didn\u2019t relate this back to the context, and when we started the evaluation, we were in the pre-COVID world, and COVID struck right in the middle of it, so the context shifted very, very dramatically through the course of the study. We paused for six months, so, as Fiona has alluded to, that very challenging situation for everyone across social care was right at the heart of what we were trying to do, and was a very disruptive force in both the practical work that we were doing around evidence gathering, but what it also meant when we restarted that data collection, and we\u2019ll reflect more on that as we go through the session, I\u2019m sure.The other thing that\u2019s worth mentioning around the context is that this was not a meta-inspection of social services in Wales. You and we have bodies to do that, and we were not ever wanting to tread on the toes of Audit Wales, Care Inspectorate Wales or any other regulatory bodies, like Social Care Wales, in our work. So, we were very clear that, whilst we had to understand the experiential nature of social services through what people had experienced as service users, as carers, as family members, that was a means for us to reflect on the key focus of our study around the policy and the legislation, the way it was framed, and the way it was conceptualised, which is the first of Michael Patton\u2019s questions. Secondly, on how that had been implemented in practice, so, reflecting with the workforce on that journey from legislation into practice. And then thirdly, whether those two things lined up and provided for people the desired results\u2014were they experiencing the transformative potential that the principles were offering?So, those three things were our questions. We weren\u2019t, as I say, trying to do an inspection of social services, but we will provide, and do in our work, an analysis both of that policy strategy piece, but also the bit that sits in the middle\u2014that implementation space between policy and experience.And then, the third thing that\u2019s worth mentioning about is the nature of the evidence that we collected.\" said by Professor Mark Llewellyn\n\"Yes. So, 11 independent studies, or separate studies. Just to take you through, we did literature review, we analysed literature on the Act's principles, comparative studies and research undertaken elsewhere. We did a process evaluation, so, we looked at the workforce perspectives on the implementation of the Act. We talked to people pre COVID and then we talked to people post COVID, so we\u2019ve got two snapshots there from different time windows. We talked to service users and carers. We talked to black, Asian and minority ethnic service users and carers about their expectations and experiences, and then, for each of the principles of the Act\u2014well-being, prevention, early intervention, co-production, voice and control, multi-agency working\u2014we did separate studies. We used different ways of collecting data, different methods for those various studies. We did a report on financial and economic implications of the implementation of the Act, and then we pulled all of that together in a final report. We took such a lot of material that we gathered, primarily qualitative data, we pulled that together, and synthesised it in a final report that was structured according to Michael Patton\u2019s three questions.&nbsp;\" said by Professor Fiona Verity\n\"The final report concludes with 19 test questions that we have set for the sector. We didn\u2019t write those as recommendations for the Welsh Government. We felt that was far too narrow a focus for a piece of work like this. What we wanted to do was to encourage a dialogue across stakeholders, so those test questions, we hope, will act as useful reference points, both in terms of acknowledging where we see strengths in the evidence we\u2019ve collected and where there are some deficits, but also provide a bit of a road map for future developments. We\u2019re conscious that the consultation\u2019s been launched this week, against which those types of developments can be judged. So our view would be that, if we can provide better answers to the questions that we\u2019ve set as we move forwards, this will have been a worthwhile exercise and we\u2019ll be able to see development and change over time.&nbsp;\" said by Professor Mark Llewellyn\n\"Thank you very much indeed. What specific issues highlighted relating to different groups of service users\u2014examples being, perhaps, children and young people, disabled people or older people\u2014need to be considered? If I can give you, perhaps, just two brief examples that I've been asked to highlight, the Act refers to reablement and habilitation, but I'm advised by vision impairment charities that delivery is falling far short of what is set out in the codes of practice. You'll know that reablement is helping people to do things for themselves to maximise their ability to live independently. Habilitation is central to enabling children and adults who have an impairment to live as independently as possible. But, I understand, for example, that three local authorities have no children's specialist, one specialist is shared between four authorities in north-east Wales and habilitation, for example, is not mentioned in any of the population-needs assessments conducted by the regional partnership boards; further, there's a shortage of qualified children's specialists working in these areas.&nbsp;The second example: just over a week ago, I was asked to attend, with an autistic young adult\u2014an autistic service user\u2014and her autistic mother, a care and support review. It concluded\u2014well, given the Act's requirements and the public sector equality duty's requirements to prevent a crisis occurring beforehand by preparing in advance, establishing trust and identifying the individuals' communication, sensory and environmental processing needs, although that was done to a certain extent\u2014it was in their home\u2014from the very beginning there was clearly, although there were good intentions, a failure to understand the autistic needs of the individuals. One of them became visibly more and more anxious\u2014that was missed and they eventually had a full autistic meltdown in the meeting. Yesterday, I was copied in on a letter from the director of social services blaming them for language, for their conduct and setting the terms for the future over where and how they would communicate with them. Again, could you comment on that in the context of the codes of practice?\" said by Mark Isherwood AM\n\"Do you want to start, or shall I start? There's one, in particular, part of our study that I think, perhaps, is commensurate with the issues you were talking about around sensory loss. So, we did undertake a specific focus group with people who were experiencing sensory loss, working in partnership with a third sector agency. I think the messages from that really focused on the lack of voice and control, which I think speaks very clearly to what you're describing there.There are a couple of particular issues that were raised. Firstly, that, on the communication barriers\u2014I'm talking now about the evidence that we've collected, which I think will speak to the example you've given us\u2014the opportunity to ensure that their voice is heard is, obviously, a genuine challenge, both physically and in the sense that it's meant in the legislation. So, sufficient time to prepare\u2014the ability to ensure that translators are available was a challenge that was routinely identified in the work that we undertook with that group.Secondly, this was a conversation that we had post COVID, so all of those issues had been intensified by the pressures on the workforce. Given the paucity of resource that had been able to be deployed in order to support deaf people in this instance, those challenges were exacerbated post COVID.Thirdly, there is an issue around the role of third sector providers in the examples that we gathered through our study. So, whether those organisations have sufficiency and sustainability of funding in order to provide the kinds of support that people are looking for is a challenge, and, fourthly, that varies very significantly by geography. So, there will be areas of good practice; you're clearly identifying areas of poor practice. What we don't have in our evidence or, clearly, in yours, is what we would seek to have, which is a consistent level of provision that is commensurate with the aspirations of the legislation. I hope that helps. Fiona may want to talk about reablement and some of the other aspects.\" said by Professor Mark Llewellyn\n\"Yes, thank you very much for your question. A couple of things. So, in the prevention report, we had a look at initiatives across Wales, across local authorities, and reablement does come through\u2014that there are a whole range of reablement initiatives happening. But I think, just picking up one of Mark's points, what we've picked up in the study, because it's a large study and we've looked at patterns, really, we've got a mixed picture, we've got pockets of good practice. When we talk to service users and carers, there are stories about good things that happen, good practices, responsive services, services that do meet people's needs and support them, but, then, we also hear stories\u2014. And it's probably true to say from the data, from our interpretation of the data, the dominant story is a disconnect between the promises of the principles of the Act and what people's experiences are. And it does come through\u2014looking at my notes\u2014that the need for accessible information and support for people living with sensory loss is something that does come through this particular study. I think it's important to say that we have got a mixed picture from our data. So, it's not a single story about what's happening, from the data that we've collected.&nbsp;\" said by Professor Fiona Verity\n\"Okay. Thank you.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Isherwood AM\n\"Mike Hedges.&nbsp;\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Diolch, Cadeirydd. The evaluation reports a view from the workforce that statutory care services are 'reactive' and a 'last resort'. I speak as somebody who believes in early intervention, but what do you think needs to change?&nbsp;\" said by Mike Hedges AM\n\"Would it be possible to repeat the question? I didn't quite catch it. It was a bit quiet.&nbsp;\" said by Professor Mark Llewellyn\n\"We all found it a bit quiet. We'll just try and get a bit of volume, Mike, but if you can just perhaps speak up a little bit more.&nbsp;\" said by Russell George AM\n\"I have no problem with speaking loudly, Cadeirydd.&nbsp;\" said by Mike Hedges AM\n\"We can hear you loud and clear now, Mike. Thank you. [<em>Laughter.</em>]\" said by Russell George AM\n\"The evaluation reports a view from the workforce that statutory care services are 'reactive' and a 'last resort'. I believe in early intervention. What needs to change?&nbsp;\" said by Mike Hedges AM\n\"I can answer that. Thank you very much for your question, and I share that belief. I think early intervention, prevention, is one of the strengths of the legislation, that has that focus on prevention. We've got different windows through the different studies on prevention and early intervention, so service users and carers talking about how important it is to them that things are prevented. So, it's not that, when there is a crisis, all of a sudden things have to be put in place, but there is support for them, building supportive environments around them and supportive services. So, it's coming through there. The workforce talking about prevention\u2014. For some people, they were saying, in our first process evaluation when we talked to the workforce, that they've been doing prevention; it's not new, they've been doing it. The Act has allowed for an acceleration of that endeavour of prevention. It's really put it out there that we have to\u2014sorry, local authorities and providers have to have a preventative wherewithal.But, there are things coming through our data about some of the issues\u2014. Actually, before I say that, we found that there's a rich tapestry of preventative activities happening across Wales, so things like dementia-friendly communities, community connectors, community catalyst programmes. So, there are different examples across Wales of prevention, working with local authorities, working with civil society, working with the third sector, working with social enterprises and co-operatives. All of that speaks to this architecture for prevention, which is really positive, but there are things coming through our data, as people articulate them, about prevention in terms of budgetary considerations, so when budgets are tight and there are pressures, questions about, 'Is it prevention that is the first thing to go when there are limited resources?'.The need for better models of prevention\u2014. Often, prevention\u2014we can talk about prevention, but do we think about it the same way? Are we understanding prevention in the same way? So, conversations and models to, really, I suppose, get a bit more clarity about what it is that's being prevented in the context of social care. And the final thing is about not letting the prevention agenda go. So, it's certainly something, for me, as being part of that particular study, that I think is really critical that the prevention agenda is one that is taken forward and not lost. &nbsp;\" said by ", "answer": "Professor Fiona Verity"}
{"content": "\"We'll go straight on, then, to the first substantive item, item No. 2, instruments that raise issues to be reported to the Senedd under Standing Order 21.2 or 21.3. The first of these is item 2.1, SL(6)359, the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) (Amendment) (No. 2) (Wales) Regulations 2023. These regulations amend the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989, which provide for the making and recovery of charges for relevant services provided under the National Health Service (Wales) Act 2006 for certain persons ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom. The regulations make amendments to the list of countries or territories with whom the UK Government has entered into a reciprocal agreement. So, for example, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands have now been added. Now, our lawyers have identified one merits reporting point, but we don't need a Welsh Government response for this, I understand, Kate. What's the merits reporting point?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"The merits reporting point is just to note that there has been no formal consultation on these regulations. The explanatory memorandum explains that this is because the regulations are implementing UK international agreements.\" said by Kate Rabaiotti\n\"Thank you&nbsp;very much, Kate. Are we content with that, colleagues? We are. Thank you, Kate.We'll go on, then, to item 2.2, SL(6)361, the Public Procurement (International Trade Agreements) (Amendment) (Wales) (No. 2) Regulations 2023. In your papers there, we've got a draft report and a letter from the Minister for Finance and Local Government to the Llywydd of 23 May. So, these regulations revoke and replace the Public Procurement (International Trade Agreements) (Amendment) (Wales) Regulations 2023 in order to address technical issues identified by us in our report on these regulations. The regulations amend various public procurement regulations for the purpose of implementing the procurement chapters of free trade agreements entered into by the UK with Australia and with New Zealand. Our lawyers have identified two merits points, and, again, we don't need a Welsh Government response here in response to these. Kate, what have we found here?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"The first merits point is just to note that these regulations are being made in response to this committee's report on the original 2023 regulations, and then the second merits point is to note the breach of the 21-day convention, and the letter to the Llywydd.\" said by Kate Rabaiotti\n\"Thank you, Kate, and, as I say, we don't need a Welsh Government response to those. Are colleagues content with that? We are. Good.That takes us on to the last item, then, in this section, item 2.3. It\u2019s an affirmative resolution instrument, SL(6)360, the Allocation of Housing and Homelessness (Eligibility) (Wales) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2023, and, again, we have a draft report and a written statement by the Minister for Climate Change of 22 May. These regulations amend the Allocation of Housing and Homelessness (Eligibility) (Wales) Regulations of 2014, which make provision for certain categories of persons from abroad to be eligible or ineligible for an allocation of housing, accommodation and for housing assistance, and colleagues will recall that the Minister wrote to us before half term to ask that we expedite our consideration of these regulations. So, the regulations extend the eligibility to people who are British nationals, others not subject to immigration control or treated as such, and anyone with immigration leave and recourse to public funds arriving in the UK due to the civil unrest in Sudan. Our lawyers have identified one merits reporting point, and, again, there\u2019s no Welsh Government response needed. Kate, what is that?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"The merits point is to note that no consultation has been carried out in relation to these regulations, and, according to the explanatory memorandum, this is because of the speed at which events in Sudan have occurred.\" said by Kate Rabaiotti\n\"Thank you very much, Kate. So, we can see that there\u2019s a good reason, good justification here for expediting these particular regulations. Colleagues, are you content with that reporting point? We are. Thank you.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"So, that brings us on, then, to item No. 3, which is instruments that raise issues to be reported to the Senedd under Standing Orders 21.2 or 21.3 that we have previously considered, and, under this, we have one item. It\u2019s SL(6)356, the Public Procurement (International Trade Agreements) (Amendment) (Wales) Regulations 2023, and we have a report and a Welsh Government response. We considered this instrument at our meeting on 22 May and we laid our report the same day. So, I\u2019d just invite Members to note the Welsh Government response to the report that we\u2019ve now received, and, as we discussed at item 2.2, the original regulations have been withdrawn and replaced. So, colleagues, are we content with this? We are.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"In which case, then, we move on to item No. 4, which is instruments that raise issues to be reported to the Senedd under Standing Order 21.7 that we\u2019ve previously considered, and we have one item here as well. It\u2019s in respect of item 4.1, SL(6)357, the school admission appeals code, and you have a report and a Welsh Government response in your papers. We considered this on our committee\u2014the draft code\u2014at our meeting on 22 May and we laid our report the same day. So, I just invite Members to note the Welsh Government response to that report that has since been received. You will note that the code is being withdrawn and a new version of the code will be relaid as soon as practicable, we are informed. Are Members content to note that? We are. Peredur.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Is it because of all the drafting issues that they\u2019ve just decided to pull it back and start again?\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"I wonder if we have any insight on that, Pered. Kate, or any one of our colleagues?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"I believe it\u2019s to look at the committee\u2019s report and to address the points that have been made. We identified quite a lot of issues, so, yes, I think that\u2019s why they\u2019ve been withdrawn.\" said by Kate Rabaiotti\n\"Thank you very much. Good.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Okay, and we go on, then, to item No. 5, notifications and correspondence under the inter-institutional relations agreement. So, under 5.1, we have correspondence from the Minister for Climate Change in respect of the net-zero energy and climate change inter-ministerial group. That meeting took place on 27 April 2023, and the letter informs us that the discussions focused on the grid network investment and inter-governmental collaboration.Again, colleagues, if there's anything on these you want to raise, just shoot your hand up or shout out there. Item 5.2, we have correspondence from the Counsel General and Minister for the Constitution in respect of the inter-ministerial group on justice. You'll recall from our last meeting, colleagues, that we considered a letter from the Counsel General, informing us that the inaugural meeting of that inter-ministerial group on justice was due to take place on 24 May. Now, the follow-up letter that we have from the Counsel General with us today informs us that the meeting was postponed due to the unavailability of Lord Bellamy KC, who was due to chair that inaugural meeting. They are seeking an alternative date, and the Counsel General has informed us that he will notify us as soon as that date has been agreed.Item 5.3, we have correspondence from the Minister for Rural Affairs and North Wales, and Trefnydd in respect of the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (Amendment) Order 2023. She confirms in that letter that she has granted approval to Lord Benyon, Minister for Biosecurity, Marine and Rural Affairs, to make the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board (Amendment) Order 2023. This Order will make amendments to the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board Order 2008, which is a UK-wide statutory instrument that contains elements within the competence of Welsh Ministers. This follows a UK-wide targeted consultation with industry and with stakeholders. Just also to note, the Minister notes that Welsh Government officials discussed and refined the 2023 Order with counterparts in DEFRA, the Scottish Government, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs in Northern Ireland, and this included the development of the consultation document and the responses, which have shaped the content of the Order. So, they're at pains to describe the extent of the engagement there to get this right.Item 5.4, we have correspondence from the Minister for Health and Social Services in respect of the Healthcare (International Arrangements) (EU Exit) Regulations 2023, and you have a couple of letters in your pack there. So, I just ask you to note the correspondence with the Minister in relation to the Healthcare (International Arrangements) (EU Exit) Regulations 2023, and the Minister responds to the questions we put in our letter of 15 May in relation to, amongst other things, the commencement of the main enabling powers for the regulations, clarity around how Welsh local health boards have been consulted, and why the UK Government is carrying out this work on behalf of the Welsh Government. And on all these points, of course, we can return to this in private session as well.\" said by ", "answer": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM"}
{"content": "\"So we'll move straight on to the sole item of business for today, which is Stage 2 of the Social Partnership and Public Procurement (Wales) Bill. We will adhere to the marshalled list and take each group of amendments relating to that subject matter. I'll obviously call the mover of the lead amendment first and then any other person who wishes to speak, either initially as the mover of another amendment in that group, or any other Member who wishes to speak on the subject in question.&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"So, the first group of amendments relates to the social partnership council chairing, meetings and procedure, and the lead amendment is amendment 12. I call on Joel James to move and speak to the lead amendment and any other amendments in that group.&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you, Chair, for this important opportunity to contribute to the Social Partnership and Public Procurement (Wales) Bill. I wish to first of all speak to my own amendments. For the social partnership council to function in a manner that is to be expected, that is, one that shows impartiality and fairness in proceedings, I believe that an independent chair is necessary. For this reason, my amendments in this group will serve to replace the First Minister as chair of the social partnership council with an independent chair that is to be selected by the Senedd.Chair, I also believe that it is important that the meetings of the social partnership council are effective and time efficient. For these reasons, my amendments in this group would also reduce the number of times that the SPC&nbsp;meets, guarantee that the SPC&nbsp;can continue to meet if the chair is not present, and ensure that any expenses claimed as part of participation in the council are reasonable. Furthermore, to enhance the quality of these meetings, amendment 43 will ensure that all meetings will be properly prepared for the meeting by having copies of the agenda for a meeting of the SPC to be published electronically at least 14 days before that meeting, or, if the meeting is convened at a shorter notice, then as soon as is reasonably practicable. As for amendment 1, I'm happy to support this amendment, as I believe it is right that any revisions must be consulted on with the SPC.\" said by Joel James MS\n\"Ken. Ken Skates.&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. The SPC is a Welsh Government body. I know of no other Executive bodies that have chairs appointed by the Senedd, so it's entirely appropriate that the First Minister, or for that matter,&nbsp;any other Minister or Deputy Minister within the Government should chair the council. So, I, I'm afraid, don't agree with Joel's proposal.&nbsp;\" said by Ken Skates AM\n\"Thank you. Anybody else wish to speak on this? Jane.&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. Thank you for the opportunity to speak briefly on this. I would agree with the point made by my colleague Ken Skates. It feels entirely appropriate that this important council is chaired by somebody with the stature and seniority as that of the First Minister. So, I don't support this amendment. Diolch yn fawr iawn.&nbsp;\" said by Jane Dodds MS\n\"I'd now like to call on the Member in charge to speak to amendment 1, and any other of the amendments in front of us on this subject.&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. I'll speak to the Government's amendment 1 first. This amendment responds to the committee's Stage 1 recommendation No. 4, which proposed that a duty be placed on Welsh Ministers to consult with social partnership council members before making revisions to the council's procedures. As I indicated in my letter to the committee following the Stage 1 debate, the Government accepted recommendation 4, and as such has tabled this amendment to add a requirement on Welsh Ministers to consult with SPC members before making any revisions to the council's procedures. I therefore ask that the committee accepts this amendment.&nbsp;Turning to the remaining amendments in this group, tabled by Joel James, Members will know that the function of the social partnership council, as set out in the Bill, is to provide information and advice to the Welsh Ministers on relevant matters. It's entirely appropriate that the First Minister, or another Welsh Minister or Deputy Minister, should chair the council. I do therefore not agree with Joel James's proposal that the Senedd be given the power to appoint the chair of the SPC. The council is intended to be a Welsh Government body and not a committee of the Senedd.&nbsp;Amendment 40 would require the SPC to meet four times per year. My view is that this is unnecessarily prescriptive. Currently, the Bill states that the SPC must meet at least three times in each 12-month period. This is a minimum requirement. The SPC may choose to meet more than three times a year if it so wishes, but this would be a matter best decided by the SPC itself when it becomes operational. Amendment 43 would require SPC agendas to be published within a specified period ahead of each meeting. Again, I think this would be unnecessarily restrictive and would hinder the SPC's ability to respond in a flexible and agile way to changing circumstances.&nbsp;Finally, in relation to amendment 48, which relates to members' expenses, all those appointed to public office are bound by the seven principles of public life and have a duty to ensure the safeguarding of public funds. I would expect all members of the SPC or its constituent sub-groups to fully comply with the rules set by the Welsh Government regarding expenses, and that all claims for expenses are scrutinised before payment is made. So, on that basis, while I appreciate the spirit in which that amendment has been tabled, the Government will not be supporting amendment 48, solely on the basis that it isn't necessary.So, in conclusion then, I ask Members to resist amendments 12, 15, 18, 22, 25, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 34, 35, 38, 40, 41, 42, 43, 48, and support amendment 1. Diolch.&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Hannah Blythyn AM\n\"Thank you, Minister. I call on Joel James to reply to the debate.&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you, Chair, and I'm disappointed that the Minister and others are not supporting my amendments in this group. I firmly believe that guaranteeing impartiality, effectiveness and efficiency for these meetings is in the best interests of all involved. Moreover, I do not see any specific need for the First Minister to chair these meetings, because they will still be in attendance, and it helps prevent representatives from simply stating what they think the First Minister wants to hear, which, given the status of the office, as outlined by my colleague Jane Dodds, could easily happen. Thank you.&nbsp;\" said by Joel James MS\n\"The question is that amendment 12 be agreed. Does any Member object? [<em>Objection</em>.] We will now proceed to a vote on amendment 12. Will all those in favour please raise your hand? And all those against. So, one Member in favour, five against. So, that amendment falls.&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Joel, do you wish to move to amendment 15?

Turning to my amendments, which comprise the entirety of this group, amendments 13, 17, 19, 21, 26 and 30 serve to increase the political representation on the social partnership council, therefore enabling a wider range of voices to be heard. It also helps improve scrutiny of the Welsh Government, because other political parties would have access to the advice that the Welsh Government is receiving. As to my remaining amendments, 33, 37 and 51, they seek to ensure that those who have been elected to represent the views of the Welsh people are able to represent their constituents in the social partnership council. Thank you.\" said by Joel James MS\n\"Does any other Member wish to speak on the amendments in group 2? Sarah.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. The social partnership council is not intended to be a political forum; it is meant to be a mechanism for bringing together Welsh Government and social partners in support of the duties set out in the Bill, and, more widely, our well-being goals. So, I do not support this amendment.\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Thank you. Minister, do you wish to\u2014? I beg your pardon. Sorry, I hadn't\u2014. Ken Skates.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thanks, Chair. Further to the comments made by Sarah Murphy, which I agree with, I'd also add that scrutiny of Welsh Government bodies takes place in the Senedd itself, through committee work and Siambr work, not in the bodies themselves, so I'd object to this group as well.\" said by Ken Skates AM\n\"Very good. I call on the Member in charge to respond to the debate.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Diolch. The Government will not be accepting these amendments. Our vision for the SPC is as a formal channel through which employers and trade unions\u2014specifically employer and worker representatives\u2014are able to engage with Welsh Ministers, to work with us to reach consensus on issues of mutual interest and to provide us with advice to better inform policy development and support implementation. It's not intended to be a party-political forum, nor, as I mentioned in my previous remarks, some sort of glorified Senedd committee. The Government will therefore not be supporting these amendments.\" said by Hannah Blythyn AM\n\"Joel James, do you wish to reply to the debate?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. It's unfortunate, but not surprising, that the Minister and others haven't supported these amendments, but, unless you have voices that represent the diversity of opinion in Wales, it is not really a social partnership. And I'm concerned that the Deputy Minister is going to create an echo chamber for the Welsh Government to hear those opinions that it agrees with. Thank you.\" said by Joel James MS\n\"The question is that amendment 13 be agreed. Does any Member object? [<em>Objection</em>.] Object. So, all those in favour of amendment 13. And all those against. So, that's one in favour, five against, so amendment 13 falls.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"We now move to group 3, which relates to the social partnership council and the employer representatives. The lead amendment is from Joel James\u2014amendment 14.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. I wish to speak to my amendments in this group concerning employer representatives. Firstly, amendments 14 and 20 will increase the number of representatives on the social partnership council, to include representatives of employers from small, medium and large businesses. For the SPC to be properly informed, it must draw on contributions from a wide range of views and experiences. By opening the door to representatives from small, medium and large businesses, we will be ensuring advice and a representative cohort of the private sector will be able to have their say. Small, medium and large businesses each have a different need and organise their voices differently to Government and trade unions. Having one body represent all these businesses is short-sighted, and we should strengthen the ability of businesses to convey their needs, therefore I propose having this extra representation.As to amendments 23 and 24, these will further reinforce the contributions I previously described, by ensuring that employers from different sectors are represented in the SPC. Finally, amendments 49, 50 and 52 provide clear definitions of 'large businesses' et cetera, in order to facilitate my previous amendments.\" said by Joel James MS\n\"Thank you. Does any other Member wish to speak on this group of amendments? The Minister in charge to respond.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. The Government will not be supporting amendment 14. The SPC is intended to be tripartite, with equal representation from social partners across the public, private and third sectors. Amendment 14 would increase the number of employer representatives on the council, but not worker representatives. This would create an imbalance, and as such is not one we can support.In relation to amendment 23, I am unconvinced that there is a need to give priority status to local health boards and local authorities. The Bill relies on a definition of 'public bodies' set out in section 6 of the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015, all of whom are subject to the social partnership duties, and includes local authorities and local health boards. Making special provision for local health boards and local authorities is therefore unnecessary.&nbsp;As far as amendment 24 is concerned, I believe that ensuring businesses of all sizes are represented in the council is a matter that employer representatives will, without any legal requirement from us, give careful consideration to when making the nominations. And of course we will work with the sector to ensure that this is the case in practice.\" said by Hannah Blythyn AM\n\"I call on Joel James to reply to the debate.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. Again, it's unfortunate that these amendments are not being supported. I believe that depriving the SPC of the widest possible range of views will only serve to harm its performance in the long run. Thank you.\" said by Joel James MS\n\"Thank you. The question is that amendment 14 be agreed to. Does any Member object? [<em>Objection</em>.] Amendment 14, all those in favour.

{"content": "\"Good afternoon and welcome to this afternoon's Plenary meeting. The first item on our agenda this afternoon is questions to the First Minister, and the first question is from Vikki Howells.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"1. How is the Welsh Government working to improve the provision of health services for the people of Cynon Valley? OQ59213\" said by Vikki Howells AM\n\"Llywydd, I thank the Member for that question. A series of national programmes assist the health board in providing improved access to its services. These programmes offer the most up-to-date clinical advice and access to latest best practice so that standards can be improved in all parts of Wales, including the Cynon valley.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Thank you for your answer, First Minister, and I was really pleased to hear the announcement last month about the new diagnostics and treatment centre for south-east Wales, to be based in Rhondda Cynon Taf. This could not just reduce, but actually eliminate, backlogs in accessing treatment and substantially reduce waiting times, moving forward, for orthopedic surgeries in particular, for people in Cynon valley and neighbouring areas.&nbsp;Can you provide any information on timescales for delivery of this key project and, in addition, outline what help Welsh Government will be providing to health boards to get this new centre up and running?\" said by Vikki Howells AM\n\"Well, Llywydd, I thank Vikki Howells for that question, and for drawing attention to that very important development in the RCT area. And, Llywydd, it's a genuine example, I think, of the social partnership approach in Wales in action. The three buildings that are to be used were first identified by the local authority. They drew them to the attention of the health board. The health board had negotiations with the current private sector occupant of the buildings. The health board then involved itself in discussions with the wider south-east Wales health community, and the financial help to acquire the buildings was provided through the Welsh Government. So, there you have local government, the health service, the private sector and the Welsh Government all collectively involved in bringing about a development that, as Vikki Howells said, will lead to significant new capacity for residents in this part of Wales.&nbsp;In terms of timescales, it's important to remember that the building is still occupied by its current owner, but there will be a period over the next 12 months in which they bring their use of the building to an end, and diagnostic capacity, which will be the first phase of the new development, will be worked up by the health board, its partners, including the Welsh Government, and that will be the first phase in the next calendar year. And then, once that is developed, there will be physical space at the buildings to have dedicated elective capacity, with a particular focus on orthopaedic care, which will, as Vikki Howells said, Llywydd, make an important difference to patients in that part of Wales, in accelerating their access to treatment. And the Welsh Government will be there not just with the financial help we've offered so far, but, as I said in my original answer, by making sure that the health board has access to those national programmes, those national clinical leads, which will help to make sure that the most advantage can be derived from this new development.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"First Minister, according to Stats Wales, in December 2022, Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board, which covers the Cynon valley, along with Bridgend, Merthyr Tydfil and the rest of Rhondda Cynon Taf, had a staggering 13,732 patients waiting more than 14 weeks for diagnostic and therapy services, out of a population of 450,000. This represents 36 per cent of the total amount of people waiting more than 14 weeks in Wales. Cwm Taf health board also had 31,992 patients waiting over eight weeks, which represented 18 per cent of the Welsh total, which is, sadly, further evidence of the postcode lottery that exists in Wales with the health service.&nbsp;To put these figures into perspective, for the same month, the whole of London, which has a population of over nine million people, had a similar amount of 32,953 people waiting more than six weeks. Recent Office for National Statistics data shows that, out of the 331 areas in the United Kingdom, Merthyr Tydfil is officially the sickest place, with almost 10 per cent of the population in very bad health, whilst RCT is sixth and Bridgend is thirteenth. As you know, recent news shows that Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board has now been put back into special measures, and the British Dental Association has warned that NHS dentistry in Wales could soon disappear, with the chairman of the BDA's Welsh general committee stating that Welsh NHS dentistry in its current state is unlikely to exist in a year or two's time. With this in mind, First Minister, what steps has the Welsh Government taken to improve on these appalling statistics? Thank you.\" said by Joel James MS\n\"Well, it's being so cheerful that keeps him going, Llywydd\u2014it's certainly not the accuracy of his grasp of the facts. In some ways, the Member managed to answer his own question, eventually, by pointing to the fact that the reason why there are percentages of that sort waiting in Cwm Taf is because of the nature of the population it serves. It's not a postcode lottery at all; it's as the Member eventually managed to say\u2014it is because Cwm Taf Morgannwg serves one of the oldest and sickest populations that we see anywhere in Wales. And the demand for health services reflects the needs of that local population. It's all the better news, therefore, that the development that Vikki Howells pointed to will accelerate access not simply to diagnostic services, but to planned operations for people in that part of Wales.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"2. What progress has the Welsh Government made on embedding prudent healthcare into every aspect of health and well-being in Cardiff Central? OQ59234\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"I thank Jenny Rathbone for that question. Llywydd, value-based healthcare continues to take forward the prudent healthcare principles of ill-health prevention, joint partnership with patients on the journey to improvement, and diversification of the workforce so that every practitioner operates at the top of their clinical licence.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"First Minister, I'm sure you will want to celebrate the work of Cardiff and Vale health board, mindful of the well-being of their staff, and inviting them to take part in courses on how to grow vegetables on the Llandough hospital site, obviously funded by the Cardiff and Vale health board charity\u2014something, I'm sure, close to both our hearts. But I also want to highlight their recent work on tackling the enduring epidemic of mental illness. Referrals to secondary care remain almost as high as they were during the pandemic. So, they've been training barbers to recognise signs of mental distress amongst their customers, and they're training people with lived experience of enduring mental health problems as tutors, to work alongside professional clinical tutors, involving individual patients and families and friends in a whole-system recovery, through something called the recovery college. How can this really creative response to the shortage of applicants to fill staff vacancies be deepened across Government, to help shrink the disparity in the numbers of years lived well between different socioeconomic groups, so harshly exposed by COVID? In Cardiff, it's 12 years.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Llywydd, I thank Jenny Rathbone for that. I certainly share her enthusiasm for the work of Cardiff and Vale health board, at their Llandough site, in using the ground that they have available there for well-being initiatives. The fruit that is being grown in part of the western edge of that site offers patients as well as people who work for the health board an opportunity to be outside, in the fresh air, and with access to the things that we know improve individuals' sense of well-being.As far as the mental health impact of the pandemic is concerned, it continues to be seen in all parts of Wales. The Welsh Government's new investment in mental health is often very much concentrated in that prudent healthcare part of the spectrum: investment in tier 0 and tier 1 services, and the 111 'press 2' service that's available 24 hours every day in the Cardiff and Vale health board area, and with a publicity campaign, Llywydd, which will take place throughout this month, to increase patients' awareness and use of that very valuable service. I'm very struck by what the Member said, Llywydd, about the way in which it is possible to harness the efforts of people who aren't in the health service at all to be part of the work of identifying and attending to patients needs as early as possible when those needs arise. I do recall, some years ago now, when I was health Minister, visiting Pen-y-groes, a Welsh-speaking area in the Ammanford coalfield, to see a dementia service and being told by the GPs who ran it that their most important source of referrals were hairdressers on the main street of the village, because those hairdressers knew their clientele\u2014they could spot the person who wasn't quite managing as well as they used to, with the money, with the organisation, and they would make an early referral into the dementia service, so that people could get that preventative intervention that is possible when you manage to identify people early on that journey. The barbers in Cardiff, the postal workers in Cardiff, who we know have those day in, day out interactions on the doorstep, all these are people who we can make helpful to the health service in that prudent healthcare way.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Questions now from the party leaders. The leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew R.T. Davies.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Thank you, Presiding Officer. First Minister, last week, my colleague Janet Finch-Saunders, along with other MSs, hosted a meeting about the cladding situation here in Wales, and the Welsh Cladiators, who have been pioneering the lobbying work and the projection of the plight of many home owners here in Wales who are caught up in this, really should be commended by all Members in this Chamber. One of the asks among many was why isn't the Welsh Government coming forward and adopting the legislation that has been put down in England, to take sections 116 and 125, to give rights to leaseholders so that they themselves can exercise those rights in holding the developers to account. I've heard Mike Hedges, one of your backbenchers, speak in favour of this in the Chamber when speaking to the leader of the house. There's cross-party support for this. We had a debate prior to Christmas. Will the Government reconsider its view, in light of the ongoing crisis that many home owners here in Wales face?&nbsp;\" said by Andrew RT Davies AM\n\"Well, Llywydd, first of all, I join with the leader of the opposition in congratulating those people who continue to campaign on this issue to make sure that the Welsh Government is always aware of developments that they are in touch with and that their views are conveyed to us. And I know that last week's meeting was an opportunity for that to happen, and the Minister will be following that up in her forthcoming meeting with the strategic safety stakeholder group, where these matters can be further debated, and the Minister keeps all those arguments about sections 118 to section 125 under review.The position, though, is that those regulations\u2014those sections\u2014were specifically written for the building safety regime in England. It is not as simple as simply picking them up and dropping them into the very different Welsh context. And there are some disadvantages for leaseholders who find themselves within that regime, because here in Wales our intention is that leaseholders should not be required to pay for the remedial action that is required to their buildings, whereas those sections expose leaseholders to bills up to \u00a310,000, and we don't intend to do that in Wales. So, while we will continue to keep the position under close review, we're not convinced that a simple drag-and-drop of those sections into the Welsh context would deliver what the campaigners say it would deliver, and we're not convinced that it could not actually act to their detriment.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"First Minister, a part of Welsh law that would accommodate those sections, in the rights of leaseholders and home owners, surely is something that must be welcomed, to give rights to those leaseholders and home owners in their actions against the house builders, in this case multinational house builders who have deep pockets indeed? And now, six years after Grenfell, many leaseholders and home owners still find themselves in this vortex that is opening up and with no end. If the Welsh Government are not prepared to enact sections 116 to 125, then the other route that the Minister has taken on board is negotiating with the house builders and the compact agreement that we were told last autumn has been agreed between certain developers, and then the obligations that those developers will bring forward. Can you confirm today how many developers have agreed that compact agreement with the Welsh Government, and, importantly, how many of those developers have brought forward their remedial works for consideration by the Welsh Government? Because it's my understanding that, in paragraph 6 of that compact, they had one month from agreeing the compact to come forward with their proposals. I would hope that you would be able to tell me how many developers have submitted those plans.&nbsp;\" said by Andrew RT Davies AM\n\"I can certainly tell the Member that 11 developers have signed up to the compact. We continue to work with the sector to put the force of law beneath the compact as well. I don't have in front of me the answer to the number of developers who have taken the next step to which the Member referred, but I'm very happy to write to him and make sure that he has that information.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"It is vital that the developers step up to the plate and do the work that is expected and commanded of them to make sure that the leaseholders and the householders aren't put in a disadvantaged position through no fault of their own. In Westminster, Michael Gove has been very forthright in saying that if the developers do not come forward with the proposals and start the remediation work and sign up to the Government agreement, they will be barred from operating in England. That is a very powerful stick to bring those developers to the table. Will you take such action here in Wales to make sure that the developers do respond and don't have this continual round-table discussion that leaves the leaseholders and home owners on the sidelines, unable to move forward with their lives?\" said by Andrew RT Davies AM\n\"I fully agree. It's been the position of the Welsh Government throughout that those who are responsible for the faults in the construction of those buildings should take responsibility for remediation. I want to try and be as fair as I can to that sector by saying that the considerable bulk of developers who are responsible in Wales have come forward and given that commitment, and therefore we should work with them to make sure that they deliver exactly what they have committed to do.Llywydd, to return to the leader of the opposition's first question, whereas sections 116 to 125 require leaseholders to instigate legal action against a developer who they consider is not remediating fire safety defects, in Wales it will be the Welsh Government who will take that action on behalf of the leaseholders so that they don't end up having to foot the bill for doing so. Where developers clearly fail to play their part, then absolutely we will take action against them, and I would not expect any developer who fails directly to deliver on those responsibilities to go on working here in Wales.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Plaid Cymru leader, Adam Price.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Diolch, Llywydd. The UK Government has just raised rail fares by 5.9 per cent\u2014the highest increase for a decade. Coming, as it does, in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, it's hard to disagree with Labour's shadow Secretary of State for Transport, Louise Haigh, who said:'This savage fare hike will be a sick joke for millions reliant on crumbling services. People up and down this country are paying the price for thirteen years of Tory failure.'Why did you agree to increase rail fares in Wales by the same amount?\" said by Adam Price AM\n\"The normal practice, as the Member will know, will be for rail fares to be increased in line with inflation; that would have meant a 12.3 per cent increase in rail fares here in Wales. With a great deal of discussion and action by the Minister, working alongside Transport for Wales, we have been able to cap that increase at less than half of inflation. I wish we didn't have to increase rail fares by 5.9 per cent, because it does, of course, have an impact on the passenger, but the farebox, the money the passengers pay, is an integral part of the way in which we pay for a rail service, and if passengers are not to pay, then taxpayers do have to pay. In the end, the best bargain we could come to in Wales, within the resources that we have available to us, was to increase the contribution that the taxpayer will have to pay in order to peg the increase in rail fares at less than half what it would've been had the normal practice been followed.\" said by ", "answer": "Mark Drakeford AM"}
{"content": "\"Good afternoon, and welcome, all, to this Plenary meeting. At the outset, I wish to inform the Senedd that, in accordance with Standing Order 26.75, the Historic Environment (Wales) Bill was given Royal Assent earlier today.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"The first item, therefore, this afternoon is questions to the Minister for Finance and Local Government, and the first question is from Joel James.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"1. What assessment has the Minister made of the number of NHS employees who have accessed training through Academi Wales? OQ59633\" said by Joel James MS\n\"Thank you. Academi Wales delivers a range of leadership interventions to public service leaders across Wales. In 2022, total delegates numbered 2,502, of whom 1,057 were NHS staff. For the first quarter of 2023, a total of 946 delegates have participated so far, with 292 of those delegates being from the NHS.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Thank you, Minister, for your response. As you know, Academi Wales is designed to transform this country through excellence in leadership, but, due to the COVID pandemic, our public sector leaders are now faced with challenges that they've never experienced before. I'm specifically thinking about our NHS leaders and how they have to deal with an ever-increasing complexity of health needs, a shortage of healthcare professionals in many sectors and geographical areas, and an ageing population, many of whom have chronic health conditions, to name just a few. Academi Wales lists a range of leadership training focusing on health boards, coaching and management training, which are standard skill sets that leaders need. But there doesn't seem to be any specific training on dealing with the challenges to the NHS in a post-COVID era. Minister, have you challenged Academi Wales to design this type of training, and what are the Welsh Government's aspirations for training the next generation of NHS leaders? Thank you.\" said by Joel James MS\n\"I'm very grateful to Joel James for this question this afternoon, and also for recognising Academi Wales as the centre of excellence that it is in terms of leadership development in Wales. So, Academi Wales does have a range of leadership interventions, including coaching, master classes, programmes and residential schools, and I'm really looking forward to the summer school in Lampeter later on this year. But I will say that NHS staff are one of the key target audiences for Academi Wales, and it does work directly with the NHS for some of its programmes, including, for example, independent members' induction training, and that's part of Academi Wales's efforts to improve and strengthen board level leadership across public services in Wales.Academi Wales is, of course, not the only place in which NHS staff will receive training. There is a wide range of training available through the NHS itself, including professional development across a range of routes, including everything from work-based training to specialist courses. So, I think it's important to recognise that leadership within that one Welsh public service ethos is very much supported and catered for through Academi Wales, but, absolutely, the NHS has an important role to play. And, for me, it's important that those two ways of learning and ways of supporting leadership development complement each other. Thank you for the question\u2014it's not often we get to talk about Academi Wales on the floor of the Senedd. It is one of the more joyous areas of my portfolio and a really exciting agenda.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"2. Will the Minister provide an update on empty buildings owned by the Welsh Government in Caernarfon? OQ59634\" said by Si\u00e2n Gwenllian AM\n\"Yes. The former Welsh Government office building in North Penrallt is the only empty building owned by the Welsh Government in Caernarfon. The Minister for Climate Change has already written to Gwynedd county council on this matter, and officials are in active discussions with the council to ensure that the building is put back into beneficial use at the earliest opportunity.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Thank you very much. The Government offices in Penrallt have been empty for two years, and the council and a local housing association are eager to use the building to provide temporary accommodation to people who present themselves as homeless. In May, 107 people presented as homeless in Gwynedd. The county spends \u00a36 million on unsuitable accommodation, because there are insufficient temporary places. There would be room for more than 30 people in Penrallt, a site that is in the middle of the town of Caernarfon. Doesn't it make sense, in terms of making effective use of public resources\u2014which is part of your portfolio, to ensure that efficient use of public resources\u2014as well as a whole host of other reasons, to move forward with this scheme? Will you commit today to doing everything within your power to accelerate this scheme?\" said by Si\u00e2n Gwenllian AM\n\"I'm very grateful for this question this afternoon as well, and I just want to reassure Si\u00e2n Gwenllian that we are very much seeking to ensure that any redevelopment of the site does deliver new and affordable housing to alleviate the current housing pressures in the area. We are very aware of the significant negative impacts that empty buildings do have on the local environment, and especially so in our town centres.&nbsp;I can say that there is a meeting now scheduled between senior Welsh Government officials and the chief executive of Gwynedd county council, and his officers, on Monday of next week. I hope that's an opportunity for us to make some progress and agree a way forward. We've been unable to receive any recommendations from officials at this point in respect of disposal of the building to Gwynedd county council because we do need a more detailed proposal than that which has been forthcoming so far, and that's because I think that any proposals will require some significant grant support. So, any applications for such funding have to undergo a very rigorous process, and very much so to determine value for money.&nbsp;But we are, I think, in the same space in terms of wanting the building to be used as soon as possible, and recognising that residential use is a really good use for that site, and there's very much a need for it. So, I do hope that the meeting, now, on Monday of next week will be productive.&nbsp;\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Questions now from party spokespeople. The Conservative spokesperson, Sam Rowlands.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Diolch, Llywydd. Minister, I've spoken before about the issues around abuse of politicians, in particular&nbsp;councillors serving in local government. Minister, you will be aware that yesterday it was reported that the deputy leader of Anglesey council has said that, and I quote,'All Tories should be shot.'We'll all be aware, of course, that, in the UK over the last seven years, two MPs have been murdered in their role as parliamentarians\u2014one Labour and one Conservative. This is real, literal violence, and any attempt to insight violence like that, in my view, should be met with the strongest condemnation. The language that Ieuan Williams used, I would say, is obscene and creates a foul atmosphere around our politics, especially from somebody in a leadership position, who has now stood down, as I say, as deputy leader of Anglesey council.&nbsp;Of course, this isn't the first time in recent months that a councillor has done this. We heard earlier this year of a Caerphilly Plaid Cymru councillor posing with a gun and posting about shooting English people.&nbsp;So, Minister, can you share your thoughts on this particular issue in Anglesey&nbsp;and the wider issue of abuse in politics?\" said by Sam Rowlands MS\n\"Yes, I'm very grateful to Sam Rowlands for raising this, and, actually, it's a topic he returns to frequently in spokesperson's questions, which I think is really, really important, because it is one that I think transcends those party political lines, and one where we have to all stand shoulder to shoulder against any form of abuse. Healthy debate is wonderful; it's really important to be able to challenge each other, but also to do so in a way that is respectful.And I think that it is the case now that the individual concerned has asked the standards committee of the local authority to look at what happened. I think that is definitely the appropriate way forward, because processes are in place to investigate potential breaches of codes of conduct, and I think that it's important now that that process takes place. But there are sanctions for breaching the code of conduct, and they can range from censure to suspension or disqualification from being a councillor for up to a period of five years. So, it is a serious matter.&nbsp;It does give me an opportunity to say that we are currently consulting on a revised code of conduct, to ensure that it does remain fit for purpose in engendering trust in the highest standards of conduct for councillors. And I would obviously encourage colleagues to have their say in that consultation, and particularly to make sure that it is fit for purpose with all of the different things that we have to deal with nowadays, for example, threats online and social media abuse.&nbsp;\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Diolch yn fawr iawn, Minister. Thank you for that response. Just to expand on the issue slightly further, because, from that particular incident, it also appears that the chief executive of the council was at the meeting where those comments were made, and the chief executive seems to have asked for those comments not to be minuted. I would say that this is staggering, to say the least, because, of course, we'd all advocate and want people to stand up and speak out when things like this happen, not shy away in an attempt to cover it up. You just mentioned there some of the consultation on a revised code of conduct, but, I wonder, can I ask what resources and what support are Welsh Government giving to local authorities in order to support staff and councillors when they're dealing with aggression and hostility, especially in light of the events that we heard about yesterday?\" said by Sam Rowlands MS\n\"We're working really closely with the Welsh Local Government Association, but also with One Voice Wales, because we know that levels of abuse are increasingly concerning to members of town and community councils as well as principal councils. And we are now working to develop some training on the code of conduct, so that local authorities and those who are elected to serve on councils are aware of the responsibilities of the various partners who operate roles on those bodies, but also ways in which they can find support, in terms of the WLGA, the resources from the local council and also those support mechanisms that lie outside the formal council as well. So, I think that it is something that now has a very strong focus and is a very important part of the work of my officials in the local government department.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Thank you for that response, again, Minister. Certainly, we're supporting efforts to make sure our staff and councillors in local authorities are properly equipped.I just want to touch, in my last question, on local development plans. I'm sure the First Minister was disappointed yesterday that my question was too far down the order paper to be able to raise a question on it with him yesterday. But, Minister, you will be aware of Wrexham council's recent decision to not support the local development plan that was placed in front of the council. I did note the First Minister made comments on this a few weeks ago here in the Chamber, and I did note that those comments seemed to be mocking the decision of the council. In my view, it's completely disrespectful of local democracy and the mandate that councillors received only last year in those local authority elections. My view is that democracy works best at a local level, and if a local authority does not want to support something, they should be well within their right to not support something. So, in your view, Minister, would you not agree with me that local councils and councillors deserve respect as the people on the ground who know best for their local communities? And what approach will you be taking to build bridges not just with Wrexham council, but with all councils to ensure that they are properly supported in the development of local development plans?\" said by Sam Rowlands MS\n\"Well, Wrexham is the only local authority in Wales not to have an adopted local development plan in place, and obviously that is a really disappointing position for them to be in. In not adopting a plan, it does remove certainty for communities, for businesses and for investors in Wrexham. We considered the positive report from planning inspectors following the statutory scrutiny process. We consider, as a Welsh Government, that that does enable now the LDP in Wrexham to be adopted, and let's remember we've had 11 years of preparation in Wrexham for this plan, and it was a plan that the council itself considered to be sound and able to be adopted, but yet it hasn't been. I do know that a judicial review was launched by third parties against the decision by the local authority not to adopt the plan, but Wrexham have conceded this judicial review in full. I understand that the authority is now scheduled to consider this again on 14 June. I'm checking my watch\u2014that's today or tomorrow.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"I was going to provide clarity, and then I worked out I couldn't work out whether it was 13 or 14 June.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"The Plaid Cymru spokesperson, Mabon ap Gwynfor.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Diolch, Llywydd. Well, Llywydd, I'm hearing incredibly concerning things from local government and the homelessness sector about their ability to deliver homeless prevention measures. Representatives from the sector have told me that many support providers and commissioners have spent the last two months discussing how to reduce and remodel homelessness and housing support services because they don't have the funds to continue delivering services at the same level as they did last year. The lack of any increase to the housing support grant is forcing the sector to cut services in order to pay minimum wage, and the figures published by the Government last week show that over 10,000 people are now in temporary accommodation, causing huge challenges for local government and the sector at large. The sector is now under mor pressure than ever before. The likely reduction in support hours and service delivery is incredibly concerning, and the impact will be felt by the most vulnerable in our society. So, what is the Minister\u2019s message to them and the brilliant front-line workers in local government and third sector who are struggling at the moment? What consideration did the Minister give to providing additional funds from the UK Government spring statement to increase the housing support grant? And what priority will the Minister give to the housing support grant, should the additional funds or in-year savings become available?\" said by Mabon ap Gwynfor MS\n\"I'm very grateful for the question and also to take this opportunity, as you have, to recognise the important work that people in local authorities and those delivering these schemes provide. I will say that the question really is a policy and budget question for the Minister for Climate Change. I\u2019ll make her aware of these concerns. But from my perspective, I will certainly say that, in the three-year spending review that we undertook last year, we did increase the housing support grant by 30 per cent at the start of that three-year spending review period, and that was, I think, a significant uplift.It wasn\u2019t possible, of course, to do a similar thing in the second year of the three-year spending review just because of the fact that the way in which the money that came from Westminster to Wales was profiled means that we had the majority of it in year 1; years 2 and 3 will inevitably be much more difficult.The amount of funding that was provided to Wales through the spring statement was absolutely paltry. And let\u2019s remember that this year, our budget is worth \u00a3900 million less than it was when we set our budgets, and that is largely the impact of inflation. So, at the moment, we\u2019re really not in the space of being able to allocate additional funding to new things. It is very much about getting a clear sight, really, of the pressures across Government and the impact that inflation is having on our existing plans. So, I don\u2019t want to mislead anybody as to our ability, really, to be providing large amounts of additional funding for new things, much as we would obviously want to be able to.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Thank you for the response. Of course, you didn't mention the increase\u2014[<em>Inaudible</em>.]\u2014the budget was \u00a3139 million back in 2012 and, in today's money, that is the equivalent of \u00a3186 million. So, in real terms, that's a \u00a320 million cut that they've received over 10 years to the housing support grant. So, any in-year savings would be appreciated.\" said by ", "answer": "Mabon ap Gwynfor MS"}
{"content": "\"We will move on now to item 2, our sixth evidence session on the right to adequate housing. I'm very pleased to welcome the Minister for Climate Change, Julie James, to committee, together with two of her officials, Sarah Rhodes, who is interim deputy director of housing policy for the Welsh Government, and James Hooker, who is head of private sector housing policy. Welcome to you all. Thank you for joining committee this morning.Minister, perhaps I might begin with a couple of initial questions before other members of the committee ask further questions. On the Green Paper, Minister, I wonder whether you could inform committee of progress with the Green Paper on the right to adequate housing and rent controls and the potential timescale that's currently envisaged.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Certainly.&nbsp;\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Good morning,&nbsp;Chair.&nbsp;Good morning, everyone.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"It's very nice to be here. So, yes, absolutely. We have a commitment as part of our co-operation agreement with Plaid Cymru to publish a White Paper in this Government term, and the timing for that is summer 2024. That will set out proposals for a right to adequate housing. It's also important, though, to point out that that isn't the only thing the White Paper will look at. It will also look at fair rents and new approaches to making homes affordable for those on local incomes. So, as part of developing the evidence base to understand the potential impacts and consequences of that, we'll be launching a Green Paper, which is basically a call for evidence, before the summer recess this year.We've got a stakeholder advisory group established so that we have a collaborative approach and appropriate representation from organisations that represent tenants, landlords and local government, who are the main categories of people impacted and likely to have the kind of data that we're looking at. Lots of&nbsp;the people on our advisory group, I know, Chair, have already provided evidence to your inquiry.We know that we have lots of data and evidence gaps, particularly in relation to the affordability aspect of a right to adequate housing, and that's why the Green Paper is a call for evidence. So, pretty succinctly, really, we want to help build our evidence base to inform the development of the White Paper. We want the White Paper to be a direct route to a Bill. Sometimes, you have a White Paper and it looks more like a Green Paper, because it's a wide, discursive document, but we're having a Green Paper and then a White Paper in order to get a proper build-up to a Bill that would introduce the right to adequate housing.The Bill is not part of the co-operation agreement, the White Paper is, and the reason for that is that we are very unlikely to be able to get that Bill to come forward in this Senedd term, given the legislative timetable that we already have. We also have, of course, as the Chair will know, as the committee will know, a very large homelessness piece of legislation on its way as well, and it's been my long-stated policy that we need to do those sequentially, because we need to\u2014. I would very much like a right to adequate housing to be enforceable, and I would like people to be able to get adequate housing as a result of that. It's not a statement of intent; it's an actual right.To do that, we have to establish what we mean by 'affordable', what we mean by 'adequate'. We also have to put local authorities into a position where they can get people adequate housing, and, to do that, we need to reform the homelessness legislation. We have\u2014the lawyers don't like me saying this, but\u2014a sticking plaster at the moment over the legislation that allows us to give a service to everyone in Wales, but we want to put that right so that it's properly set out in law, and then the next Bill will follow as a matter of course.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Thank you very much for that, Minister, and we'll be coming on to other legislative questions later on in this session. Could you tell me the extent to which there have been discussions across Welsh Government departments to develop the policy for a right to adequate housing, where you are in that process?\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Yes, certainly. Myself and Cabinet colleagues are all fully supportive of the general principle that everyone should be able to access adequate housing. We've been consistently driving housing policy and practice towards that goal the entire time. The ending of homelessness in all of its forms has been a top priority in driving towards that. We've already taken and continue to take significant steps towards meeting the criteria to deliver housing adequacy, and we do that on a cross-Government basis. So, I've got a number of examples I could give, Chair; the work to end homelessness is obviously a prime example of that. We work with education, health, social services, criminal justice, local authorities, to take forward our shared goal of ending homelessness, pooling budgets and developing joint programmes of work, and all of our policy and legislative work across housing is taken forward in collaboration with colleagues right across Welsh Government, as well as external partners. I can specifically name some, but every department is involved. We specifically work, for example, with the Deputy Minister for mental health, we work with substance abuse colleagues, we work with the Deputy Minister for children, we work with health overall, economy. Even rural affairs is included here, because we have rural housing enablers in place; we have a whole project around second homes, which the committee will be familiar with. All of these policies are driving towards adequate housing across Wales, and so we have a very long and very well-established process for pulling in colleagues from across Government. Well, and indeed, wider\u2014the wider government family, like local government as well.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Okay. Diolch yn fawr, Gweinidog. And now Sam Rowlands. Sam.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Thank you, Mr Chairman. Morning, Minister. Thank you for your time with us this morning. Thank you, then, for just walking through some of your process of consideration around Green Paper into White Paper and moving through from there, and we have already heard as a committee from a number of stakeholders who have expressed some support for the right to adequate housing into Welsh law, and I wonder whether you would be able to expand a bit further on how you think we would see benefits from incorporating a right to adequate housing into Welsh law, and what tangible difference will it actually make being law, rather than being a directive, as it were.\" said by Sam Rowlands MS\n\"That's really quite a complex question, really, Sam. So, legislation isn't a panacea here. It doesn't in and of itself deliver adequate housing for everyone. We have to have a series of strategies, policies and programmes that deliver the housing, which then allows everyone to have that adequate housing. So, we've got all kinds of issues going on there. We've got record levels of funding across housing portfolios here in the Welsh Government that will deliver a housing supply and so on. What we want is for local authorities to be able to deliver it in practice. So, we want, when somebody is asking for adequate housing at a housing options service, for example, for the local authority to be in a position to say, 'Well, yes, we have x, y, z on offer'. That absolutely is not the case at the moment. We have a lot of work to do to get there.We have to have collective understanding of what we mean by a right to adequate housing. So, there are seven specific criteria that are put forward by the UN, and my official James, who is in the committee with me today, is more than happy to take the committee through those, if that would be helpful, Chair; I'm sure you've heard of them before. And then we're focusing on putting all the building blocks in place in order to deliver housing adequacy for everyone in practice.So, I suppose the philosophical answer to the question, Sam, is that I think that it's a fundamental human right that you are adequately housed, and that it's the mark of a civilised society that we can adequately house our citizens. I don't think there's much disagreement with that. The issue we're dealing with is the route to get there, and then that's why I've just talked about the route for a Green Paper, White Paper, Bill. The Green Paper is to call for evidence. We know that we don't have enough Welsh-specific data on what we're looking for, so we need to fill in those data gaps, and both the officials with me on this call can talk to you in a great deal of detail if you want them to about exactly what the data gaps we're looking at are.I chair a housing cabinet with members across Welsh Government and we talk there about how we get data together; we collaborate with various centres for collecting housing data, statistical organisations and so on. But we need to know what we're doing, because interventions in the housing market can have consequences that are unintended, so we like to make sure that we have the data sets available. It's very difficult to answer what seems like a simple question simply, I'm afraid, so it's a complex series of building blocks we're putting together here to get us to where we want to go.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Thanks, Minister, and I certainly recognise the complexity of this, absolutely. I wonder is it worth, then, as you mentioned, hearing just what those perhaps top two or three biggest data gaps might be at the moment and perhaps how you're seeking to resolve them. Because, I guess that's part of the challenge or concern you might have about incorporating this into law.And secondly, I wonder whether we could hear about your thoughts on the challenges it might bring for public bodies in Wales, whether they be local authorities or other public bodies that would be responsible for actually delivering this on the ground.\" said by Sam Rowlands MS\n\"Yes, thanks, Sam. I'm going to ask James to come in and just talk you through the process that we've been identifying the data gaps and so on with, if you don't mind, Chair, and then we can go on to the issues with local government.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"In actual fact, we were going to come on to research and data later on actually, so, I wonder, Sam, if we might park that just for the time being and that you might address the other issues that Sam has raised at this stage, Minister.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"So, the issues for local authorities are pretty straightforward. Sam, you'll be very familiar with them from your previous role. we want to have a service that is adequate. We want to re-enable the local authorities that are stockholders to build, and the ones that aren't stockholders to work with their registered social landlords to get a housing supply in place. It's not just about new build though, it's about bringing a whole series of other measures to bear, and it's about changing the way that we run housing options.&nbsp;So, the committee, I know, is very familiar with this, but we've been working with the homelessness action group for quite some time. You'll know that, just as a matter of serendipity, they had given us a report just before the pandemic hit. We were able to implement that report in a very short period of time, when we'd originally intended it to be over a number of years, and we've kept that approach up.But there's an enormous culture change to be driven through the system here, because, in fairness to colleagues in housing options, for many years, they've operated what's effectively a rationing system, and we've turned that around into a front-facing service for everyone. And that's quite a big culture change for them. So, we've been working with the local authorities to do that transformational change. It's very much welcomed by most of the staff in the service, because the service has not been set up in that way. And then, we've worked with local authorities around the way that they work, either with their own housing departments as a whole authority challenge, using what's called, the 'trauma-informed approach'. And we've worked with the non-stockholding authorities to work well with their RSLs in a similar way. We've got a lot of work to do there, which, Chair, I'm more than happy to talk\u2014I could talk your arm off, as you know\u2014I'll talk very happily about that. But basically, we're trying to get a system change here and local authorities are absolutely at the heart of it.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Sam, are you content?\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Yes, and just perhaps a brief response further to that, Minister, I was wondering whether you think that, whilst they may well commit and want to see this change, do you think they have the capacity to be able to then deliver on this change?\" said by Sam Rowlands MS\n\"Yes, so, that's the point of the data and the call for evidence, isn't it? What we want to know is: what does this system require? So, when we go out with the Green Paper, we're expecting local government to respond by saying, 'Well, if you're going to do that, then we will require this.' And we expect the RSLs to do that; we expect the tenants' organisations\u2014you know, we expect people to do that.And then, the White Paper will have a set of proposals, which again, is a consultation document, obviously, for local government to respond to. And then, if we're going to deliver a right to adequate housing, local government has to be in a position to be able to deliver it\u2014they are the delivery arm, effectively. Obviously, they do that in a variety of ways: through the RSLs and through their dealings with the private rented sector, through their local development plan and their planning process and through their homelessness and housing functions. You'll know how diverse the services that a local authority provides are in this sphere. But we need that system change. So, the whole point of the Green Paper and then White Paper process is to make sure that we have an adequate consultation mechanism in place. And, in the meantime, I continue to meet very regularly with both leaders of councils and with housing planning cabinet members in order to make sure that we're driving towards that outcome.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Okay. Thank you very much, Minister. Thank you, Sam. Mabon ap Gwynfor. Mabon.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Good morning. Thank you for joining us this morning. I'm very pleased to hear your opening remarks. I understand from what you've said that you want to see different policies being put in order\u2014I think that 'sequentially' was the word that you used. Don't you feel that, in introducing legislation as soon as possible, assuming that we need the data, on the right to adequate housing, that kind of legislation would ensure that other policies that you want to see being delivered would be delivered, because that legislation would be in place without doing things sequentially?\" said by Mabon ap Gwynfor MS\n\"No, Mabon, I'm afraid I don't agree with that at all. I think you could put a statement of principle into legislation, but you can't put a delivery mechanism into the legislation. We have a principle of not putting legislation in place without all of the funding available for it. I can't imagine what the regulatory impact assessment or the financial assessment of such an Act would be at this time. It would have to include all of the things I've just talked about, and those things are not in place yet. So, quite genuinely, I want to see this\u2014it's something we should have; all civilised societies should have it. I absolutely agree with that. But we have a long road to travel to get to it, and I want it to be deliverable and implementable.The committee will be very familiar with the fact that it took us many years to implement the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016. Fundamental system change takes a long time. It's not just about the principle in the legislation. It's about the ability to actually deliver it on the ground. We want to learn the lessons of the renting homes Act in putting the homelessness legislation in place. That is a transformational piece of legislation by itself. This committee will be dealing with it. That has fundamental changes in the way that we approach housing\u2014really fundamental changes. We need to put that in place first and get the system change running first before we then put the rights that come with it in place. If you do it the other way around, we will have something that nobody can implement and that everybody just shrugs about. We've had unattainable goals put in place before, where everybody just\u2014'Well, nobody can do that, so that was interesting', and it just doesn't happen. There are many examples of that, Mabon, that you and I could discuss at great length, you know, 'Why didn't that happen?' And I really want this to happen.So, we want to put a practical set of steps in place that get us to this goal, which is adequate housing for everyone. It's a very straightforward goal, isn't it\u2014adequate housing for everyone? It's a right. You have a right to it. But at the moment, we wouldn't be able to implement that right. We can't give everyone at the moment adequate housing. That's the horrible truth of it, and we need to get our system to change itself around so that we can do that. That will take a little more time. We've gone a long way towards it in the last three years, but we've got a few more years to go yet before we get there.\" said by ", "answer": "Julie James AM"}

Ffion Williams is the constituency Member for Cardiff West. Ffion Williams.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Diolch, Llywydd. It is a pleasure to be at the Senedd today with our first joint session between Members of the Senedd and the second cohort of Welsh Youth Parliament Members.I know that I and fellow Members are grateful for the opportunity to be here today, and hope the session will be valuable to both Senedd Members and the Welsh Youth Parliament in furthering our work. As a Welsh Youth Parliament Member, it has been incredibly rewarding to see the progress we have made in our sub-committees on mental health, the environment, and education. Our November session in the Senedd really proved our success in listening to young people across Wales and vocalising their views to ensure every voice is represented. Furthermore, I and other members have also benefited from previous sessions and experiences shared between the Welsh Youth Parliament and Members of the Senedd to inform and influence our politics here in Wales.Of course, our work has built on the foundations laid by the inaugural Welsh Youth Parliament, with the continuation of these sub-committees and certain themes within these topics being a testimony to how these issues remain prevalent for young people. We hope that today's session will inspire Members to further engage with the work we are doing and support our efforts as a Welsh Youth Parliament. In turn, we also hope that, as Welsh Youth Parliament Members, we gain insight into how the Senedd is responding to the issues facing young people, and ensure we are recognising this in our work.

As a committee, we found that common topics we wished to explore consisted of life skills, extra-curricular opportunities, equality and inclusion, in addition to the current support systems in place for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.Committee members have had the opportunity to meet with Welsh Government representatives to learn more about the new Curriculum for Wales, in addition to many of us being part of insightful discussions with Qualifications Wales in regard to new subject qualifications and the changes to the way some of the subjects will now be assessed. As a collective, we hold many different experiences within the Welsh education system, and thus we hope we've been able to provide substantial value to these discussions.We have recently launched our consultation on the school day, with our main focus being for the Welsh Youth Parliament Members to understand if making changes to the length of our school day would have any positive correlation or impacts to improved student well-being, their confidence, greater support for those from disadvantaged backgrounds to achieve in their place of study, as well as potential increased social and personal skills, especially following the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.As part of our consultation, we would like to hear not only from students, but also teachers, parents and guardians in order for us to gain a better perspective on how this could affect a greater proportion of our population. The consultation will build on previous Welsh Government trials where activities such as digital arts, storytelling and outdoor adventure activities have been delivered in addition to the current school hours in place. The consultation at present is being promoted on social media platforms, through school workshops and youth groups, as well as public events such as the Royal Welsh Show and the National Eisteddfod, in addition to others.We look forward to presenting a subsequent report in the Chamber in November, and we would like to emphasise the importance and encourage as many young people to get involved as possible, to ensure that they have their say.

Since launching our campaign, the mental health and well-being committee has been working hard to raise awareness of a number of key issues within the current mental health services available to children and young people across Wales.\" said by Harriet Wright-Nicholas\n\"We began our research by sending out a survey, asking children, young people and adults, about their opinion of the current mental health and well-being services and provisions available to them. We received over 3,500 responses, and discovered that, despite the first Welsh Youth Parliament\u2019s impressive work to try and improve provisions, mental health services are still not hitting the mark. In fact, we found little to no difference in how often young people are struggling with their mental health when compared with the first Welsh Youth\u2019s Parliament survey, carried out in 2020. Despite the increase in spending in an attempt to improve services, there hasn\u2019t been enough change. Obviously, mental health provisions need an urgent overhaul. Based on our survey\u2019s results and discussion with children and young people in a number of settings, we formed our report, which included our findings and our recommendations for improvement to the Welsh Government.Last November, we had the opportunity to meet with decision makers at the Senedd at our residential meeting. We discussed the report and the recommendations we made. Our key suggestions included: one recognised, central one-stop shop for information, resources, and support; greater emphasis on ensuring that families and friends are equipped to support young people, including the provision of training, information and materials to better enable those who young people trust and confide in to help; training programmes for professionals who work with and support young people. The aim would be to improve awareness and understanding of the mental health challenges faced by young people from different backgrounds, including neurodiverse people, those with a disability, members of the LGBTQ+ community, those in poverty, those living in rural areas, and young people of different ethnicities. Finally, we called for better support for young people at an earlier stage to lower the demand on child and adolescent mental health services.Since the report launch, members of the committee have been involved in opportunities to speak up on the issue, including at events such as Wonderfest with Platfform at Glamorgan cricket ground.\" said by Harriet Wright-Nicholas\n\"I would like to finish by thanking the Deputy Minister for her written response to the report and her offer to work with the Welsh Youth Parliament over the coming months. We are currently in the process of arranging a meeting with the Deputy Minister. Following this meeting, we look forward to seeing some if not all of our recommendations put into effect by Welsh Government. Thank you very much.

Now, on behalf of the climate and environment committee, Harrison Williams.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Harrison Williams, representing the Boys and Girls Clubs of Wales. Harrison.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Good afternoon. My name is Harrison Williams and I represent the Boys and Girls Clubs of Wales. Today I\u2019ll be providing an update on the work of the climate and environment committee. During our meeting here in November, as a committee, we met to help decide whether we wanted to focus on biodiversity, public transport or school and education campaigns. After some very informative presentations and discussions with experts on these issues, we ultimately decided to direct our focus on the area of public transport and sustainable travel. As a committee, we came to this decision due to the issues presented to us, such as the use, reliability and cost of public transport in Wales, as well as our desire to encourage more people to travel sustainably.Our consultation looks at the barriers to public transport and active travel presented to young people, and looks at what more can be done to travel sustainably. The consultation is being undertaken through our Sustainable Ways survey, which has gathered over 1,000 responses through promotion in schools, youth groups and events such as the Urdd Eisteddfod. The survey will be live until the end of July. Early findings suggest that the cost of public transport is a major factor for young people when deciding to use public transport, with those in rural areas highlighting issues in the reliability and frequency of it. The committee\u2019s been particularly keen in understanding these experiences in more rural and poorer areas, which is why we have held focus group events and spoken to young people in our local areas to understand the challenges they face. Furthermore, the survey has shown that there has been an increase in car and walking trips since the pandemic.As well as the survey, public engagement events have played an excellent role in raising awareness of the benefits of sustainable travel and letting young people express their opinion on the topic through interactive activity stalls and engaging guest speakers. We recently held events in Blaenau Ffestiniog and, more locally for me, in Pontypridd, which were well attended. We will be at the Royal Welsh Show next month, and we invite anyone interested to come and have their say.The environment committee report will be published in the autumn term, where we will be able to relay our full findings. This will enable us to work together to tackle the current issues of public transport and to continue to raise awareness of sustainable travel.To finish, having green travel systems is an essential part of a sustainable future. By reducing our carbon footprint, promoting healthier living, saving money and reducing traffic congestion, we can build a better future not just for ourselves, but for future generations, and, together, we must work to make green travel options more accessible and convenient for everyone. Diolch. [<em>Applause</em>.]\" said by Harrison Williams\n\"Thank you, all, for those updates on behalf of the various Youth Parliament committees. We will now hear brief responses from the First Minister, the party leaders, and also the Chair of the Children, Young People and Education Committee. So, first of all, the First Minister, Mark Drakeford.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Llywydd, good afternoon and thank you very much. I'd like to start by congratulating all Members of the Youth Parliament on being elected. Last week, I met with somebody who had been a Member of the first Youth Parliament here in Wales. He told me that the experience had changed his life, and I hope that the time that you give and the commitment that you've shown will be rewarded in a similar fashion. The work that you've already done reflects the main concerns of young people in Wales today. Thank you for the reports on education and the curriculum. The recommendations in your work on mental health and well-being will be very influential across the Welsh Government. The current survey, which investigates the climate and the environment, will ensure that the challenging voice of young people on the most serious subjects of the day will be heard clearly and effectively in the work of the Senedd.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Thank you, all, for joining us today. You can be sure that you have the whole support of the Senedd in the important work that you will carry out not simply on behalf of young people in Wales, but on behalf of Wales as a whole. Diolch yn fawr.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Diolch yn fawr. No, you don't need to clap the First Minister or the leaders of your respective parties, if you don't mind. Nice try, Hefin David, but no thank you. [<em>Laughter</em>.]\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"The leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew R.T.

[<em>Laughter</em>.]It's a real pleasure to be here for the second occasion that this current Youth Parliament has come together in the Oriel, in the Senedd Chamber, to obviously meet with MSs. I've had the pleasure of meeting various youth parliamentarians\u2014I look at Ruben across the desk there who, whilst not of my political party, by the logos he puts on social media, has really genuinely engaged with politicians across this Chamber, whether they be Labour politicians, Plaid Cymru, or ourselves, bringing us into the schools to meet students at Llanishen High School, and I'm sure that's gone on right across the Youth Parliament, and obviously opened the doors to many people to see what actually the Welsh Parliament does and the responsibilities that we have, and that hopefully you will obviously be able to inform with the reports that you've done.It's so heartening to hear the work that you've done in particular around the school day, and around mental health in particular. Today, in the <em>The Daily Telegraph</em>, for example, there's a report, as we come out of the COVID pandemic, around eating disorders and how that's affecting young people and the help and support that's required to be put in place there. What better people to inform the measures that need to be put in place than young people themselves? And then, also, reflecting on the school day and the changes that I know the Government are talking about bringing forward, it's heartening to see that dialogue between the Government bench and the youth parliamentarians in the work that you've done.So, I wish you well and continued success in your work. I understand that you have another six months of work until this term comes to an end\u2014I think I'm right in saying that, Presiding Officer, 2023\u2014and, from your initial presentations, you've indicated, obviously, that there'll be reports coming forward in the autumn. I, certainly, and, I know, my colleagues on the Conservative benches have enjoyed working with fellow youth parliamentarians, and we look forward to continuing that work and the support. Hopefully, it'll open the door to many of you coming forward and putting yourself forward at election time, to be considered by the electorate more generally, irrespective of whatever party that is, because democracy flourishes when people do stand for election and offer that choice, that broad choice to the electorate, so that their voices can be heard.

{"content": "\"We'll now move to the second item. We are today starting our scrutiny work on Stage 1 of the Infrastructure (Wales) Bill, which was introduced to the Senedd by the Minister for Climate Change on 12 June. To inform our scrutiny, we have issued a call for written evidence, the details of which can be found on the Senedd website. So, anyone can submit evidence if they want to put forward their opinion, and the closing date for that is 11 August. And we will continue our scrutiny through the autumn when we will have a series of evidence sessions with stakeholders. But we start today with the Minister and her officials, who are here in person for the introductory session.&nbsp;So, welcome to Julie James, the Minister for Climate Change. With her is Neil Hemington, the chief planner, Owen Struthers, head of national consent, and Nicholas Webb, who is a lawyer with the Welsh Government. Welcome to all of you. We do have a bit of time to tackle this Bill, so I'm sure we'll use that time that is available in full. I'll just start, if I may, by asking the Minister: the Bill has been published without a statement of policy intent; do you intend to publish something similar to that at some point?\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"You're testing my Welsh now.&nbsp;\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Okay, yes, I'm testing your Welsh.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"The Bill has been published without a statement of policy intent, so we wanted to know do you intend to publish something similar at some point, and, if so, when are we likely to see such a statement.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Diolch, Cadeirydd. We've been preparing for a very long time this very large and very technical Bill and the explanatory memorandum for introduction to the Senedd. It's been a long time coming, so my thanks to the team of people who've been doing all of that work. I do understand why the committee wants to see a statement of policy intent, though, and we'll probably be providing them shortly after the summer recess.&nbsp;\" said by Julie James AM\n\"So, they will be available during our period of scrutiny of the Bill. Okay. That's useful. Diolch yn fawr.&nbsp;The Bill, as we know, establishes a new unified consenting regime, replacing a number of different existing processes. It's been long acknowledged that this needed to happen, so I'm just wondering why is it only now that this is coming forward, because, clearly, you and others have been saying that the current system isn't what it maybe could or should be for many years.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"It's just about the resource available and the number of experts that we need for this particular Bill whose expertise was also required for a number of other things, like the European Union exit arrangements, and so on. And in the end, we've only got so many experts. This is a very technical Bill. This isn't something that you can have a series of excellent although generalist civil servants looking at. So, we have to have people with the correct level of detail and skill. So, Chair, it is what it is, really; we're very delighted to have got it here now. We would have much preferred to have had it in earlier because of all the issues that we face, but, as I say, the best time was 20 years ago and the next best time is now.&nbsp;\" said by Julie James AM\n\"And conversely, then, what would you say the risks would be if we weren't to move in this direction at this current time?&nbsp;\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"I think there's a real serious risk of developers just going somewhere else, because if we can't speed up the system, then it takes a lot of time and effort to get particular things in place. The committee may well be thinking of a renewable developer, for example, but, actually, these are things like flood defence schemes, and so on. So, we need contractors who want to come in and do the very best work they can. It's harder to tender for those kinds of schemes if you've got to have a series of consents beforehand, and so on. And frankly, it takes an enormous amount of resource to administer the current system, and so actually this is very much an invest-to-save type arrangement as well. We think it will also provide better protections in the environmental sphere, because it's a more comprehensive procedure that will allow us to address everything in the one hit. So I think really, all round, this is something that is very much needed.&nbsp;\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Clearly, we'll come on later, I'm sure, to striking that balance between doing things efficiently\u2014quickly, if you like, or effectively\u2014but also responsibly, and that's a balance I know that the Government is keen to strike.Can I just ask, on a general level again, then, before we move on to some specifics, how will the Bill engage human rights? Because obviously there are issues, potentially, around giving certain groups and individuals rights to do things, and ask for things. Could you just tell us a little bit about the balance that's being struck there, and whether you considered other options that maybe had lesser impacts on human rights?\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"As always when we look at human rights, we look to see whether what we're doing is proportionate, justified and reasonable. It's the same mantra every time\u2014whether we've got the balance of rights right between individual rights and the public interest. So, there's a series of things to look at with this particular Bill: interference with property rights, for example; making sure that individuals have an opportunity to challenge measures that might interfere with their rights, or their particular property rights. We're very clear that this is a very good balance between particular rights and the public interest. In fact, actually, one of the things I very much like about this new system is it gives communities more involvement and more opportunity to be heard. So, while that's not strictly a human rights issue, it covers the general area, which I'm very pleased about.&nbsp;\" said by Julie James AM\n\"And we'll be coming on to that in greater detail in a moment. Thank you, Minister. Huw.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Diolch, Gadeirydd. Good morning, Minister. I want to turn to the issue of consultation. One of the fascinating things with this\u2014. In response to the Chair now you've already said that the ideal time for doing this may have been some years back. Here we are now today, but of course the consultation took place in 2018. There were a great number of responses, but time has passed. But let me stick with the consultation first of all. As a result of the original consultation, what do you feel have been the main changes to the Bill as now presented, because of that 2018 consultation?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"The vast majority of people who responded were very much in support of the proposals, and effectively saying how we started this meeting, which is, 'Why not just get on with it?' So, they weren't looking for changes so much as speed, really. Some of the comments were very detailed, and aren't on the face of the Bill\u2014they will be set out in the regulations that follow, as you'd expect. There was a review of compulsory purchase powers as a direct result of the consultation. That's actually an ongoing conversation with the UK Government, which the committee might want to get into. We took account of those comments, but the vast majority of the respondents were just saying, 'Goodness me, get on with it'.&nbsp;\" said by Julie James AM\n\"As it is five years ago, let's move on, then, to subsequent discussions that you and your team have had, resources allowing. Because we understand from the explanatory memorandum that organisations such as Natural Resources Wales, Planning and Environment Decisions Wales and&nbsp;National Grid have been consulted since the consultation in 2018 on particular aspects, so there are clearly areas you wanted to get into in more depth. So, can you set out a little bit more detail about what you've been discussing, the work that's taken place since that consultation? Perhaps there are things such as technology, but also what were the other views of stakeholders that they wanted to see refined as you brought this forward?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"I'll defer to Neil in a moment, but just to say, Huw, what we've been trying to do is to make sure that the Bill is sufficiently flexible to be futureproof. Much of the discussion that you're talking about there has been not really to shape the Bill any further, but to make sure that it is capable of being sufficient in the face of a widget nobody has ever heard of yet suddenly coming over the horizon and being something that everybody wants to deploy. So we've had a lot of discussions with people around the flexibility of the Bill.We've also done a number of other things that are tangential but impact the Bill. The committee will be aware that we did an end-to-end review of marine licensing, for example, which has obviously played into this, and there have been discussions with Planning and Environment Decisions Wales, or the planning inspectorate as it's colloquially still known, around this,&nbsp;to talk about technical aspects&nbsp;of some parts of the Bill, about how they interact with it. And we have had some discussion with local planning authorities, as you'd expect, and with NRW about the interaction of it. But it's more about the implementation, I guess, rather than the detail. But Neil and the team have been very involved in those discussions.&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Julie James AM\n\"As the Minister described, yes, we did a formal consultation exercise, and we believe that the fundamental components of that still stand. However, what we had sought to do is co-design the Bill as we worked through it. Obviously, we have got some bodies that have a particular role in relation to the potential legislation, so we have worked very closely with NRW, particularly as we are talking about taking forward some consents that NRW would be responsible for. So, we've worked with them on the Bill.&nbsp;We need to carry on working with them, and we are working with them, as we start to map out the statements of policy intent and the subordinate legislation that will come.Similarly, with Planning and Environment Decisions Wales, as the likely operator of the system, they have a wealth of knowledge around how things that are on the page will actually work in practice. So, we have worked with them as well, very closely. So, we have gone through that process. We have also worked quite closely with some of the representative bodies for the agents that will be submitting these sorts of applications. So, this is a particular group of agents that specialise in this sort of of work. We have also spoken to them. So, the process isn't a once-and-for-all 'we consult and we legislate'. We have got a much more co-production-type approach because we want a process that is going to work for everybody at the end of the day.\" said by Neil Hemington\n\"It sounds as though the time hasn't been wasted, even though\u2014as you said, Minister\u2014it would have been good to have got here earlier. The discussions have continued, and you flagged, Minister, that this Bill is designing in the flexibility, which is an interesting thing. Sorry, with a different hat on, as Chair of LJC, I bring up the flexibility, and there might be further discussions on that. But you certainly haven't wasted your time here. One of the things picked up in the EM is the interesting issue of the consenting of overhead and electrical power lines. So, what can you tell us about the interesting discussions that you have been having on that?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"I seem to spend half my life in meetings with people about grids, overhead lines, et cetera. The officials have met a number of times with National Grid and Scottish Power as well, and that's around the consenting regime for them, and the general network improvements that we have been looking for.I also have several hats on, Chair, I'm afraid. Obviously, with one of my other hats on I am very keen indeed to get grid better deployed across Wales, and with some alacrity. So, I'm very keen indeed, with my other hat on, to ensure that we have a consenting regime that is fit for purpose, but has all the right community involvement as well. The last thing that we want is community alienation, if you like, from those kinds of developments. So, I'm very keen indeed to make sure that this Bill does what it's supposed to do, which is have the community involvement, but also streamlines the process. But Neil can tell you a great deal more about the specifics of the discussion.&nbsp;\" said by Julie James AM\n\"I think that it is probably fair to say that this is a complex area when it comes to how electricity lines are permitted/consented. What we are essentially dealing with here are electricity lines up to 132 kV, associated with a devolved generating station. So, you have got a generation station at one end of this.When we spoke to National Grid and SP Energy Networks, the main issues that they raised were actually issues that this Bill cannot address. They raised issues around the existing reinforcement of gridlines that we have now, which we know need to be reinforced but which unfortunately don\u2019t fit within devolved competence.They also had some concerns about how any rights that we give as part of the consent could be passed on to them. So, if a developer gets consent, how can that then be relayed on. We have reassured them that the process that we set up here allows that to happen.So, I think that the main message from this is that this is a very complex area. We have simplified as far as we can within our competence here. But there is an awful lot of work going on in other areas to look at the grid that we need in Wales going forward.\" said by Neil Hemington\n\"That's helpful. I think that you have made it clear that getting that balance right between the ability to engage and consult with communities who would be affected, but also not inhibiting the ability to facilitate infrastructure development, is what you're seeking to do. This is a live and interesting issue, clearly.&nbsp;Can I just turn to another aspect of the original consultation, which was that the majority of respondents agreed that the Welsh national marine plan, Future Wales and topic-based policy statements should provide the policy basis for determining infrastructure development, but they also suggested that more consideration should be given to the role of local development plans. So, has the role of LDPs been strengthened as a result of the consultation? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"This is very complicated as well, because this, of course, covers marine, as well as land-based issues. We've had a long discussion with local authorities about this, and, again, Neil and colleagues have been 'embroiled'\u2014I think is the word\u2014in discussions with local government colleagues for a very long time on this and a number of other related matters. So, the way it will happen is the applicants may go to the local planning authority first to request pre-application services and so on, and they will be required to provide those services, but that's the case now\u2014right?&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Right.&nbsp;\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"And then, because this will capture developments for marine as well, it's much more complicated than that. So, they'll be required to put in a local impact report and that can be put in by any relevant community councils as well, if they want to do so, and that's supposed to highlight an impact that a proposed development might have on a very local area, and that will be to ensure that the voice is heard. But obviously, if you're talking about consenting an offshore development, then, that's a wholly different kettle of fish, although it's possible that the shoreline local authority might have a view or the shoreline community council might have a view, and that would be enabled by the Act. We also think that\u2014.We expect this, let's be clear, to lighten the burden on local authorities, but there will be a moment where it beds in, won't there? But we expect this to streamline some of the things that normally happen. So, if you think about the way that\u2014the one I always use, forgive me, Neil; he's got bored of me saying the same one over and over again\u2014but if you think about a flood defence, at the moment, you might need to have the Highways Act 1980 stuff, you might need to have harbour authority stuff, you might need to have a marine licence, you might need to have planning consent for the works, you might need to have\u2014. So, for all of those, there would be separate applications done sequentially and the local authority would be involved in responding to all of those, whereas, now, it would be a single process with one impact report. So, it definitely does streamline it for them.&nbsp;\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Chair, just one final comment that you might want to come back to, when you prefaced your remarks by saying that this is another area of complexity and so on, are you confident that what will come through as a result of this Bill and the implementation of it will make this process simpler and more streamlined, whilst also allowing local authorities and community councils and other organisations, Pembrokeshire national park and so on, to have an input into the process as well\u2014complexity streamlining?&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by ", "answer": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM"}
{"content": "\"Good afternoon and welcome, all, to this Plenary meeting. The first item this afternoon is questions to the Minister for Climate Change, and the first question is from Jane Dodds.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"1. Will the Minister provide an update on the next iteration of the Warm Homes programme? OQ59427\" said by Jane Dodds MS\n\"Thank you, Jane. The underpinning policy for the new scheme was discussed at Cabinet on 24 April and will be published shortly, and I will also be publishing the tender specification for the procurement of a new, demand-led scheme.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Thank you so much. Diolch yn fawr iawn. It's good to hear that there will be a new scheme coming soon. It would be good, too, if you could just clarify what the timescales may be, if you know that. We've highlighted, as you know, on the basis of completion rates in 2016-17, that it would take 111 years to insulate every fuel-poor household in Wales, so we really can't wait. Also, it would be good to hear from you as well around your view of the Warm Homes programme. I understand that you might have said to the Climate Change, Environment and Infrastructure Committee that the Warm Homes programme will make no difference at all to the households currently in fuel poverty. So, it would be good to have some clarity on that, if you don't mind. It's good to hear that you're moving forward, and it would be great to have a timescale, please, given that we know that this is really important for those fuel-poor homes. Would you also consider a green homes Act, reducing energy bills, reducing demand on the grid, and driving investment in warm, sustainable homes? Thank you. Diolch yn fawr iawn.\" said by Jane Dodds MS\n\"Thank you, Jane. I think the point I was making to the committee was that this scheme doesn't cover all households\u2014not that it won't affect fuel poverty. It's important to remember that this is a scheme that's aimed at owner-occupiers; we have other schemes for other tenures. There is a different scheme for social tenants, for example. So, I think that that's the point I was making\u2014that it won't cover all households in fuel poverty.The idea of the new scheme is to begin the process of tackling both the climate emergency and fuel poverty together. So, we will be moving away from an automatic assumption that the replacement of an inefficient gas boiler with a new gas boiler is the way to go, but we have to do that\u2014and I will publish the policy process behind it\u2014in a proportionate way, and guarding against making fuel poverty worse. Because, in some instances, if you swapped a house that was on a gas boiler to an electric source of heat, their bill might go up. So, it's a very careful judgment. So, what we're looking to do is a balance between those two things, so that if you have a gas boiler that's capable of a repair that would make it much more efficient, we will do that, but if it needs complete replacement, then we will look to have a whole-fabric approach to the house, to replace it with a heating system that doesn't contribute to the climate emergency. There'll be a balance to be drawn. And it's a difficult one, so we need to transition to that new scheme smoothly. We want to continue the scheme for fuel-poor households\u2014that's who it's targeted at. We will also develop other schemes for households who aren't perhaps absolutely in fuel poverty but who live in very inefficient homes, with plenty of carbon footprint, but who might not meet the definition of fuel poverty. And fuel poverty is a difficult one, isn't it? Somebody can be in fuel poverty and have quite a decent income, but they might be spending 65 per cent of that decent income on fuel, and that will put them into that definition. So, it's quite a difficult judgment all the way through. We'll extend the current Nest contract in the meantime, so that there isn't a gap, so we still can help everyone. But I do want to get this next one right, because it will run for many years, and so we want to get that just right. So, I will publish that, Llywydd, and I will expect Members to be able to comment on it when I have.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Minister, whilst I agree with Jane that we urgently need the new Warm Homes programme in place, I'd also urge the Minister to ensure that the next iteration is fit for purpose. My constituents suffered greatly under the Arbed 1 scheme. Residents in Caerau, near Maesteg, had their homes made virtually uninhabitable due to faulty insulation\u2014insulation totally unsuitable for the properties, and funded via the Warm Homes programme. Work was undertaken by a company owned by a Bridgend County Borough Council cabinet member, and, thanks to an internal audit, it was found that no procurement process was followed and no due diligence checks were carried out. The Auditor General for Wales said that, overall, contract management arrangements needed to be strengthened in any future schemes. This includes closer monitoring of the contract compliance, addressing significant variations of costs charged for supplying and fitting the same energy efficiency measures, and improving management information. Minister, how will you ensure that the next iteration of the Warm Homes scheme is not open to fraud and corruption and will not leave recipients' homes in a worse state?\" said by Altaf Hussain MS\n\"Thank you. We are absolutely aware that, for some people, what was done during some of the other schemes, including UK Government schemes, was not right. And one of the real big lessons to be learnt is that one size does not fit all. So, many, many thousands of homes were helped during those programmes, but for those for whom the wrong thing was done, then that has had poor consequences, and we've put an amount of money aside to try and fix that, including UK Government schemes that also suffered from that. I just don't want to give people across Wales the wrong impression, because for some of the schemes that the UK Government ran, we're not able to step into that. I know a number of Members have brought that up with me, and we have been able to fix some of the others.&nbsp;We very much want to learn the lessons of that, so this is not a one-size-fits-all approach. It's why the policy needs to be nuanced, and it's why the policy needs to evolve from where we were. So, we need to tackle the climate emergency at the same time as making sure that people have as affordable a bill as we can manage. The energy crisis really hasn't helped that. So, I can assure you that we will be learning lessons from the way that we've done it in the past, and that's why we're being very careful with this process. And, as I said, in the meantime, we've extended the current Nest contract so that there will be no gap in provision. I also don't want to give people the impression that there hasn't been provision in place. We had two programmes running. We've only got one programme at the moment; we'll then put another demand-led programme in place.&nbsp;\" said by Julie James AM\n\"The Net Zero Wales plan was published 18 months ago, so I'm concerned that the decarbonisation implementation group is only now looking at strategic themes. When will you be able to provide clarity to people who are renting privately, or asset-rich and income poor, privately owning their houses, in cold homes they can't afford to heat, and what help they might be able to get from the next iteration of the Warm Homes programme?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"This programme is not designed to help people in the private rented sector; there are other programmes designed to do that, not least Leasing Scheme Wales. So, any landlord that has a real problem getting their property up to spec really needs to look at Leasing Scheme Wales in order to get the assistance of the Government to bring that home up to spec. We have been liaising with the UK Government about their energy performance certificate E rating for the PRS. We're very concerned that, without a grant programme to go with it, we might drive some landlords from the market, particularly, Jenny, in your constituency, where there are larger homes with multigenerational families living in them, and they tend to not meet the EPC E&nbsp;rating. So, it's important that we cover off the bases.&nbsp;Vaughan Gething and I have recently announced some work with the Development Bank for Wales to put in place a loan\u2014possibly a grant loan scheme\u2014for people who don't meet the income criteria for this iteration of the Warm Homes programme. We will be bringing that forward. It is important to have a range of different measures in place, not a one-size-fits-all. And you'll have all heard me talking many times about the roll-out of the optimised retrofit programme. We're about to roll out that into a hub, which will give people the right advice on how to decarbonise their home, how to get the right advice to do it and how to get the maximum benefit out of it. So, I don't want you to think that nothing's been happening; quite a lot's been happening. But there's no doubt at all that the Government cannot afford to decarbonise all of the homes in Wales by itself, so we must find ways to lever in private sector investment, including the investment that individuals make in their own homes.&nbsp;\" said by Julie James AM\n\"2. What discussions has the Minister had with businesses about the upcoming roll-out of 20 mph speed limits?&nbsp; OQ59426\" said by Natasha Asghar MS\n\"Thank you. The Wales 20 mph taskforce group set out the recommendations that the Welsh Government should take forward for the implementation of 20 mph on residential streets and busy pedestrian areas, and I was pleased that the Conservatives supported that at the time. Organisations representing businesses were invited to participate, and officials have continued to engage with them.&nbsp;\" said by Lee Waters AM\n\"Thank you for that answer, Deputy Minister. More often than not, the roll-out of 20 mph speed limits is a hot topic of conversation, especially when I meet businesses and residents in my region, whether that is because of the obscene amounts of cash being spent on it or because they realise that a blanket roll-out is indeed ridiculous, especially all across Wales. I spoke with one major business in my region recently and they are very concerned about the impact that 20 mph will have on their trade. At the moment, they make hundreds of deliveries every day, but with this Labour Government actively slowing Wales down, their ability to make so many deliveries could indeed be significantly hampered. And, of course, we already know that this 20 mph scheme will cost the Welsh economy \u00a34.5 billion. So, Deputy Minister, what would you say to those businesses who fear that your 20 mph pet project will have a hugely detrimental impact on them, going forward?\" said by Natasha Asghar MS\n\"It's disappointing that the Member keeps repeating falsehoods, even though she knows they are falsehoods. I think it does a disservice to all of us when this kind of inflammatory approach is taken. I'd hoped that she would be better than that, but I'm still awaiting the evidence. To say that an obscene amount of cash has been spent, we have published academic studies showing that the cost of implementation will be repaid threefold in the first year alone from savings to the NHS, from a reduction in serious casualties and deaths on the road. Every year in Wales, 80 people die in road accidents; half of those on roads where the speed limit is 30 mph. We've seen from experience and evidence in Edinburgh that there's been a 25 per cent reduction in casualties as a result of the 20 mph. And this is a policy being pursued by Conservative local government in England too. So, she does a disservice to a serious issue to try and reduce it to these kinds of cheap headlines.It's also factually inaccurate to say that this is a blanket policy. It's not a blanket policy. We are changing the default speed limit on regulated roads from 30 mph to 20 mph. Local highway authorities have the legal ability to change them back where there is a good case. So, there's no blanket ban. And as you'd have seen if you'd taken the trouble to look at the detail of this, rather than just looking for a headline, you'd have seen that a number of local authorities are planning exceptions in their areas, proving once again that it's not a blanket ban.As for the cost to the economy, the figures that we were obliged to produce by the Treasury Green Book are heavily discredited and academically disputed. They don't take into account the significant benefits to the economy from the figures I've just mentioned on road casualty reductions, and my experience of speaking to business, of which I've done a fair bit, is that views are mixed. I've certainly had conversations these last few days with small businesses who are very concerned about the impact it'll have on their businesses, and I understand the anxiety, and I've spoken to larger businesses who are very relaxed about the policy. So, I think that we need to approach this in a pragmatic way, working closely with communities and local government, and with businesses, and I hope that we will see the hysteria that the Conservatives are determined to generate, even though they supported this at the first stage vote in this Senedd\u2014. They've sniffed an opportunity to stir up trouble, and that's all they ever do.\" said by Lee Waters AM\n\"Minister, I'm very supportive, as I know so many are in Wales, of the 20 mph policy, which is, as you say, so positive for road safety and allowing communities and neighbourhoods to reclaim their streets. The pilots, I think, are very useful in allowing for possible tweaking once the experience of the pilots has worked through.Minister, could you say a little bit in terms of the roll-out and how it will link with other very important policies that are of a similar nature, such as active travel, such as safe play streets, and such as the urban walking routes that are increasingly being worked up here in Wales, to allow people to get the benefits of exercise and being more familiar with our local environment?\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Thank you very much. I once again pay tribute to John Griffiths in his role in campaigning for this policy over many years before it became more widely supported in this Chamber. John was among a small number of others who made the case for this. And, in fact, the first meeting I had on being appointed a Minister four years ago was with John and Rod King from the 20's Plenty for Us campaign\u2014others in the Chamber have met him and some have even had their photos taken with him, although they seem to be suffering from short-term memory loss. That was instrumental, really, in setting us on the path of a default approach, rather than just extending the zones. I think that default approach, the trials are suggesting, is the right way to go.He mentioned the way that exceptions have been used in Caldicot, for example, in one of the pilots where, sensibly, through real-life experience, the scheme was changed. That was the whole point of piloting it. And what we've seen consistent in the data coming through from the pilots is an increase in walking and cycling. So, that's where the main air quality benefits come from. The air quality evidence is somewhat mixed, but what is a very clear benefit is that a more friendly environment for pedestrians and for cyclists is encouraging more people to cycle and walk, and that is producing a meaningful modal shift. Interestingly, the project we're doing with Living Streets in primary schools\u2014the WOW tracker\u2014to try to encourage more children to walk to school, in those areas it's operating with a 20 mph zone, we're seeing significantly more uptake from children willing to leave the car at home and to walk to school.He also mentioned the safe streets initiative, which is something that we've been rolling out. Some great work has been done in Newport on piloting that approach. I'm sure we all know, in this Chamber, from our constituency experience, that it's an issue in almost every school, and primary schools in particular, around parking by parents in the mornings, and this is a really exciting project to try and address that, and we're rolling that out gradually. It's all part of a package; it's a coherent vision for a more civilised and safe local neighbourhood as part of our broader efforts to tackle climate change.\" said by Lee Waters AM\n\"Can I commend the Minister for taking forward this policy, but also many of our local authorities, who are indeed taking it forward in a very considered, pragmatic way as they look at moving to a default of 20 mph? They are in open public consultation, and I've been through every map in my constituency to look at it. It's very sensible, and some of the suggestions of where there should be exemptions seem like sensible ones. But would he join me in encouraging not only local residents, but also businesses to get involved in those consultations right across Wales\u2014in Bridgend, RCT and elsewhere\u2014and to put their views in? Would he agree with me also that the evidence internationally shows that, where you actually put this in place\u2014yes, it's a bit of a mind change, it's a bit of a culture change\u2014the effects on communities, on people, are manifold, and people rapidly say, 'What was all the fuss about?'\" said by ", "answer": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM"}
{"content": "\"So, with no further ado, I'd like to welcome our witnesses today: Peter Tutton from StepChange, Luke Young from Citizens Advice, and Steffan Evans from the Bevan Foundation. Welcome to you. Thank you very much, StepChange and Citizens Advice, for your written evidence. I'm just about to find my script, which is here. Could you just briefly summarise\u2014? Sorry, Sioned, did you want to\u2014?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Sorry, Chair. I'm also a member of the Bevan Foundation.\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"Okay. Sorry, apologies I didn't see you earlier.So, if you could briefly just tell us what the latest impact of the cost-of-living pressures are, highlighting any particular groups that you think are worst affected. I know this is included in your written evidence, but I think it's really a question of reflecting on how things have changed in the last 12 months or so. I don't know whether, Peter Tutton, you'd like to go first, just as you're online. Welcome, Peter Tutton, of StepChange.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you, Chair, and thank you, committee, for inviting me. It's a pleasure to be here. Apologies I can't be with you in person and I'm dialling in. But, thanks for having me. I'll see what I can do to help you.So, what's happened? It's been a bit funny over the last year. So, certainly, we can see that the cost-of-living increases are having an impact. So, we started recording towards the end of last year the proportion of clients saying that the cost-of-living increases were significant, and that was about 9 per cent if you go back to the end of 2021. We're up to sort of 22 per cent and rising now. So, clearly, more and more people are being drawn to debt advice specifically because of the cost of living.In terms of who we're seeing, generally speaking it's a continuity from both COVID and also the decade before that debt is still largely about people who have less financial resilience, people who are on lower incomes, disproportionately people like single parents, women in general are disproportionate in our client loads, people with responsibility for children, and renters in particular. So, about two thirds of our clients are renters, which is almost the other way around to the overall tenure occupancy. And, particularly, private sector tenants have become increasingly prominent in our case loads over the last decade, but that seems to be accelerating a bit with the cost-of-living crisis.In addition, over half our clients\u2014. It's a regulatory requirement for us, as we're regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, to look and see whether our clients have additional needs because of vulnerable circumstances, and over half our clients fit into that category. That typically means people who are experiencing some degree of mental ill health or physical ill health or physical disabilities.So, debt is really about at the moment, and has been largely about, people on low incomes, maybe more distant from the labour market, low financial resilience, not much in the way of assets to fall back on, and perhaps extra living costs like childcare and so on, and now, of course, things like fuel costs as well.That all said, one of the things that we have seen over the past year is we're starting to see an increase in households who haven't necessarily had financial difficulties before. So, with many of the people we see, those financial difficulties can repeat because the underlying income vulnerabilities and financial resilience vulnerabilities don't change. But, we're seeing more people, which is one of the things we saw with COVID, who hadn't been in this situation before. Over half our clients are in some form of employment\u2014many of them are low income whilst being in employment\u2014and about 40 per cent are in full-time employment, and that's grown a bit, and the cost of living is certainly putting more people who are higher up the income scale under pressure. So, one of the things we've seen with our existing clients on debt solutions, who are paying their debts over a period of time, over the year we've seen quite a lot of those people having to reduce those payments or ask for payment holidays because of the cost of living. But, at the same time, we're seeing new people come in who actually have got more money. So, in a sense, the cost of living is doing two things. It's pushing people who are already vulnerable to debt further into a place where they're more likely to be negative-budget clients, who are really going to struggle to keep up with the essentials and, perhaps even after debt advice, struggle to keep up with the essentials. But, also, it's pushing up-the-income-scale people who are vulnerable to debt and it's bringing households that, before the cost-of-living crisis, as you might expect, were not vulnerable to debt and did not need debt advice, to debt advice.What we're not seeing over 2021 is a huge spike yet in debt advice demand. So, I think we said last time I gave evidence to you, about COVID, that one of the oddities of COVID was that debt advice demand actually dropped, for a number of reasons that we understand better now than we did then. We have seen a steady increase in debt advice demand over 2022, and certainly in early January this year we've had some high numbers. So, we had days in January that were higher than any day last year in client demand.So, we're not yet seeing the explosive increase in client demand that we saw, for instance, in 2008-09 following that recession, but, typically, there is a lag between people falling into difficulty and seeking debt advice. So, about half our clients say that they've been struggling with their debts and worrying about their finances for a year or more before seeking debt advice. There are a number of barriers to people seeking help, and there are a number of ways that people try and manage their financial difficulties before coming to debt advice, most worryingly by juggling bills and borrowing, which can make the harm of debt worse when they actually do come to debt advice in the end.\" said by Peter Tutton\n\"Thank you for that comprehensive reply. I don't want you to repeat the same information, but I think what it would be useful to know is really what impact it's having on debt levels, because, as Mr Tutton said, if people are borrowing money, then we're into a very dangerous situation that it's very difficult to emerge from. Steffan, do you want to go first?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Yes, thanks. So, we've got some brand new data I can share with you today. So, the reason we didn't share written evidence was that we had a poll go to the field two weeks ago today, with YouGov. So, we had the results through last Friday, and we're launching the report on Thursday, so we'll share a written copy with you once that's written up. But I've taken the time to go through the data on debt, and what we're seeing maybe feeds into what Peter was saying there that the headline levels of debt, actually, seem pretty stable in terms of the proportion of people who are reporting back they're in debt. So, this is the third survey in a row. So, there was one towards the tail end of 2021, one in summer 2022, and then this one where, in terms of the proportion of people saying that they're in debt, it hasn't really changed much in our survey. So, 13 per cent of people were saying that they were in more than one month\u2019s worth of arrears, and 28 per cent of people were saying that they'd borrowed money over the last three months to manage the cost of living. So, that does suggest maybe that those extra payments we've seen, that extra support, has stabilised in terms of the sheer number of people. But, of course, what that doesn't tell us is that, for those in debt, has the nature of that debt changed. Have they gone deeper into debt, et cetera?What we do know from it and what we've been breaking down is that there are groups that are at far, far greater risk of living in debt\u2014many of the ones that Peter\u2019s already mentioned. I think one that really jumped out at me was that over half of people on universal credit borrowed money at some point in the last three months. That was one of the things that came out of the survey. And, interestingly, 10 per cent of people on universal credit reported that they\u2019d had a loan from the Government\u2014so, a kind of budget advance, or something like that. They're quite unique in terms of that being a source of debt as well. Although, of course, friends and family, credit cards, et cetera, are bigger sources. In terms of the other groups, renters and disabled people feature very, very prominently, and households with children. And we definitely do see a skewing towards younger working adults. So, adults under 50 seem to be more likely, in our survey responses, to report that they've either fallen behind on a bill, or that they've borrowed money, than adults over 50. So, that's kind of a headline finding.Carers as well are a group that we've got some data on for the first time, and, again, they seem to be, perhaps unsurprisingly, a group that's more likely to fall into debt. So, that link between groups that were most likely to live in poverty, most likely to struggle with debt before, are absolutely the groups of people where we're seeing huge proportions of them reporting that they're in debt.&nbsp;\" said by Dr Steffan Evans\n\"Thank you. We'll come back to the detail on this in a moment. So, the Citizens Advice graph, which tells more than 1,000 words, really highlights the impact of the removal of some of the Welsh Government support. So, I wondered if you could just briefly summarise how you think that is going to impact on the sort of work your organisation is doing, Luke Young.&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Of course, Chair. As Members will have seen the graph, which does tell the story, we are in a situation where the choices that the Welsh Government made last winter and this winter have better protected people in Wales this winter. The UK Government and Welsh Government support have helped a large group of people with direct funding and direct payments over the last few months. For lots of those groups who were eligible, that has kept them afloat this winter. We're now looking, though, at a situation where the Wales fuel support scheme will not be in the next budget, and UK Government support will reduce alongside the energy guarantee, alongside rising prices.&nbsp;And so, what our modelling shows is that we see rising expenses on households and not enough income to cover it. One of the key things we've seen in the last year, just to add to the conversation around debt, is that the average energy debt for Citizens Advice clients in Wales rose last year from \u00a31,114 to \u00a31,419. Now, some of that extra pressure on those particular households will have been covered by Government support, but, with everything else, as both my colleagues have said, things are going in the wrong direction. And so, we worry that, in a few months' time, we will be seeing lots more people for crisis debt support. &nbsp;\" said by Luke Young\n\"Okay. Can I bring in Jane Dodds, who wanted to follow up?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Yes, thank you very much. I just wanted to ask about the graph. You talked about the Citizens Advice graph in the report. One of the things that I wanted to talk about is the fact that it appears that the council tax arrears\u2014so, the amount that people pay in council tax\u2014is the highest increase. And I was interested in hearing more about exactly how it works with local authorities, because I understood that they weren't putting pressure on people who are in arrears with regard to their council tax.&nbsp;So, could you just take us through that graph a little bit, please, if that's okay, Chair?\" said by Jane Dodds MS\n\"Of course. With council tax, what we have seen in Wales is, as a debt, it has competed with energy to be the top debt issue that we see amongst our clients in Wales. That's a slightly different story to England, it's worth saying. In England, our client base reported having energy debt as the top debt issue. And, in lots of local authority areas across Wales, energy debt and council tax debt have been competing for the top debt issue.Now, I understand what the Member says\u2014and the graph points to what we model will happen in the coming months\u2014but, actually, reflecting on the experience of the past year, council tax has been the biggest debt overall; it's remained high. There's been an increase in individuals who are disabled, who have a long-term health condition, coming to our services reporting council tax. Now, obviously, that is a difficult situation to marry up with the idea that local authorities are showing great reams of forbearance for people in that situation.&nbsp;So, I think there is more to do there, and I know that it's something that the Senedd and the Government are exploring. But our experience is that, in the pandemic, the issues around council tax debt kind of dropped off a bit for a number of reasons. But then, alongside the removal of the uplift in universal credit in September 2021, the debt needs, particularly around council tax, have started to increase and to rise back to levels that we've seen previously. So, my takeaway from that is that there is always more to do. We would like to see local authorities having more forbearance with people in the coming months. The Minister gave a steer last week in committee saying that the Welsh Government will scrap the rule that allows people to be eligible for a full year's council tax bill if they miss one payment. I think that is a step forward, but actually there is action that could probably be taken now, We have a council tax protocol in Wales. We'd like to see that on a statutory footing. We don't think that it's being followed at the level it should be.\" said by Luke Young\n\"Okay, thank you for that. I know that, Altaf Hussain, you wanted to follow up on the response of public bodies.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you, Chair, and good afternoon. Firstly, are there any particular recommendations in the committee's report on debt and the pandemic that we should follow up with the Minister, and what outcomes would you like to see from this? Now, coming to the question, in its previous work, the committee heard concerns about the enforcement approaches that local authorities take when people are in debt. Have there been any changes on the ground since the committee's report, and are you aware of any progress in reviewing the council tax protocol? How would you describe the current picture, where people have fallen behind in their payments to local authorities, and has it worsened?\" said by Altaf Hussain MS\n\"Thank you. Should we start with Luke Young, just picking up on your previous remarks?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Dealing with the council tax protocol itself first, I think it does need to be reviewed to see if it can be strengthened and put on a statutory basis. We did research with individuals in council tax debt last year that was quite instructive, really, and lots of the experiences relayed to us were of services that felt, at times, uncaring, that felt pressurised, that felt that, actually, there was only one way to deal with debt, and that was paying the full bill or going to court. Obviously, that's a situation that we feel, for people in debt and for anyone struggling, is not the best situation, because you're not going to help them to move forward. So, we would like to see the council tax protocol reviewed and strengthened, absolutely. Chair, I just want to check. We'll probably talk about recommendations for Government later. I'm just aware that the Member asked\u2014\" said by Luke Young\n\"Yes, we can come back to that. Shall we just stick with council tax for now? The committee want to know if there's been any change of attitude by particular local authorities who may have been employing aggressive bailiffs who weren't compliant with the protocol. So, if there's anything that either Luke or the Bevan Foundation, or indeed StepChange, want to tell us on that.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Yes. I guess one concern\u2014. Luke and Peter might know more specifically about council tax in terms of what's going on on the ground. That's part of the problem: a lot of this is anecdotal rather than hard evidence. I think there is a concern that, because there is so much pressure on local authorities at the moment across the board\u2014an area like homelessness is another example\u2014a lot of good wishes and plans to move towards more preventative action is currently coming up against the sheer workload that they're seeing of people in crisis, and obviously, it's absolutely right that the focus is on crisis. But that is preventing, across the board, I think, the shift that we may want to see, and actually a lot of the local authorities themselves are wanting to be doing as well. So, I'm mindful that that is a climate that has made it maybe more difficult for some of those actions to be taken forward than we may have wished to see, following the publication of the last report.\" said by Dr Steffan Evans\n\"Okay. Jane, is that on this specific point, because I know that Peter wants to come in?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Yes. If you let Peter go first, sorry\u2014I think he had his hand up.\" said by Jane Dodds MS\n\"Okay, Peter Tutton, would you like to come in?\" said by ", "answer": "Jenny Rathbone AM"}

If it's all right, we'll go straight to questions and I'll go to Hefin David.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Diolch, Gadeirydd. I'd like to ask the Minister, just straight into it: does the Welsh Government have targets for growing jobs and gross value added in the creative industries?\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"What I would say to&nbsp;start is, obviously, Creative Wales is still a relatively young organisation. So, part of what Creative Wales has been trying to do is to establish baseline data and to better understand the sector so that we can monitor the trends annually. But I think that, given that the creative team have been working on that, I'll ask Gerwyn to say a little bit more about how that process works and how they've been gathering the data.\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"Thank you, Minister. Yes, so, there's the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport&nbsp;definition of the creative industries, which covers a lot more sectors than Creative Wales has responsibility for. So, as an example, it's got architecture and the wider IT sector within the DCMS definition. So, we've been working, over the past 18 months, on understanding the baseline for the sectors we have responsibility for\u2014so, the priority sectors that we focus on: screen, music, digital and publishing. We've done a lot of work around the standard industrial classification codes to gather the baseline information on that. The first time the data came out was last year, showing that the sector is worth \u00a3575 million to the economy, and over 6,500 people working in the sector. We'll have annual stats updated in July on those figures, so that will show against the key sectors that we're almost in charge of in terms of policy and funding support, whether those sectors are growing. So, while there are no targets, we do have a baseline, which indicates if our interventions are working, because it's specifically on the sectors that we support.\" said by Gerwyn Evans\n\"Okay. We've heard some concerns from the sector, particularly post pandemic, about overall health and distribution of skilled workers. Is the Welsh Government confident that there's good data on the overall health of the sector?\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Again, I'll ask Gerwyn if he can give information on the data.\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"Yes, we work with partners, so the University of South Wales do annual studies around the skills shortages and gaps within the screen sector specifically. So, yes, we work with partners to gather that evidence base around the health of the workforce. We've done one year of an industry survey, where we write out to the industry and ask them about the health and well-being of their sector and their business, whether they're seeing growth, whether they've got any issues. We'll be issuing the second year of that survey in the next couple of weeks, so that will give us\u2014. Alongside the data that we have on turnover, GVA and jobs, we'll have the more anecdotal evidence from business as to the health of the sector, so that survey will be going out in the next few weeks.\" said by Gerwyn Evans\n\"And you mentioned\u2014\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Forgive me, Hefin\u2014forgive, me. Just quickly: could the results of that survey be shared with the committee when you have them, please?\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Absolutely, yes.\" said by Gerwyn Evans\n\"Thank you so much.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"We share it wide with the industry, so it's an indicator for us of almost the temperature of the sector.\" said by Gerwyn Evans\n\"Thank you so much. Sorry about that, Hefin.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"That's fine. You mention the screen industries in your answer as well. I would like to know, how do balance attracting inward investment through big productions and then also manage to develop an indigenous workforce?\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Well, certainly from our point of view, the priority is growing the screen industry, and we do that by supporting ranges of indigenous products, alongside targeted inward investment, where they complement our strategic goals, because I think that is important, that we don't just do this randomly, that it's done through a process of trying to achieve outcomes. So, we're looking to get the best investment in the economy and skills and the creation of those skills on a permanent basis. But overall, our objective is to maximise the long-term benefits through that mix. So, production funding, for instance, is deliberately spread across a range of indigenous and inward investment projects, and our aim, really, is to use that funding to help create an environment that allows the indigenous companies to grow. If I\u2014\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"Just at that point, can you give me some examples of those projects\u2014just name some of the projects?<strong>&nbsp;</strong>\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"We've got lots of examples, and I think it's probably\u2014. I could sit here and rattle through them all, or\u2014\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"Just tell us your top three.\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Oh, Gerwyn, the top three\u2014go on.\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"So, this year, in 2023, with our work with the BBC and S4C particularly, it's the year of drama. South-east Wales has a very good reputation for high-end tv and drama, because of Bad Wolf, et cetera. I don't whether you just watched&nbsp;<em>Steeltown Murders</em>, which is on currently. That was a programme we funded. We've got Michael Sheen's production in Port Talbot,&nbsp;<em>The Way</em>, currently being filmed, so we've spent a lot of time this year focusing on supporting more Welsh portrayal. I think it was a question from this committee a number of years back about that balancing between inward investment and Welsh portrayal, so we've done a lot of Welsh portrayal with independent production companies. This year, we've got the&nbsp;<em>Men Up</em> story about Viagra coming to screens as well, so please keep an eye out for that one.\" said by Gerwyn Evans\n\"What about geographical balance, though? How do you manage that? You've mentioned south Wales\u2014how do you make sure that it's spread throughout Wales?\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"We do try to spread the investment across Wales. We've seen, recently, the development of the Aria studios in Anglesey, so that's one example of where we're trying to spread that investment, and we're also working closely to provide funding for Gogledd Creadigol in north Wales as well. We're really trying to build on the success of what we've seen in south-east Wales and spread that to other parts of Wales, and we're certainly seeing that investment in the north now.\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"Just before I move on to\u2014. I want to move on to another sector, but is there anything else you want to add? I know I'm rattling through, we've got an awful lot to get through.&nbsp;\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Just in terms of the inward investment question there, it's about a balanced portfolio for us; it's about strategically going after the inward investment projects that work for Wales. So, we've got a really exciting pipeline, and some good stuff happening in north Wales as well. So, in the next week or so, hopefully, we'll be able to announce a major inward investment project that is happening in north Wales. That balances against the independent production companies that we've been supporting as well.\" said by Gerwyn Evans\n\"Any hints about what that is?\" said by Haidee James\n\"Well, it's kind of\u2014. It's out\u2014[<em>Inaudible</em>.] so it's got a dragon in the title.\" said by Gerwyn Evans\n\"Has it? Okay. That's it, is it? Is that all you're going to tell us?\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"That's all I can say, I'm afraid.&nbsp;\" said by Gerwyn Evans\n\"Until next week, Hefin. [<em>Laughter.</em>]\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"Until the offer letter is signed and it's official.&nbsp;\" said by Gerwyn Evans\n\"We'll have a big reveal next week. [<em>Laughter.</em>]\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"Yes, tantalising.&nbsp;\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Okay. I'm not going to push you any further then.&nbsp;\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Sorry.&nbsp;\" said by Gerwyn Evans\n\"And my last question is: we've heard that, since the pandemic, there have been particular problems with the workforce in that arts and music sectors, and the rather alarming term 'spiral of decline' has been used in some of the evidence we've received. So, what support are you giving to the workforce in the arts and music sectors?\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Okay. Well, over and above the normal annual allocation\u2014. I think we did talk about this in the budget scrutiny as well, so I think it's probably just worth repeating some of that. So, we allocated an additional \u00a31 million funding to support the cost-of-living pressures in the arts sector, via the Arts Council of Wales, with \u00a3500,000 for 2023, and a further \u00a3500,000 in 2023-24. And what the Arts Council of Wales are telling us as well is that their National Lottery funding has performed much better than expected, and that means that they're also now able to direct that additional funding to the cost-of-living pressures being faced by the sector. So, those are the key direct interventions that we've made in the arts and the music sector.&nbsp;Again Hefin, I've got lots of examples of the activity that we are trying to support. I'm conscious, Chair, that we've got an awful lot to get through today, so I can go through the list of some of these projects, or I can write to you and give you the detail of how much we've\u2014\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"It would be helpful to\u2014\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Sorry?\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"It would be helpful to have a list, if we can, if you can provide it to committee&nbsp;at a later stage.&nbsp;\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Yes. So we've got a significant list of projects that have been supported, and, I think, if I can provide that to the committee rather than waste time literally reading out a list, that might be helpful.&nbsp;\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"No, we'd be very grateful. Thank you.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Yes, okay. All right.&nbsp;\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"So, I hope, Chair, that you're satisfied I've gone through that as quickly as I could.&nbsp;\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Yes, you did, Hefin, very impressive. Diolch yn fawr.Could you talk us through, please, what you think the Welsh Government could do to help organisations, or encourage them to improve working conditions in the sector, and also, in terms of pay levels, to help recruit more people, and a more diverse range of people?\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"All right. I'll start by saying that that is absolutely a priority for Creative Wales. We're encouraging organisations that we work with to improve their pay levels and working conditions. And what we can do is use our funding mechanisms in that regard to drive good practice. So, any grant funding that comes from Creative Wales, it will come with conditions attached to it. That is only the case as far as those organisations or productions that we are funding, for instance, or whatever sectors it might be. So, if they're getting direct funding from us, then there will be, as I say, a condition attached to that, where we will look to ensure that there are minimum levels of pay rates and so on. If it's production funding, then we also insist on certain numbers of trainees to be taken on in that area as well, and we work with the Welsh Government's fair work team to make sure that all of those requirements around pay and working conditions are actually in our grant offers.&nbsp;I think, yesterday, we saw a significant move forward in terms in social partnership with the new piece of legislation that received Royal Assent yesterday. That will also feed into a lot of what we're doing, as will our work on the culture strategy, because I think one of the things that, as I say, it's important to reiterate is that we can only really determine things like levels of pay and working conditions as a determinant of a fund grant that we provide. So, that will come with a condition. The vast majority of organisations out there don't come to us for funding support, so we don't have the same levers in that way. So, for those organisations, the main lever, of course, is UK employment law. But what we do have is the cultural strategy that we're developing, and within that cultural strategy I would expect very much that expectations will be set out very clearly about what cultural organisations look like in Wales and how they employ staff, and what their working conditions are like, because that is going to be a key sector of the work being done on the cultural strategy.\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"Thank you for that. We held a workshop in the University of South Wales with lots of representatives from the sector, and some of the most concerning things that we heard were about the prevalence of bullying in the sector, and problems with mental health issues, particularly for younger entrants into the sector. With bullying and bad behaviour, it was reported to us that lots of people feel that they either don't know where to go to report that behaviour, or they can't, because everyone knows everyone in the sector. So, both in terms of the bullying, and also in terms of mental health support, a common theme that was coming up was that there aren't always HR teams in the very small, micro companies. Do you think that there's more\u2014? What would you like to see being done? Do you think that there's anything that the Welsh Government can do to be, again, encouraging this? Do you think that there should be shared HR facilities for different companies to be doing this together? I know that there's an app that's been launched, but should there be something more structural and structured so that there's somewhere for people to go, either to report bad behaviour or to say that they're not coping?\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Well, I mean, what you report there is clearly what we've heard as well, and it is very concerning and it's very worrying. I think it is a reflection of society; we've seen it in other organisations. I mean, this committee had to do an inquiry around what was going on in the Welsh Rugby Union; we've seen it in S4C; we've seen it in the Confederation of British Industry; we see it in a number of organisations. My approach to all of this is not that that is surprising, because that is a reflection, to a large extent, of society. What is important is how organisations respond to it, and how they deal with it, and those are the greater challenges that we face.So, we have introduced a well-being facilitators pilot across the creative industries, and we've extended that pilot with further funding this year, and we've had very, very positive feedback from that pilot, which is giving access to people in a workplace to go to somebody that's not directly involved and related to the organisation that they work for, so it gives them the confidence to be able to go and speak to somebody about any issues of concern that they've got. And as I say, I think that is an initiative that is only happening in Wales, in the creative sector in Wales, and, as I say, very, very positive feedback on that.What I would also say is that we do have the Live Fear Free campaign in Wales and a hotline that is available to anybody. That is something that we have encouraged the WRU and S4C to make their staff aware of, so that they have somewhere that they can go outside of their organisation to speak to. But the other point that you raise, which, I think, is a very valid point, is about sharing services across smaller organisations and smaller companies. That is a successful model that has worked on a number of our skills programmes. Again, Gerwyn, I don't know if there's anything that you want to add to that, because you've been more closely involved.\" said by ", "answer": "Dawn Bowden AM"}
{"content": "\"We are having an&nbsp;evidence session with the Welsh Rugby Union, following allegations surrounding the Welsh Rugby Union. Can I invite firstly Mr Ieuan Evans to introduce himself for the record?\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Ieuan Evans, chair, Welsh Rugby Union.\" said by Ieuan Evans\n\"Thank you very much.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"And, Mr Nigel Walker.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Nigel Walker, acting chief executive officer of the Welsh Rugby Union.\" said by Nigel Walker\n\"Thank you so much. On behalf of Members, I really would like to thank you for accepting our invitation to give evidence today. It's a really important issue; it's something that has the interest of Members of the Senedd, members of the public, and obviously the press and the wider public in Wales. This is something that has come out following the <em>BBC Wales Investigates </em>programme on 23 January. Would you like to make a short opening statement?\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Thank you, Chair, and thank you for the invitation to appear before the committee this morning. We're very pleased to have the opportunity, and we are aware, as the stewards of Welsh rugby, that we have a great responsibility, and we're aware that we've disappointed the rugby family across Wales. The experience has been sobering for us, but as the new chair, I am determined to make the changes that are necessary to improve rugby in Wales. You will be aware of some of the changes that we have already announced. Also, Nigel has taken the role of acting chief executive.\" said by Ieuan Evans\n\"We fully understand and embrace the WRU's unique role in the sporting, economic and civic life in Wales, embedded in its social fabric, and how we project ourselves is critical. We need to get this right; we need to take advice and seek input from others, so we've been working closely with Welsh Government and Sport Wales, and of course, talking to our staff, our players, our member clubs and our commercial partners about the next steps. We are a \u00a3100 million-turnover business, and that includes some public funding. We take our responsibility for spending public funds extremely seriously. We have 80,000 players across 300 clubs, and many more thousands of young people in schools across Wales playing rugby. We're a showcase for Wales to the world. We have a duty, and a responsibility to be as good as we can be, and it's my job to make that happen.Hopefully, today, we can outline for you the changes we have already put in place and answer some of the questions that I'm sure you have. As you know, we will be working with our partners to establish a taskforce with external expertise to help us achieve the cultural change we need, and we'll have more information about that this morning as we finalise some of those details, as they're not all in place as yet. And we've agreed, of course, that Sport Wales will be identifying an independent chair and we will be working with them and the membership in terms of reference for that review, and I'm sure that we can elaborate on that as the hearing goes on. We're happy therefore to provide more details to the committee when those arrangements are finalised.\" said by Ieuan Evans\n\"Thank you for that. So, we'll move on to questions. Why do you think the WRU is in this situation?\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"As a relatively new chair\u2014a matter of weeks\u2014I've been humbled and harrowed by what I've heard, particularly the impact on our female staff and players. I think we all know that we should do more, we need to do more to make the game and our organisation more inclusive, but I was shocked by the personal stories highlighted by our former staff in the programme, and I can only apologise once more to them, and not only them but people elsewhere affected by the allegations in that programme as well, and to say that I will work night and day to ensure that all of our staff feel safe and valued.\" said by Ieuan Evans\n\"Thank you for that. I'll bring Alun Davies in in a moment, but could I just press you on that, because your words are obviously heartfelt, and I appreciate that, but in terms of why you think this has happened, what would be your analysis of that?\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"I'm happy to come in there. I think, in any organisation, especially a large organisation like the Welsh Rugby Union, it's possible for things to occur over a period of time and for people to turn a blind eye, and not to address those problems, and then it's not until, sometimes, an organisation is forced to face the reality of the position they find themselves in that they begin to really look deeply and look back to the past and begin to join the dots. So, the warning signs have been there for quite some time. When it's presented as graphically as it was during the BBC Wales programme the week before last, it hits you like a 10-tonne truck.I should offer my apologies. My thoughts are with those members of staff, those players and ex-players who have had an experience that no individual should have. The key now is, yes, we're apologetic, yes, we've made statements, yes, we've accepted that we've got a problem; the key now is to begin to understand the scale and scope of that problem, to seek outside help, which Ieuan has referred to, and to give an undertaking that, when those recommendations come through, whether it's in three months, six months, whenever they come through, we will do everything in our power to implement them, to make sure that the experiences that those women, players, young girls, maybe, have experienced, won't be repeated in the future, or at least you minimise the prospect of those things happening again.\" said by Nigel Walker\n\"Thank you for that. When you say the very graphic nature of some of these reports that have come out, could you tell us why it took that happening for action to be taken, rather than it happening when these reports had first been made clear to you?\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"To be candid, I think, as an organisation, we have been in denial as to the extent of the problem. So, there have been cases in the past that have been dealt with\u2014in theory, dealt with, and people have moved on. I think each individual case is an indication that there has been a wider problem, but people have not joined the dots. When you see it presented over a 30-minute programme in the way that it was, unless you're going to bury your head in the sand for another six months or 12 months, you have to take action, and that's the position we're in. None of us are proud of the position we're in.\" said by Nigel Walker\n\"Thank you. I'm going to bring in Alun.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Thanks very much. Can I challenge you a little bit on your assertion, Mr Evans, that you were shocked by what you've learned? I was reading parts of your autobiography that were scathing about the WRU in different ways. You said that there were people on the WRU who were simply not capable of taking the right decisions because they were too parochial, too insular or just plain short-sighted.&nbsp;You went on to ask how you could have officials from small clubs with no real knowledge of world rugby making decisions that affected the national team, and more often than not affected it for the worse.&nbsp;And you also said, 'At a time when our rivals were planning ahead and learning from the likes of Australia and New Zealand, too many of our people seemed more concerned with ensuring that they had their supply of free tickets and hotel accommodation for international weekend junkets'.Now, that's harsher, in many ways, than anything we've heard in the last week, and that was written some years ago. So, you were clearly aware that there were significant and deep-rooted problems with the WRU, so what you've heard this last week couldn't have shocked you.\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"One of the reasons I came on to the board\u2014and I have been chair for, as I said, a matter of weeks\u2014I've been quite open and candid in my desire to ensure that our organisation is a high-functioning organisation, to drive us to new horizons, and we need to be reflective. My desire\u2014and you've read the press release that went out last night with regard to it\u2014and, as a board, our desire is to convince and compel our member clubs, as we are a union of member clubs and the constitution dictates that clubs need to vote through changes before they can be implemented, that we need to be a diverse, skill set-based board, with an independent chair. I've actively campaigned to find my replacement; we need to have an independent chair. I'm conscious, for us to deliver on our strategic objectives, that we need a board composition overhaul, and it's how we achieve that. We were quite open in the press statement with regard to what we intend to put to the clubs in an extraordinary general meeting at the end of March or earlier. That is our aim, because that's how the organisation needs to be run. Yes, we have a main board, we also have a community game board, which runs the community game with elected representatives from the clubs, and I wish to broaden that and make it a broader church to be truly representative of our game.\" said by Ieuan Evans\n\"I don't disagree with that, but my question was\u2014I think the statement last night was very positive, by the way, I've got no issue about that\u2014my question was about your knowledge about what was happening. You're both giants of our game. You must have had an awareness of what was happening. Your words, Ieuan, were absolutely brutal about the WRU.\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Can I\u2014? Not that Ieuan needs me to defend him, but the words that you've\u2014and I haven't read Ieuan's autobiography, by the way.\" said by Nigel Walker\n\"Well, you should, it's very illustrative.\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"I'm sure that those words were talking in general terms about the running of the organisation. It was the graphic nature of the sexism and misogyny in last week's programme that was the bit that was particularly distressing, talking from my point of view, and I know that Ieuan shares that point of view.\" said by Nigel Walker\n\"There was a review in 2021 into the women's game, could you tell us how the WRU responded to that and would you commit to making those findings public?\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"I went through and interview process in May/June 2021. At the latter stages of that process, certain elements of that review were presented to me and it became one of the interview questions: 'What would you do?' I was appointed in July and started in September. When I read the review, I was shocked as to the extent of the problem. There are 40 recommendations in the review, and it was obvious that the Welsh Rugby Union had failed women's rugby. You'll find, during the course of the next 40 minutes, I'm just going to be completely honest with you\u2014\" said by Nigel Walker\n\"We appreciate your honesty.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"So, one of my first tasks was to try to address the problems that were present in the women's game. I remember, even before I took up my appointment formally at the end of September, I addressed the women's squad. They were at the NCE, the national centre of excellence, in Hensol, they were all sitting in front of me, and I apologised. Steve Phillips, the CEO, was next to me. I apologised for what they had been through in the recent past and I said that I was here to make changes and that I would be actively pursuing the prospect of a world class programme for our women players. I said that I would have professional contracts in their hands by the end of December. When I said that, at least half a dozen of them looked up at the ceiling\u2014and I've related this story to them\u2014because they'd heard it all before. But, by December 2021, they had professional contracts. We have made enormous progress against the 40 recommendations. I think the recommendations of that review have been circulated. I'm happy to answer any questions, I can talk about the progress that we've made, and I can talk about the areas that are still to be corrected. But, probably 32 or 33 of those recommendations have been implemented in full\" said by Nigel Walker\n\"Thank you. And the report, it will be published.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"The full report\u2014we've got a little bit of an issue with the full report being published, because when the panel was commissioned to conduct the review it was on the basis that the report would be internal. I have been in conversation with the chair of the review panel in the last couple of days. The chair of the review panel is happy for the recommendations, but we've still got a way to go before the full report, because of the detail of the report and the ability to identify certain individuals. Now, I know we can go through the Maxwellisation process and it could be redacted\u2014\" said by Nigel Walker\n\"But that's what I was going to ask you, if a redacted version\u2014. Because obviously no-one would want to compromise anyone's information that they had given, wanting it to be anonymous. But could a redacted version of that report be\u2014\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"We're working on that. The conversation is ongoing. We are completely transparent. The report will not make comfortable reading for those involved in the WRU, but I personally have no objection to the report being published.\" said by Nigel Walker\n\"That's useful, and I appreciate the fact that you're saying\u2014. I don't think that we've actually received those recommendations, so it would be useful if you could send those to us, please.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"We will do. We'll make sure that happens. Sorry, I believed they'd been sent last night, but obviously that's my misunderstanding.\" said by Nigel Walker\n\"If I could also add that I was part of the panel that interviewed Nigel, and thank him for the hard work he has done in bringing us so far. It's not enough, it's nowhere near enough, but I commend Nigel on the work he did in his role as the high-performance director, and now as chief exec, because that was one of the key aspects, when he stepped into the role of high-performance director, that we wanted him to focus on.\" said by Ieuan Evans\n\"Thank you for that. We'll move on to Hefin David.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Can I ask what are your minimum expectations of the external taskforce?\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"I'll give you a bit of background on where we are, because it's only Thursday, but it seems like a very long week. We've had a number of meetings with Sport Wales, Welsh Government officials and a company called Sport Resolutions, who are an arbitration service, if you like. Where we've arrived at at the moment: the terms of reference are just about complete, we've got another call at 5 o'clock this evening, those terms of reference will be signed off, and it's fairly broad, the terms of reference, to look at the culture of Welsh rugby, to look at sexism, misogyny cases. It's fairly wide, going back to 2017, although if the panel uncovers things that go back further than that, they can look at them. What we didn't want was for the review to be so all-encompassing that we're sitting here this time next year and it hasn't presented itself. So, there's a balance between what we want them to look at and us being able to take action.&nbsp;Sport Resolutions will appoint an independent chair. I've got the name. I can't release it at the moment, the name of the independent chair, but I don't think anybody will have any concerns when they see the name of that chair. By tomorrow, we should be able to name the chair and publish the terms of reference, and by early next week, the other panellist will have been identified, and by the tail end of next week we'd expect the review panel to begin their work.&nbsp;\" said by Nigel Walker\n\"Okay. I'll come to the terms of reference in a second. I noticed Tonia Antoniazzi MP said that she'd like someone outside of Wales to chair, and she's had involvement with the WRU and as a player. Someone outside of Wales to chair it\u2014is that going to happen?\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"I don't want to mention the name. I don't know where the person hails from.\" said by Nigel Walker\n\"No.\" said by Ieuan Evans\n\"Are they connected with the WRU in any way?\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Not in any way, shape or form.\" said by Nigel Walker\n\"No, not in any way at all. Not at all. And just to confirm the process we've gone through: Sport Wales has advised the Welsh Rugby Union on the appointment of the independent body to lead the review. The WRU has commissioned the independent review through Sport Resolution, another independent entity, on the advice of Sport Wales.\" said by Ieuan Evans\n\"So, Sport Resolution, where is that based? Is that a UK-based arbitration service?\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"No, it's based in London.\" said by Nigel Walker\n\"A London-based arbitration service. And I imagine they've done work with other bodies before.&nbsp;\" said by ", "answer": "Hefin David AM"}

If I give you a bit of a brief timeline as to how this came about, both myself and Tanni received separate phone calls, late afternoon on Friday, 27 January, asking if we would help and advise on the establishment of an independent panel. It was urgent, and they needed answers immediately. We have a retainer with the organisation in question, Sport Resolutions, who have a\u2014is it enviable or unenviable, depending on your point of view\u2014track record of working in this kind of field. It's well established, it's not for profit, and, as I said, we have a retainer with them for our appeals processes. So\u2014\" said by Brian Davies\n\"Can I ask you, just at that point, have you used them before, then?\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"We haven't as an organisation had need to use them, but we do know organisations, such as British Cycling, British Canoeing, British Gymnastics, have used them. And they are used quite extensively in the world of anti-doping, and the establishment of panels to look at anti-doping evidence as well.\" said by Brian Davies\n\"Is that why you've got a retainer with them?\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"No. Our retainer is about our appeals process. So, if someone complains about us, there's a process that we put in place to deal with that complaint, and if someone is unhappy, or an organisation is unhappy with the result of that complaint, then, we retain the services of Sport Resolutions to look at it, on appeal.\" said by Brian Davies\n\"Okay.\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Hefin, just for transparency, before I became chair of Sport Wales, I'd spoken at lots of Sport Resolutions conferences; I'd had a number of dealings with them in other cases that I worked on, outside sport\u2014so, their expertise and the number of individuals they had access to. Also, from a very personal level, I felt, looking at appointing a chair who was outside Wales, who had knowledge of sport and that structure\u2014the good and the challenging bit of sport in Wales is the interconnectivity, and, for me, it was important that the independence that that individual brought was someone whose future career didn't depend on sport in Wales.\" said by Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson\n\"Thank you for that. Hefin, back to you.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Yes, that's been reflected in the correspondence we've received from interested parties\u2014that it was someone entirely independent to Welsh sport. So, can I ask what is Sport Wales's role now with the ongoing investigation? Do you take a step back, or will you be further involved as the process continues?\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"It's a bit of both, to be honest. So, the independent panel is exactly that\u2014it's an independent panel that has the terms of reference agreed, and it will operate now under the auspices of Dame Anne Rafferty. But there is a commissioning advisory group. So, the panel has been commissioned by the WRU\u2014someone has to commission it, so, the WRU will be covering the costs, and therefore are the commissioning party. But there is an advisory group, consisting of a representative of the Welsh Rugby Union, a representative of Sport Wales, and a further independent person, and that's the commissioning advisory group. It effectively sits there to help the panel if it requests it. It is asking for monthly updates from the panel, but its role is basically to check on progress and that everything the panel wants and needs is being received. So, we do have a partial role in that commissioning advisory group, yes.\" said by Brian Davies\n\"Previously commissioned reports will be provided to the panel\u2014will they be public record, or is that all going to be done in private?\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"I think the chief executive of the WRU covered that in the last session, where they needed to check the legality of that situation. They certainly clarified that they'd be available to the panel, but in terms of public access, that was for the WRU to determine, based on the confidentiality, certainly of one of the reports that was commissioned into the women's game. A lot of the evidence was given under agreement that it would be confidential, so they were having to check whether they could redact or publish anything publicly.\" said by Brian Davies\n\"I think others will have a question about the detail of the report; I was wondering if, in general, reports will be made public and the answer is no; they'll have confidential access. What about evidence sessions? Do you feel that the evidence sessions with people\u2014I assume there'll be sessions much like this committee\u2014will they be held in public, much the same as a public inquiry, or will they be done in private?\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"I can't answer that question, I'm afraid, because it's an independent panel being chaired by Dame Anne Rafferty. You'll have to direct the question directly to Dame Anne, I'm afraid, because it is her process, it's her panel.\" said by Brian Davies\n\"Okay.\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Could I\u2014?\" said by Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson\n\"Yes, of course.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Sorry. Thank you. Just in terms of other reports into British national governing bodies, there have been some challenges in terms of what is made public. So, in similar cases, people have given evidence and then reports had to have been heavily rewritten when those people were quite nervous about potentially being identified, even though there were very generic comments in there that individuals had made. So, I think where we are in terms of\u2014this has moved at quite a lot of pace, and I think we all recognise the urgency of getting something started very quickly. Some of those things still need to be explored, because I think the challenge in this area\u2014and this is culture across sport and society\u2014is how difficult it can be for some individuals to come forward and, sometimes, when they want to come forward in terms of how comfortable they feel coming forward.I've been involved in various different ways in lots of different issues in sport, and that confidentiality is really important. And one of the challenges is that some people don't want to necessarily put things in writing or need to feel\u2014. When I did the piece of work for the UK Government on duty of care back in 2017, a large number of people didn't even want their name to be in my diary and didn't want to meet me in Westminster, wanted to meet me outside. I ended up meeting people in coffee shops all over. So, there's a lot of sensitivity around some of this.\" said by Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson\n\"There's that balance between transparency and confidentiality\u2014we fully understand that. Chair, I've got two more questions. One is on the terms of reference. As a body, are you satisfied that the terms of reference are sufficiently broad and focused at the same time to cover the key issues that are at play here?\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"An interesting question in that broad and focused is a difficult balance to strike. I think in terms of expediency and the specific allegations that were raised in the BBC programme, they are covering the right areas. I think if they were too broad, this review could go on for years, and there are examples where that is the case, and the reviews take literally years to produce. This isn't the objective here; the objective here is to try and change some immediate things in the culture of an organisation&nbsp;and therefore it needs to report promptly. So, the terms of reference have reflected that in terms of its scope.So, as an organisation, I think we're happy, but they are Dame Anne Rafferty's terms of reference. We've had input into them, as have the WRU, but they are the chair of the independent panel's terms of reference. So, again, I think the question is directed at Dame Anne, whose CV and track record is very impressive. I hope that people agree that the independent panel has a very good and capable chair.\" said by Brian Davies\n\"I do feel that, though, the&nbsp;terms of reference are public&nbsp;and there's nothing to stop you having an opinion on those terms of reference, but I think you've expressed that anyway.\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Sorry, Chair, it might be worth me just adding that the other role for the commissioning advisory group is if the panel, or Dame Anne, wants to change the terms of reference during her investigation, she consults with the commissioning advisory group as to whether that can be done or should be done.\" said by Brian Davies\n\"That's very helpful. That's very helpful. Thank you. And finally, my last question is regarding what you've already made reference to\u2014the length of time this will take. I think Nigel Walker said to us in the last session that he'd be uncomfortable if it took 10 to 12 months. They're looking to get this done as quickly as possible. Do you feel this can be done as quickly as possible? And what kind of timescale would be preferable, do you think?\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"I've no reason to doubt Nigel's desire for it to be done within that time frame. The advice we were given by Sport Resolutions is it is quite dangerous and potentially not very productive to put a timeline on something of this nature, because the panel needs to have the opportunity to find its course through its terms of reference. There is a desire to make some changes as quickly as possible, certainly in the culture of the WRU, but also then potentially more widely in the sport sector so lessons can be learned quickly and implemented more widely if necessary.\" said by Brian Davies\n\"I think the issue is, if the report makes&nbsp;recommendations and the WRU is undertaking, in the meantime, changes, and if the recommendations are contrary to those changes, then you end up having to do things twice and possibly making it harder to do things later down the line.\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Yes, I think that's true. What I would probably would add, though, is that what the WRU are currently proposing is some hard governance changes, which are really very welcome and needed, and have been needed for a while. But the soft changes are more difficult, and that's maybe where the panel's recommendations will be focused. I don't know if that makes sense\u2014hard changes: the rules; soft changes: how things are implemented, what the culture within the organisation looks like and how that can be improved or monitored or regulated.\" said by Brian Davies\n\"So, you don't think the investigation will talk about the make-up of the board, then?\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"I'm hoping it won't need to if the recommendations that the WRU have put forward, or the chief exec and chair have put forward, are adopted by the membership.\" said by Brian Davies\n\"Okay, thank you.\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Diolch, Hefin.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"From my previous experience in something like this, people will use it as an opportunity to come forward and raise any issue that they have, whether it's about regions, and I think that's where the terms of reference are really important and in terms of what the panel is there to do. So, Brian's absolutely right\u2014it's hard to put a time frame on it because it depends on how many people come forward, but I think we all recognise, for Welsh sport, that the pace needs to be there as well.\" said by Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson\n\"Thank you. Diolch, Hefin. Can I check, before the BBC programme aired on 23 January, were you at Sport Wales aware of any allegations of inappropriate behaviour at the WRU?\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Nothing formal. We were aware of some things that were in the public domain, but, in terms of the specific allegations that were aired, no, nothing had been raised directly with us.\" said by Brian Davies\n\"Thank you for that. And just to check, because that's one of the themes that's come up in the course of the evidence we've had already\u2014that people have said nothing formal\u2014and to clarify, it was just things that were in the public domain that you would have been aware of before.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Yes, and quite a bit of what was in the public domain was a bit of hearsay, a bit of rumour, a bit of gossip. There were some more factual things, I think, but fundamentally it was a\u2014. People have talked about Amanda Blanc's evidence. Well, Amanda Blanc kept her counsel having resigned from the WRU. It was all hearsay for that significant period as to why she left the professional rugby board.\" said by Brian Davies\n\"I think Tom Giffard and Jenny Rathbone want to come in on this. I'll just bring Tom in first, and then I'll go to Jenny. Tom.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"You mentioned that there was nothing formal. Obviously, from the informal things you did hear in the public domain, did you do any investigative work to get to the bottom of how real those allegations were?\" said by Tom Giffard MS\n\"I think it's important, in response to that, to identify what our role is as a body, as an arm\u2019s-length body of Welsh Government. We're the agency responsible for promoting and developing sport and physical activity in Wales. We're not an investigatory body. We're not resourced that way. We're not established that way. We have no legislative power. We do have duties. As an organisation, we're bound by certain legal duties. But, in terms of the sector, we don't really have that kind of responsibility. Whether we should is another matter. So, if someone does raise something informally with us, there is a limit to what we can do.\" said by Brian Davies\n\"I understand the point you're making, but, just from a concern perspective, you have a relationship with the WRU, both in terms of counsel and a financial relationship. Surely, in your role, if you hear an allegation like that, regardless of how formal or not it's presented to you, you'd have a concern that you'd want to investigate, wouldn't you?\" said by Tom Giffard MS\n\"I think the key word there is 'investigate'. I'm not sure we do have the authority to investigate, but we do have a duty to maybe help those individuals if they contact us. So, in terms of anything to do with employment, if someone contacted us directly, we would probably point them in the direction of their trade union if they've got one, to seek support, or other agencies that are available. Depending on what the issue was, there are other commissioners, commissions, agencies and the like that we could point them towards, but we don't have any jurisdiction in those areas, so it would be difficult for us to investigate in that sense.\" said by Brian Davies\n\"Okay. Jenny.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Wales is a pretty small country. Everybody knows everybody in the sports world, I would imagine. So, when somebody as senior and high profile as Amanda Blanc resigned unexpectedly and there's hearsay knocking around, weren't you curious to find out whether there was any substance to this hearsay?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Are you talking personally or as an organisation?\" said by Brian Davies\n\"As an organisation.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Well, Amanda Blanc was chair of the professional rugby board, which is obviously, by definition, the professional aspect of the sport. We don't have any dealings with the WRU in respect of professional sport. Ours is all about grass roots and the development of the women's game and pathway, so that's where the public investment goes into the WRU. We have no remit on the professional side of the game, and we certainly can't invest lottery funds in anything to do with the professional side of the game. So, we might have been interested, but, as far as I could tell at the time, Amanda wasn't saying why she left. She made no public statement.\" said by Brian Davies\n\"Okay, but if this hearsay had any cause for concern, clearly I understand you're not responsible for the professional rugby board, but were you not curious to make sure that whatever allegations were going around about the culture in the professional game were not spilling out into the rest of the game?\" said by ", "answer": "Jenny Rathbone AM"}
{"content": "\"So, I'd very much like to welcome Sarah Germain, who is the chief executive officer of FareShare, as well as Jen Griffiths, the service manager for Flintshire County Council, and Robbie Davison, in charge of Well Fed. So, welcome to all of you.In light of the fact the Trussell Trust isn't here with us today, I did notice in its evidence that there had been a sort of drop-off in the demand for food, marginally, in the month of July, when there was a cost-of-living payment made by the UK Government, but that it was then back up to really high levels again in August. I just wondered if you could, very briefly, just summarise what the current situation is, given that we have got your written evidence in all cases. Just how difficult is it for organisations that are endeavouring to ensure that everybody is eating and heating?&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"I can start, if you like. So, the demand just isn't going away. It's going up, if anything. As an organisation ourselves that supports other organisations, we are finding that we are getting more and more requests for support. In addition, the organisations that we are working with are also asking for more food. So, the organisations that we are already working with are asking for more food, and we are always having more organisations asking us for food as well.FareShare UK did a survey back in September-October time, and it found that 96 per cent of our community food members in south Wales were saying that they had had an increase in demand since January the previous year. So, that shows that almost every organisation that we are working with has seen that increase in demand.&nbsp;\" said by Sarah Germain\n\"So, are people actually being turned away?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"I don't know if people are being turned away. I know that we, and they, are finding it difficult to meet the demand that is there, and that demand is growing constantly.\" said by Sarah Germain\n\"Okay. Who are the main people who are using these services? We know, obviously, that anybody with children, anybody with a disability, and also private renters whose housing benefit isn't covering the cost of their rent, are in a desperate situation. Is that a reasonable summary of who you are seeing?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"I think that it's across the board. There are all sorts of organisations. We work with all sorts of organisations. We work with everyone from homeless hostels, women's refuges, through to pantries and community kitchens. So, we work with a whole host of organisations, and I think that demand is going up across the board. But the highest levels of demand are within groups\u2014. The highest demand groups are families with children, older people and lone parents. Those are the three highest groups that our community groups are saying that that they've seen an increase in demand from.&nbsp;\" said by Sarah Germain\n\"Okay. Robbie Davison or Jen Griffiths.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"I'd just add that there's a kind of new poverty going on. I don't know if I put in the evidence that we've submitted that we are noticing about a 20 per cent increase in people wanting good food services. What's been interesting, and almost alarming at the same time, is that there are people now coming through the system who have never been in need of food aid or, if you like, poverty services at all. Therefore, they don't know what to do while they are in them. So, for the first time, they are trying to make do with maybe visits to a food bank, maybe visits to a pantry, maybe relying on services like us. But, because it's the first time that they have been involved, they've needed to get involved in services like ours and others. The issue for them, when you're talking to them and you're meeting them for the first time, is that there's a panic\u2014there's a real panic\u2014that they don't know what to do next because they've never been in the situation before. That's coming through now.&nbsp;\" said by Robbie Davison\n\"Okay, thank you. Jen Griffiths.&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you. Flintshire is fairly rural. We've got lots of communities that don't have access to the main town centres\u2014we've got five county towns in Flintshire. And what we are noticing, as Robbie's just said, it's people who've never accessed the system. So, we've got support hubs where we offer advice and guidance, but people are coming in who won't access the benefits system because they wouldn't qualify and they don't meet those criteria. However, they're really struggling to pay their bills. It's eat or heat, feed your children or feed yourself, and it's almost like there's a squeezed middle who are missed by the benefits system because they simply wouldn't qualify. However, because of the cost of living, they're just really struggling to cope, and it's certainly something we've seen through our hub models in Flintshire. People we've never bumped into before are accessing services and trying to find ways to alleviate their situation.&nbsp;\" said by Jen Griffiths\n\"Given that there is clearly so much need, how are organisations managing to meet that need? Sarah, you said that you weren't aware of anybody being turned away, but if the public doesn't support your organisations, then the situation could become a whole lot worse, couldn't it?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Yes, I think they are feeling it\u2014the organisations that are supporting people that are in this situation are starting to feel it themselves. They stepped up to the plate during the pandemic, they've been working really hard all the way through the pandemic to help through that, and then straight off the back of that we're into this cost-of-living crisis. So, I think the organisations are finding it hard. They are feeling that demand. I've got some stats somewhere if I can just find them. They're being hit by the cost-of-living crisis themselves as well, because obviously their bills are going up, the cost of food is going up, wages are starting to go up as well, so the organisations themselves are starting to feel the impact of this as an organisation as well.&nbsp;\" said by Sarah Germain\n\"Robbie.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"It's interesting, because the pressure on, if you like, the third sector is continuing to grow and increase, and it's important to note that. What we've been attempting to do as an organisation is\u2014. We have got a completely different model. We've got a commercial model running alongside a social model, and we are trying desperately to move people away from charity alone and to get them to be contributors to their own well-being. And by that I mean we offer four weeks' worth of support that is free to access, which is meals for a week, but after four weeks we start to charge. But we start to charge at a subsidised rate. So, for four weeks, we charge \u00a310 and people get \u00a340 worth of food, and then for the following four weeks\u2014so, it's 12 weeks in total\u2014they pay \u00a315. The reason this is important is because we are using our profits to subsidise the food, but what we are actually asking people to do is to take part in looking after themselves, moving them away from an over-reliance on charity and getting them back into thinking about their own well-being, at a cost that they can afford. Really, really important\u2014good food has to be affordable, otherwise good food will just not be on offer to people.&nbsp;\" said by Robbie Davison\n\"Thank you. Sioned Williams wanted to follow up on one of your comments. Sioned.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. I just wanted to follow up on a comment made by Sarah from FareShare regarding the increase in demand. In the written evidence, 75 institutions on the waiting list and 42 organisations\u2014[<em>Inaudible</em>.]\u2014in specific areas of Wales\u2014[<em>Inaudible</em>.]\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"Those groups are primarily in south-east Wales, because that's where the majority of our members are. [<em>Interruption</em>.] Sorry.\" said by Sarah Germain\n\"Sorry, Sarah. We just have to take a halt for a moment because we've lost Sioned. Are you able to hear what Sarah Germain's starting to say?&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Yes, I can hear.&nbsp;\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"Excellent. We lost you momentarily. Sarah, please do continue.&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Chair, sorry. Could I just raise a point, which is that I'm having a problem hearing Rob's microphone? I'm not sure if anybody else is having a problem with that microphone.&nbsp;\" said by Jane Dodds MS\n\"Well, I think the technicians can raise the volume on that mike.&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"There is a red light here and it's just gone\u2014\" said by Robbie Davison\n\"No, don't touch\u2014\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"I won't touch it.\" said by Robbie Davison\n\"I think that means you're on.&nbsp;\" said by Sarah Germain\n\"Okay.&nbsp;\" said by Robbie Davison\n\"Can you hear Robbie now, Jane?&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Can you hear me? Great.\" said by Robbie Davison\n\"Okay, that's fine. Sarah, back to you.&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Yes. So, those 75 organisations are across south-east Wales, because that's the majority of where we are. There is another waiting list in north Wales of about 10 organisations up there, and they're across the board. Yes, that's where the\u2014. Yes.&nbsp;\" said by Sarah Germain\n\"Okay. Thank you. I saw Jane next, I think, and then Altaf.&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Yes, I just wanted to ask what's the main reason that adults approach you. We've heard that pensioners and single parents do access your services, but what are the main reasons? Is it because they're on benefits or because they're not being paid enough in employment to afford food? What's the main reason? Thank you.&nbsp;\" said by Jane Dodds MS\n\"So, again, I think there's a variety of reasons, and some of those reasons have changed. It's not just people that are on benefits anymore; a lot of people, as other people have said today, are that squeezed middle\u2014those people that aren't on benefits but are now struggling because the cost of living has risen. They used to be able to cope on what they were earning, but they're now starting to struggle because the cost of living started to rise. And I think the majority of our charities are saying that they're starting to see people for the first time again\u2014a similar theme that's come out before. The reasons behind that, the majority of them are coming to them and asking for food, but there are other things that they're asking for\u2014for help with fuel bills, help with transport costs. There are all sorts of different reasons that they're going to them.&nbsp;\" said by Sarah Germain\n\"Okay. Altaf Hussain.&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"I was curious about the type of subsidised food that is supplied door-to-door at a very reduced cost. What type of food is it? Is it balanced and does it contain sugar and salt? Does it do all the breakfast and two meals? Is it chilled or frozen, because, effectively, how they are trying to, you know, warm their food, and other things? So, that was not clear in their report, and I'd be grateful if you'd let me know about the facts of this or how it is supplied.&nbsp;\" said by Altaf Hussain MS\n\"Robbie Davidson, Altaf wanted to know what type of food was being delivered in the mobile shops?&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"There's a mix. There are cook-at-home meals for people who can actually cook the meals from scratch at home, and the focus is on the evening meal, but the focus is also on staple goods. So, for instance, in the meal box that we provide, if people choose the meals\u2014. And it's important to say that people can choose, so every week we contact and they contact us, and they're selecting from a menu of meals. Once they've selected the meals they've chosen that they can cook at home, then we deliver recipes and the ingredients to do that, and then the staple goods are the milk, the eggs and the bread, and so on.If people are struggling to cook at home\u2014and our experience is that most if not all people, even when they are struggling with utilities, can get access to a microwave at some point\u2014we deliver in ready meals. So, as a comparator, I would draw your attention to Tesco Finest ready meals or Marks and Spencer ready meals, and the quality of the meals that we provide are on that basis. Every meal is nutritionally balanced, all of the meals are signed off by a dietician, and we have a bank of really qualified chefs who bring those meals together. Just to be accurate, we model all of our meal supply on the top 10 meal choices that people naturally go to, to make sure that they fit with family lives.\" said by Robbie Davison\n\"Okay. Thank you for that. Before we dive into further information about food, can I bring in Sarah Murphy, just to identify a little bit more information about how this could be done differently?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Yes. So, quite an open question, so it would be really good to get your thoughts on this. So, for all of you: to what extent has cost-of-living support provided by the Welsh and UK Governments helped the households that you are supporting, and how long lasting have those impacts of support been? Whoever wants to go first. Sorry.\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Jen Griffiths.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you. I think the Government schemes have been really useful, whether they're Welsh Government or UK Government. I think the fuel schemes in particular, where they've moved away from people who are entitled to support and to just helping households, has been really, really useful. We had a tenancy hardship grant scheme during COVID, which was designed to support people who weren't accessing benefits but had a shortfall and were struggling to pay their rent. Unfortunately, the grant conditions with that were so tight that the take-up was really low across all 22 local authorities. It was a really good scheme in principle, but the criteria were so tight, we had lots of money, but we just couldn't support people through that criteria. So, that kind of scheme would be really useful, again, to support people who wouldn't necessarily be able to access the benefits.From a Flintshire perspective, our discretionary housing payment\u2014we pay way above the Department for Work and Pensions contribution; we have done for a number of years, but we've seen an unprecedented increase in that, alongside huge pressure on homelessness and temporary accommodation, and it's all one big picture, really. And we are seeing people accessing temporary accommodation and homelessness services who wouldn't traditionally have fit that model. So, it's lots and lots of pressure for everybody. I think the grant schemes, certainly in the last 18 months, I would say, are significantly better, because they're much more broad and they move out of that eligibility criteria. And, in Flintshire, we've had an excellent take-up and we've marketed, and I think most of the other local authorities have as well. A little tiny bit more lead-in time would be useful\u2014and we have turned all of the schemes around on a sixpence, because we've had to, and, as I say, we've had really good take-up.I think the uniform grant scheme as well, the extension of it across the extended years has been really useful for us, and again, we've had a really good take-up. So, we're pushing the take-up from a local authority and a partner perspective, and I think what's helping around the hub models is that we're arming everybody with the information about all of the support schemes. So, anybody who's prepared to listen to us, we talk and we join things together. So, our support hub model, we take that out with us as well, so as our partner teams or third sector teams are out and about in the community, they're armed with all the information, and that's really key as well. Certainly, with the mobile shop, that's been a phenomenal take-up in those communities, and people are pre-ordering from there now. So, going back to Robbie's point: people want to pay; people don't want to have to rely on charity, and for us, it's about getting that model right so that we can support those people who are struggling currently. The food dynamic is really important, because if people are hungry, they're not going to be able to concentrate and cope, and you know yourself, if you're hungry, you can't think about anything else other than, 'I'm hungry'. So, combining all of those services together, the people who access the services are just\u2014. It's such a broad brush. They might be lonely, isolated, struggling\u2014all of those things that I think we mentioned earlier. Recovery from the pandemic has never really been dealt with, because we've lurched straight into another crisis. So, what we're bumping into is a combination of all of that.&nbsp;\" said by Jen Griffiths\n\"Thank you so much.

I was shocked and saddened, as I'm sure we all are today, to hear of the tragic death of two young people involved in a serious road traffic collision in the Ely area of Cardiff yesterday evening, and our thoughts are with the family and friends of the two young people involved.&nbsp;But I would like to take the opportunity, along with the points that you've made, to thank all those services, and, indeed, the community itself\u2014all those services involved, of health, police, the local authority, fire and rescue services\u2014for the exemplary way they pulled together to handle the situation. And I think it is a reflection of the excellent community safety partnership work that's been done in that part of Cardiff, focusing on it last night. It enabled those services to work together so well in this fast-moving and tragic situation.&nbsp;I do understand that South Wales Police have made arrests in connection with the disorder, and that more will follow, but, clearly, this is something where our thoughts are also with the community\u2014such a warm and strong community. And I know, obviously, that the local authority, our colleagues and elected representatives, and the leader of the council, were all engaged in this. And I was listening to the phone-in with Jason Mohammed\u2014of course, from the Ely area\u2014who actually interviewed the Rev&nbsp;Jan Gould from the Church of the Resurrection. It's a strong community in Ely, and we must remember this as we look to follow up and hear, obviously, what has happened, what the circumstances were surrounding this tragic series of events.&nbsp;\" said by Jane Hutt AM\n\"May I thank Andrew R.T. Davies for putting in this question, and thank you, Minister, for the response? As you mentioned, there is an ongoing investigation, but may I echo the comments made in terms of sharing our deepest, deepest sympathy with the families of the victims, and their friends, of course, and, as you say, the community? Because it is a community, a very strong community, and I know many people are devastated by what happened last night, and the subsequent violence as well. And people are terrified, saying that they are still worried that this could escalate further. And what I would want to ask is: what discussions have taken place to provide reassurance to those in the community that suffered last night\u2014they were terrified in their homes\u2014and, obviously, to deal with the tragic loss of two young people as well?Can I ask also in terms of what seems to be that breakdown in community police relations as well, in terms of miscommunication? We've heard that there may have been miscommunication on social media that led to this. Well, there was absolutely no communication with me as one of the five Senedd Members for the area, to find out anything about what happened or to provide any reassuring messages, and I've still not received any messages. I think there is a role for us as Senedd Members to play in terms of community cohesion, and I would ask the Welsh Government to ensure that all elected Members receive that assurance from South Wales Police, so that we are able to support that message that you have rightly made in terms of peace for the community, but also support to rebuild.\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Diolch yn fawr, Heledd Fychan, and thank you for your words of support and sympathy to the families and to all of those who have been affected by this in the community of Ely. I just want to say that I've already met with the Police and Crime Commissioner for South Wales, Alun Michael, for an update on this incident, and the First Minister has also been briefed. South Wales Police are looking into exactly what happened, the circumstances surrounding this tragic series of events. And, I have to say, it was a fast-moving situation; I think we were only becoming aware, and I know that the local councillors and the police and all the agencies were working to address the situation, as it emerged. Again, I would want to thank those who responded so quickly and speedily to this. In fact, the violent disorder that took place did include attacks on the emergency services, damage to property, causing considerable fear, as you've said, within the community, which is completely unacceptable. So, can I again call for calm and for people to support the police and other services in the work that's being undertaken now? And, of course, in terms of communications, I'm pleased to be responding to this question this afternoon, and we will keep everyone briefed in terms of the ongoing investigation.\" said by Jane Hutt AM\n\"Thank you, Minister, for those responses and for taking the question.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"The next item, therefore, will be our usual first item of questions to the First Minister. The first question is from Hefin David.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"1. Will the First Minister provide an update on Welsh Government support with the cost of school uniform for learners and their families? OQ59582\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Llywydd, the Welsh Government is clear that the cost of school uniform should not be a barrier to learning. Our updated uniform guidance requires schools to prioritise affordability. Funding of \u00a313.6 million has been made available for the school essentials grant for 2023-24 to help reduce concerns around purchase of school uniform and equipment for lower income families.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Diolch, Prif Weinidog. All of those measures put in by the Welsh Government are very welcome. And in complement to that, in Lansbury Park in Caerphilly, Lisa Watkins runs the Caerphilly Uniform Exchange, whereby people can visit to exchange uniforms, to pick up uniforms, and, the most important thing to know, they're open to everyone\u2014regardless of income, you are welcome to go along and use the Caerphilly Uniform Exchange. I'd like perhaps to invite the Minister for education, Jeremy Miles, to come and visit the Caerphilly Uniform Exchange and come and see what's happening. There are similar groups across Wales. Would the First Minister, therefore, as I welcome the Government's policy, also welcome the work that is being done by Lisa Watkins and the volunteers there in Lansbury Park?\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Can I thank Hefin David for that supplementary question, Llywydd, and begin, as I've done before, in thanking him for all the local efforts I know that he makes to promote the help that is available, both from the Welsh Government and also through the fantastic local community effort to which the Member referred? I read with great interest the personal history of Lisa Watkins\u2014how, as a parent, and obliged for other reasons to move from place to place, she found having to replace school uniform every time her children were at a new school a real issue to deal with. And that personal experience motivated her to start up the community interest company that now trades as Caerphilly Uniform Exchange. And the fact that it focuses on recycling school uniforms, both for the cost involved and also because we know that, environmentally, it is far better to be able to reuse and recycle than to buy new each time, is a fantastic service that is being afforded to residents of Hefin David's constituency. As the Member said, Llywydd, these things are replicated elsewhere in other parts of Wales, but I'm sure there's a great deal that can be learned from these local initiatives to make sure that the cost of uniform is never an obstacle to children attending school.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"First Minister, I would like to thank, first of all, my colleague Hefin David for asking this question, but we all just know\u2014. I'm sure we can all appreciate how expensive school uniforms can be, placing a huge financial strain on many families. Anything the Welsh Government can do to help parents with the cost of school uniforms and other essentials, especially in this current climate, is very, very welcome. Back in 2018, the then education Minister suggested scrapping logos in a bid to cut costs. Fast forward five years, and we're still here having the same conversation. Please don't get me wrong, First Minister, as I do believe and sincerely feel that the school essentials grant plays a pivotal role in helping families, but I do feel we could also do more. The current education Minister recently stressed the need for cheaper school uniforms, and then published guidance meaning schools must take that into account when setting school uniform policies. But I do fear slightly, First Minister, that the education Minister maybe, just maybe, is kicking the can down the road when it comes to guidance. So, I feel like we need something a little bit more meaningful right now. First Minister, do you agree that now is the time for the Welsh Government to be taking a much more robust approach on this issue, so we can truly help families all across Wales?&nbsp;\" said by Natasha Asghar MS\n\"Well, Llywydd, I don't think it can, for a moment, be an accurate accusation to suggest that the can is being kicked down the road, because that guidance has already been issued. Nobody is waiting for the guidance; the Minister has published the guidance. It is statutory guidance, it is a great deal stronger than any guidance to be found across the border or, indeed, in London, to take a random example, I'm reminded of by the Trefnydd. And the purpose of the statutory guidance is to make it obligatory for local authorities to respond to the messages that were received in the consultation exercise. The consultation exercise was clear that parents and, indeed, teachers still feel that a school uniform is a useful adjunct to an education, but they don't want it to be a barrier to education either. That is the balance that the statutory guidance faces, and the can is well down the road already.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"2. What progress has the Government made in achieving equality for disabled people? OQ59581\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"I thank the Member for that question. Llywydd, the Welsh Government is committed to equality for disabled people and has set up the disability rights taskforce. It ensures that the voices of disabled people themselves are at the heart of policy and practice. Support for the work of the taskforce is highlighted in the co-operation agreement.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Thank you for the response.&nbsp;\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"In your last Senedd manifesto, your party committed to enshrining the United Nations convention on the rights of disabled people, which utilises the social model of disability, into Welsh law. We are now in 2023 and, despite the establishment of the disability rights taskforce, we're still waiting for this to be enshrined into Welsh law. I gather there is no timetable for it being enshrined into Welsh law during this Senedd, making it look unlikely ahead of the next Senedd elections. First Minister, this matters because the damning 'Locked out' report of 2021 showed just how far we need to go to achieve equality for disabled people in Wales. It's not fair that the disabled employment rate in Wales is nearly half that of non-disabled people. Can you update the Senedd on work to address the inequality that exists for disabled people in this country, First Minister, and ensure that shortcomings identified in previous reports are not identified again in future reports? Diolch.&nbsp;\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"I thank the Member for those important questions, Llywydd. I agree strongly with what he has said about the need to go on addressing the barriers faced by disabled people. We know, from the work of the taskforce and hearing directly from disabled people themselves that they felt that the experience of the pandemic saw a reassertion of the medical model of disability over the social model, and that there is ground that now needs to be made up in making sure that the social model of disability, which was supported across the floor of the Senedd almost two decades ago, and has always been part of the way in which we think of the rights of disabled people, that we recapture that and put some new energy behind it in order to make up for the ground that they felt was lost. To give the Member just one example of that, and as a result of the work of the group, we are looking at the questions in which we explore the impact of disability in the different tests of public opinion that we conduct here in Wales\u2014the different surveys that we commission. If you look at the questions that are asked about disability, members of the taskforce say to us that they are over-influenced by the medical model\u2014they think of disability in that way. As a result, we are going to recast those questions in future, so that future survey questions align with the social model of disability in the way that we would want and the members of the taskforce advise us.As to legislation, we are two years into a five-year term and, although the pressures on the legislative programme are very real, I will make a statement, as ever, Llywydd, before the end of the summer term, setting out proposals for legislation in the Senedd year to come.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"First Minister, sadly, Wales is still a long way from being equal. Disabled people still face barriers and challenges to do things that most of us take for granted. We still hear of incidents of wheelchair users being unable to travel by bus because there are people with prams and buggies using the service, or we hear the common complaint of wheelchair users unable to get on or off a train because they had not booked ahead, that is if they can even get to the platform. First Minister, it has been nearly 30 years since the introduction of the Disability Discrimination Act and almost 15 years since the introduction of the Equality Act, yet disabled people can't even get equal access to public transport. What urgent steps are you taking to guarantee disabled people having equality of access to public transport in Wales?\" said by Altaf Hussain MS\n\"Well, Llywydd, I thank the Member for that supplementary question, and it does indeed illustrate the strength of the social model, which focuses on the way in which society is organised and the social and institutional barriers that restrict disabled people's opportunities. Now, I think a great deal has been done and goes on being done in the field of public transport. The new electric buses that colleagues will see around Wales are designed to full disability standards. The new rolling stock that is being secured for railways here in Wales reflects the needs of contemporary Welsh society. Of course there is a legacy\u2014there is a legacy of buses and of trains built in an earlier era when understanding of these issues was not what it is today. But our ambition is to make sure that as we are able to bring new facilities into operation, they will allow disabled people to have access to public transport and other services just as any other Welsh citizen would expect.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"First Minister, I recently met with the Royal National Institute of Blind People Cymru, who have expressed some concern over what they see as a variation in the support available for children and young people with visual impairments across local authority areas. They also point to a geographic variation in the provision of habilitation services outside of education, which you will know focuses on essential everyday skills for living independently, such as mobility, communication and personal care. I know the Welsh Government is meeting with Guide Dogs Cymru on this, but will you commit the Welsh Government to doing all that it can to work with campaigners to find solutions so that children and young people with visual impairments can access the right support both inside and outside of school?\" said by ", "answer": "Vikki Howells AM"}
{"content": "\"This is our first evidence session on our inquiry into the public health approach to preventing gender-based violence, and I'm very pleased to welcome Lara Snowdon, the public health lead in the violence prevention unit within Public Health Wales. So, thank you very much, Lara, for joining us. We've got your paper, so we've all read it. I wonder if you could set out what the Welsh Government has done, in its vision and frameworks, to support implementation of a public health approach to preventing gender-based violence.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Prynhawn da, Chair. Chair, sorry, would you mind repeating the question? I had a technical issue at the start. Your voice was duplicated. Apologies.\" said by Lara Snowdon\n\"Don't worry. Obviously, there's a new policy action by the Welsh Government on gender-based violence, and, obviously, you're arguing very strongly for a public health approach. Could you tell us how the Welsh Government has approached the vision and the frameworks to ensure that we are implementing a public health approach to preventing gender-based violence?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. We really welcome the inclusion of a public health approach in the violence against women, domestic abuse and sexual violence strategy. I think it will be really key to achieving the goal in the Violence against Women, Domestic Abuse and Sexual Violence (Wales) Act 2015 of ensuring that the Welsh Government implements preventative practice to prevent VAWDASV. However, I think it's fair to say that, at the moment, the approach in Wales is very much in its infancy. So, we have this high-level commitment in the strategy, but there is still a lot of work, really, to do to embed that approach in practice across Wales.We have the blueprint approach as well, which is one of the commitments of the new VAWDASV strategy, and I think that will be really key in terms of developing multi-agency practice for VAWDASV prevention, which is a key part of a public health approach. It's also a tried-and-tested model that has been used for youth justice and women's justice in Wales, and, I think, particularly to navigate the complexities of the devolved and non-devolved landscape as well. So, I think we have this high-level commitment, I think there's a recognition that we should be taking a public health approach, and particularly focusing on prevention, which is really important, and I welcome the focus of the inquiry on it today, but we still have quite a long way to go in terms of actually developing what that looks like in practice.\" said by Lara Snowdon\n\"So, when you talk about a blueprint approach, you're meaning a collaborative approach, are you?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Yes, that's right. So, one of the commitments in the strategy was to take a blueprint approach, which is an approach that has been developed in Wales, particularly with youth justice and women's justice, and it's really a multi-agency action plan. So, it takes that systematic approach that we look for in a public health approach.\" said by Lara Snowdon\n\"Thank you. So, how well are public and private sector organisations engaging with understanding this public health approach?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"As I said, it's really an approach that I think is in its infancy in Wales. So, there is this commitment. I think there's a real drive by a range, particularly, of public sector agencies to understand what this is and to implement it, but there's still a long way to go, I think, in terms of implementing it fully.I wanted to mention as well the serious violence duty. So, this is another legislative driver that we have at the moment to implement a public health approach. The serious violence duty is an amendment to the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. So, it's central Government legislation, but it puts a responsibility on a range of multi-agency partners to take a public health approach to violence prevention. So, I wanted to mention that, because we have these two drivers, really, for taking a public health approach. They're both relatively new. So, with the serious violence duty, they tend to be regional multi-agency partnerships, which are being set up across Wales, to implement a public health approach. There are two statutory responsibilities: one is to do a strategic needs assessment, and one is to do a strategy. So, I think what will be quite important going forward will be to ensure that, with the commitments of the VAWDASV Act and the commitments of the serious violence duty, we ensure that partners can work together across both of those duties, to ensure there isn't duplication or siloed working, really. So, as I said, quite a long way to go to implement it fully, but we certainly now have some of the drivers to ensure that it can be put into place.\" said by Lara Snowdon\n\"Okay. Just very briefly, what's the difference between the serious violence duty and the 'ask and act' that we talk about, colloquially?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"So, 'ask and act' is particularly a duty on health service professionals to be aware of what VAWDASV is and to understand that they have a role in actively asking the question about the experience of VAWDASV, and then taking responsible and appropriate action if they discover that somebody has experienced VAWDASV. The serious violence duty is a piece of legislation that is on organisations to collaborate to take a public health preventative approach to what's termed as serious violence\u2014\" said by Lara Snowdon\n\"So, you're saying that 'ask and act' only applies to the health service, not to the education service, the housing service, or anything else?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Sorry, it's because I'm from public health, so particularly in my sphere of work we're working to ensure that it's implemented across health, but there's a wider multi-agency responsibility on 'ask and act'.\" said by Lara Snowdon\n\"Okay. Just to put some slightly counter views to you: Dr Burrell, of Durham University, supports the public health approach, but says that the gendered roots of violence against women and girls must remain front and centre. Is that something you agree with, or do you think that we need to change the emphasis?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"No, I absolutely agree with Dr Burrell, and very much respect Dr Burrell, particularly in his role in engaging men and boys in the prevention of gender-based violence. In terms of gender-based violence, really, the clue is in the title\u2014it's where gender is recognised as a causal factor in what causes that violence to take place. So, we can understand gender as a causal factor, but then intersect it by other risk and protective factors, which may increase or decrease the risk of VAWDASV taking place. So, we quite often would describe gender as a cause and a consequence\u2014. Sorry, we would quite often understand gender-based violence as a cause and a consequence of gender inequality. So, gender inequality underpins gender-based violence, but it also reproduces it as well. It's really important to understand this, because this tells us a lot about what the preventative measures are.So, again, through a public health approach, we would talk about modifiable risk factors; so, these are factors that can be changed, which is the key part of how preventative programmes are developed. We know that people of the male sex are more likely to perpetrate violence, as well as gender-based violence, but we also know that particular kinds of social norms are harmful\u2014so, those that are rooted in patriarchal norms, misogyny, sexism\u2014and we know that those social norms can lead to violence. So, through the VAWDASV literature review, we really found that programmes that sought to transform those harmful gender norms, and to work alongside men and boys, to really critically think about what those social norms look like, and then how they can engage in them, to change them among their peer group, really, is a really important thing that we can do for the prevention of gender-based violence.I think the only other thing really to say on this is around intersectionality. So, whilst we have to remember that gender is front and centre, gender is intersected by other intersections, I guess, of social categories. So, that could be something like socioeconomic deprivation, or race, or sexuality, or religion, and some of these things can make women and girls, in particular, more at risk of experiencing gender-based violence. It could also change the nature of the violence that is experienced as well as the response that they get from the services that they try to access. So, sorry, a slightly long answer there, but we can certainly understand gender as a causal risk factor, which is intersected by other factors as well.\" said by Lara Snowdon\n\"Okay. I agree that this is not <em>Daily Mail</em> stuff. [<em>Laughter</em>.] Just finally from me, could you tell me how well you think the VAWDASV strategy understands the complexity of reaching different diverse communities, such as those you've outlined, so that we're confident that it's going to reach all women and girls, and indeed, men and boys?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Again, I think, really, I have the same answer in the sense that it's fantastic that intersectionality is recognised in the VAWDASV strategy, but again, I think there is a long way to go to ensure that the diversity that we have in communities in Wales is represented in VAWDASV prevention and response. So, some examples that we know of research that has been conducted in Wales, such as the 'Uncharted Territory Review', which explored the experiences of women and girls who are migrants, asylum seekers or refugees, wasn't included in the VAWDASV strategy, for example. So, we know that there's a lot of research going on, we know that there's a lot more to do, but having, as a principle, intersectionality, and particularly understanding how prevention programming can intersect with the needs of diverse communities, is going to be really important going forward.&nbsp;\" said by Lara Snowdon\n\"Thank you. I'll now ask Sarah Murphy to come in.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you very much for being here with us this morning. I'm going to ask some questions now about evidence and data. Public Health Wales's systematic review of what works in preventing VAWDASV was published in September 2021. The national advisers for VAWDASV say that the Public Health Wales review has not yet been included in the Welsh Government's VAWDASV strategy. Do you know what the reasons for this are, please?\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Unfortunately, I don't think I can answer your question directly, because that would be a question for Welsh Government. I do\u2014\" said by Lara Snowdon\n\"Okay. If I phrase it differently then: do you think that there is sufficient transparency and accountability in the delivery of the VAWDASV strategy and blueprint?\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Yes. Again, really, this is in the very early stages of implementation; the governance around the blueprint has only recently been established. So, I think we will be looking to see, over the next year or so, how this is implemented. The high-level work plans for the blueprint are now just being published, I believe. I've had assurance that prevention has been included, but I haven't yet seen the detail of that, unfortunately. So, unfortunately, I think it's a bit too early to be really looking at that, but I want to say to Welsh Government colleagues, 'Please do reach out and talk to us about how we can ensure that the blueprint plans are as evidence-based and as theory-based as possible.' We do have this fantastic resource of the VAWDASV systematic review that we can draw upon; there's a lot of evidence in there about what works. Where there are gaps, we need to really understand how we can take a co-ordinated response to research and evaluation for gender-based violence prevention. So, I'm really looking forward to working with colleagues on taking that forward.\" said by Lara Snowdon\n\"Thank you very much. Can I ask why the systematic review covered primary and secondary interventions, but not tertiary prevention? And, what are the benefits of developing multi-agency data on gender-based violence to measure the prevalence and trends and to monitor inequalities and track progress in prevention? How feasible do you think it is for it to be able to cover all of this?\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"To answer the first part of your question, we focused on primary and secondary prevention because, really, they are areas of both research and practice that are generally under-represented, so I really welcome the committee focusing on this as part of the inquiry. There is really a wealth of evidence around tertiary prevention in comparison to primary and secondary prevention, which is why we decided to focus on this.&nbsp;In addition, it would be absolutely huge if you focused on all three areas. So, that was the reason to focus on that, as well as to meet the commitments in the VAWDASV Act around prevention.&nbsp;On the second part of your question, around data, I think this answers your former question as well, in a sense, because one of the commitments of the VAWDASV Act is to develop a set of national indicators to measure progress around VAWDASV prevention. That is going to be the kind of key thing that we can do to understand whether the strategy and whether the blueprint approach are being effective, essentially. I know that some work has started on the national indicators, but, again, I think this is going to be really critical to ensure that we're understanding that population-level change towards VAWDASV prevention. It really needs to be underpinned by a robust theory of change that is based on evidence and based on a principle to evaluate all of the blueprint activity to ensure that the indicators match the theory of change. So, I think that will be really key to holding partners to account, but also to ensuring that overall governance, really, for the VAWDASV strategy and blueprint.\" said by Lara Snowdon\n\"Thank you. My last question, then, and you've already touched on this a bit. We've heard that the current 'ask and act' duty doesn't empower professionals to act, often because they are unsure about how to handle a disclosure and the responsibility that they will have as individuals for managing the risk. Do you have details of any reviews into how effectively legislative duties such as the 'ask and act' duty are being delivered, please?\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Again, I think I'm probably not the best person to ask that, unfortunately; I'm not directly involved in the delivery of 'ask and act'. I've obviously seen the Welsh Government evaluation of 'ask and act'. One thing I would say about the evaluation that's been done is that it's really fantastic to have an evaluation of the implementation, but it is a process-and-outcomes evaluation; it's not looking at the impact of 'ask and act'. So, I think, going forward, it would be really great to fully understand the impact that 'ask and act' is having in Wales, because, at the moment, we're really working without knowing what the impact of it is, so that's something really important, I think, to take forward.\" said by Lara Snowdon\n\"Yes, thank you very much, and thank you, Chair.\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Thank you. I just want to ask you about some specific interventions. The 'Don't be a bystander' campaign has been run by the Welsh Government for, I think, about six months, and I just wondered whether Public Health Wales was involved in helping to shape that, the procurement of that intervention. What is the evidence base that such an investment is one worth doing?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"There was formerly a campaign called 'Don't be a bystander', which was run by the Welsh Government. There's been a procurement process to procure an organisation to deliver bystander training across Wales. So, I believe what you're referring to is the latter, is that correct\u2014or both?&nbsp;\" said by Lara Snowdon\n\"Well, what was the evidence base for investing money in an advertising campaign and then, obviously, how much has that influenced the procurement of a new bystander training programme?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"I wasn't involved in the 'Don't be a bystander' campaign, unfortunately, so I won't be able to talk to that.\" said by Lara Snowdon\n\"Fine, okay.\" said by ", "answer": "Jenny Rathbone AM"}
{"content": "\"So, we'll go on to the second item on the agenda today, and in today's meeting we will be hearing evidence from a number of stakeholders to inform the committee's work on the Welsh Government electric vehicle charging strategy and action plan.

Now, of the total, 6.4 per cent could be found in Wales, and that comes to about 2,400 chargers all in all in Wales. In data that we analysed for the first three quarters of last year\u2014so, at the end of September\u2014there were 1,026 slow and fast public chargers in Wales, and 223 rapid and ultra-rapid chargers in Wales. That gives a total of 1,249 at the end of September 2022.As to whether the amount is adequate, it has to be seen, in our opinion, in the form of ratios, because the number of chargers themselves is actually a very blunt figure. Unless you contextualise it by way of looking at the number of plug-in vehicles there are on the road in a particular region\u2014Wales, for example\u2014you wouldn't be able to form an intelligent opinion, which is why we crunched some ratios. The central Government Department for Transport also has its own preferred ratio, which is the number of chargers per 100,000 population. We disagree with that ratio, simply because population per se, human beings, don't need to charge; vehicles do. Furthermore, not everybody in the population owns a car or a van, or drives a vehicle. Therefore, the ratio that we suggest is more intelligible\u2014it's the number of plug-in cars per charger, because plug-in cars do need to charge.So, looking at the ratios that we have freshly crunched, and using data from the Department for Transport for chargers, and our provisional Motoparc data, which is the number of vehicles on the road, and looking at just Wales, I'm pleased to say that, actually, although there is a deterioration everywhere in the UK in terms of ratio, the deterioration in Wales is actually quite modest. So, back in 2021, there were 15 plug-in cars for every slow and fast charger in Wales. And, at the end of September last year, the ratio had deteriorated slightly to 19:1. So, 19 plug-in cars for every slow and fast charger in Wales. In terms of rapid and ultra-rapid chargers, at the end of 2021, there were 45 battery electric vehicles to every rapid and ultra-rapid charger in Wales, and the ratio has deteriorated slightly to 52:1, which is not a major deterioration compared to the deterioration of these ratios in many other regions in the UK. In case you're interested, to contextualise this versus the national average, the UK average, the UK average for plug-in cars to slow and fast public charger ratio is 34:1; in Wales, it's 19:1, as I mentioned just now. So, Wales is actually doing better than the national average. And, in terms of battery electric vehicles to rapid and ultra-rapid chargers, it's 88:1 nationally; it's 52:1 in Wales.&nbsp;\" said by David Wong\n\"That's pretty good, because\u2014\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"That's very interesting. Sorry, Janet.&nbsp;\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Yes, that's pretty good, because we all have constituents who maintain that they're struggling to use electric vehicles in the way they'd like because of a shortage of chargers. But, clearly, even though we're better than the UK average, we still need more, don't we?\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"Absolutely. Without pre-empting some of the questions that may follow, if I may say that, looking at your action plan, you're targeting about seven to 11 cars per charger by 2025. And, as it is written in the plan, as adoption of these vehicles increases, you're looking at 25:1. So, in the context of your key performance indicators or your target, of course, at the moment Wales is behind those targets, but not very far behind, which is good. However, these things have to be contextualised. These are figures that I've quoted\u2014hard evidence\u2014but these things have to be also contextualised in terms of actual experience of plug-in car drivers on the road, or any motorist, for example. So, I routinely talk to Uber or taxi drivers whenever I'm in one. For example, last evening, travelling from Cardiff Central to the hotel, the Uber driver basically told me that he is not ready to make the transition, because, for him, he couldn't see adequate public chargers for his use or his colleagues' use\u2014that's private hires\u2014in Cardiff. So, while the features are great, perhaps a bit more attention ought to be paid to ensuring that the chargers are in the right places, and the right types of chargers in the right places, even though perhaps the numbers are not too bad.\" said by David Wong\n\"Okay. We'll pursue some of that as we go along. And I'll come on to the other guests as well in a minute. I just wanted to ask, as you framed that in the context of it being related to the number of EVs that we have, in terms of how many charge points, well, of course, do we have an equivalent uptake of EVs in Wales. Because if we only have 10 in Wales, then the figures look good, but, actually, it's not, is it?\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Part of the reason why the ratios in Wales are actually quite promising is because the number of EVs on the road in Wales is actually quite low. So, I could tell you that our provisional parc figures show that, at the end of September last year, there were about 11,500 battery electric vehicles on the road in Wales. In terms of plug-in hybrids, about 7,800 of these, giving the total of all plug-ins at just under 20,000. And, of course, by the end of last year, we reached a million plug-in registrations in the whole of the UK.\" said by David Wong\n\"Okay. Huw.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Just to follow-up on that line of questioning, how much of this is skewed on a UK figure by London and the south-east, or other geographic factors? So, for example, in terms of uptake of electric vehicles, is Wales pretty much comparative to the north-east or north-west of England, and the south-east far outstripping the uptake of electric vehicles?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"I think you're right. The south-east particularly has skewed the entire national figure, because our figures suggest that, actually, the number on the road in the south-east is 10 times what you have in Wales.\" said by David Wong\n\"Yes, okay.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Joyce.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"The next obvious question is: the south-east is quite a bit more wealthy than anywhere in Wales, so have you factored-in affordability of the vehicles as well, in terms of distribution of ownership?\" said by Joyce Watson AM\n\"That is a very good question, and a very important matter, because we've been always been saying as an industry that, as Government has asked consumers to make this transition by 2030 and then 2035, it has to ensure that it's affordable for the people. It's no point asking people to make this transition when people actually couldn't afford it. So, at the moment, because of the cost of production, 30 per cent to 45 per cent of which is actually embedded in the battery of the vehicle, hence it's expensive\u2014and the cost of the battery has gone up because of the hike in critical raw material prices and other supply chain issues as well\u2014because of that, it is very difficult to tell people that, 'Actually, you can easily make this transition because it won't hurt you in the pocket in the near term.' Yes, EVs have a very much more favourable running cost, but it's actually the upfront cost that is quite prohibitive, which is why we were looking to Government for some support, but, as of June last year, the plug-in car grant was completely ended and at the moment there's no support for private consumers, apart from zero-rated vehicle excise duty, which will end by spring 2025. There's much more support for the fleet and business sector, particularly in the form of very attractive company car tax.So, our view is that this transition must be for everybody because it's about social equity. No-one, regardless of the segment of users, whether it's private or business or fleet, and no-one from any sort of background or social standing should be disadvantaged in this transition, because everybody must be able to make this transition by 2030 and 2035.\" said by David Wong\n\"Can I ask just one\u2014?\" said by Joyce Watson AM\n\"Yes, and take us on to the next line of questioning there. I'm keen to bring other witnesses in. They've been very patient, in fairness. But ,Joyce, yes, go on. Carry on, and then we'll bring the others in.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"I was just going to ask the obvious follow-through from what you've just said and whether you've done any analysis of help that might be available in other countries outside the EU, what that looks like and where they are, because whilst we're comparing areas within the EU with each other, we also need to compare transitions in other countries and the support. If you haven't got it now available, it would be useful for us to know.&nbsp;\" said by Joyce Watson AM\n\"We'd be very pleased to send you the analysis. We certainly have done the analysis. In summary, there are quite a number of major markets in Europe that have continued to support the transition via consumer incentives. Quite a number of these markets are scaling back the incentives gradually, but they have never removed these incentives completely like the UK. So, we are a little bit, if you like, of an outlier in that sense.\" said by David Wong\n\"Thank you. I'm going to look at the strategic vision and the KPIs, which, basically, is what we've already done. The Welsh EV charging infrastructure vision is, as you say, that the use of electric cars and vans is going to accelerate. Can users at the moment, in your view or anybody else's view, be confident about accessing that charging infrastructure? Because we've done cars per people, but there's a geographic spread as well.&nbsp;\" said by Joyce Watson AM\n\"I'd like to bring some of the other witnesses in on this, if I may. Paul Bevan, first of all.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Diolch. The vision itself is a good one, the confident measure is a good one. Confidence and cost are the barriers that exist to EV uptake, but measuring it is a bit trickier. I would certainly say that drivers cannot be confident today in traversing across Wales. David talked a moment ago about numbers, but it's not a pure numbers game, it's about distribution, particularly distribution of fast en route charging. I think the vision itself is fine, but, really, there need to be some stronger measures underneath. Electric car drivers ask themselves two questions, really: 'Can I charge my vehicle where I'm not using it at a fair cost at home or on the street?' and, 'Can I be sure of safe and reliable access to high-speed charging hubs when I'm on a longer journey across Wales?' You can link this to all kinds of metrics, but, ultimately, they're the two questions that we need to ask ourselves, and I think the answer at the moment to both across Wales is still 'no'.\" said by Paul Bevan\n\"Thank you. Professor Cipcigan, would you like to add anything?\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Yes. Thank you very much. I would like to add a couple of points in relation to some discussion on equity and social justice. I would like to give the example of the Scottish Government. They are providing \u00a330 million to accelerate the shift to zero-emission transport, but this time this support is for communities that are disadvantaged, for example funding interest-free loans for second-hand vehicles. I think this is a very good incentive.You have mentioned already some examples worldwide. There is a similar incentive in California for residents who live in disadvantaged communities in the enhanced fleet modernisation programme. These are eligible to receive an additional $3,000 to $5,000, and this is depending on income and the type of electric vehicle. Separately, they are receiving also $2,000 for the installation of an electric vehicle charger. So, I think there should be a different incentive for these low-income communities, because it is well known that they are in an area that could face a high level of emissions. So, in this case, they are disadvantaged also for this transition to electrification.In terms of the action plan, there is not enough granularity on the actions. There needs to be a split into subactions in order to have confidence that these are achieved. Sometimes, the targets are quite vague. Ten years is not a good target for the charging infrastructure, seeing as we have the ban on new petrol and diesel cars in 2030. So, we need a little bit more ambitious targets for achieving all of these actions.\" said by Dr Liana Cipcigan\n\"Thank you for that. There have been concerns as well that some of the KPI deadlines haven't been met either, so I'd imagine, on the back of what you've just said, Professor Cipcigan, that you'd be concerned, for example, that the establishment of the connections group hasn't happened, the review of building regulations hasn't happened, as was promised, and the establishment of a chargepoint operator group as well. These targets haven't been met.&nbsp;\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Yes, and also recognising the value of equality and social justice in all these documents. Actually, these are not mentioned\u2014not at all. Because we know that there is also an environmental injustice in areas with higher deprivation, because this links with high levels of outdoor air pollution. And also they don't have enough funding in order to install any low-carbon technologies.\" said by Dr Liana Cipcigan\n\"Okay. Thank you very much. I'm conscious, Olly Craughan, that we haven't given you an opportunity yet. I'd imagine, just picking up on what Joyce said earlier about distribution, if there's a density of charge points, let's say, along the M4, along the A55, then that, really, doesn't help you.\" said by ", "answer": "Llyr Gruffydd AM"}
{"content": "\"Item 2 is our pre-appointment hearing for the role of chair of Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board, and an evidence session with the Welsh Government's preferred candidate. The committee's role is to provide views on the suitability of the Welsh Government's preferred candidate for appointment to the role, and then it is, of course, for the Minister to decide whether or not to proceed with the appointment. This morning is an opportunity for Members to question the Government's preferred candidate for the role, who is Jonathan Morgan, who is with us this morning. Thank you, Jonathan Morgan, for joining us this morning. I'm grateful to you for being with us. Perhaps I could just start with the first question. I can see that you've provided the committee with your background information and a CV, which outlines your experience and background. But I suppose my question would be how are you going to draw on the skills and experience that you've outlined to us in order to ensure that the health board and the organisation has strong governance, accountability and financial management.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Thank you, Chair, and a very good morning to you and to the committee. I think I bring varied experience to the role. For the past 12 months, I have been one of the independent members on the board at Health Education and Improvement Wales. For the past three years, I have been chairing the board of a major housing association in Cardiff that delivers not only homes but also a range of social care services, both domiciliary care and residential and nursing care. I spent three years, some time ago, heading up the business unit for the Association of Directors of Social Services. So, what I hope I bring, certainly in my experience and my work in the past 12 years, is a deep understanding, not only of the workings of the health service, but certainly the opportunities that exist with social care, housing and other partners to better deliver the services that people need. That breadth of experience I would hope to bring to the role. I was very fortunate to spend three years chairing the audit and risk committee for the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales, and I currently sit on the audit committee for the Future Generations Commissioner for Wales, and that understanding of governance\u2014the importance of firm, robust governance arrangements\u2014I think will also stand me in good stead, if the Minister were to confirm the appointment.\" said by Jonathan Morgan\n\"Thank you. Is there anything else that you would like to add in terms of drawing on your experiences or specific experiences that you would apply in terms of the position?\" said by Russell George AM\n\"If I were to look at my role as chair of Hafod housing, one of the important areas of board responsibility\u2014and probably the most important area, of course\u2014is to set the overall strategy and to work collectively with the executive team, providing that support and challenge, to understand how that strategy is being implemented. That is done in a variety of different ways, but making sure you have those robust, fair, open, transparent relationships between independent and non-executive members and the executive team is really quite crucial. What I would hope to bring to this role is a deep understanding and experience of having done that at a major housing association. At the point at which I was brought in as chair, it was under what's termed 'a regulatory judgment'. One of the reasons was governance, and we have worked extremely hard to improve the robustness of those governance arrangements, the openness and transparency of those working relationships, the quality of the reporting to board. All of those things are relevant in any organisation where you have that relationship between executive members and non-executive or independent members. So, robustness of governance is something that I would bring. There are probably a number of things I would want to review in Cwm Taf Morgannwg, if I were to be appointed chair, particularly around the governance, just to assure myself that things were as robust as they can be. I think that experience of having achieved that elsewhere would be a benefit to the organisation.\" said by Jonathan Morgan\n\"Thank you. It might be that some Members want to pick up on some of your answers to the opening questions. Finally from me on this section, are there any other appointments that you currently hold that you believe could be a conflict of interest, or could be seen as a perceived conflict of interest, and how you would deal with or manage that?&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Russell George AM\n\"There are those matters that would certainly be conflicted if I were to take up the role, if the Minister were to offer the appointment. My understanding is that the appointment would run from April; I think that is the timescale that we were informed of. Certainly, I would be standing down from the board at HEIW, because you're not allowed to sit on two different health boards. I would not be a member of the audit committee of the future generations commissioner, because health bodies, as you know, Chair, fall within the remit of the commissioner. And I would be standing down as chair of Hafod housing, the conflict there being that Hafod housing provides some nursing care support within the Cwm Taf Morgannwg region. So, those conflicts would cease. In fact, if the role were to commence in April, then my three final meetings of all those organisations will be in the last week of March. I would put the arrangements in place to ensure that those conflicts were dealt with immediately. The other area of work that I've very much enjoyed in the last 12 years is that I've undertaken some consultancy work in the field of social care, a lot of which has been within the Cwm Taf Morgannwg region. Obviously, I will ensure that no other work, if there was to be any other work\u2014and I don't think I would have much time left on my hands if I was undertaking this role\u2014would conflict with the role of chair.&nbsp;\" said by Jonathan Morgan\n\"I notice from your CV that you also work for some Senedd Members as well.&nbsp;\" said by Russell George AM\n\"That would come to a conclusion.&nbsp;\" said by Jonathan Morgan\n\"Lovely. Thank you. Sarah Murphy.&nbsp;\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Thank you very much, Chair. Thank you for being here this morning to answer some of our questions. This follows on quite nicely, I think, from what you were just saying about social care. As the Member for Bridgend, obviously, CTMUHB covers my community and we have the Princess of Wales Hospital in my constituency as well. I know just from constituents and talking to many stakeholders that there are quite a few issues facing CTMUHB at the moment, including, for example, the anticipated publication of the regional area plan, questions about the future of critical care across the three main hospital sites, the distribution of community and step-down beds, and also whether Maesteg Community Hospital will be reopened for community beds. The committee, of course, wouldn't expect you to have detailed answers on these matters today, but could you tell us more about your vision for the integration of health and social care, and how you would plan, as chair, to lead the health board through these challenges?&nbsp;\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Thank you, Sarah, for the question. If I could just deal very quickly with the vision and the mission of the health board, as you'll be aware, the health board's mission is to build healthier communities together. All health boards are attempting to respond to the challenges of emerging from a global pandemic, and now are facing quite significant challenges, particularly in the additional costs that health boards have met around increases in energy supply costs, the increase in agency nursing, and the challenges of ensuring we have an appropriately skilled, motivated and supported workforce.&nbsp;What I will say is I think it's important that we set out very clearly our ambition to provide high-quality safe care to everybody within the Cwm Taf Morgannwg region, and to set our work accordingly to achieve that particular agenda. I think we are able to do more in partnership than we have yet been able to achieve. That's not a criticism of our health boards; it's sometimes difficult to find ways in which to get organisations to work. The regional partnership boards have been, I think, somewhat successful in pulling people together strategically to have those conversations about where organisations can better work together, but if you look at what we spend across health, social care and housing and look at the capacity of our third sector partners, there is clearly a lot more we can do.I think Sarah is right to raise the integration agenda, particularly in the context of Bridgend. There is an ambitious piece of work being done at the moment between the health board and Bridgend County Borough Council to look at how we can better integrate adult health and social care services. I really welcome that. Having spent a lot of time in the past 12 years working with different organisations who have the ambition to work more collectively with other organisations, it's really good to see this happening. Perhaps the Bridgend model could be a model that's held up for other parts of the country. We know we can get more out of a substantial amount of working together, greater integration of services.There will be consequences. I think it will mean that we have to think more carefully about workforce planning, about different roles, modifying roles in the future to make sure they're fit for purpose, but I think the opportunity to provide better services closer to home, helping people to remain as healthy as possible without the need for hospital admission, is something that we have to really grasp very, very quickly. It's about the opportunity of caring for people closer to home without the need to go into hospital, and also ensuring that we have the right sort of facilities to help people leave hospital when they are well enough to do so, I think that\u2019s been a challenge for all of us in Wales.There are examples elsewhere of where there are different schemes that help people leave hospital. There are certain parts of England, for example, where there are discharge-to-assess schemes, where, if you\u2019re medically fit, you leave hospital and you go somewhere else for a period of time where your needs are better assessed. I think we need to be looking at all options. We should be considering where our facilities are. We need to be looking at our overall estate to see where we can support people to leave hospital more quickly so that their needs can be better assessed. Assessing someone\u2019s needs whilst in hospital isn\u2019t always the best place to do it, and I think that\u2014. Sorry, Sarah.\" said by Jonathan Morgan\n\"I was just going to say \u2018thank you very much\u2019. I think that\u2019s an excellent answer.\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Do you have any further questions, Sarah?\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Yes. I was also just going to raise with Jonathan that the escalation status in maternity and neonatal services is very worrying. The quality governance and quality related to performance and long waiting times are currently at targeted intervention level, and the escalation status for planning and finance is at enhanced monitoring. So, how confident are you that you have the ability to guide and support the health board in making the necessary improvements to performance and quality governance, but also at the same time instil that culture that encourages staff, patients and families and the public to raise concerns and know that they\u2019re going to be appropriately addressed? And how that\u2019s communicated to patients as well, please.\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Thank you, Sarah. Firstly, I think it is important to recognise, as Welsh Government has already done, the enormity of the work in the past four years that has been achieved by the health board in addressing the very real concerns that were raised about the quality, safety, leadership and governance of the maternity services. I would like to ensure that we continue to build on that. There\u2019s always a risk when organisations believe that improvement is being secured that somehow you can take your eye off the ball and just focus on other things. There are other things, of course, that the health board has to focus on, but certainly a continued, relentless focus on the quality and the safety of maternity services is something that will have to feature over the next few years within the health board. I will ensure that that happens as a matter of course, not only within the health board meetings, but certainly with the opportunity to hold specific board development sessions where we focus in more acutely on how well we are delivering services in maternity care.It does come down to leadership. Those improvements I think are now being felt. Obviously, people have to have confidence in services. I think that certainly my view is that we should continue to do more to communicate those improvements to the wider population so that they can see and feel the changes. I think it\u2019s important that we continue to demonstrate that we will focus on it as much as we\u2019re able to by looking at data, by looking at case studies, and by ensuring we engage with staff, because the staff are absolutely critical in the delivery of our services. I have no intention of sitting back and assuming that everything\u2019s been sorted. There is still a journey. We\u2019re still under targeted intervention, and I expect that process to be very robust.\" said by Jonathan Morgan\n\"Thank you very much. Thank you, Chair.\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Thank you. Rhun ap Iorwerth.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Diolch. You\u2019ve touched on this already, at the end of your answer there. You\u2019ll be taking the role at a time of unprecedented disquiet among NHS staff, with an ongoing pay dispute. You wouldn\u2019t be able to offer a resolution on the pay front or on changing terms and conditions, but you would be expected to play a leading role when it comes to staff morale. What would be your approach in the incredibly difficult context to ensuring that morale is as good as it possibly can be?\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"You\u2019re right, I can\u2019t sit here and make a promise that I can suddenly resolve all of the challenges that we face. There are a range of issues&nbsp;that I think the health board, and the NHS collectively, needs to respond to, and I think it's doing quite a lot to do that.So, firstly\u2014. I'll come to the pay dispute secondly, but, in respect of staff recruitment, we have, in Cwm Taf Morgannwg, around 14,000 members of staff. Do we have enough staff doing all of the right things? I don't think we do, and I don't think any other health board in Wales could claim that it does. We know that recruitment and retention have become more challenging. We saw the impact of the COVID pandemic on our staff. I know from my role as an independent member at Health Education and Improvement Wales that a huge amount of work has been done in the last few years to increase the commissioning number of postgraduate nursing places that we are offering in Wales. That has increased substantially in the last three-to-four years. It's becoming more difficult now to recruit people into those training places and it's becoming more difficult to hang on to them before they even qualify. It's then difficult, again within the first two to three years, to keep them in post when they are there.As chair, I'm acutely aware of those problems, of those gaps, where those gaps are, and what I will say to our staff is that I will be a very visible, vocal advocate for our staff. I have got nothing but praise for the professionalism, the compassion and the skill that our staff have. I think we have some of the best staff anywhere in the world. Do we articulate that enough? I don't think we do, and what they will get from me is somebody who will listen very acutely; who will not just listen to what they say to me but ensure that we use that information from our staff in our board considerations. There's no point just saying, 'I've got an open door; please come and tell me what you think.' Yes, come and tell me what you think, and then I'll ensure that we use that information in our discussions with the executive team and our team leaders throughout the health board to see how we can improve the experience of our staff.On staff well-being, for example, I know that, in all of the major health sites within the health board area, we have well-being champions. I think that's really important, and I think we ought to be doing more to promote our sites for exercise and recreation, which I know that many of our staff take advantage of. That in itself, I think, goes some way to supporting and recognising the challenges that many of our staff face.The pay dispute has been very challenging, obviously, and people do have the right to strike if they wish. As a health board, all we can do is respond to that by ensuring that we do everything possible to put the right number of nurses and clinicians in place when such action is taken. If I could solve the pay dispute today, I would, but there are other things that I could do as chair. Making sure that I am listening to our staff, engaging in those staff groups, talking to our team leaders\u2014all of that, I hope, will make a difference, because there's nothing worse than working in a challenging environment where you feel that no-one is listening to you. It can't just be your immediate line manager; it needs to be the people right throughout the organisation.&nbsp;\" said by Jonathan Morgan\n\"What do you think are the particular lessons that have been learnt relating to maternity services and special measures, and then targeted intervention, around that need for communications?\" said by ", "answer": "Rhun ap Iorwerth AM"}

So, I think, both in terms of the education international approach and research links, it's been a very important relationship for us.\" said by Amanda Wilkinson\n\"Does anyone else want to go? Berwyn. Can we unmute Berwyn, please? Great.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"So, just to add to that, INTERREG&nbsp;has definitely been an important funding source, but so have the framework programmes in the past. I wouldn't say Ireland is at the top of our list of historical partnerships, but they are very important. We've had, I think, 19 projects with Irish partners in Horizon 2020, the previous programme. We haven't really got the data for Horizon Europe in terms of relations with Ireland. But Ireland is an extremely successful country in terms of Horizon 2020. I think it reached its targets of getting \u20ac1.2 billion out of Horizon 2020. So, it's an important partner for us to partner in that European context as well, in terms of research.\" said by Berwyn Davies\n\"Thank you for that. Before I go back to see whether Oliver wants to contribute, Hefin wants to ask a question.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Yes. Can I just come back to Amanda? I'm just wondering, from a universities perspective, are there any franchised arrangements, franchised courses in Ireland\u2014any of the kind of international arrangements that we see across the world?\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Sorry, do you mean franchising within Ireland?\" said by Amanda Wilkinson\n\"Yes, franchising within Ireland. Yes, or any other kind.\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"I don't know the answer to that, Hefin, but I can check and find out for you.\" said by Amanda Wilkinson\n\"Okay. I'm just wondering about the relationships between universities here and higher education in the country and whether there's the development of the kinds of partnership links you'd see with, say, Greece or China, or anything like that.\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"I'm not aware of those sorts of relationships with Ireland, Hefin, but I will check, but not as commonly as you would find with other countries and other regions.\" said by Amanda Wilkinson\n\"Okay, thanks.\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Thanks for that.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Oliver, did you want to add anything to this?\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Yes. I would say that, from a business perspective, a decent portion of Welsh trade is with Ireland, but there's a great opportunity for there to be more that's done through the Celtic connection and through sectors that would benefit both Ireland and Wales\u2014so, tourism, manufacturing, travel, that kind of thing.\" said by Oliver Carpenter\n\"If I can just pick up from that point, then, what do you think needs to happen to facilitate that? What are the barriers at the moment?\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"That's a good question. There's the general barrier of the economy at the moment, which isn't very conducive to trade. Obviously, recently, with the Windsor framework that's recently come in with Northern Ireland, that's slightly eased trading tensions between the UK and Northern Ireland, and, as a proxy, that will affect the likelihood of Wales's trade to Northern Ireland and therefore Wales to Ireland as well.&nbsp;I would say that one of the barriers is, therefore, the economy, and I would say partially its infrastructure. We know that soon in Wales we're going to hopefully be getting a free port, potentially, an economic investment zone, and that will help as well. And then, also, it's probably partially political will as well. I think there needs to be more done from those in Welsh Government to push for trade with Ireland.\" said by Oliver Carpenter\n\"Thank you. If I can just pick up more generally, then, you've mentioned some of the challenges. Obviously, the B word\u2014Brexit\u2014is something that came through strongly in terms of the evidence received prior to this, and especially with some of the universities, in terms of projects and so on. Can I just ask, therefore, in terms of some of the challenges that you're seeing\u2014I think it was the evidence that suggested some of the challenges between movement of students, collaboration with Erasmus, et cetera\u2014if you could expand on some of the impacts of Brexit and some of the challenges that we need to overcome if we're to continue to develop these relationships? I don't know who might want to go first.\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Berwyn or Amanda? Amanda.\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"I was going to say that Berwyn can probably answer that a little bit better than I can. In relation to Erasmus, as you know, it's obviously been a significant loss for universities, and I think we've been very pleased that we've been able to set up the Taith programme here in Wales to help support those mobilities. Of course, it can't exactly replicate Erasmus. But, we do have, I think, over and above other UK nations, more levers to support mobility, and that is important to us. And, of course, Irish students are treated as home students, so that's also very helpful.\" said by Amanda Wilkinson\n\"Berwyn.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"So, we haven't got the data for Taith at the moment in terms of higher education into Ireland. We've got, I believe, a global figure, and there's also, of course, the Turing programme that does allow Welsh students to go abroad, and we're looking to get data from that as well. We don't know yet whether there has been any outward mobility to Ireland, but I think, in the evidence that Aberystwyth gave, and also, I think, Bangor as well, I think Bangor accounts for about 21 per cent of Irish students in Wales, and there are key partnerships there in terms of degree mobility as well. So, the question really is to maintain and to build on those collaborations and exchanges.&nbsp;\" said by Berwyn Davies\n\"If I may, therefore, as you referred to the evidence from Aberystwyth University, well, Professor Treasure was quite honest with us in terms of her discontent, perhaps, that very little progress had been made in terms of ensuring that relations continued as a result of Brexit, and one of the issues was that European Union funding for the projects that she listed was expected to come to an end and that there isn't a great deal of hope for a continuation of those projects at the moment. Does that reflect the sector's view more widely, that there is genuine concern that some projects aren't going to be able to continue? I want to understand who you think should be looking at these issues and what the role of the Welsh Government is in that regard.&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Berwyn.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"The Government has been active and doing as much as they can, for example, in creating this new fund, Agile Cymru, which tries to keep some of those relationships going. It doesn't take INTERREG's place at all in terms of the investment that can be put into it. So, there will be a big question about that funding in the future. I think one of the most important things, of course, is whether we'll be able to join Horizon Europe. It would give us a great boost to be able to continue with these partnerships\u2014for example, in looking at whether some of the projects that have been funded through INTERREG are then able to apply to Horizon Europe, if we are able to join that programme as a full member.\" said by Berwyn Davies\n\"Thank you. Amanda, do you have anything to add?\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"This is part of a wider problem that we have in relation to the structural funds, but it's true for the INTERREG projects as well, that we haven't seen a replacement of funds that we might be expecting and that universities are largely cut out of eligibility for a lot of replacement funds. So, I think this is an issue, and I think it's something we need to think about very carefully here in Wales\u2014what are the key projects that are really going to matter to us, going forward, and which of these might we wish to bridge into potential Horizon Europe projects? Because, even if we're successful in associating with the next Horizon programme, then I still think we're going to have a period where we have to get some of these projects to work and be successful. So, there's still an issue, I think, around how we bridge some of them, if we wish to keep some of these joint projects with Ireland going.\" said by Amanda Wilkinson\n\"Who's leading those conversations at the moment? Obviously, concerns have been raised, and you're saying you're hoping, et cetera, but who's driving that at the moment? Do you think there's enough clarity, or are concerns being listened to? I'm just trying to understand how we can ensure that some of the unanswered questions following Brexit are addressed, so that there's clarity for the sector.\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"So, we've done quite a bit of work focusing on Westminster in the last three months. I do think what happens with the next round of prosperity funding does matter if we're going to keep some of these projects going. And if we can't keep them going, then we need to think fairly strategically about which of these projects are going to be the most important to us. Because, at the moment, there's not an obvious place for universities to go.\" said by Amanda Wilkinson\n\"Thank you. If I may, Oliver, I saw you agreeing in terms of the funding there and clarity. Perhaps you'd want to expand in terms of your sector.\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Yes, and I suppose I can also speak more generally as well. I think the main issues around Brexit with these relations is that Brexit is still actually affecting us now. You've got the Windsor framework that only just came through, and that certainly helps. We know the EU has always had a pretty good relationship with Wales specifically, in terms of things that are still affecting EU and UK relations now, which expands to Wales-Ireland. You have things like the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill. With that, there's the potential for divergence away from trade, or legislation that's in keeping with EU trade policy. And in general, that might make trade more difficult between Wales and Ireland, if you want to shrink it down to the smaller scale. So, it may be more about that we're still in that state of transition that is affecting things, and so maybe it's a question about stability. I think Welsh Gov keeping a strong relationship with the EU, not in spite of UK Gov, but alongside UK Gov, is probably part of the key to making sure that those things aren't too affected. I can't speak on the shared prosperity fund, as we aren't involved enough to know.\" said by Oliver Carpenter\n\"Thank you.\" said by Heledd Fychan MS\n\"Okay. Great. Thanks for that. We'll move on to Alun Davies.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"That's a cracking final line there, Oliver, that you weren't involved in the shared prosperity fund, as we understand from UK Government that everybody is, but I'll resist the temptation to pursue that this morning, everybody will be pleased to hear. But I'm interested in\u2014. I've been reading the shared statement and action plan from Welsh Government, and I'd be interested to know from each one of you your involvement in drawing up that document that the Welsh Government has agreed with the Irish Government.\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Shall we go to Oliver first this time?\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Yes, I can keep that short and sweet: we were not involved.\" said by Oliver Carpenter\n\"You were not involved.\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"No.\" said by Oliver Carpenter\n\"And do you know of any other business organisations that were involved?\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"We don't personally know, no, but there may have been.\" said by Oliver Carpenter\n\"Amanda.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"So, we've been involved insofar as, obviously, we've been involved with the development of Agile, and we're involved in the regional investment partnership that Welsh Government runs as well.\" said by Amanda Wilkinson\n\"Sorry, that answer wasn't very clear, I'm sorry, Amanda. My question was about the action plan, the shared statement. Are you saying that you were involved in particular elements of it, but not\u2014? There's a chapter on, I think it's called 'education and research', which I would anticipate you will have been involved with, to a lesser or greater extent. Were you actually involved in\u2014? I don't expect you to have written it, but were you involved in developing the ideas behind it?\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Not in the sense that we were involved in consultation on the framework itself, but we are involved in the development of the ideas and the issues, through our work with Agile and the regional framework. So, not directly as consultees, no.\" said by Amanda Wilkinson\n\"Okay. And Berwyn.\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Again, not directly involved. We were at a conference in Dublin in 2019, where a number of the key issues were explored at an early stage, and we were able to provide evidence there. There were senior managers from Welsh universities at that conference, and I know that they have also been involved in the British Irish Chamber of Commerce meetings subsequent to that launch event in Dublin, back in November 2019, I believe.\" said by Berwyn Davies\n\"Okay. Not overly clear answers, I'm afraid, but let's try to move on a little bit. Let me focus on the education and research aspect of this, at the beginning. The action plan says that the two Governments will:'Explore the possibility of establishing new Welsh-Irish research fellowships'Facilitate and support academic collaboration...'Contribute to ongoing wider discussions on...focused engagement between Welsh and Irish Universities'.You weren't involved, from your previous answers, in developing those particular commitments, so, are you involved in delivering any of them? And it's to Berwyn and Amanda, really, on this.\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Berwyn, do you want to go\u2014?\" said by Delyth Jewell AM\n\"Oh, okay, Amanda, you've put your hand up.\" said by ", "answer": "Delyth Jewell AM"}
{"content": "\"So, moving onto our first oral session on the public health approach to preventing gender-based violence, I\u2019d very much like to welcome Anne-Marie Lawrence, the Wales development manager for Plan UK\u2014excellent event you held in the Senedd recently\u2014and Dr Stephen Burrell, assistant professor, research, at Durham University. So, thank you very much indeed. Welcome to both of you.So, I\u2019m going to ask the first few questions. We know that there\u2019s a link between gender-based violence and the context of gender inequality, which is in every aspect of our lives. How relevant do you think gender is to prevention efforts? I.e., is it possible to prevent violence if we still haven\u2019t got equality? What\u2019s your understanding of these interconnections and risk factors for different forms of gender-based violence and how well do you think it\u2019s reflected in the Welsh Government\u2019s strategy and blueprint? Which of you would like to start?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Yes, I can have a go first. I think, yes, there's definitely a clear link. I think, for most children, we put them into boxes as soon as they're born, because society is defining a very narrow definition of gender that we're expecting our children to conform to as they grow up. And I think those gender stereotypes are often very reinforced by society as they're growing up, and I think that then affects how attitudes and behaviours are formed for our adolescence, which, obviously, in turn, then, can lead potentially to the development of harmful attitudes, beliefs, and then they can become social norms. And then those social and cultural norms obviously guide our attitudes and behaviours around gender roles and expectations, and can allow at times the acceptance of violence within a group or community. So, we think gender is a really key point.I think in order to challenge some of the harmful social norms that allow some men and boys to believe they have an entitlement to be in control over women and girls, and those that perpetuate harmful ideas of masculinity and drive gender-based violence, which may prevent some women and girls from coming forward to seek support or from reporting violence due to the normalisation of this issue, it goes back to how we\u2019re bringing up our children and some of those narrow definitions, and a lack of understanding and education, really, throughout our childhoods about gender equality.At Plan, we would believe that education throughout the life course is essential in challenging and changing some of these social norms, and that we need to see this modelled everywhere, from our national leadership through to our schools and throughout our communities as well.\" said by Anne-Marie Lawrence\n\"Okay, and I know you're doing some very interesting work in this regard in Wales, and it would be good if you could tell us a bit more about that a bit further down in the discussion.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Yes, definitely.\" said by Anne-Marie Lawrence\n\"Dr Burrell, Plan International talks about prevention being an ambitious, brave and long-term goal. In your research you refer to political inertia towards prevention. Could you just expand on this and outline what you think the obstacles facing policy makers are in terms of overcoming that inertia?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Yes. Well, I think perhaps one of the reasons for that is that this is such a huge problem, isn't it? It can feel quite intimidating, overwhelming. I think we have a lot of ideas, don't we, that somehow this is something that is impossible to solve\u2014it's inevitable, it's always happened, it's always going to be there\u2014and I think we really need to challenge some of those ideas, because I think it's definitely something that is preventable. There is good evidence out there that, when we do dedicate resources to prevention work, we can make a real difference in communities and reduce the prevalence of different forms of gender-based violence.Perhaps one of the reasons as well for that is because of the links with gender inequality, which is something that remains very embedded in our societies. That is something that is, I suppose, so normalised that it can feel quite confronting and challenging for all of us, I think, can't it, to learn about the ways in which we have been brought up, and the ways in which we might be conforming, unintentionally, to the gender norms and stereotypes that Anne-Marie talked about, which are very much linked with gender inequality and the reproducing of gender inequality in society.So, I think, yes: embracing prevention can feel quite confronting on a political level because it asks quite big questions about our society, the world we live in, and whether or not we are willing to actually embrace quite deep-rooted change to our society and to our own attitudes and beliefs. So, I think that that is difficult for anybody\u2014not just somebody who might have perpetrated violence, but for any of us. We have probably been influenced on some level by these norms and expectations about masculinity and femininity, which are very much at the heart of so much violence.So, yes, I think that tackling gender inequality really is at the heart of prevention. Also, I think that that's such a great question to ask as well, because it highlights that prevention work isn't just about trying to shift individual attitudes and behaviours, or even the kinds of norms and expectations that exist within particular groups or communities, but actually bringing about change at a more structural level in society\u2014you know, moving towards a more equal society will help to prevent this from happening.\" said by Dr Stephen Burrell\n\"Okay. So, is this a hopeless task, given that the Welsh Government doesn't hold all the levers on this? We simply don't control the benefits system, the taxation system. That's controlled by the Government at the other end of the M4. Just to summarise, given that we have limited powers, how fruitful is it to be approaching the issue of prevention?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Oh, it's absolutely vital. I think that we can all make a difference, can't we? Each of us in our everyday lives, we can set an example to others in the behaviours that we model, if we call out everyday sexism and misogyny, if we question some of these harmful ideas about masculinity and femininity that exist in society. If we can do that as individuals, any institution and organisation can have an influence on the people within it and on wider society. So, yes, I think that the Welsh Government can have a huge impact in Wales, and beyond as well. It can set an example for other Governments here in the UK and more broadly, I think, as well, can't it? So, no, I think that there is a huge amount, but I recognise the challenges as well that you mentioned.\" said by Dr Stephen Burrell\n\"Okay. All right. I'm now going to bring the other Members in, who are online, starting with Altaf Hussain.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. I think that Jane has raised her hand. She wants to come in.\" said by Altaf Hussain MS\n\"Oh, I beg your pardon. I'm sorry, Jane. I didn't see you. Jane.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. It was just an additional question, really, for Dr Burrell. In your evidence, you say that there is political inertia towards this issue. Can you just try and be specific about what needs to change politically, particularly given that we are in Wales, and about what your views are in terms of what needs to change politically in the Welsh Government's response? Thank you, Chair.\" said by Jane Dodds MS\n\"Thank you. Well, I think that we have seen some real change in the last two years, actually, haven't we, after some horrific events such as the murders of Sarah Everard and Sabina Nessa. I think that that has led to some steps forward, especially perhaps in recognising the role that men and boys have to play, and the need to put an onus on men and boys and to really be addressing ideas about masculinity, given that most of this violence is being perpetrated by men.But I still think that there is a lot of work to do there, in terms of having those conversations in a much more widespread way. These problems are so deep-rooted. This prevention work needs to be happening across society in quite in-depth, ongoing, multifaceted ways, to have the kind of impact that we need. So, yes, I think that there have definitely been steps forward, clearly, in Wales. I think that you are doing inspirational work here. But, yes, for prevention to really have an impact, we do have a lot of work to do in education, workplaces, all different parts of society.\" said by Dr Stephen Burrell\n\"Thank you, Chair.&nbsp;\" said by Jane Dodds MS\n\"Thank you. Altaf Hussain.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you very much, Chair, and thank you to both of our guests. Good afternoon. My area of questioning is primary prevention work with men and boys. I am conscious of time, and we have too many questions. It's a huge subject, but I'll try to summarise the questions, so that I may have full answers as well.What action does the Welsh Government need to take to ensure that men and boys realise they have a major role to play in stopping violence against women and girls? How can this be achieved without generating a backlash or a resistance? And my second part of this question is also: what can we do to address cultural and social norms, which both of you addressed in your answers before, around masculinity, which contribute to violence against women and girls? Thank you.\" said by Altaf Hussain MS\n\"Do you want to start off, and really talk about the work you're doing in Wales? That would be really great.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Yes. Brill. No problem. I think we need to start off by understanding more about how we even do this work in the first place. It's quite complex, and, as you said, we need to be very mindful about not provoking backlash and we need to be sensitive about how we do this work, and I don't think anybody has the answers yet to know exactly how to do it. I think it needs to become normal for boys to recognise how they feel, and to be able to talk about it and to feel safe doing so, but that's quite a shift for a lot of boys and men, because of those social and cultural norms that we referred to in the last question. I think it's important to recognise that there are many different ways in which this work could be done. I don't think there's one project or one solution; I think there isn't a one-size-fits-all approach.Through our work in schools, we found that a large majority of boys said they felt that they needed to be seen to be tough. Many said that they didn't feel they could be their true selves around their friends and some displayed quite concerning attitudes around the acceptance of violence within relationships. So, this led me, personally, into research projects in Wales for boys, to see what was out there and see if I could find work that was happening in single-gendered settings, exploring issues with boys that are relevant to their lives, and, apart from a few good examples, I really couldn't find very much.So, as a result of this, Plan UK in Wales are funding eight grass-roots organisations to carry out test-and-learn projects. So, these are working directly with boys and young men. They have a diverse range of approaches, from a project in rural mid-west Wales with 13 to 15-year-old boys in a local community garden, a project in Swansea using music and DJing to help boys connect to their feelings around masculinity, and a project by Safer Wales working with young men in custody. All of the projects are happening at the same time, and they are supported by ourselves and Beyond Equality, who are experts in working with masculinity. We've trained the project facilitators and we've formed a community of practice, where we share our experiences, challenges, ideas and successes together. So, these test-and-learn projects are about giving those who support young people the space to learn and explore what works, and how to create the right conditions for boys and young men to feel safe to think and talk about exploring masculinity, mental health, relationships, et cetera.Also, during my time looking into projects and examples of good practice, I came across a project in New Zealand called 'She Is Not Your Rehab', a global anti-violence movement birthed from a community barbershop. And we're now exploring opportunities about hosting them here in Wales later in the year, with the hope that we can spark a conversation about what more we need to do here in Wales to achieve some of our ambitions set out in the VAWDASV strategy, and about how we start to change the narrative around how we approach family and domestic violence.I think the time is now. We can't afford not to act on this. Our young people are experiencing all that the previous generations have plus a whole new online world to navigate, and if we don't look to change things now, then, I think, we're going to have even bigger problems in the future. I believe that we need to further invest in youth work, so both generic provision and specialist projects, where young people can do issue-based work and projects about the issues that are affecting their lives and relationships, and to do this, we need a very well-equipped and trained youth work and volunteer force and gender transformative approaches. We could look to the new Wales Without Violence framework and think about how we could work within schools and education and provide safe activities, trusted adults, and we can look to how do we change and challenge those harmful social norms and values.And then one final point from me on this: although working through the education system is key, we need to be really mindful of the pressure already on schools and teaching staff, and that some of this work needs a specialist knowledge and understanding, and that we can't just keep on asking schools to pick some of this stuff up.\" said by Anne-Marie Lawrence\n\"Okay, fine. Stephen, do you want to respond any further on that particular point?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Yes. Well, I would just build on what Anne-Marie was saying. I think we need to be having conversations with boys and men from as young an age as possible, really, because as soon as we're born, we start being confronted with all of these kinds of gender stereotypes, which boys are confronting and having to deal with, and not just young people, not just in formal educational settings, but across the life course, like in the workplace. When men become fathers, I think parents could be having a lot more support on these issues to help them to model the kind of behaviour we want to see in society. And I do think it is about trying to instigate those dialogues, both within formal settings and in the more informal conversations that we have as well.I think dialogue is really important, isn't it, in terms of what the question was, about backlash. So, I suppose, trying to avoid lecturing men and boys, like we have the answers and we're telling them how to behave, but I suppose listening to them as well and where they're coming from, what their experiences are like and how they're having to face these pressures and expectations about being a man, which they're getting from wider society. You know, they didn't create these expectations; they're having to deal with them through things like social media and so many different parts of their lives. So, having conversations with them as much as we can. And what I think, and everything Anne-Marie said, which I think is so important, is, like, how these issues are interconnected, aren't they? On the one hand, that does mean that these are huge problems, but on the other hand, that means we can actually move forward in tackling multiple problems simultaneously, potentially.So, if we start talking to boys and men more about the pressures that they face about masculinity, like, 'Be tough, be strong, don't show your emotions, don't ask for help', we can help to get to the roots of different kinds of violence and abuse, which is predominantly being perpetrated by men and boys, but also issues that men and boys themselves experience, like poor mental health or loneliness and isolation. So, having those conversations with them, I think, hopefully will show to men and boys that we have so much to gain from these conversations as well. And putting the emphasis on the positives there, like how we all benefit from change; we can all play a positive role in creating change, and hopefully through that\u2014.And I think also, in terms of the backlash, I think there's always going to be some degree of backlash, right? So, I think we should just be prepared for that and not let that put us off. I think that, yes, there might be a small but vocal minority expressing those views, but actually there's a much bigger group of men and boys out there who just don't know what to think about these issues and aren't quite sure, and if they had more help and education and dialogue, I think we could really help to move them and then move men and boys more broadly as well.\" said by Dr Stephen Burrell\n\"Altaf.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you very much. How should Government engage with men and boys in implementing this? Do you have any examples of best practice? And also, as you say, we have to put it in the schools to boys, and the new curriculum will now place a greater emphasis on teaching healthy relationships in a developmentally appropriate manner. Do you think this should be sufficient to help change attitudes towards gender-based violence, and how can we best extend that message to those no longer in formal education?\" said by Altaf Hussain MS\n\"Who wants to go first? Don't bother to read what you've prepared. Just tell us from the heart. I'm sure you've got lots to tell us. But keep it reasonably brief. So, Anne-Marie, do you want to go first?\" said by ", "answer": "Jenny Rathbone AM"}
{"content": "\"Good afternoon and welcome to this Plenary meeting. The first item on our agenda this afternoon is questions to the First Minister, and the first question this afternoon is from Alun Davies.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"1. Will the First Minister make a statement on the resettlement of people from Ukraine in Wales? OQ59465\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Llywydd, I thank Alun Davies for that question. As a nation of sanctuary, we have welcomed just under 6,900 Ukrainians to Wales, with 3,200 arriving under the Welsh Government's sponsorship scheme. We continue to support guests, helping them to move on to longer term accommodation, where they can live more settled lives and be supported within local communities.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"I'm grateful to the First Minister for that. This afternoon, I think we should also pay tribute to the work of Mick Antoniw, who has united Members across the Chamber in his support for the people of Ukraine over the last period. And the Welsh Government has also, I think, First Minister, demonstrated a real commitment to the people of that country. It has both condemned Putin's illegal invasion, the barbaric war crimes that have been committed against the Ukrainian people, and it has also reached out its hand of friendship to those Ukrainians who are seeking to escape the consequences of Putin's war.&nbsp;In Blaenau Gwent, First Minister, over 130 people have initially been resettled in the county borough. We're also looking at how we can ensure that there is additional support for those people who are seeking to make their homes again in Blaenau Gwent. The local authority in Blaenau Gwent, as you know, has been proactive in reaching out to people from Ukraine, and has provided additional resources, on top of those provided by the UK Government, and the Welsh Government, to ensure that people who are supporting and hosting people from Ukraine are able to do so, but also to ensure that those Ukrainians who are seeking to move on with their lives have the support to do that.&nbsp;First Minister, the people of Blaenau Gwent and the local authority of Blaenau Gwent are doing everything they can to support the people of Ukraine. Will the First Minister assure me this afternoon that the Welsh Government will continue this support for the people of Ukraine, as we continue to support the people of Ukraine in their struggle against Putin's invasion?\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Well, Llywydd, I thank Alun Davies for what he has said about the success of the programme here in Wales. I'm sure Members would want me to recognise as well the part that he has played in making sure that goods from Wales reach families in Ukraine, where war crimes continue to be committed right up to today. I thank the local Member for Blaenau Gwent for what he has said about the success of the scheme in that county borough. It has been a genuinely outstanding success. Workers in Blaenau Gwent local authority's support team have done an outstanding job in helping people from Ukraine, who came first of all to the welcome centre, to be able to move on to longer term accommodation, whether that is within Blaenau Gwent itself, which has welcomed many Ukrainian citizens into that move-on accommodation, or whether it's work with neighbouring local authorities. Indeed, Llywydd, so successful has the Blaenau Gwent team become that we have asked them to take a national lead in assisting other local authorities in that move-on effort, bringing the expertise that they have developed, the operational skills that they have, to support others to do a similar job. And, of course, the Welsh Government, with the \u00a340 million that we have set aside in our budget for the current financial year to continue to welcome people from Ukraine, forced to flee from their own country, looking for an opportunity to re-establish their lives, will go on working with all our partners to make sure that we offer that hand of friendship, live up to our reputation for being a nation of sanctuary, and do everything we can to help people to re-establish their lives here in Wales.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"In February, Welsh media reported, and I quote, that,'Hundreds of Ukrainians who arrived in Wales via the Welsh Government\u2019s super sponsor scheme face an uncertain future as welcome centres close and sponsors remain reluctant to come forward.'And although the Welsh Government stated it was working closely with local councils to get Ukrainian refugees into longer term accommodation, refugees claimed only one in 100 landlords will take a Ukrainian. And, in March, the British Red Cross warned that better infrastructure is needed to support Ukrainians to rebuild their lives in Wales, and that the Welsh Government should work with the UK Government and the Welsh Local Government Association to establish schemes to help Ukrainians into private rented properties by meeting the upfront costs and acting as guarantors where needed. I know the Welsh Government's still awaiting clarification on the \u00a3150 million resettlement funding from UK Government, but what specific action has your Government taken since then to address these findings? And what figures does the Welsh Government have regarding the number of Ukrainians affected and what has happened to them since?&nbsp;\" said by Mark Isherwood AM\n\"Well, Llywydd, the first point to make, and it's an important one, is that in closing welcome centres\u2014because the inflow of new people coming from Ukraine has slowed down\u2014not a single person has been left without accommodation. Despite the anxieties that were expressed, indeed, over 1,700 Ukrainian guests have already been moved in Wales on to longer term accommodation. And, in terms of the specific actions that have been taken, of the \u00a340 million that I mentioned a moment ago, Llywydd, \u00a34 million of that is specifically to assist our local authority partners in securing additional move-on accommodation, and that does, indeed, cover some of the points that Mark Isherwood made about assisting people who are able to secure somewhere in private accommodation with some of the upfront costs that you face when you're trying to secure places in the private rented sector. At the same time, we have a major transitional accommodation capital programme mobilised through the Welsh Government: over \u00a376 million used last year to assist local authorities and social landlords to deliver more homes to support all those people who are in housing need. That funding has already delivered nearly 1,000 additional homes, and many people from Ukraine have been able to take advantage of that programme. So, we continue to work closely with our partners, Llywydd. Nobody is suggesting that it is easy to find move-on accommodation in what is already a competitive accommodation market, but I think the success story here in Wales is one that would bear up to scrutiny from anyone.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"2. What is the Welsh Government doing to ensure that school leavers have the necessary skills to succeed in the employment market? OQ59496\" said by Tom Giffard MS\n\"I thank the Member for that question, Llywydd. Careers and work-related experiences are mandatory within the new Curriculum for Wales, and Careers Wales provides support for all schools across Wales to build relationships with employers. Qualifications reform and our employability programmes will prepare young people for the jobs of the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"I'm grateful to you, First Minister, for the answer. I ask the question today in the context of equipping our young people with the skills they need to compete in an increasingly globalised world. And, to that end, it's no coincidence that the countries that produce the best outcomes in terms of maths attainment are often also the countries that have emerging and innovative global economies. And in the UK, I think, sometimes, some of us have a tendency to write off the importance of mathematics. People often joke about not being able to do maths, but that's something we'd never say about reading, for example, so that's something I'm glad that the Prime Minister has correctly identified as a problem that makes us less competitive internationally. And he suggested that further maths learning may be required later on in a young person's education to address the problem. Obviously, there are no one-size-fits-all answers here, First Minister, but, given education is devolved in Wales, and, according to the latest Programme for International Student Assessment results, maths attainment in Wales was the worst of the UK nations, what consideration have you given to what the Welsh Government can do to help turn this situation around and to ensure that school leavers have the maths skills that they need so they can reach their full potential? &nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Tom Giffard MS\n\"Well, Llywydd, I agree with Tom Giffard about the importance of mathematics. Much of what we do in Wales is to equip young people for the digital skills that they will need for the future in which that aspect of the employment market will become more and more important. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister's actions don't match the rhetoric that we hear from him. He was responsible for the catastrophic Multiply programme when he was the Chancellor of the Exchequer\u2014\u00a3100 million top-sliced out of money that was meant to come to Wales for a national programme that, I'm afraid, has been a huge failure on the ground. Certainly it has not delivered what was promised here in Wales. I'm afraid the Multiply programme just demonstrates the difficulties when Ministers in Whitehall believe that they are able to design things on the ground in parts of the United Kingdom where they have no reach at all. They designed their Multiply programme without a single word of discussion with the Welsh Government or with the local authorities that are expected to deliver it. As a result, it has not been possible to spend the money that was allocated to Wales. That money is yet to be released to local authorities so that they can do useful things with it, including\u2014and I agree with the importance of the point\u2014to improve numeracy amongst people who are leaving school and people in the workplace who are looking to improve their numeracy skills. So, while I agree on the basic proposition, I cannot agree that the way the UK Government has gone about this has demonstrated a success. In fact, I'm afraid, it is exactly the opposite.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Prif Weinidog, Welsh pupils and young people have such a vast array of skills and talents. In terms of future employment, it benefits everyone for there to be a system in place that allows them to access educational opportunities that actually utilise and play to their own strengths, while ensuring they have the skills for jobs. I know the Welsh Government understands this, so, on that note, what assessment has the Welsh Government made of the junior apprenticeship programme pilot, and will we see more pupils across Wales be enabled to access such positive opportunities?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"I thank Jayne Bryant for that. She points to a very important change in the labour market, Llywydd, which we've discussed on the floor of the Senedd previously. For most of my political life, we believed that the biggest challenge we faced economically was to provide employment opportunities for young people where those employment opportunities would be in short supply. We thought we had too many young people and too few jobs for them to do. In fact, the problem we face today is the opposite; we have jobs to do and not enough people to do them. When I speak to employers, particularly progressive employers, what they talk to me about is the efforts they know they have to make to be in schools from an early age to attract young people into the opportunities that will be there for them. Those talented young people, I think, will find themselves sought after by employers. What this means is that we cannot afford to waste the talents of any single individual in Wales.The junior apprenticeship programme, a two-year programme aimed at students in years 10 and 11, in other words pupils aged between 14 and 16, has been specifically designed to provide a different sort of opportunity for young people who look as though conventional schooling is not succeeding in finding a pathway for them into the future. If you go on the junior apprenticeship programme, you study for 25 hours a week at a local further education college, you will take a GCSE in maths and English or Welsh, but at the same time you will study for a level 2 qualification in a range of vocational pathways. So, this is to recapture the interest of young people who otherwise might find themselves not succeeding within the system.The best evidence we have, Llywydd, is from an inspection that Estyn carried out at Bridgend College last year. They reported that, in the five years that the programme has been running at the college, the successful completion rates of vocational qualifications amongst those young people on the programme exceeded 95 per cent; that GCSE results were in line with or exceeded learners' predicted grades; and that over 80 per cent of the young people who successfully completed that junior apprenticeship programme went on to further post-16 qualifications at the college, or apprenticeships, or directly into employment. I think it absolutely demonstrates that it is possible to create pathways for young people who are on the edge of the system that can capture their interest, give them the experiences they need and lead them on to successful futures.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Turning to school leavers who take up apprentice construction opportunities, First Minister, I've been made aware by FE providers in Cynon Valley that the green economy skills that we would want to grow and nurture aren't necessarily embedded within those courses\u2014for example, around installing heat pumps or retrofitting our current housing stock. So, First Minister, could Welsh Government investigate this as a priority, to ensure that these apprentices have the skills they need to succeed in the employment market, to grow the green economy and to help us as a nation to reach net zero?\" said by Vikki Howells AM\n\"Llywydd, I referred in my original answer to curriculum reform, and Qualifications Wales is actively engaged in making sure that the qualifications that are offered in our further education colleges do equip young people with the skills that will be needed for the future. That is already happening. I visited a further education college in north Wales recently and I spent my time there talking to a group of apprentices who were focusing on motor qualifications, and those were electric vehicles; they weren't the vehicles of the past. They were being equipped with the skills for the future in that green economy. Our net-zero skills action plan, published at the end of February, sets out the actions we will take, alongside the education sector and employers, to build confidence and knowledge in this area. The Minister for Economy announced a \u00a32 million investment in personal learning accounts specifically to allow people to obtain the skills, knowledge and qualifications they will need to be part of that green economy. The courses are free, Llywydd, they are flexible, they are available to young people, but, importantly, they are available to people who are already in the employment market. When I was in the north Wales college, as well as meeting young people, I also met people well into their careers, working in garages in north Wales and who are coming in one day a week to make sure that they could also refresh their skills and make sure that they too would be available to do the jobs that will be needed in the future.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Questions now from party leaders. The leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew R.T. Davies.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Thank you, Presiding Officer. First Minister, I agree with the sentiments that you've just expressed in responding to questioners in the last question, that no young person should be left behind and that we should be trying to unlock everyone's talent. Regrettably, the additional learning needs numbers that have come out from Welsh Government indicate that there's been a drop of 18,000 in the young people identified as having additional learning needs in Welsh schools over the last 12 months. That is a significant drop and, if it was a drop for all the right reasons, then, obviously, we would be celebrating that. But we know, with COVID, many young people, obviously, had their education blighted. How confident are you, First Minister, that those numbers, down from 92,000 to 76,000, are a true reflection of the help and support that might be required for young people, because unless they get that additional learning needs assessment undertaken, obviously, that support cannot be put in place?\" said by Andrew RT Davies AM\n\"Well, Llywydd, it's an important point that the leader of the opposition makes. We have a new system here in Wales, as he knows, put on the statute book by the Senedd and which is in its early stages of full implementation. I think it is very important that we interrogate those figures carefully. We want to see a system in which it is easier for young people to get the help that they need. Sometimes that will mean that that help is available to them within the broader school without needing a specific special educational needs designation. But the important thing is to make sure that those figures genuinely reflect the position on the ground and that the young people we are concerned about are getting the help that they need. As I say, it is the earliest stages of the new system. We shouldn't read too much into the preliminary figures. The important thing is to be aware of the issue and make sure, in the work that we do with Estyn and through the improvement agencies, that we are confident that the new system is making sure that our young people who have additional needs get the help that they need and get it in a way that is easy to access, properly calibrated to the individual circumstances and then effectively delivered on the ground.\" said by ", "answer": "Mark Drakeford AM"}
{"content": "\"Good afternoon and welcome to this afternoon's Plenary meeting. The first item on our agenda will be questions to the First Minister, and the first question is from Samuel Kurtz.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"1. How is the Welsh Government supporting renewable energy projects in the Celtic sea? OQ58979\" said by Samuel Kurtz MS\n\"Llywydd, investment in physical infrastructure, and a workforce skilled for the future, are amongst the actions taken by the Welsh Government to support energy technologies in the Celtic sea.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Diolch, Prif Weinidog. And can I begin by welcoming the Royal Welsh Agricultural Society's rural leadership programme group, who are in the public gallery this afternoon?Prif Weinidog, this evening, I have the immense honour of hosting a cross-party reception in the Neuadd on the Haven Waterway future energy cluster. It brings together the Haven Waterway's major traditional energy companies with new and exciting renewable developers, and the supply chain, to lead in decarbonisation. You'll be aware, Prif Weinidog, that I'm a big advocate for the opportunities presented to Wales from both the Haven Waterway and the Celtic sea, from floating offshore wind to tidal, wave and hydrogen initiatives, and even the progressive Celtic free-port bid. So, it does feel as if we're on the cusp of a green energy revolution in west Wales. So, given the strategic importance of the Haven Waterway and the Celtic sea, what assurances can you give to developers and groups, such as the future energy cluster, that Welsh Government and Natural Resources Wales will operate in a timely manner to ensure these opportunities aren't lost? Diolch.\" said by Samuel Kurtz MS\n\"Well, Llywydd, I thank Sam Kurtz for that question, and congratulate him on hosting the future energy cluster event today; I think it's a great event to have here in the Senedd. And I agree with everything that the Member said about the immense possibilities that renewable energy, including floating offshore wind and other projects in the Celtic sea, hold out for his part of Wales, but for Wales as a whole. And, in that, the Welsh Government is absolutely aware of the need to have a consenting regime that is robust, of course, as it must be, but is also streamlined, effective and enabling. I have been in discussions with NRW myself. I know the Minister has a meeting with NRW today to talk about the end-to-end marine licensing review, which the Welsh Government commissioned, carried out independently. The consultants said that there was nothing, fundamentally, that needed to be repaired in the current regime, but that there were ways in which it could be made to work more effectively.&nbsp;Developers have their part to play as well in all that. They have responsibilities to submit applications based on early engagement, best available evidence, and where the quality of the application itself doesn't hold up the process. Then, it is for NRW to ensure that they have the necessary resources in place to be able to deal with those applications in a way that respects the very important responsibilities they have as an environmental regulator, but also recognises the huge opportunities that renewable energy provides for Wales, and our contribution that we can make to tackling that great crisis of our time in global warming.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"I do think there's real benefit in thinking in a joined-up way about offshore wind off the west coast of Wales\u2014the Celtic and Irish seas. I think the free-port bidding process offers an opportunity to do that. Now, as you can imagine, I'm confident in the quality of the Holyhead/Ynys M\u00f4n north Wales free-port bid for what it can offer in terms of growing that sector, as well as mitigation for post-Brexit losses that affected the port of Holyhead. But would the First Minister agree with me that the best way, perhaps, to ensure the growth of that sector, in a way that benefits the whole of Wales, would be to not only support our bid, but also to ensure a second free port, which could enable Celtic sea and Irish sea developments to work in parallel greater than the sum of their parts?&nbsp;\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"Well, Llywydd, I must be careful in what I say, because there is a process and bids are being assessed objectively, as they must be, by civil servants both here in Wales and at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. I will just remind Members that the agreement we struck with the UK Government does not rule out there being two free ports here in Wales. One is the expectation, but two is not impossible, and the quality of the bids, and the assessment made of them, will, of course, be pivotal to deciding whether or not we're able to persuade the UK Government to go down that second route.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"I thank Sam for bringing this question forward, because the potential here in the Celtic sea is, of course, for west Wales, and for the whole of the south Wales seaboard as well, in terms of manufacturing, supply chain, and so on. And we have to have that rigorous consenting regime as well, to make sure this works. But, can I ask you, First Minister\u2014? Learning from the past is important within this. We need the right port infrastructure, and, indeed, it would be great to see two bids going through from Wales as well. We need those local grid connections to actually bring this onshore, but what we've learned from previous iterations is that we need the National Grid to be strengthened as well. So, could I ask you what discussions you're going to have with the UK Government and the regulator about strengthening the market signals that say we must have this investment\u2014Wales deserves its fair share of investment in the grid as well. We can do so much on our own, but we need the UK to step up as well.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Well, Llywydd, I think they're two very important points made there by Huw Irranca-Davies. We do need to learn the lessons of previous renewables. There is still no offshore wind industrial strategy out of the UK Government, despite the fact that we have been calling for one, and others in the industry have been calling for one. We do have concerns that, in the reliance on competitive processes to drive down the cost of projects, that will result in the cheapest supply chain solutions, rather than investing in the long-term value, which is to be had there for Wales by making sure not only that energy is produced in the Celtic sea, but that everything that goes into that has a local supply chain, creating jobs in the process.As to the grid, I sometimes think, Llywydd, because it is called the National Grid, that people don't realise that this is a private company, listed on the stock market, distributing \u00a31 billion every year in dividends to shareholders. Indeed, it distributed \u00a34.5 billion in 2017 alone, directly into the hands of shareholders, when we know that there is not enough investment going into the vital connections that the grid provides. When I was in Ireland in the autumn, Llywydd, I took part in a round-table discussion with the foreign Minister of the Irish Government and developers interested in the Celtic sea from the Irish perspective as well. I was struck by what a major developer said there\u2014that their greatest fear was that they would bring the energy all the way to the beach and then there would be nothing that you could do with it, because there would be no connection into the grid.I saw an article just this week by Molly Scott Cato, the Green economist, saying that there are almost 700 renewable energy projects on hold across the United Kingdom, waiting for the National Grid to find them capacity. Well, my own preference would be to bring the National Grid under public control so that it was run in the public interest and where there was no leakage into private profit of the resources of that company. In the meantime, we work with the company and with others here in Wales. We were glad to see, last year, a move towards anticipatory demand in the grid system, glad to see that the latest energy Minister at the UK Government says that improving the grid is his top priority, in all his responsibilities. There is undoubtedly a need for a step change in making sure that the grid is fit not just for today, but for the future, so that when we put the Celtic sea to work, in the way that Sam Kurtz said in his original question, there will be the infrastructure there to take up the energy that will be produced.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"2. Will the First Minister make a statement on the impact on Wales of the recent transition to the new UK subsidy control regime? OQ58972\" said by Joel James MS\n\"Llywydd, the UK subsidy regime is not the regime the Welsh Government would have designed, nor was it one supported by this Senedd. We will work, however, with public authorities to equip staff to understand and utilise the new regime, mitigating its many imperfections.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Thank you, First Minister. I recently met with a business within my region who are developing technologies that will have a profound impact on helping to reverse the effects of climate change and are in the process of applying for Welsh Government funding, but it seems like the whole process is taking considerable time and much longer than previous applications, which is having a detrimental impact on their forward planning. I'm conscious that you cannot discuss individual applications, but I'm wondering if the delay in the application process is due to a cut in funding, and, in which case, what levels of funding are now available and what will be the ratio of grant to loan in those settlements? Or, if the delay is due to the transition to the new UK subsidy control regime and single-year settlements, what is the Welsh Government doing to smooth the transition to the new system? Thank you.\" said by Joel James MS\n\"Llywydd, the new subsidy regime is already in force; it came into force on 5 January. I'm obviously not aware of the details of the individual case that Joel James mentions, but I would not be surprised to find that the new complexities of the subsidy regime are playing their part in any delays because, for the very first time, the system, by introducing intra-UK subsidies within the focus of the law, introduced new legal risks into the subsidy process. Two rival companies on the same high street can, for the first time, ask for a judicial review of every single subsidy that their neighbours may have negotiated. Inevitably, that makes those organisations responsible for providing subsidies more cautious in making those decisions, because the legal risks involved in making any award have been increased by the new subsidy control regime. So, if that does lie near the heart of the delay that Joel James mentioned, it doesn't surprise me, and it is inevitable that those members of staff in public authorities responsible for making those decisions will be having to become familiar with the new regime and, in the early days, are likely to take longer in making those decisions. But, in the longer run, there are new risks in the subsidy control arrangements, and they will be risks that will particularly fall hard on us here in Wales.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"That's no surprise, is it, First Minister, that something created by this UK Government will adversely affect Wales? The Scots have learnt this week about the UK Government's disregard for democracy. What we have understood is that we have a chaotic subsidy control regime introduced post Brexit, when the reality of taking back control was not to give control to the people of Wales, to the communities of Wales, to enable the businesses of Wales to flourish, but to take back control to a few Ministers in London, their cronies in the House of Lords and all their party donors. That's the reality of 'take back control', and the people of Wales and Joel's constituents are suffering as a consequence of it.\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Alun Davies makes a number of very powerful points there. I should remind Members of the Senedd that, of course, this Senedd denied legislative consent to the UK Bill on 1 March last year, and then the Sewel convention was disregarded and the lack of consent from this Parliament was simply ignored by the UK Government that went ahead and imposed this solution on us anyway. Here are just two ways, Llywydd, in which the new system acts against the interest of Wales. First of all, it removes any sense of assisted areas from the subsidy regime. Indeed, the first draft of the Bill referred to the levelling-up principles of the UK Government. That was abandoned by the time the Bill reached the statute book. So, as my colleague Rebecca Evans said in her letter to the UK Government before our consent motion was debated, the Bill puts Mayfair and Merthyr on exactly the same basis when it comes to providing subsidies. That simply means that those with the deepest pockets will use that advantage to make themselves even more advantaged, while those with the least will end up with the greatest struggle.And here is just a second example, Llywydd. The UK Government insisted that agriculture and fisheries should be brought within the scope of this Bill. They never were, while we were members of the European Union; they were dealt with separately. We asked the UK Government what the evidence was for bringing agriculture and fisheries within scope. They said to us that it was to be found in the responses to consultation. We asked them where the responses to consultation were to be found. We were told that they hadn't been published. We asked if we could see the responses that justified this inclusion, and we were told that, no, we couldn't. So, here we are. We have a major change, which has, I think, real implications for Welsh agriculture, because the system is based on seven principles, the third of those is that any subsidy must be designed to bring about a change of economic behaviour of the beneficiary. Where single farm payments fit into that, I really do not know. But we can't know, because the whole basis on which the UK Government decided to make this major change was unexplained by them, and the evidence that they pointed to was never made available to us.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Questions now from party leaders. Leader of the Welsh Conservatives, Andrew R.T. Davies\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Thank you, Presiding Officer. First Minister, last week, regrettably, Wizz Air chose to leave Cardiff Airport. To date, the Welsh Government have invested or made available to the airport \u00a3225 million\u2014nearly \u00a30.25 billion. You are the owners of the airport, albeit you have set up an arm's-length company to operate the airport. Do you believe that \u00a3225 million is money well spent?\" said by Andrew RT Davies AM\n\"Llywydd, I have always believed that a regional airport is an essential part of the economic infrastructure of any part of the United Kingdom that seeks to support the modern conditions under which the economy must operate. The private sector was unable to do that. It was right that the public purse stepped in. It's an investment in the future of the Welsh economy, and one that this Government was pleased to make.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"First Minister, after \u00a30.25 billion, the airport sadly has fewer passengers now than it has had for a very long time. Yes, COVID intervened to obviously affect all airports, but if you take Bristol Airport, it has seen a 22 per cent decline in its passenger numbers but still handles close to 7 million passengers. If you take Birmingham Airport, another competitor, they have seen a 33 per cent decline, and still handle 8.5 million passengers. It is a fact that no airport that I can find has had such a generosity of Government money made available to it\u2014\u00a30.25 billion\u2014and had such poor outcomes achieved. What are the new plans available to make sure that that \u00a3225 million is protected, and that, ultimately, you can resurrect the airport, because I think the taxpayer, in fairness, deserves to know is this a bad investment that is going to continue to go wrong, or do you have a long-term plan that can resurrect Cardiff Airport, which, obviously, you acquired back in 2013?\" said by Andrew RT Davies AM\n\"Well, Llywydd, the Welsh Conservative Party has never supported the airport. It has always done its best to talk down its chances of success. They never like to face up to their own responsibilities, Llywydd. Time after time after time on the floor of the Senedd, I have heard Conservative spokespeople here complain about the airport, suggest that it shouldn't have been taken into public ownership, and generally undermine the airport's prospects of success. The Member will know that figures from the Civil Aviation Authority showed that passenger growth at Cardiff Airport had increased by more than 50 per cent in March 2020, the month in which COVID hit us all, and that growth had happened since the Welsh Government purchased Cardiff Airport\u2014strong growth, and a path that the airport was on, clearly, towards future profitability. Indeed, it had made a profit in that year.&nbsp;Now, since the pandemic, of course the airport faces a much more difficult future. Demand for air travel has fallen across the world. It has not recovered, and the downturn in the UK economy means that industry experts are now predicting that this coming year will be a year in which air travel recovers more slowly in the United Kingdom than it will elsewhere. But, the rescue and recovery package that we have put in place with the airport, with those who are responsible for its future, is absolutely designed to make Cardiff Airport self-sustainable and profitable for the future. And when I hear Members shout, 'never' to that, that's exactly the sort of remark I meant when I said that, whenever we talk about a successful future for the airport here, Conservative Members intervene to cast doubt on its ability to be a successful part of the Welsh economy.&nbsp;\" said by ", "answer": "Mark Drakeford AM"}

And they're concerned that many individuals in their communities are feeling disheartened and isolated, and they want Welsh Government to make sure that Wales is as accessible as possible for all citizens. We can recognise that the Government is looking at this, so there is work ongoing to tackle the important concerns they've raised. We should certainly share the views of the pupils with the taskforce, but perhaps that's as far as we can go as a committee with this at the moment, and we all, as Members, look forward to the publication of the report next year. Diolch yn fawr, Cadeirydd.&nbsp; &nbsp;\" said by Rhys ab Owen MS\n\"Diolch, Rhys. I absolutely agree in terms of the pupils taking the initiative, and congratulate them for their excellent work. And can I ask if Members agree with Rhys's proposals there? They do. Diolch yn fawr.&nbsp;Item 2.2, P-06-1333, 'Stop Natural Resources Wales from tree felling that threatens red squirrel survival'.&nbsp;'In 2021, Petition P-06-1208 was debated by the Senedd to get new laws to protect red squirrel habitat. The petition also highlighted how NRW NW Area had failed to monitor squirrel populations in Newborough and Pentraeth forests on Anglesey. Subsequent research revealed precipitous declines in Newborough forest associated with too much timber cutting.&nbsp;'Now in Gwynedd, NRW are once again tree felling without squirrel data; once again suggesting that vague 'internal guidance' can make up for this'.This was submitted by Dr Craig Shuttleworth with 3,625 signatures, and I now invite Members to discuss this petition and any actions they may wish to take. Joel James.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. Just a quick thing, really. I was reading this petition with some interest, and I know that we\u2019ve got a debate coming up about squirrelpox, and I definitely think that this is something that could be highlighted during that as well, really. Because I\u2019m conscious it hasn\u2019t necessarily hit the target to have that debate, but also, in the correspondence we\u2019ve had with the petitioner, they\u2019ve come back with some quite&nbsp;strong questions of the Minister, and wanting further clarification, really. So I was wondering whether or not we could write back to the Minister highlighting those questions, but then also maybe to NRW, because they are being quite strongly challenged there by the petitioner.&nbsp;\" said by Joel James MS\n\"Diolch yn fawr, Joel. Do Members agree with Joel's suggestions? Any comments? No. Okay. Joel's right\u2014we have written to Business Committee already requesting a debate, and I'm sure some of the points in this petition can be raised during that time, if not by committee members, probably by Darren Millar, who is the furry red Senedd Member, and red squirrel champion for the Senedd.Item 2.3, P-06-1335, 'Welsh Government should take steps to ensure vulnerable adults without bank cards can pay with cash'.&nbsp;'Mencap Cymru is concerned that the move to a cashless society will leave behind disabled people who cannot have access to electronic forms of payment. In recent months people with a learning disability have been unable to pay for goods and services and have had to leave businesses empty-handed. Support workers are not permitted to use their own cards, and nor should they be. This means they do not have equal access to goods and services with many businesses and organisations moving to cashless transactions'.And this was submitted by the charity Mencap Cymru with a total of 2,504 signatures. I invite Members to discuss this petition and any actions they may wish to take. Luke Fletcher.&nbsp;\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Diolch, Gadeirydd. I think we\u2019ve seen quite a bit of coverage of this particular issue in the press, and I think Mencap have done a really good job. I think they\u2019ve highlighted two particular areas that they would want the Welsh Government to focus on. I think, in the long term, it\u2019s essentially looking at how Welsh Government, UK Government and the Financial Conduct Authority can work on alternatives, or at least a provision for vulnerable adults to be involved in a cashless society, but in the short term, looking at how public bodies, or bodies across the board that are in receipt of public funds, can allow people to pay with cash if they wish. I\u2019m really keen to see this go to debate in the Chamber. I think it\u2019s really important to a lot of our constituents, so I would like to suggest, if the committee would agree, that we ask for an inquiry as the first point of call so that we can actually dig down into this, and then hopefully that could follow on to a good debate in the Chamber as well.&nbsp;\" said by Luke Fletcher MS\n\"Diolch, Luke. I know, from a conversation we had as a clerking team, there is scope for some work on this. So if Members would agree to this suggestion that we do seek to undertake an inquiry in the autumn term\u2014do they agree? They do. And it's also worth noting as well, actually, the interest of the Senedd in this. I know Sioned Williams and Sam Kurtz, at the last opportunity to question the Minister for Social Justice, Jane Hutt, on this particular petition and topic, Mencap themselves were mentioned by those two Members. So, I do feel, and Members clearly agree, that there is space for us to dig into this a bit further and debate our report and findings at the end.&nbsp;Item 2.4, P-06-1336, 'Free Welsh lessons for everyone who wants to learn the language in Wales'.&nbsp;'Many people in Wales are very keen to learn Welsh, and people who live here and people who move to our country want to see the language flourish and grow. But a great many people also find it difficult to afford Welsh lessons, and using Duolingo is not a suitable learning method for everyone. Therefore, we need to ensure that everyone has a fair opportunity to learn Welsh without having to worry about the cost, and that there is also an appropriate method for people to learn'.This was submitted by Elfed Wyn ap Elwyn, with 858 signatures, and I'd like to bring Members in to discuss this petition and any particular actions they may wish to take. Buffy Williams.&nbsp;\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. I'd like to thank the petitioner for bringing this petition forward.&nbsp;As a Welsh learner myself, I do understand there is a wide range of formats on offer for those wanting to learn the language, but I do worry that it isn't easy to find this information. It's not easy to find if there is funding available for the different classes that are on offer, so I think, as a committee, we could write to the National Centre for Learning Welsh's chief executive and find some clarification on where this is advertised to start with, because it's really, really difficult to find out where the classes locally are held, let alone on a wider scale. So, I think that this is something, as a committee, we could look at a little bit more closely.\" said by Buffy Williams MS\n\"Diolch, Buffy. Luke Fletcher.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Diolch, Gadeirydd. Just to agree with Buffy's suggestion as a starting point, I think it would be useful to get a clear picture of what is currently available. I should probably declare an interest as well, I know Elfed, and I know he's very passionate about the subject. I agree with him on this particular point as well. Especially now, with the cost-of-living crisis, I think a lot of people have been locked out of going to learn Welsh as well as other languages. Of course, we know the benefit of being bilingual, not just in terms of the physical side of being able to go out and the mental side of that part, but also the development of people's brains, essentially. We have seen a number of scientific studies out there that show that being bilingual can help ward against stuff like Alzheimer's. Well, I think that's an important point for us to consider when it comes to language policy and how we help people go out and learn other languages.\" said by Luke Fletcher MS\n\"Diolch, Luke. Any comments from other Members? Joel.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. I agree with what Buffy and Luke have said, really, in terms of trying to look to see what support is out there. I know Luke was saying then about the benefits of bilingual education, but also\u2014it's something I've raised in the Chamber before\u2014the decline in foreign languages, as well, in French and German. So, I don't know if there's scope there to see what help might be available to them, as well. I don't know, but\u2014.\" said by Joel James MS\n\"Thanks, Joel. We can certainly ask our clerking team to see if there is scope for that within this, and when the petition comes back the next time, we can consider that suggestion then.Item 2.5,&nbsp;P-06-1337, 'Sycharth, the home of Owain Glynd\u0175r, should be bought to safeguard the site for future generations'.'History is such a key subject for us here in Wales. Stories from our nation show us how we have developed over the centuries to become what we are today. Notable characters have steered this interesting history, with none more prominent than Owain Glynd\u0175r, who has contributed so much to our identity, and for many, he is a symbol of the nation. It is very disheartening to see that Sycharth, Glynd\u0175r's home, is almost forgotten deep in the heart of rural Powys, and the place is not very accessible for people to visit.'This petition again was submitted by Elfed Wyn ap Elwyn, with 10,534 signatures in total. I'll invite Members to discuss this petition, and perhaps any actions they may wish to take, looking at Rhys ab Owen.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Thank you very much, Chair, and thank you to Councillor Elfed Wyn ap Elwyn for his second, and very important, petition today. He clearly takes an interest in the work of the committee. What Elfed has raised is not a new issue, there has been real concern about the state of Sycharth for many years. I have experience of this myself. The site is in a very poor state of repair and it's not seen as a notable landmark in our nation's history, or it's certainly not treated in that way. It's clear from the support that Elfed has garnered\u2014over 10,500 signatures to the petition\u2014that there's clearly a strong feeling in favour of safeguarding the Sycharth site and to recognise its contribution to the history of our nation.It is Owain Glynd\u0175r Day on 16 September, and because this petition has had so much support and that Owain Glynd\u0175r Day falls in mid September, I suggest that we should seek a debate on Sycharth in the Senedd Chamber in our first week back after the summer recess. Thank you.\" said by Rhys ab Owen MS\n\"Diolch yn fawr, Rhys. Thanks for your suggestion as well to request a debate, and in particular request a debate ahead of Owain Glynd\u0175r Day, which I think seems very sensible. Any further comments from Members? Joel James.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. It was just a quick observation really. I know we\u2019ve had a similar petition coming in\u2014I can\u2019t remember if we\u2019ve debated it now, or if it will be debated\u2014about Ruperra castle, and about management plans for privately owned amenities, for want of a better word, and whether or not there's scope to maybe bring that within this discussion, this debate, then, really, because I would imagine that there are similar\u2014for want of a better word\u2014properties throughout Wales that are just equally as important, and I think that\u2019s an opportunity for us to highlight them as well. I\u2019m also conscious that it might be of benefit for the committee to go and visit Sycharth,&nbsp; just to see what the situation is like on the ground. I think that might be beneficial for us in framing our debate, then, in September.\" said by Joel James MS\n\"Diolch, Joel, for that. I think on your second point, a visit, we can certainly look to see if that is achievable, and getting the committee out there is one of the things that we did say in establishing this committee that we would go out across Wales. I\u2019m sure we can look into that.And on your first point on raising other topics of interest, I agree, I think there is a case for that, and perhaps, if agreed\u2014and hopefully, it will be agreed by Business Committee that we can debate this issue\u2014that Members can make those points in those contributions there.&nbsp;Item 2.6, P-06-1340, \u2018Stop the change of speed limits to 20mph on 17th September\u2019.'This decision is not representative of the broader public opinion and as such, it is not democratic to implement the changes. An alteration to road laws on this scale should be subject to much more extensive polling or possibly as part of a Welsh referendum on the matter.'This was submitted by Benjamin James Watkins with 21,919 signatures in total. Given the scale of the signatures to this particular petition and the interest in the topic of the petition, I asked the clerking team to reach out to the lead petitioner, Benjamin, to suggest that we bring forward the closing date of this particular petition and bring it forward to this committee ahead of the changes in the law, so that we can request a debate from Business Committee ahead of those changes on 17 September. Are Members content to agree? They are. Any further comments? No. Okay.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Item 3.1, P-05-1112, \u2018Help Welsh Communities Buy Community Assets: Implement Part 5 Chapter 3 of the Localism Act 2011\u2019, submitted by Daniel Evans with 655 signatures. I think this is the eighth time now we\u2019ve considered Daniel\u2019s petition in this committee. I'll bring in Members to discuss this petition and any actions they may wish to take. Joel James.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair, and I agree with you, in a sense, that it is quite an important petition to agree, and it\u2019s had a lot of interest, and I know that the Local Government and Housing Committee have also looked into that, and I know that because I\u2019m on the committee, I suppose, and they have made quite detailed recommendations about this, and I know that, for example, the Minister for Social Justice confirmed that there will be a commission to look into this. And so, with that in mind, I don\u2019t necessarily know what more we can do as the Petitions Committee, as I think it\u2019s already been looked into, if that made sense.So, I definitely, definitely think that we should go back to the petitioner, highlighting the work of the Local Government and Housing Committee, highlighting what the Welsh Government is doing to do it, and also to thank the petitioner for raising this, and I think it\u2019s probably time to close it then.\" said by Joel James MS\n\"Diolch yn fawr, Joel, for that and, yes, I fully agree to thank Daniel for engaging with the committee on a number of occasions now, and of course we can share the report from the Local Government and Housing Committee with the petitioner as well. But you're right: a successful journey, in many ways, because we've highlighted this in a number of different ways in the Senedd as well as with different committees. Are Members content to agree the suggestion? Yes.Item 3.2, P-06-1299, 'Welsh Government \"Freeze on road building\" to include a clause for cases that pose a danger to life', submitted by Susan Blaney with 455 signatures.

{"content": "\"Good afternoon, and welcome, all, to this Plenary meeting. The first item on our agenda this afternoon is questions to the Minister for Economy, and the first question is to be answered by the Deputy Minister for Arts and Sport, and to be asked by John Griffiths.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"1. How is the Minister working with the Deputy Minister for Arts and Sport and Chief Whip to promote the growing tv and film industry in Wales? OQ59221\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Thank you for that question, John. Both the Minister for Economy and I are committed to working together to maximise Wales\u2019s growing reputation in the film and tv sector, and in promoting Wales on the global stage.\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"Thank you for that answer, Minister. Recently, I visited a local industrial firm, a family industrial firm, in Newport, GD Environmental. They are diversifying at the moment, and we visited their film studio, in Nash in Newport, where Urban Myth film the <em>Sex Education</em> series. It's all going very well, and the relationship with Creative Wales has been very useful, Minister, which I'm sure you'll be pleased to know. But they now have plans to build another film studio, alongside the existing one, and also they're interested in building a film and tv hub, which would be a film school, really, in conjunction with higher education and further education. So, they really are quite ambitious, Minister, and I think it's part of that growing strength that we have in Wales around tv, film and media. And I wonder whether you might look at what further support you might offer the company to expand in the way that they plan, and perhaps to visit, yourself, at some stage.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Thank you, John, for that supplementary question. I think probably it would be helpful if I set out initially some of the support that Creative Wales has been giving to the sector. We've got a strategic objective of ensuring that there is a good supply of studio space throughout the nation, for the incoming and indigenous productions. And we've recently supported capital investment projects in Aria studios in Anglesey, the Wolf studios in Cardiff, and Seren studios in Cardiff. In addition, the Creative Wales production funding is regularly used in conjunction with projects that have been delivered from studio sites in Newport, which you've already highlighted. And I thought it was particularly interesting you talking about the cross-over with education, and that fits very much with our support for the national film and tv studios that we have based in Cardiff as well. Skills and training are absolutely crucial and central to everything that Creative Wales is trying to do. We've recently supported 17 projects through our Creative Wales skills fund. One of those projects is supporting three new screen academies, alongside studio complexes.But, to deal specifically with the support that we could potentially give for the organisation that you're talking about, GD Environmental, what I would say is that Creative Wales do consider business cases for new investment and are happy to review those in detail when they're submitted. So, they can be approached for initial discussions, and it sounds as though, from what you're saying, that that's exactly what has happened thus far. Any formal application for support would obviously have to be assessed on its individual strengths and the impact to the industry, and we require an initial and, later, a full business case\u2014all of that which I'm sure you and GD Environmental would fully understand. But we do have a huge ambition for this industry in Wales. It's one of the fastest growing sectors in Wales. It has a huge impact on the economy. And I'd be more than happy to come along and visit GD Environmental, talk to them about their plans and see what they're proposing to do, because this is very much the kind of investment that we're looking to see grow.\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"The culture committee provided a workshop for people within the Welsh creative industries as part of its inquiry into barriers within the sector. Participants noted that access to Welsh Government funding for small businesses who are in the industry was challenging and overly bureaucratic, with one noting that delays can cripple small businesses. Another stated, and I quote,'Access routes to funding are difficult in Wales, especially when those in the creative industries aren't known by their ability to handle technical paperwork. Often, big organisations find it easier to apply for funding due to having dedicated staff, which is very different for small businesses'.Yet another was concerned that every application is considered a new one. So, every time they apply, they need to prove themselves all over again. Furthermore, it was stressed that long-term investment from Welsh Government and planning for the future was needed to see substantial growth in the industry. Suggestions included targeted investment and potentially taking industries with Welsh Government to global fairs to amplify the creative industry in Wales. Therefore, Minister, what urgent action are you taking to ease the application process for funding for small businesses, and what measures are you taking to enable those in creative industries to receive long-term investment, so that they can be showcased globally?\" said by Tom Giffard MS\n\"I think that's a fair challenge, Tom. We've seen a number of small businesses, small industries, that want to grow in Wales, and some of them do find the grant process very difficult. By the very nature of the process, it has to be thorough. We are talking about dealing with public money at the end of the day. We can't just willy-nilly hand over money to organisations that we don't do due diligence on. So, I'm sure you and, I'm sure, the applicants that you're talking to would understand and accept that.&nbsp;But I'm always open to a conversation with any of these organisations about how we can streamline and make the process more user friendly. It's certainly very much the approach that we've taken on the investment review with the Arts Council of Wales\u2014applications to the Arts Council for Wales will be considered by the end of March, but very much part of that review has been about how do we reach out to some of the smaller organisations, and how do we make the process of grant applications far less burdensome that it has been previously. So, I'm very happy to have that conversation with any organisations that feel that their involvement or the application process through Creative Wales is too difficult. And if any of them want to write to me and explain to me their experiences, I'd be happy to look at that.\" said by Dawn Bowden AM\n\"2. What action is the Welsh Government taking to encourage more young people to start their own businesses? OQ59203\" said by Altaf Hussain MS\n\"Thank you. The Business Wales youth entrepreneurship service encourages the next generation of entrepreneurs in Wales. It supports entrepreneurial ambition, and provides practical advice to take their ideas forward. Since 2016, 5,000 young people have been supported with start-up advice, and almost 700 have started a business. This, of course, is now being enhanced by the young person\u2019s guarantee.\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"Thank you, Minister. As you are no doubt aware, 95 per cent of UK businesses are microbusinesses or sole traders. With much of the focus of economic development policies on attracting large employers, and preparing young people for workplaces, we have to question whether we are doing enough to encourage self-employment. I was, therefore, pleased to see a scheme run by the Bridgend Business Forum, in conjunction with the Rebel Business School, to offer free training to young people on how to start a business.&nbsp;Minister, will the Welsh Government monitor the scheme and look at ways to either replicate it across Wales or even incorporate the lessons into the school curriculum? Thank you.&nbsp;\" said by Altaf Hussain MS\n\"I'd be very happy if the Member were to write to me with the detail of the scheme that he has identified. As I said in my initial answer, we have a range of support services that are available. Business Wales is still the front door, so if anyone is concerned or doesn't understand the individual scheme, they can go to Business Wales and they can help to guide people through, and, also, those people taking part directly in the young person's guarantee funded work.We've got a range of Big Ideas role models\u2014over 400 of them\u2014who do go out and encourage people who want to start up their own business. And what's encouraging about the young person's guarantee in this area is that, as part of the national conversation, 28 per cent of young people indicated they would like to consider becoming self-employed or running their own business, and, indeed, 25 per cent of them wanted more information on becoming self-employed. So, part of our challenge is, with the enthusiasm that does exist, how to make sure we have the right support available to help those who can go from an idea and a desire to actually be able to have a business plan and then to start up. And that's also why, of course, we have a range of our start-up grants that are already available to support people with exactly that ambition. But I look forward to receiving the Member's correspondence.&nbsp;\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"Questions now from the party spokespeople. The Conservative spokesperson, Natasha Asghar.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Thank you so much, Presiding Officer. Minister, it's estimated that around 7 per cent of adults in Wales are not on the internet. A large chunk of that 7 per cent are people aged 75 or over who have no connection to the internet. Just under 80 per cent of people with a limiting, long-standing illness, disability or infirmity&nbsp;use the internet, compared with 93 per cent of those without such conditions. So, I'm curious to know, Minister, how the Welsh Government's digital strategy will help reduce digital exclusion.\" said by Natasha Asghar MS\n\"Tackling digital exclusion is one of the key aims of our strategy, and there's a number of different strands. There's our work with the UK Government on the reserved responsibility for infrastructure. I've had a number of meetings with my officials and, indeed, with the current UK Minister\u2014I think it's Minister Lopez, in the newly rebadged DCMS\u2014and we're looking at how they are going to meet their own obligations, and actually the fact there'll be a gap, because they expect to meet 85 per cent of the population. Now, we have to talk about how we get services and improved services to that extra 15 per cent.As well as the connectivity and the width, we then have a range of schemes in place actually to deal with practical access, and some of that is attitude. My mother has a connection in her house and I have regularly tried to get her to use it, but that's just one of those things. She doesn't do it, whereas other people are more keen to do it. And actually, this isn't just a point about entertainment. As we all know, there's a point about work, and it's also about access to services as well. Many of our services are moving to a digital-first model, which I think is a good thing, but that does mean we need to constantly be thinking about how we equip users, the people using the service, to be able to do so effectively. That's not just the public, of course; a number of the people who need support to make sure that they're properly enabled and are able to use the system actually are staff as well. So, those are parts of the challenges we're looking to try to resolve, and I'm very keen to see further progress made in the rest of this term.&nbsp;\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"Great, thank you, Minister. I really do appreciate the detailed answer.Now, moving on to my second question, the UK Government's gigabit broadband voucher scheme is a fantastic initiative, helping people to combat slow broadband speeds in rural areas. Vouchers worth thousands of pounds are being given to homes and businesses to help cover the cost of installing gigabit broadband. Last year, the Welsh Government announced it was going to stop its top-up funding for the scheme because you, and I quote, said that you 'don't have the money'. How can it be, Minister, that you don't have the money to put towards this fantastic scheme, but yet the Welsh Government is happy to fork out in excess of \u00a3100 million for more politicians in this place? So, can you please elaborate on more information as to why this isn't actually happening? Thank you.\" said by Natasha Asghar MS\n\"Look, I don't think it's particularly helpful or sensible to attempt to compare an entirely different issue with how we use Welsh Government budgets. If you want to have a conversation about the size and capability of this place, we could do that. When it comes to the reality of our budget, it's just undeniable\u2014the reality is our budget is worth less in real terms, in cash terms. It's also a demand to use Welsh Government funds on an area that is plainly reserved as well. I actually had a conversation earlier today with one of your colleagues about what we are doing and what we will try to do to fill in part of that reserved responsibility where the UK Government don't intend to meet the needs of people. There are practical choices, as ever. I'd like to be constructive in responding to questions, but you really do need to recognise that this is a situation of the creation of your party in Government at the UK level.&nbsp;\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"Okay, thank you very much for that, Minister. But it was also this Government that sent back \u00a3155 million to the UK Government because they didn't actually do their homework when it came to funding. So, let's not go down that road. I will carry on with my third question.&nbsp;Ofcom believes that approximately 15,000 premises cannot get a broadband service of at least 10 Mbps download speed and 1 Mbps upload speed. Openreach believes that it will be challenging to get those 15,000 properly equipped, and says it will require the industry and Governments to come together to find a solution. So, Minister, what is the Welsh Government doing to support the UK Government in ensuring that these 15,000 premises actually get an acceptable and adequate broadband speed? Thank you.\" said by Natasha Asghar MS\n\"Well, I come back to this: this is a reserved responsibility. It is the responsibility of the UK Government. We are acting because we don't think it's acceptable to simply abandon those people. The UK Government's stated ambition is to provide access to 85 per cent of the population. There are a range of people who would be excluded if we did nothing in this reserved area of responsibility. If you want to look at the people responsible for not acting in this area, they're Conservative Ministers in the UK Government. That's just unarguable. It's the settlement, it's the reality. I will act with the resources that are available. I will be constructive with UK Ministers about what we can do, but Members need to recognise, in all parties, that every step we take in this area, every pound we spend will provide a benefit to people in Wales, but it'll be money that we cannot spend on areas where we are actually responsible. But we're doing this because we recognise the societal and the economic value of doing so. We could do so much more, of course, if the Conservative Government actually met their own responsibilities.&nbsp;\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"The Plaid Cymru Spokesperson, Luke Fletcher.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Diolch, Llywydd. The Digital Inclusion Alliance Wales has published the second edition of its digital inclusion agenda, 'From Inclusion to Resilience', building on the first edition of the agenda that was introduced in early 2021, which outlined five key priorities to make Wales a digitally inclusive nation. Now, although the report outlines the very good progress that's been made by Welsh Government, despite the lack of support from UK Government, since its first publication\u2014which has seen an expansion, of course, to include over 90 members holding six quarterly meetings with Welsh Government Ministers\u2014it is clear that there is still some work that remains to be done.If I can start with the first priority: embedding digital inclusion across all sectors. The report highlights the need for greater engagement with the private sector, especially small and medium-sized businesses and microbusinesses, to ensure that digital inclusion is evenly distributed across Wales. So, could I therefore ask the Minister what steps are being undertaken by the Welsh Government to encourage private sector, specifically SMEs and microbusinesses, to engage in the digital inclusion agenda? And, of course, the Minister rightly pointed out, this is all being done by Welsh Government despite the complete and utter lack of support from UK Government on this agenda.\" said by ", "answer": "Luke Fletcher MS"}
{"content": "\"I'd now like to welcome Susan Lloyd-Selby, who's the lead for Wales of the Trussell Trust network. Thank you very much indeed, Susan, for joining us. I just wondered if I could ask you the first question. I'm just going to get my notes. Could you just tell us which groups of the population have been most affected by food poverty over the recent months and whether you expect this to get worse or better in the next few months?&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you for giving me the opportunity to come and address the inquiry this morning, and thank you for the question. You'll have seen from our written evidence submission that, sadly, foodbank use in Wales increased significantly in the first six months of this year. Wales saw a 38 per cent increase, which was the highest increase of all the UK nations. Our research and our stats show that there are people within the population that are disproportionately impacted by poverty, and particularly at the moment by cost-of-living increases. Our foodbanks would be seeing significant numbers of people with a disability, families with children, not surprisingly, but also here in Wales we do see a significant number of people who are working and whose income and circumstances are simply not sufficient for them to meet their essentials, and so they're having to turn to foodbanks for support.&nbsp;\" said by Susan Lloyd-Selby\n\"Some of our other witnesses, two weeks ago, talked about the 'new poor' joining the people who'd always been poor and this cost-of-living crisis is the latest challenge being thrown at them\u2014that there was a new set of people who were feeling almost like a rabbit in the headlights and that they'd never been in this situation before. I wondered if you have noticed that amongst the people who use foodbanks.&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Yes, we have. I was looking at some of the messages that have come in to some of our local foodbanks over the last week. These are just some examples. Somebody contacted us to say, 'I'm sorry to ask for help, but please can you help my sister? She's waiting for money to go into her account but it won't be there for five or six days. I'm struggling myself, and I can't help her. She hasn't got any food and she's got no money for a train to get to you. Is there anything you can do to help her get food?' And another message: 'Can I ask how I can get help, please, if possible? Me and the family are on our knees trying to find help. I don't know what to do. Thanks in advance and God bless you.' Those messages are indications of people who've never used a foodbank before, and don't know how to go about getting help with their financial crisis. Our stats\u2014that huge 38 per cent increase\u2014are an indication that there's a whole group of people who've never found themselves in this situation before and simply don't know where to turn. Often, they'll turn to a foodbank as the first port of call because the desperate need is to get food on the table. The way that we work in our network is we respond to that immediate need for food, but what we're also doing, which we think is absolutely critical, is having the conversations with those people to make sure they're accessing advice and support for their financial crisis to make sure that they're claiming everything that they're entitled to claim, because often people aren't, to make sure they're getting help with managing their debt, if people are struggling with that and have never had anybody to help them. It's a whole package of support to help them get through the crisis that they're facing. But yes, we are seeing people turning to us for the first time.\" said by Susan Lloyd-Selby\n\"Obviously, there's been a significant increase in the demand for your services. Could you tell us whether the contributions from the community and from the large food suppliers who donate food that's surplus to their requirements have managed to keep up with demand?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"It's a mixed picture. Across the network as a whole, foodbanks in the last three months of last year were purchasing about 9 per cent of all the food that they received in order to cope with demand. But I was looking at the stats over the weekend, and, for example, in January, Anglesey foodbank had to purchase 28 per cent of all their food, because donations weren't keeping pace with the demand that they were experiencing. It's patchy. In Cardiff in January, they didn't have to purchase any food, because they had sufficient stock and people had responded to the messaging around increased demand. Blaenau Gwent, I think, had to purchase 15 per cent of the stock last month.Sometimes, it may be that a foodbank is sitting on a lot of stock, but it's not the right stock. They might be sat on lots of tins of beans, and they need milk to give to people. So, it is patchy. Communities across Wales are astonishingly generous despite the pressures that they're experiencing. But the reality is, as demand continues to increase, as all families are experiencing pressure as a result of cost-of-living increases, it is difficult for donations to keep pace in some areas. We're aware that for some foodbanks, that may make long-term sustainability a challenge.\" said by Susan Lloyd-Selby\n\"But to date you've not had to turn anybody away.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"No. We talk to our foodbanks all the time about the pressures that they're facing. For example, through the winter, we offered every foodbank in Wales a \u00a35,000 emergency grant payment to enable them to buy food if they needed to to keep pace with the demand. That grant stream is open again for all the foodbanks. We have those very close connections, and we know if any of our foodbanks are in danger of falling over. None of them are at the minute, but, obviously, if a foodbank is having to rely on purchasing 30 per cent of its food, that will be something we will be keeping a very close eye on to make sure that the foodbank wasn't in the position where it had to turn anybody away. Thankfully, we're not doing that yet.\" said by Susan Lloyd-Selby\n\"Thank you, Susan. I'd like to bring in Jane Dodds first of all.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you, Susan. I hope that you can hear the English through the translation. Thank you for giving us evidence today. I'm grateful for the work that you do, but we shouldn't be grateful, because you shouldn't be doing it, in all honesty. We've heard that the numbers have been increasing over a number of years and in recent months as well, which is very disappointing, in my view. But I just want to put on record in this committee: what in your opinion and in your experience would be the one thing that would have an impact in terms of ensuring that fewer people were going to foodbanks?\" said by Jane Dodds MS\n\"Thank you for the question. It\u2019s difficult to say there\u2019s one thing. Our research shows that it\u2019s often an unexpected crisis in life that can result in somebody needing to turn to a foodbank. That might be somebody losing their job; it might be a relationship breakdown; it might equally be that, for example, the DWP has made a mistake in somebody\u2019s benefit payments and they\u2019re then having to make a repayment, and that can plunge them into crisis; it can be an unexpected bill. So, it\u2019s very difficult to say that there\u2019s one factor. We know that there are several factors that can plunge somebody into a financial crisis that means they need to turn to us. And often it is those unexpected events that people don\u2019t have the opportunity to plan for and take steps to respond to that mean they\u2019re in immediate crisis and need an emergency food parcel.\" said by Susan Lloyd-Selby\n\"Could I just ask one more brief question? So, in your opinion, it\u2019s not about benefits that people receive, for example. We heard on the radio and in the press today and yesterday that the Trussell Trust had said that this is about benefits; but in your opinion, the main reason is not to do with benefits.&nbsp;\" said by Jane Dodds MS\n\"Absolutely not. No, absolutely not. The main reason why people are having to rely on emergency food aid and foodbanks is because their income is insufficient for food, and we know that it\u2019s inadequacies in the social security system that are the primary driver of foodbank use.For example, today with the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, we\u2019ve launched a new \u2018essentials guarantee\u2019 campaign, and we\u2019re calling on the UK Government to introduce new legislation to make sure that nobody\u2019s income falls below that minimal level. With JRF, we\u2019ve estimated that that\u2019s \u00a3120 a week for a single person. From April, it will be \u00a385. So, that \u00a335 gap in basic income is what\u2019s driving thousands and thousands of people through the door of our foodbanks and through the door of other emergency food aid providers across Wales. That is the key issue, that people simply don\u2019t have enough money in their pockets for the essentials.It\u2019s a crisis on top of that which is often a reason why people have to turn to us for the first time, but we are seeing people who've had their income maximised, who\u2019ve done everything they can to ensure that the income they get goes as far as possible, and the reality is, it simply isn\u2019t enough. They\u2019re in a deficit budget position, and therefore they have no choice but to rely on emergency food aid to get by.\" said by Susan Lloyd-Selby\n\"We've got five more areas of questions to get through, so could you keep your questions brief and your answers brief as well? You don\u2019t need to repeat what\u2019s in your excellent paper, as we already have all that evidence. Sioned, did you have a\u2014\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"No, Jenny. You asked the question I was going to ask about turning people away.\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"Thank you. Moving on, then, to Sarah Murphy.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you very much, Chair. I\u2019m going to ask some questions just to dig in a bit more about tackling food poverty in the current climate. We have heard evidence that people are saying at the moment it is 100 per cent worse than it\u2019s been, even when we had that \u00a366\u2014it\u2019s like, \u2018Yeah, it\u2019s great, we appreciate it, but it just doesn\u2019t go far enough.\u2019 That\u2019s what people are telling us. They\u2019re also telling us that their mortgage payments are doubling, and so something like an MOT coming out of nowhere and not knowing how much that\u2019s going to cost, and it\u2019s more than you expected, as happens\u2014. These things are just knocking people. One person said that they had to ask their 19-year-old son for \u00a345 as a result. So, how effectively is the Welsh Government helping to tackle food poverty in its response to cost-of-living pressures, and what impact does the support it provides have?\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Thank you for the questions. I've already said that, unfortunately, Wales experienced the biggest increase of all the nations in the first six months of last year. We would say that the mitigations that Welsh Government has put in place through things like the winter fuel support scheme, the fuel voucher scheme, those mitigations, are very welcome. We know from our network that people are benefiting from them. What I'm not able to say is whether or not that has had an impact this year in terms of reducing foodbank use. So, we'll see that picture more clearly when we get to the end of the year and we produce our end-of-year stats. In the short term, those short-term mitigations clearly help people. In the long term, the evidence indicates that they're not sufficient to sustain people and lift them out of poverty and needing charitable food aid.&nbsp;\" said by Susan Lloyd-Selby\n\"Thank you very much. And my second question, then, is: you have described in your written evidence and today that foodbanks are at breaking point. So, what more could the Welsh Government do to support foodbanks and potential alternatives through this period?\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Yes, we're very clear that food is not the answer and providing food is a solution that risks embedding charitable food aid as a primary response to food insecurity. So, the single most important thing is to make sure that people are able to access advice and support with their financial crisis. And, in terms of the solutions that Welsh Government has put in place, wherever funding has been channelled through local authorities to ensure that emergency food aid is also orientated towards supporting people to access financial advice and support, that's the most effective way to address the current pressures.&nbsp;\" said by Susan Lloyd-Selby\n\"Thank you very much. That's very interesting. Thank you, Chair.&nbsp;\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Thank you. Altaf Hussain.&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you. Thank you, Chair. Susan, you have said that foodbanks are not the answer to tackling food poverty. What would you prefer to see, and what role can the Welsh Government play in delivering that over the longer term?\" said by Altaf Hussain MS\n\"Yes, thank you for the question. I want to be clear that I've sat across the table from thousands of people who don't have food to put on the table for their children for tea, so in the immediate term, if somebody doesn't have any money for food, they need that food parcel, and we'll continue to provide that for as long as people need it. But, in the longer term, what we'd like to see is a plan to reduce and prevent the need for emergency food aid in Wales.We recognise that\u2014. I've already said that the key driver of food poverty and foodbank use here is the social security system, and those decisions sit largely with Westminster. So, we recognise that. Nevertheless, we think there's more that Welsh Government can do, and we would welcome Welsh Government considering introducing a national plan to prevent and reduce emergency food aid, because we think that will, importantly, help us to understand the scale of the issue here in Wales\u2014Trussell Trust stats are only the tip of the iceberg. It will also bring key people around the table\u2014critically, people with lived experience of poverty and charitable food aid\u2014to identify the solutions that will reduce and prevent people finding themselves in that situation. We'd like that plan to include consideration of how Welsh benefits might be aligned more effectively to make it easier for people to access support, because we know that, at the moment, that can be a barrier to people claiming the things that they're entitled to.&nbsp;\" said by Susan Lloyd-Selby\n\"Thank you very much. And what would you want to see in this plan, and how much impact is this plan likely to have without the UK Government making changes to social security?\" said by Altaf Hussain MS\n\"Yes, as I said, we do recognise that\u2014. We would not say to Welsh Government, 'We want you to introduce a plan to end the need for foodbanks in Wales', because that would be unrealistic. We definitely think there are things that Welsh Government could do. We'd like that plan to set out a road map for increasing the income people have to buy food and essentials. Some of that work has already begun here. The 'Claim what's yours' campaign is a very welcome approach to raising people's awareness of what they're entitled to. We'd like to see a plan set out, a way of improving access to cash, an advance in a crisis, particularly encouraging local authorities to take a cash-first approach to responses to crisis wherever possible. The steps that Welsh Government has taken to enable local authorities to make cash-first payments around free school meals are very welcome.So, we think that there are already initiatives in Wales that could be built on and pulled together within a national plan that would make a difference. We absolutely want to see a plan focusing on prevention to avoid an immediate crisis becoming long-term hardship. And we also think that a plan should include a way of improving data sharing between Government at all levels, to ensure that there is a holistic approach and a holistic understanding of need, but also a more holistic approach to bringing local authorities and others together to address that need.\" said by Susan Lloyd-Selby\n\"Thank you very much, Chair.\" said by Altaf Hussain MS\n\"Very good. Ken Skates.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. You said that the cost-of-living support that's been provided so far has been temporary respite for households, but it hasn't helped them for an extended period of time. In that case, what approaches could support households over a longer period of time?\" said by ", "answer": "Ken Skates AM"}
{"content": "\"So, under item No. 2, we have instruments that raise issues to be reported to the Senedd under Standing Order 21.2 or 21.3. The first of these is SL(6)316; it's a made negative resolution instrument, the Judicial Offices (Sitting in Retirement\u2014Prescribed Offices and Descriptions) (Wales) Regulations 2023. These regulations prescribe the judicial offices that a person must hold or have held prior to their retirement to be eligible for appointment to a particular sitting in retirement office. Our lawyers have identified three technical reporting points and one merits reporting point, and a Welsh Government response has been received. Do you want to highlight anything on this, Kate?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Yes, thank you. It was the first two technical points that required a Welsh Government response. The first relates to defective drafting, noting that the heading in the Schedule refers to Part 5 of Schedule 3 of the Act, but the term 'the Act' is not defined anywhere in the regulations, so it's not clear which Act is being referred to. In response, Welsh Government acknowledges that this is an error but says that it does not propose to correct it, because in their view it will be clear enough that the reference is to the enabling Act. Then, the second technical point notes a number of inconsistencies between the Welsh and English texts. Again, Welsh Government agrees that these are errors but they do not propose to make corrections. Members may just wish to note that this is the second such response we've received from Welsh Government recently where they've said that they're not going to correct acknowledged errors. This is valid principle\u2014the obvious error\u2014but it's obviously undesirable to have a lot of errors remaining on the statute book indefinitely. So, it might be something that the committee wants to keep under review should we get further responses.\" said by Kate Rabaiotti\n\"There we are. Members are signalling they would want to keep that under review. We have a point of disagreement there, where the Government sees something as self-evident and doesn't need correction, but we will keep this under review. So, thank you very much. We're happy to agree those reporting points.So, we'll go on to item 2.2, regulations SL(6)317, amending the Care and Support (Charging) (Wales) Regulations 2015 and the Care and Support (Financial Assessment) (Wales) Regulations 2015, and we have a draft report in our papers as well. The overall stated purpose of these amending regulations is to effect a change to the existing regulations to apply an uplift to the minimum income amount in residential care charging and to reflect new pieces of legislation on financial support schemes. Our lawyers have identified one merits reporting point and we do not require a Welsh Government report on this.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Yes. So, the merits point is simply a matter to note. According to the regulatory impact assessment, local authority supported residents will retain around a third of the uplift in state pension and welfare benefits to spend on personal items, while local authorities will receive an increase in charge income of around \u00a38.3 million per annum.\" said by Kate Rabaiotti\n\"Thank you very much. Are we happy with that reporting point, happy to agree that? We are.Item 2.3, then, is regulations under SL(6)320, the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) (Amendment) (Wales) Regulations 2023. We have a draft report and a letter from the Minister for Health and Social Services to the Llywydd in your packs. These regulations provide that individuals who have a late application for leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom under the European settlement scheme, EUSS, but have not been granted EUSS pre-settled or settled status must not be charged for relevant healthcare services provided to them whilst their application is under consideration. Our lawyers have identified three merits reporting points to bring to our attention.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Again, these are matters to note. So, the first is the breach of the 21-day rule and the explanation provided by the Minister. The second to note is that there is an element of retrospectivity in the regulations, and this is justified in the explanatory memorandum, and then, finally, there's been no consultation in relation to the regulations.&nbsp;\" said by Kate Rabaiotti\n\"There we are. Are we happy to note those in a report on this? We are. Thank you very much. That brings us to our last item in this particular section, item 2.4; it's SL(6)319, the Non-Domestic Rating (Multiplier) (Wales) Regulations 2023, and we have a draft report in our papers. These regulations amend the basis on which the non-domestic rating multiplier is calculated. The regulations apply to the financial year beginning on 1 April 2023, and disapply the use of the consumer prices index for September 2022 when calculating the NDR multiplier. The effect of this is to freeze the NDR multiplier for 2023-24. And one of our colleagues here on this committee, who is the Chair of the Finance Committee, will be relishing getting his teeth into this one as well, I know. So, our lawyers have identified three merits reporting points.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Again, it's three points to note. The first is that the non-domestic rating revenue in Wales is pooled centrally and distributed to local authorities and police and crime commissioners, as part of the annual local government settlements, and that's why the multiplier needs to be determined before the annual settlements can be finalised. The second point draws Members' attention to the paragraphs of the explanatory memorandum highlighting that freezing the multiplier will result in lower bills for rate payers, but it will also reduce income into the non-domestic rating pool for 2023-24. However, this reduction will be fully funded by the Welsh Government, so that there should be no financial impact on local authority or police budgets. And then the final merits point just notes that there was no consultation.&nbsp;\" said by Kate Rabaiotti\n\"That's really helpful. Any comments on that? Are we happy to agree those points? We are. Thank you, Kate.&nbsp;\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"So, that takes on to item No. 3, instruments that raise no reporting issues under Standing Order 21.7. We only have one item under this section today, and it's item 3.1, which is SL(6)318, the code of practice on the exercise of social services functions in relation to Part 4, direct payments and choice of accommodation, and Part 5, charging and financial assessment, of the Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Act 2014. The revised code has been amended to reflect a number of new financial support schemes by making an addition to the list of forms of capital that should be fully disregarded in the financial assessment for charging for all forms of care and support. I don't know if there are any issues at all here that you want to flag.&nbsp;\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Nothing. Nothing to note.&nbsp;\" said by Kate Rabaiotti\n\"No. None. No reporting points on this. Are we happy with that, colleagues? We are. Thank you. So, we agree the reporting points there.&nbsp;\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"That takes us to item No. 4, notifications and correspondence under the inter-institutional relations agreement, a regular part of our deliberations. Under item 4.1, we have correspondence from the Minister for Rural Affairs and North Wales, and Trefnydd on the inter-ministerial group for environment, food and rural affairs, and we have a letter in our packs of 6 February there from the Minister. So, if I invite colleagues to note the correspondence from the Minister in relation to that inter-ministerial group meeting, held on 23 January, and the letter details for public interest topics of discussion, including the Retained EU Law (Reform and Revocation) Bill, and in particular the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs'&nbsp;plans for managing the extensive amount of legislation in the portfolio. The Minister also notes that she requested an update on the Animal Welfare (Kept Animals) Bill, and that she would be responding to a letter from Lord Beynon on the Animal (Low-Welfare Activities Abroad) Bill, and the next meeting will be on Monday 6 March. We might want to come back to this in private, but are we happy to note that for now? There we are. Okay.&nbsp;Item 4.2, then, in this section is correspondence from the Counsel General and Minister for the Constitution in respect of the Interministerial Standing Committee, and that letter and the written statement by the Counsel General relate to the most recent meeting of that committee, which was held on 1 February. And again, we're grateful to him for sharing with us the details of the topics of discussion, which included the importance of the Sewel convention and concerns around the retained EU law Bill. The Counsel General also, within the letter, notes that he'raised serious concerns over the suggestion that the UK Government might bring back the Bill of Rights, as well as concerns relating to the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill and the Strikes (Minimum Service Levels) Bill'as well. So, they obviously had a full agenda there on that day. Again, we can return to these in private session if colleagues want to.&nbsp;Then we have item 4.3, a letter from the Minister for Health and Social Services in respect of the UK health Minister's inter-ministerial group, informing us of a meeting on 28 February of the UK Government's health Minister and health Ministers of the devolved Governments. They will be discussing, we are told,'common pressures across the UK national health services and post winter planning and recovery'and they will be issuing a communique after that meeting. And again, this is something that we can return to if we want to in private session.Item 4.4, we have a letter from the Deputy Minister for Mental Health and Well-being and a statement as well relating to the Food Supplements and Food for Specific Groups (Miscellaneous Amendments) (No. 2) Regulations 2023. This informs us, from the Deputy Minister, about the need for an amending instrument in relation to the above regulations, and the Minister notes that the correcting instrument'addresses an error in the commencement provision'of the original regulations that had rendered them inoperable. The correcting instrument&nbsp;'also inserts transitional provisions into the Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003, the Food Supplements (Scotland) Regulations 2003 and the Food Supplements (Wales) Regulations 2003',and the Deputy Minister informs us that she'gave consent to these amendments being undertaken by the Secretary of State as they are required due to oversights in relation to the Miscellaneous Amendment Regulations and they form part of the same policy objectives which those Regulations were made to achieve'.So, if we're content to note that for now.\" said by ", "answer": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM"}
{"content": "\"So, for the first of our sessions on data justice and the use of personal data by the Welsh NHS, I'm very pleased to welcome Chris Carrigan, who is an expert data advisor for Use MY data, as well as Dr Robert French, and who are both here in the Senedd, and Ann John from Health Data Research UK, who's joining us online. So, welcome to all three of you. And I just wanted to start off by asking if you could just give me a summary, briefly, on how well healthcare data in Wales is being collected and used at the moment. As we've had a paper from Use MY data, do you want to say something very briefly? We've got your paper, obviously, and is there something, a headline, that you want to tell us?&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"I think, interestingly, the headlines tend to work across the UK as well. So, there is a significant amount of health data that is now being collected that wasn't collected before. If you look at the entirety of data that is collected about us as individuals to manage our healthcare, only a small amount is actually used for healthcare planning and research, particularly because a lot of it is recorded in ways that are either difficult to understand from a research analytics perspective, or inaccessible in terms of it sitting in different places and isn't linked together very well. But I do think you have in Wales, and had for many years, a research environment within the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank, which brings those data together and which has really driven research at a national level far more quickly than other parts of the UK. So, there's a real asset there that I think can be built upon.&nbsp;Other problems tend to be shared across other parts of the UK. So, there's a general lack of understanding among people about how their healthcare data is used\u2014it's difficult for a patient to understand what is in their healthcare data because, by and large, they can't see it all\u2014and a lack of understanding among the public about the real benefits that usage of healthcare data for the NHS, for planning and research, can bring. What the public tend to hear are largely negative messages about data loss, data hacking and risk, and therefore that engenders the perception of the public that data is something that maybe can't be trusted, when actually we want to move the agenda forward to something where it says, 'Data can be trusted. Use it in the right way and we can really use it to save lives'.&nbsp;I do think Wales is in a really strong position to be able to build on what SAIL has done for many years in bringing together data for research, more so than other parts of the UK, which tend to be a little behind, I would say.&nbsp;\" said by Chris Carrigan\n\"Thank you for that excellent summary. We'll just move over to Sarah Murphy, who's got some questions for you.&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Thank you very much. It\u2019s really good to have you here today. I\u2019m really pleased that we\u2019re doing this inquiry. I\u2019ve been having a look through your website and some of the projects and things you've been doing, and I was particularly interested in the national opt-out project, I suppose, or system, that was created in England. My impression has been that, in theory, obviously, it sets out to achieve all the aims of what you would like to see, which is to promote the benefits of sharing and using data to improve patient outcomes, but also the safeguards against that mistrust, I think. So, from Wales, looking at what happened, it looks like the intention was there, but maybe the execution wasn\u2019t ideal, and there has been some trust that has been lost, which has meant that people have opted out. So, it would be really useful for us to hear today from you how that happened, I suppose, and what you think are the pros and cons, and where we are with it now, because, obviously, most of this happened back in 2018, and anything we can learn from, I guess.&nbsp;\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Shall I start? So, I think you're right\u2014it's a very good summary. In England there is a national data opt-out, so, as an individual you could go on as an English NHS patient with your NHS number onto a website and you can decide whether you want your data, your confidential patient information, to be used for research and planning. It's a pretty simple yes/no. Now, on the one hand you think that's quite a straightforward way of working, but, of course, the nuances and complexities about how health data is used in a variety of settings with various safeguards is very different. So, how to encapsulate something into a very simple message when the answer is quite complicated can be difficult. So, I think, first of all, the concept about giving people a choice about how their health data is used outside of their direct care is very good. There's no doubt about that. That's certainly what people want. How you describe those choices to people, and the choices they can actually make, and the impact of those choices, is a much more nuanced, much more difficult thing to communicate, and I think that's where there are some of the lessons we could learn from how England have done it to how it gets implemented in other parts of the UK. There are some good lessons to be learned on that. By and large, choice is a good thing. It does engender trust. But around it goes the whole issue of things around transparency. So, if I want to make a choice about how my health data is used in Wales, I would love to know what's in my health data, where does it go at the moment, who can use it, what are the safeguards, where do patient voices sit around understanding those safeguards and making sure that organisations use them correctly, what choice can I make and what's the impact of the choice, and, around that, what are the benefits of using healthcare data rather than just the risks.\" said by Chris Carrigan\n\"Excellent. Thank you very much. Who'd like to add to that?\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Just to add to that, firstly, on whether people know what they\u2019re opting out of and what they get with the opt-out, I think a lot of people would think, \u2018Right, that means my data\u2019s not used for anything other than clinical care\u2019, when, actually that\u2019s not quite the case, and I think there\u2019s a real chance for Wales to do something much better than we\u2019ve seen in England. I think it\u2019s a smaller country that has better communication, possibly. So, I think there are more benefits that we could illustrate from the data sharing that\u2019s already happened.And the second point is that the English model is quite a blunt tool\u2014you\u2019re in or you\u2019re out, and there might be things that, really, you don\u2019t want your data shared for, because of something to do with you, or perhaps a data user that you don\u2019t want to use the data. So, you end up opting out of everything because of this one simple yes/no. I think those are the two points I\u2019d add.&nbsp;\" said by Dr Robert French\n\"Thank you very much.&nbsp;\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Sarah, could you\u2014? Ann John wants to come in on this point.\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Yes, of course.&nbsp;\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"So, I just wanted to highlight\u2014. I\u2019m a professor of public health and psychiatry at Swansea University. I also am a co-director of DATAMIND, which is a mental health hub in Health Data Research UK, and the mental health lead of Administrative Data Research&nbsp;Wales. So, I did really want to highlight what a flagship SAIL is for the secure storage and safe use of data. So, in many ways we have learned the lessons over the years of how to make data available for service planning and research in terms of patient and public benefit. I guess the real lesson to be learned is about having really meaningful public involvement. If you look at any of the initiatives through HDR UK or other organisations, that\u2019s the thing that makes a difference, and that happens on many different levels. So, on the one hand, we need to have a whole-public campaign about understanding what we mean when we\u2019re talking about the use of data and how data is stored. So, within DATAMIND we\u2019ve developed a data literacy course because, often, researchers, policy makers, NHS staff and the public are not all talking the same language. There's lots of evidence out there about what the public feel comfortable with and don't feel comfortable with, and I think there are lots of conversations to be had around that.But, as well, we need to involve the public in the meaningful design and use of data. So, they need to be involved in all of the bodies that are approving data for research and use. I think there are lots of ways we respect the public's rights about the use of their data, but also inform those conversations. I think the reason why this is so important is because we saw really clearly during COVID that trust is one of the fundamental issues upon which people make these decisions. Often, it's the most vulnerable, marginalised and underserved\u2014you know, the very people we want to do this work for and with\u2014who will be the people who opt out, which basically means they stop having a voice. So, I think it's going to be really important to do that work at a population level, but also very specific work with underserved populations.We've recently done a piece of work looking at the mental health needs in routine data. I do a lot of work in SAIL with the Gypsy and Traveller community. Us data scientists worked with researchers who have really strong relationships with those communities, and then we worked with the communities themselves. I think, once you embed that in how we're working with data, the insights for everyone are huge.&nbsp;\" said by Ann John\n\"How reliant is healthcare research on good-quality data, and what's needed to ensure that data is reliable and sufficiently comprehensive so that you are able to predict these disease patterns?\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Well, it's a mix. When you're working with data at scale, there are real relationships between looking at trends, looking at how things are changing, looking at how people are accessing services\u2014from that planning and delivery to discovery science. However, routinely collected data is not collected for research purposes, so I think it's really important to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the data that you're using. So, within HDR UK and ADR Wales, we do lot of work in SAIL to understand how we're finding people and what it means. What we've found with certain populations, and we've seen it a lot during COVID, is that the poor quality recording of ethnicity data was a real issue. I think, as we use this data more, we have to also be doing the work to understand where people are represented and where they aren't. Within HDR UK, there's what they call the 'phenotype library'\u2014an innovation gateway\u2014where researchers from across the UK share those insights. So, I think it's really important that, in the doing of this work, particularly when we start using more artificial intelligence and more innovative analytical techniques, that people understand what's there and what's not, and that we combine that with work to improve the data quality.\" said by Ann John\n\"Yes, thank you very much. Just my last question, then, to\u2014\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Chris Carrigan, I think, wants to come in.&nbsp;\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"Right, sorry. Yes, of course.\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"On your question about the opt-outs, you asked whether there were any lessons to be learned. I should have said that if you were a patient in England, the first thing you heard about data usage, which initiated the opt-outs, was in the media, because there was a whole void of information about how health data gets used. Negative news stories went in the media and then lots and lots of people\u2014millions of people\u2014chose to opt out. That's happened twice now in England. So, the lesson to be learned here is: be active about the ways you communicate to the entire population about the benefits of the use of health data. Don't let the first thing they see to be bad news about health data, because that's very difficult to recover from.\" said by Chris Carrigan\n\"Absolutely, I agree. I can see you nodding as well, Ann. Just the last question that I was going to ask you, then: what evidence is there that public trust and confidence in data sharing varies depending on the organisations with whom the data is being shared? Can you provide any examples? We've talked about how we can lose that trust, but are there any in particular that patients like and trust?\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"A very good resource, to give you the evidence\u2014this is the web resource that was brought together by Understanding Patient Data. What they did was pull together whole sets of research. Essentially, there are no surprises here\u2014the further a person gets away from their treating clinician, the less trust they have in who's using their data. So, high trust in GPs and then hospitals, and then academia, universities, and then out to commercial companies. So, the level of trust goes out like that, so it drops off. People trust commercial organisations less than they trust their GP practices to use data, which is probably what you'd expect.I think the answer to some of those things is to address what commercial organisations or universities do with data. What data do they get, what are the safeguards, what are the checks and balances? Where's the patient voice in understanding whether that's the right thing to do, and what are the benefits that we intend to see or have seen from the uses of data across the pathway? That's really where you begin to build public trust in different levels of use of data by different organisations.\" said by Chris Carrigan\n\"Thank you.\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Just to follow on from that, my specific research is on type 1 diabetes and young people, and we did a session last year where we had 80 young people come in and we did workshops with them, and we asked that very question. So, we listed a bunch of different organisations and, 'Could you rank them?' and 'Would you be happy to share, or would you not be happy to share?' Of course, there were certain ones, with your hospitals, your clinicians and so on, they were very happy, and other ones, they weren't happy. Chris mentioned the usage, and once we explained different uses\u2014that a teacher might have their data, or someone from the council, all of these different uses\u2014they coould start to say, 'Well, for that purpose, yes, I'd be happy'. So, I think the purpose is critical and then that follows on from that point of transparency about saying what we're going to use the data for and who's using it and why. There were certain uses\u2014we always talk about commercial companies as one that people are sceptical of, but I think when the transparency is there and the explanation of what they're going to do with that data is clear and the public benefit that arises from it, I think people can be more supportive.\" said by Dr Robert French\n\"Excellent. Thank you very much. Thank you, Chair.\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Thank you. The NHS has long had quite a complex process of permissions before people can do research on randomised control trials and that sort of thing and it has felt to researchers quite bureaucratic and really extensive to-ing and fro-ing, but how has that system, which that has long existed, well before the digital years, helped us navigate this difficult path between personal data and the good of society and understanding better why some people are affected by a particular disease, rather than another?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"I guess there's a lot to that question, but, in my experience, I've been working with data linkage or linked data for about 10 years, but since 2016, I've been trying to actively link data and bring in data from different people, and that process takes a long time; it can take a couple of years to get some data sets linked, and then you do your analysis. So, I think one of the things that the patient groups were really surprised at was the time it took to do it and the effort and the resources just to link data\u2014data that they support for uses that they support. So, I think the challenges are there. COVID has made a difference for certain research and people's perceptions, but I don't think it has necessarily sped up non-COVID research, from my perspective, at least.\" said by Dr Robert French\n\"Okay. Ann.\" said by ", "answer": "Jenny Rathbone AM"}
{"content": "\"With that, we're going to turn directly to the first substantive item today, item 2, which is the evidence session on the Food (Wales) Bill. We have with on screen Lesley Griffiths, the Minister for Rural Affairs and North Wales, and Trefnydd. We also have two of your officials, Minister\u2014David Lloyd-Thomas, head of the food policy and strategy unit at the Welsh Government, and Claire Butterworth, lawyer for the Welsh Government as well. You're all very welcome, and thank you for spending the time with us. We've got about an hour to get through quite a lot of things on the food Bill, so if you're happy, we'll kick straight into it.&nbsp;\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Yes, of course.&nbsp;\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"Thank you. Minister, if I can begin with asking you whether you consider that this legislation is necessary, and therefore whether you support Peter Fox's Bill.&nbsp;\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"No, I don't support the Bill. I don't think the legislation is necessary. There are some very complex issues about food. I think, really, the Bill that's now been brought forward\u2014which I think has changed quite a lot since Peter first brought it to the attention of the Senedd\u2014doesn't really provide the solutions to the many complex issues that have been mentioned in the explanatory memorandum that's come forward with the Bill. One of the things the EM says is that this Bill will, and I'm quoting, enable'a coherent, consistent and strategic cross-governmental approach to policy and practice on all aspects of the food system.'Then it talks about establishing a more sustainable food system here in Wales. But I don't think, when you read the explanatory memorandum or the Bill, that really there are any proposals or solutions that would really convincingly address those points. Also, the EM says there are just two options, really\u2014it's either do nothing or legislate. So again, if you look at the EM, it says:'the Welsh food system in a comparative disadvantage to other food systems in the United Kingdom as a result of recent policy and legislative developments.'There's nothing to substantiate that statement, really, in the EM or in the Bill. I've had several meetings with Peter Fox to try and help and see what it was he wanted to do. There's also no examination of whether there are ways to improve planning or co-ordination through the existing mechanisms that we have under the existing powers and legislative framework.So, again, I don't support the Bill. I've made it very clear that that is the Welsh Government's position, and we've done that since Peter first brought that proposed Bill forward. But I do think it has changed a lot. It was quite vague, probably, in the beginning.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"Thanks for that answer. Let me test that a little bit further and then, probably to your great dismay and concern, I'm going to bring in a former agriculture Minister to test this a little bit as well.&nbsp;\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"And you're also a former agriculture Minister.\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"I'm also a former agriculture Minister, yes. Crikey. James, your time will come as well.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"I did cover agriculture at the local authority.\" said by James Evans MS\n\"Well, there we are. Your worst possible nightmare here.&nbsp;\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"What was that, sorry? I missed that bit.\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"James will come back afterwards. We're all with agricultural experience of some sort. But anyway, let's go to\u2014. One of the challenges here has been from the organisation Food Sense Wales. Listening to what you said in response to that opening answer, they contend the Bill is essential to bring about coherent and comprehensive food policy. You clearly disagree, but why?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"I think it's really disappointing that Food Sense Wales haven't understood the relevance of the policy framework that we already have with the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015. I think, for me, that's the big disappointment, really. We've already got that policy framework with the Act, and I think it's a real missed opportunity for them to bring forward, again, solutions and ways of working with the current legislation, with our current policies, with the current framework, because we do have that well-being of future generations Act. Everything that we do, we have to do it through the lens of the Act, and I think they've missed a real opportunity there.&nbsp;I think it's also fair to say that if this Bill were passed, the duties that would follow would take up considerable resources to, really, in my view\u2014. Certainly, in the officials' advice I've had, it's just another layer of bureaucracy. We can create many of the plans and targets, and those are the discussions that I've had with Peter Fox to see what we could do within current policies and frameworks. So, that's why I don't think the legislation is necessary.&nbsp;\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"We'll go into this in quite some depth over the next hour, but I'm going to\u2014. You clearly disagree with the Member bringing forward the Bill, who says this will provide that coherency, and it's interesting your responses\u2014. You know, your response to Food Sense Wales is they clearly don't understand the things you've put in place already, and the framework and the well-being of future generations Act, and so on. The question arises then, 'Well, why don't they?' and so on. But I'm going to hand to my colleague Alun Davies, just before we go into even more depth.&nbsp;\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"I'm not sure that any of us understand the frameworks around the future generations Act, but we won't go after that this afternoon. From the Minister, it sounds like\u2014tell me if I'm wrong\u2014the Government will be voting against this measure when it comes back in front of the Senedd. I assume that's the case, given what the Minister's just said, and the Minister can correct me if I've got that wrong.&nbsp;\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"That's correct.&nbsp;\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"That is correct. Okay. To what extent have you negotiated with the Member in charge? I voted for this Bill to give it an opportunity to move forward, because I think a food Bill is necessary, as it happens, because I believe there's a great deal of incoherence within Welsh Government around how it deals with food. There have been a number of different Measures, in the old days, and regulations passed, to try to address that; I'm not sure it has been addressed. So, I think this Bill did have some potential. But I'm also disappointed in many ways\u2014probably from a different direction to the Minister\u2014that the Member hasn't taken the opportunity of the introduction of this Bill to actually focus on a couple of key objectives, and seems to have gone far too broad with the legislation; it seems far greater than anybody would anticipate from private Member's legislation. So, can I ask the Minister to what extent she has sought to negotiate with the Member in charge, and to what extent she has sought to shape and to amend the legislation to come to a conclusion where the legislation can be taken forward?&nbsp;\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"On your first question, I've met with him several times and officials have met with him several times to try and flesh out, I suppose, what he wanted. I mentioned in my opening answers to the Chair that I think\u2014. And I think you're right, Alun\u2014I think it has changed a lot since Peter Fox first introduced this Bill into the Senedd. I think in the beginning, it was perhaps very vague, and it was trying to find out exactly what he wanted. I'm not sure we've been able to agree on many things, unfortunately, going forward. I don't know whose fault that is, but I've certainly had the opportunity and given Peter Fox the opportunity to try and work with him.I'm coming to the second part of your question now. I've been very happy to work with him, I've been very happy for my officials to do so. David Lloyd-Thomas has been the main official in relation to this and he's met with him, and special advisers have met with him. Have I done a great deal to shape and amend? I would say no, I don't think we have really done a huge amount there, certainly not amend, because I think it was really important for him to tell us what he wanted. I think a lot of what Peter wants now is based on the Good Food Nation (Scotland) Act 2022. And again, because we've got the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 here in Wales, and Scotland have got nothing\u2014not many countries have got anything very similar to the well-being of future generations Act\u2014that was a big issue, really, for Peter to\u2014. You know, you're trying to put a round peg into a square hole, really, because the legislation is so different. So, I don't think we've done a huge amount about what we could do to amend it to take the Bill forward.\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"We are going to go quite deeper here, but let me ask you the question that always engages us as a committee. The provisions that do fall within this Bill, should it progress, are you confident that they fall within the legislative competence of the Senedd? Have you done that analysis?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"I suppose, because it's not a Government Bill, that's not really something that I've focused on; that would be a matter for Peter Fox and, obviously, for the Llywydd. In general, I would say that, yes, I think it falls within legislative competence, but I wouldn't say we've gone into it very deeply.\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"So you haven't gone into it in that detail because it's not a Government Bill, but yourself and David and the team, your overall analysis is that the provisions, which have grown as this Bill has developed, fall broadly within the competence of the Senedd.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"I would say so, broadly. But as I say, that won't be a matter for me to determine.\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"We'll have to put that question to Peter himself as well. James, let's bring you in.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Thank you. I'll try to be as neutral in this as I can be, Minister. Have you and your officials taken UKIMA into this? Do any provisions within the Bill actually engage with the United Kingdom Internal Market Act 2020, and does that have any problems with developing the Bill going forward?\" said by James Evans MS\n\"Again, that would be a question for Peter. I'm sure Peter has considered that very carefully. I don't consider UKIMA is engaged by provisions in the Bill, as it doesn't prohibit or restrict, for instance, the sale of food or other products here in Wales.\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"On another point, you've stated previously in the Chamber, and other places, that the community food strategy developed by the Welsh Government actually covers a lot of these areas. Do you think there's enough scrutiny on Government, though? Because this Bill wants to set up the food commission, which would hold Welsh Government accountable to targets, and everything else set out in this Bill. Do you think there's enough scrutiny currently of your community food strategy, and do you think that, if we don't have this piece of legislation, actually, strategies like the one that the Welsh Government previously had in place are just going to be put on the shelf and not be monitored and delivered properly?\" said by James Evans MS\n\"The community food strategy was a manifesto commitment of my party, on which I stood, and, obviously, is something that we will be bringing forward in this five-year term of Government. I think it's fair to say that the community food strategy was brought forward because we recognised, as a Government and as a Labour Party, that there was a gap that needed filling. The community food strategy is the reason we're bringing that forward. As I say, it's a gap in our policies, and it will be just one of a suite of policies where we are looking at the food system, if you like. There's a great deal of work being done on the food strategy, but I think it's fair to say that, because of the work that officials\u2014when I say 'officials', I mean 'official'\u2014have had to do on Peter Fox's Bill, that work hasn't been as fast as I would like it to be. I think that's fair to say. So, there's still a great deal of work going on in relation to the food strategy, but there's more work that we need to do.I'm not a Minister who likes to see strategies put on the shelf and not brought down and not done anything with, so that is absolutely not the intention. Obviously, we have lots of strategies that perhaps aren't scrutinised as much as the Senedd would like, but I think there are lots of strategies that the Senedd do excellent scrutiny on. So, as I say, we have completed some initial work, and it's interesting to see, I think particularly with the public, the public perception of what a community food strategy would be and what they think should be in it, and our stakeholders as well. For me, the community food strategy\u2014. So, when you pick up something after an election and you're making it tangible, if you like, I think it's very exciting; I think there's a lot of energy across Wales that we can encompass in that community food strategy. So, we've got some long-term plans for that, but, unfortunately, as I say, because we're doing this Bill, we've not been able to perhaps be as quick as I would like. So, it is a strategy; it's not legislation, as you say, but we have lots of strategies that form lots of our policies that are scrutinised at a different level.\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"It's quite nice to hear you say that you're a Minister who actually doesn't like strategies to sit on a shelf\u2014and I've been in numerous organisations where lovely strategies are developed, they sit on shelves; they do sit, they are never developed. You, potentially, may not be the agriculture Minister forever. Obviously, Governments\u2014\" said by James Evans MS\n\"I don't think that's 'potentially'. [<em>Laughter</em>.]\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"\u2014Governments change, First Ministers change, and one of the concerns I know that the Member bringing this forward has is that, yes, a community food strategy is good, but if you change, there is no incentive here to deliver this if it's not in legislation. Because different Ministers have different priorities, and if it was in legislation, it would be able to be monitored properly. As I said, with the change of personnel, the community food strategy could go back on the shelf and never be looked at again. Do you think that that is a genuine concern that the Member does have and is recognised?\" said by James Evans MS\n\"No, I don't, because what I'm not saying is that the community food strategy is the same as Peter Fox's Bill; what I'm saying is that we've already got lots of legislation, lots of policies, lots of strategies in place, as well as we are bringing forward the community food strategy. So, I'll give you an example about not leaving a strategy on the shelf: Alun Davies brought forward a food and drink action plan back in 2014, when he was in this portfolio. That wasn't scrutinised, but, boy, was it really, really achieving, and it achieved way, way above what the Minister in 2014 planned for it to do. So, I think, as a Welsh Government, we've got a huge record of delivery and, as I say, that action plan from 2014 to 2020 absolutely surpassed the target that Alun set. And I remember sitting in Cabinet thinking Alun was absolutely way, way above the ambition that that could achieve, and it absolutely surpassed that. But what I'm trying to say is that those strategies don't have to be in legislation to achieve and deliver.\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"Alun Davies is quietly purring away in the corner now contentedly.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Actually, I'm not quite sure that his head is going to fit out of the committee room door now, Lesley\u2014thank you.\" said by James Evans MS\n\"But that is a really, really good example.\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"Let's move on.\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"I use that example not just when I'm talking about food, as we are today, but when I talk about delivery of government. That strategy and that action plan was way above\u2014and I'm sure that Alun would agree\u2014the ambition that he thought it would be. And I thought it was being overambitious; I remember thinking that at the time.\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"You've mentioned before about overlap with this Bill with other pieces of legislation\u2014the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 Act and potentially the Social Partnership and Procurement (Wales) Bill. Can you go into that a little bit further and how you potentially think this legislation could hinder some of those policies and Acts from actually being delivered?\" said by ", "answer": "James Evans MS"}
{"content": "\"So, I'll move on to our main item on the agenda today, which is services for care-experienced children: exploring radical reform; it's our thirteenth evidence session. I'd like to welcome the witnesses here this morning. We have Jan Coles, head of children and families services at Carmarthenshire County Council and the incoming chair of the All Wales Heads of Children\u2019s Services; Taryn Stephens, head of children\u2019s services, Merthyr Tydfil County Borough Council and incoming vice-chair of the All Wales Heads of Children\u2019s Services; and Sally Jenkins, strategic director of social services, Newport City Council.We've got a number of questions to get through this morning, so I'll make a start. We're interested in your views on the research from the Nuffield Family Justice Observatory, which showed that the number of very young babies subject to care proceedings doubled in Wales, meaning that 83 per 10,000 newborn infants were subject to care proceedings in 2015, compared to 40 per 10,000 in the three years before that. Do we know if this trend is likely to have continued since 2015, and, if so, what specific approaches are local authorities taking to deal with these rising numbers? Sally.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Shall I start, and then I'm sure that Jan and Taryn will want to jump in? So, I suppose that the first thing is to say that we really welcome the work of the Nuffield Family Justice Observatory. A number of local authorities have been very involved with that work, and I actually sit on the board to represent Wales. So, it's a really welcome addition to being able to join data and research into practice. And I think, across Wales, what we've already seen on the back of their 'Born into Care' research and their numbers research, in terms of the number of children coming into care, is some really positive and constructive ways of looking forward to address and understand that research, and work with them with the data partnership in Wales and the University of Lancaster.&nbsp;I think what we would all be very clear about across Wales is that all 22 local authorities' children services are absolutely committed to working to support families, and it's working, first and foremost, to support those families to keep their children safe, well and happy. And that might sound glib, it might sound high level, but I think what we would say is that, for our staff and us, that is our first commitment.And when we look at data like that, the first thing we want to do is unpick it. I think what we have all done since 2015 is really look at our family services, look at how we can work with families as early as possible, and that's not just about statutory children's services; that's about Families First, Flying Start, and how we in Wales look at that broad swathe of services.&nbsp;I think, from a statutory perspective, what we are really clear about is that we work in partnership with Care Inspectorate Wales, CAFCASS Cymru, the courts and the statutory framework, but our No. 1 partners are families and children, and those who we work with predominantly. What you will, I suspect, in your 13 evidence sessions already have seen is a number of pieces of work, funded by grant money and by local authorities, looking at how we support early intervention into families, how we support babies with their mums and their dads going forward, and how we create better services.&nbsp;What we know is that what we struggle with on a daily basis is a workforce to make that a reality. So, I suppose my answer would be that, yes, we do think that services are improved since 2015; I'd like to go back to the data and explore it. The pandemic really got in the way in a lot of the work that we were and still are able to do in terms of the impact on families, and now the cost-of-living crisis. But the will, the commitment, the wish to ensure that, wherever possible, babies remain with their families safely is absolutely our No. 1 priority.&nbsp;\" said by Sally Jenkins\n\"Does anybody want to add anything, or are you happy with that?&nbsp;\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Yes, happy with that.&nbsp;\" said by Jan Coles\n\"Okay, thank you. And we're also interested in any views you can share with us about the huge variation in the numbers and rates of children going into care in different local authorities across Wales, even when rates of deprivation are accounted for. Would you be able to comment on that?&nbsp;\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"I'm sure we all, again\u2014. It is a constant challenge in terms of understanding where, even between neighbouring authorities with similar demographics, you can see changes. Now, again, one of the things I would come back to is that what we see is variation in workforce and how social services are arranged. I think what we're all very clear about is what you need to look at is that per 10,000 rate, and, if you look at that per 10,000 rate across all 22 local authorities, there has been some closing of the gap\u2014not as great a closing of the gap as perhaps one would like to see.&nbsp;I think we are also very clear that it is really important\u2014and I think you've already alluded to that\u2014to compare like with like, and to compare clear demographics so that you've got a similarity. But, nonetheless, we do see differences. We know that, sometimes, differences arise because of changes in that area, so you might see changes in the local authority, you might see that a tragedy has happened\u2014you see the impact of all sorts of things within that area. I would say that I still think that it is an area that we need to understand more about, about why that happens and why that challenge happens.What we do know from research that Care Inspectorate Wales and the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service Cymru have undertaken is that, actually, once we come to the point of children being removed, they have never seen\u2014. They do not find instances where children should not have been removed and have been. So, there is a real complication here in terms of the courts are seeing children who clearly should be removed, and yet the data is skewed. So, I think we would feel that, across Wales, we would like to understand that data better, and perhaps to be able to look more closely in each of our local authorities.&nbsp;\" said by Sally Jenkins\n\"Jan.&nbsp;\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you. Diolch. I think that workforce stability is a really, really important feature around this work. So, if we consider, for example, Carmarthenshire, where I work, we've had a really stable workforce with stable leadership, and there are significantly lower numbers and rates of children in care there than in other areas where you'll see that kind of different pattern. So, I think I'd reiterate what Sally was saying earlier, that the key to delivering any of this work, to keeping families together, to making sure that children are properly cared for while they're in care, is making sure we've got a workforce where we don't have gaps. We've got an incredibly committed workforce right now. They'd go to the ends of the earth to support the families. But there are gaps, and I think that can have a real impact on those kinds of numbers that you're describing.&nbsp;\" said by Jan Coles\n\"We'll certainly come on to questions around workforce later as well, so there'll be points on that. But before we go on to that, perhaps you can explain why workforce instability means higher rates in care.&nbsp;\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"I think it's appropriate to consider that within the context of the 'A Healthier Wales' strategy. We know underneath the quadruple aim that, actually, we can't achieve on any of the four themes unless we have a sustainable workforce in Wales, and that is across health and social care. I think that is a key factor for us. It's something that we know we have struggled with, and actually that's going to be something that needs partner agencies, Social Care Wales, Welsh Government, local authorities to all work together in the immediate and longer term to address.&nbsp;I think coming back to the query around the number of children who are looked after, I think it's very important to say that, again, that needs a partnership approach that is a systemic way of working, and that we need to work alongside education, health, the third sector to look at what's happening in different local authorities that do support safely reducing the number of children looked after.\" said by Taryn Stephens\n\"Thank you. A critique from the British Association of Social Workers of the recent MacAlister independent review in England was that it comes across as simplistic and highly negative. The association says child abuse and neglect are hidden and hard to prove, and that&nbsp;'social workers are very apprehensive about getting things \"wrong\u201d, which...will be extremely hard to change while the media and politicians are so ready to condemn social workers and others when they make \"mistakes\".'What are your views on that?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"I wouldn't want to comment on Josh MacAlister's care review. I'm thankful I live and work in Wales\u2014very thankful. I think in terms of media criticism, critique, it is a real challenge for social work staff. I think all three of us and all our peers have experienced that, and it is hard. You day-to-day in this job are managing risk and challenge and controversy. It's the best and the worst job in the world. It's never, ever dull, it's fantastic, and what you see is that you have made a difference, and you make positive change possible. But that critique, that criticism, that undermining of social work is really, I think, damaging to us as a workforce, and it comes back to that\u2014why would you want to go into a profession that is seen in that way? You wouldn't. So, I think it does have an impact. I think it has an impact on the morale of the existing workforce, and then I think it also has an impact on those wishing to come into the workforce, in choices that they make. I think it also makes it difficult in terms of management of risk. A key part of what we all do is manage risk. We manage risk that, I think, very often is not understood in terms of that balance of safety for children with their families, be that parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters. And that critique, that fear, is very real. I think it's fair to say we all feel and live with that all of the time.\" said by Sally Jenkins\n\"I think our role as leaders is to make sure that the workforce feels supported, that they're equipped and skilled to do the task that we ask them to do, and that others around them\u2014people like yourselves, elected members and people in communities\u2014understand the work that they do, and how difficult and challenging it is, but that they are supported day to day to do that really difficult but very, very important and rewarding work.\" said by Jan Coles\n\"Thank you. Poverty, substance misuse, mental health and learning disabilities are all part of the complex picture of why children in Wales are going into care. However, we have heard that up to 75 per cent of cases can involve domestic violence. What more should the Welsh Government be doing to ensure a more consistent level of support and protection for this group of women and children so that we can reduce entries into care because of domestic violence?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"If I make a start, domestic violence, violence against women, domestic abuse and sexual violence\u2014absolutely, we see those day in, day out. We never see, or very rarely do we see, in isolation one of those elements. What we see are families with a complexity, generally, of what we work with. Specifically, when we're working with domestic abuse, it's a more complex arena because of the non-devolved nature of some elements of that, so that's one of the challenges that we experience. I think the violence against women, domestic abuse and sexual violence legislation in Wales is very, very welcome, and we work within that. But what we still see are some real challenges in how specialist services in that arena are funded, particularly direct services for children and how we support those children.I think we would all welcome the campaigns that there have been, both out of the UK Government and the Welsh Government, in relation to this area. I think what we would want to see are more services that are available for that group of women and children, but also a better understanding and evidence base, for example, for perpetrator services and how we work with the whole family to protect children in those environments.\" said by Sally Jenkins\n\"Thank you. Diolch. We've had a snapshot of data from Swansea that suggests that a third of care-experienced parents go on to have a child removed from their care, and even when they're young parents there's data to show that children can be safely returned if the parents are provided with that wraparound support that you've touched on, Sally, if that's intensive. How helpful do you see those wraparound preventative services for care-experienced parents being, in terms of safely keeping children and birth families together?&nbsp;\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"I think we would absolutely agree. It's been a really positive move across Wales that we've seen the development of more and more of those types of services to work with care-experienced young people. I think what we're very clear about, as a corporate parent, is that our role is to support children and young people in care into adulthood in a way that is safe and happy. Sometimes, that can be ensuring that they've got the tools, the network and the equipment to be able to go on to be good parents, because that's part of your role as a parent. I think some of the challenge in that is building an established network and framework of support for those young people if they become parents early. But we would absolutely welcome the nature of services like Jig-So, Baby in Mind, Born into Care and Baby and Me, which clearly are having an impact on that group of children being able to remain in the care of their families. Yes, absolutely, it's a really welcome development.\" said by Sally Jenkins\n\"James Evans.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you. On the point that you made about politicians criticising and the workforce issues, there is a role for Care Inspectorate Wales in this as well to make sure that local authorities are actually delivering for children. I know, as Jan knows, from my previous role in local government that CIW only do full inspections every four years, which is set out in the code of practice of how they deal with local authorities. Do you think that some of this could be mitigated if CIW inspected more regularly, on children's services in particular, to make sure that things are actually being done right in local authorities, and, actually, that it gives a bit of cover for staff as well to make sure that somebody is there, looking over this all of the time to make sure that we are delivering on what's set out in the code of practice?\" said by James Evans MS\n\"I don't, no. We have really regular contact with CIW. As heads of children's services and directors we meet very regularly to go through things. We have annual reviews, which are really important and part of that monitoring. There are also thematic inspections that take place throughout the year. Right now, there's a piece of CIW work going on as well. So, although those full inspections might only take place every four years, there's a lot of activity that takes place in between that, I think, probably provides good assurance. No, I wouldn't be asking for anything more frequent than that.\" said by Jan Coles\n\"Picking up on Jan's point, there are assurance checks, the quarterly meetings with inspectors, and the fact that CIW are involved in local authorities for regulation and for placements. It's not just about that one big set piece; it is much, much more than that, the involvement with CIW. I think it's about recognising that they have that and that they can come in at any point that they wish.\" said by Sally Jenkins\n\"I could go into this all day, so I'll come back later, if we've got time.\" said by James Evans MS\n\"Thank you, James. We'll go on to some questions now from Ken Skates.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thanks, Chair. What is local government's view on an approach that would see universal basic advocacy provision for all parents&nbsp;involved in the child protection system, so that, obviously, they can understand the jargon and the process that they're dealing with?\" said by ", "answer": "Ken Skates AM"}
{"content": "\"We also, as I mentioned, as I'm not here for the second part of today's meeting, need to appoint a temporary Chair. May I ask therefore whether Members would be content for Huw Irranca-Davies to be appointed as temporary chair for the second part of today's meeting? I see that everyone is content with that. Great. Thank you very much. And I do believe that it is just worth explaining that, if I have any technical issues today, I'm sure that Huw will be able to step into the breach if I disappear from your screens, or whatever else could happen as we use the technology today. There we are. Excellent. Thank you very much to you all.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Right, we'll move on to the second item, which is the continuation of our evidence gathering on and scrutiny of the Environment (Air Quality and Soundscapes) (Wales) Bill. And joining us today, we have three individuals who are going to give evidence to us. A very warm welcome, therefore, to Chris Ashley, who's policy lead, environment and vehicles with the Road Haulage Association; Christine Boston, who's director of Sustrans Cymru; and Joshua James, who's the public affairs manager at Living Streets. A very warm welcome to the three of you. We'll go straight to questions, therefore, and I'll ask the opening question, a general question, if truth to be told: is the Bill as it's currently drafted sufficiently ambitious to lead to significant improvement in the air quality and soundscapes in Wales? And if it isn't sufficiently ambitious, could you explain why? Who wants to go first?\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"I'm happy to go first.&nbsp;\" said by Christine Boston\n\"Yes, Christine\u2014okay, thank you very much.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Diolch. So, in our view, we think the Bill needs to be more ambitious, given the scale of the problem. It's quite a major issue that needs to be tackled, and we know that transport is a major contributor to poor air quality. It's the largest source of nitrogen oxides in Wales, and road traffic is a major source of carbon emissions as well.&nbsp;For us in particular we're disappointed that there isn't a greater focus on active travel as part of the solution. We think there are some opportunities to build that into the Act. And the other thing is we would like it to be better aligned to World Health Organization guidance. They have quite stringent international targets and the Bill doesn't quite align with those at the moment, so we'd like to see that.\" said by Christine Boston\n\"Okay. And a few of those issues, obviously, we'll be picking up directly on as we pick up on these issues. Any further comments from Josh or Chris? Josh.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"First of all, I would agree with what Christine Boston has said. In some parts of the Bill there is clear ambition, and we welcome the wider range of powers\u2014for instance, things on trunk road charging et cetera. But, particularly in terms of air quality targets, we don't think there's enough ambition stated to deal with the\u2014. Well, we're dealing with a climate emergency, we're dealing with an air quality emergency, and we feel like it could go further.&nbsp;\" said by Joshua James\n\"Okay, thank you. And Chris, your reflections.&nbsp;\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Yes, good morning, everybody. So, there's no dispute from the Road Haulage Association on what's here in terms of the air quality and its ambition. We agree broadly with the spirit of what we're trying to achieve here. No-one's disagreeing. Everyone agrees with the need to improve the environment. We do think, though, a different approach is needed, and we'll probably come on to that later in this session. We have particular concern about the needs of small businesses, and how they are supported through any transition to invest in the environment. Issues about the air quality\u2014we have no issue about the air quality targets per se, although we do think they are going to need to be staged in order to make this achievable. We do have concerns, though, about the use of clean air zones, but we'll probably cover that later on in this session.\" said by Chris Ashley\n\"Indeed. Okay, that's a great overview from the three of you. Thank you for that, and, as you say, Chris, we will be picking up on some of these discrete issues as we proceed. So, Huw, I'll hand over to you.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Thank you, Chair; good morning, everybody. I wonder\u2014. I'm going to turn to the issues of air quality targets in a moment and dwell on them for a little while and get into some of the detail. But, Chair, I didn't mention at the start, because I'm never quite sure to what extent we need to declare it\u2014so, I'm chair of the active travel group and I'm chair also of the air quality cross-party group that's done so much work, both of them. But, actually, there are several members on our committee who are also members of that.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"And all of that is already a matter public record, but there's no harm\u2014\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Indeed. And the reason I just wanted to lay that out is because I've got a question for both Christine and Joshua. You may have seen the evidence sessions last week\u2014. Before I go on to air quality targets, you may have seen the evidence sessions last week where I asked the witnesses whether they had a view on whether they'd want to see strengthening of some of the unfinished business of the active travel duties, for example, a duty to promote on all public bodies incorporated within this, on the basis\u2014I won't rehearse the whole argument, but on the basis\u2014that there is a legal argument to be settled on whether it would fall within the scope of this, the purpose of this Bill and its connected purposes. Do you have a view from Sustrans and Living Streets as to whether you'd want to see that incorporated within this Bill as it goes through? Or do you think it's unnecessary? Let me go to Joshua first, there, if I can.&nbsp;\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Yes, absolutely. From our perspective, it's directly connected. We know that the answer to improving air quality, from the various studies from around Europe and here in the UK and in Wales\u2014they suggest that the best way to improve our air quality is modal shift away from private vehicles. Private vehicles make up the greatest contributor to air pollution, and reducing that through modal shift to active travel is possibly the best solution. So, it is directly connected to the aim of this Bill. As Christine said earlier, we would like to see more focus on active travel. It is the solution to air pollution and to cleaner air. So, yes\u2014in answer to your question, Huw, yes.\" said by Joshua James\n\"Thank you, Josh. And Christine.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Yes, I support that too. I think there needs to be greater awareness of the public health impacts of car use and particular encouragement to give people the confidence to get out of the car, especially for short journeys. We know that the active travel Act could be strengthened in that way, and so if this is an opportunity to do that and to create a more robust legislative framework that allows for promotion, then we certainly support that.&nbsp;\" said by Christine Boston\n\"Okay. Thank you both. Chris, I haven't left you out; I'll come back to you in a moment on air quality targets, and, if you want to add to anything you've just heard, please feel free there. But I wonder if you have, Josh and Christine, anything that your people could share with the committee on that, and particularly on the issue of whether it falls within the scope of this Bill as well, because that's the practical obstacle, the paramount obstacle. Let me turn, then, to air quality. Thank you for those answers. Let me turn to air quality. Again, for Sustrans and Living Streets, other than PM2.5, the Bill doesn't require Welsh Government to set targets for other pollutants or to prescribe the pollutants for which targets should be set. Could I have your views on this and also on the three-year timescale for setting the PM2.5 target? Who'd like to go first? Christine.&nbsp;\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"I can certainly go first. This is a very serious and urgent problem. We know that between 1,000 and 1,500 deaths a day are caused by the effects of air pollution\u2014they're Public Health Wales figures\u2014and those deaths are preventable. So, Ministers should be able\u2014. Well, they should be setting ambitious targets for all pollutants, and the targets ought to be in line with World Health Organization guidelines, and, as a matter of urgency, three years is too long to wait to do that. So, yes. We know that it will be a challenge for authorities to meet those targets, but they need to be set as a matter of urgency, and we need to start developing plans so that people can breathe clean air.&nbsp;\" said by Christine Boston\n\"Thanks, Christine. I'll come to Josh, and then I'll come to you, Chris, as well. Josh.&nbsp; &nbsp;\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Yes, absolutely. Particulate matter is important, but there are other classes of particulate matter that have a huge impact on public health. Diesel particulate matter is one\u2014so, diesel particulate matter, more than 90 per cent of which is less than 1 in diameter, compared to the 2.5, so that's a whole new class\u2014and that is some of the most dangerous in terms of its impact on public health. Since 2010, in the number of private vehicles that have been sold in the UK, diesel powered vehicles outstripped petrol for the first time, and diesel vehicles produce around 22 times more particulate matter and four times more nitrogen oxide than petrol vehicles. So, we are facing, in some senses, a worsening situation, and it will be important for us, in order to have the right solutions to the challenges we face, to know and have targets for each individual particulate matter\u2014so, diesel particulate matter PM10, which, although is not seen as dangerous in the long term as particulate matter 2.5, does contribute to worsening conditions and respiratory conditions. So, having targets for all of these groups, classes, of particulate matter will be important in making sure that we have the right policy solutions as well.&nbsp;\" said by Joshua James\n\"Thanks very much. Chris, I'm going to come to you now and give you the floor on the questions I asked before, if you want to touch on them as well, but particularly on this issue of targets. And I wonder as well, Chris, if you'd touch on some of the evidence that you've given in writing from the Road Haulage Association about the consideration of economic well-being when setting targets. Okay, over to you.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Thank you very much. Look, as I said in my opening remarks, everybody agrees that we need to improve the environment, so it\u2019s not a case of quibbling the 'what'; it\u2019s the 'how we do this'. I notice, my fellow colleagues on the panel, they cite concerns with car usage. I have to say we wouldn\u2019t offer comment on that, because our interest is in commercial vehicles, predominantly heavy goods vehicles, coaches and vans. And I think there are two broad points I\u2019d want to say: yes, everybody refers to the World Health Organization targets. I think it is very important to say, and it\u2019s something I put in my submission, that the WHO have said that getting pollution levels down to meet their very stringent targets will take time; it does need a staged approach, and that, to us, seems eminently sensible. If we\u2019ve got a staged approach with interim targets, be it on PM2.5, other particulate matters or indeed other pollutants, that gives a framework that we can work with then to develop the standards needed, the engine and vehicle standards needed, to invest, and phase in, in time. So, that\u2019s my first broad point: a staged approach is needed.In terms of the economic well-being point, we have a very significant concern\u2014and this predominantly relates to our experience in England, I should stress\u2014that\u2014. So, the needs of small businesses, in particular, who we predominantly represent, are overlooked. This point about economic well-being: there seems to be a lack of understanding as to how businesses acquire new vehicles. They are phased in, basically. Going into sort of accountancy terms, you buy an asset\u2014in this case, a vehicle\u2014it will be depreciated over time. Once it comes to the end of its useful life, it\u2019s then sold on; it will have a residual value. The problem we\u2019ve had, and this relates to proposals for clean air zones, is clean air zones are a very blunt instrument, and it devalues the assets prematurely, and, if you\u2019re a small business, that really matters\u2014and, again, we may come onto this when we look at trunk road charging, but what we\u2019ve found with the clean air zone experience is that not only does it devalue the asset, but it also creates shortages and it creates price inflation. And if you\u2019re a small business on minimal margins\u2014in haulage, it's typically 2 per cent\u2014you\u2019re caught between a rock and a hard place. And we just say this because small businesses provide an essential economic function. They supply essential services, goods, to the people. Somehow, we need to think better and cleverly as to how we support businesses through this process, and, as I say, we do think that a different way is possible, which we can come onto.\" said by Chris Ashley\n\"Thank you, Chris. Chris, I wonder if I can just ask you one question that I'll put to the others as well there, which is whether you have a view, whether the Road Haulage Association has a view, on whether the WHO guidance that you referred to should explicitly be set out on the face of the Bill. Do you have a view on that, Chris? Even if it\u2019s a phased approach to get to it and so on.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Well, my immediate thought is that the Bill shouldn\u2019t be too prescriptive, in order to allow flexibility, to give legislative flexibility to accommodate what is a very complex economy that we have to cater for. So, I think it depends how the Bill will be worded. As I say, we have no issue about reference to the WHO targets. The issue that I think is missing is the caveat that the WHO put in, which is a staged approach with interim targets is necessary and, perhaps if that is reflected in the Bill, we would welcome that.\" said by Chris Ashley\n\"Okay, that\u2019s interesting. Christine and Joshua, the same question about WHO targets. Does it need specific referral on the face of the Bill? Christine?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Yes, I think it does. I think that the Bill should reflect the international standards and be clear that that\u2019s what we have to work towards. If it isn\u2019t explicit, I think there\u2019s a risk that Ministers are more cautious, and we believe that this Bill has to be as ambitious as possible and that the WHO guidelines should be the foundation of the target-setting process and therefore ought to be set out explicitly in the Bill.\" said by Christine Boston\n\"Okay, thank you. Josh, are you in agreement with that?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Yes, I am. I think the WHO standards are widely accepted as what all countries should be aiming for, and not putting that in the actual legislative text of the Bill I think misses a trick. This is an Act to improve our environment and to improve our air quality. To not mention the global standard as part of the target-setting process is one of the main problems we have in terms of the ambition of the Bill. So, in doing so, we think that would solve many problems\u2014it would restate Wales's ambition to provide cleaner air for its people.\" said by Joshua James\n\"So, if Ministers were to argue back to you, 'Well, look, we can refer to the WHO guidelines in our own guidance'\u2014words on record and so on\u2014what would your response be to that?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"That's a good point, but what we would say is that this is a Bill to improve air quality, and it's not just a Bill to make targets to measure air quality\u2014it's a Bill to try and improve our air quality. And so, to do that, we need to be reflecting and have due regard at all times, especially in terms of when we're setting our targets, to what the global community and the most eminent scientists are saying in terms of what those standards should be.\" said by Joshua James\n\"Okay, thank you. Chair, are we doing okay on time? A couple of other questions? How are we doing?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Yes, Chris wants to come in on this and then we can move on to policy. Yes, Chris.\" said by ", "answer": "Llyr Gruffydd AM"}
{"content": "\"Okay, so I would like to welcome then our witness for this morning. This is our inquiry into lobbying. So, welcome, Rachel Davies Teka of Transparency International UK. Would you like to give a short introduction to yourself, Rachel, and to Transparency International UK?&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Vikki Howells AM\n\"Thank you. It's really good to be here. Thank you for having me. So, Transparency International is a global network of around 100 different, we call them 'chapters', based around the world within countries. I work for Transparency International UK. We're one of the UK's leading anti-corruption organisations. We have quite a broad remit. We work on dirty money and money laundering coming into the UK, and we also look at the use of public resources and also political integrity, political corruption and that includes lobbying, which we're here to discuss today.\" said by Rachel Davies Teka\n\"Thank you, Rachel. So, if I can kick off with some questions around the nature of lobbying then, and just a fairly open question to begin with. What do you understand by the term 'lobbying'?\" said by Vikki Howells AM\n\"Yes, of course. So, we would say\u2014. I think we would probably agree with the international standard on lobbying: lobbying occurs when an individual\u2014any individual or a group or an organisation\u2014makes communications directed towards a public official with the intention of influencing public decision making. So, we do not define or constrict our definition to who is lobbying, where the lobbying has taken place or the method of communication, whether that's written, oral or an in-person meeting. It's all about is someone making a communication directly or indirectly to a public official with the specific intention of influencing decision making.&nbsp;I think the one exception we would have to that definition would be a citizen, for example, meeting with a representative on a private matter, as long as those private affairs, for example, do not compromise the wider public interest. So, for example, if they had an individual business interest\u2014for example, maybe they were doing some backdoor lobbying to try and secure a Government contract. So, as long as it didn't include that sort of thing, then we would say citizen representations on their private matters are an exception to that.I do just also want to say to kick off that I don't think that lobbying in and of itself is bad; I think it can be an incredibly good thing. It can be incredibly positive. It's important for democracy when it's conducted ethically and transparently. It can mean that public officials like yourselves have access to experts and their research, but it also gives you the opportunity to listen to those who will be impacted by any decisions that you make. So, when it's done well, I think it can be incredibly positive, but it must be done transparently and ethically.\" said by Rachel Davies Teka\n\"Thank you, Rachel. You've encapsulated so much in that answer already, I think there's only one other thing that I would like to clarify with you on this, and that's just your idea about a lobbyist. Does a lobbyist have to be a paid official, or could they be an unpaid volunteer? Where do you sit with that?\" said by Vikki Howells AM\n\"So, it would include unpaid volunteers for us. I do have to make the distinction and say although we think anyone who is making that representation wanting to influence public decision making is doing lobbying, when it comes to regulation, we wouldn't necessarily say that everyone that is caught within that definition should, for example, have to make filings on a lobbying register. But I would say that those who are doing lobbying outside of their paid employment, it might not be proportionate to ask them to, for example, sign up to a register. But that's why it's so important that you have a suite of measures in place. So, you might have a lobbying register, but you also have, as the Welsh Government does, ministerial meetings data that are released on a quarterly basis, because those other things might capture that kind of lobbying. It's very important that we don't forget about unpaid lobbying. We want to know who is influencing public decision making, but, yes, you need to be proportionate about what burdens you put on different people.\" said by Rachel Davies Teka\n\"Thank you, Rachel. I'll bring in John Griffiths now. John.&nbsp;\" said by Vikki Howells AM\n\"Diolch yn fawr, Cadeirydd, and bore da, Rachel. Rachel, in terms of what you've already said about lobbying possibly being of value and positive when done well, could you add a little detail to that in terms of what you think is that value that can be brought to a democracy?\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Yes, absolutely. It is a way for policy makers to gather the opinions and evidence of those experts. There's a lot of research and analysis out there on a range of different issues that\u2014. At the end of the day, we want public decision making to be informed and strengthened, and we want that expertise to be brought into those conversations. This only contributes to better decisions, both in the Senedd and in Government.I think, actually, if there are public officials\u2014and I expect many of you would fall under this definition\u2014that really want to make sure that all interested groups are being involved in those discussions and that everyone is being listened to, having transparent data on who, for example, Government Ministers are meeting with and who their advisers are meeting with, can really help you assess, 'Is that happening? Are there any groups that are being left out? And, if so, let's study the data. Oh yes, look, we're not listening to that group, let's address that, let's make sure we bring them in.' And that data, for example, coming through a register or through ministerial meetings data, if that is happening in a timely fashion\u2014so, it's not happening a year after the fact that the decision has already been made, but it's happening in a timely fashion\u2014that can really help.So, to give an example: I've got colleagues in Transparency International EU, and they've told me that, during the 2008 financial crash and the crisis that followed, I think there were Members of the European Parliament that actually studied the meetings data, and realised that, whereas there'd been lots of meetings with representatives of financial institutions, there hadn't been many, if any, meetings on financial regulation with those who were representing the public interest. And some might argue that that might have contributed to the situation, where the regulations weren't really quite sufficient, and they weren't working in the public interest, and, as a result of that, I think they actually pushed for more representation from non-governmental organisations and from civil society. And in fact, there was a whole organisation, called Finance Watch, that ended up being created out of that analysis, and the public interest is now much more represented at the EU level, which is really good.On the flip side, we did some analysis a couple of years ago, looking at housing policy that's made at Westminster, and we realised, through looking at meetings data, but also conducting interviews, that whereas lots of developers had been consulted on housing\u2014and, actually, the Westminster Government had met with lots of civil society groups\u2014groups representing renters had been entirely left out of the conversation, and just hadn't been represented in any of those discussions. And it's interesting and tragic. There is a rental crisis at the moment, particularly in England. In fact, I think there was something on the BBC News website over the weekend about people in Devon wanting to rent in the towns where they'd grown up, and where their communities and their jobs are, and they just can't afford to. So, it's unsurprising when you look at the data that renters just haven't been represented. But that data is there, and it could be used for good, if people really want to analyse, 'What spots are we missing, who else can we draw in?'\" said by Rachel Davies Teka\n\"Okay. Thanks for that, Rachel. Rachel, would you draw an ethical distinction between providing information and advocacy?\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"I probably wouldn't say one is ethical and one isn't. I think it's absolutely fine to go to representatives, wanting to influence decision making. I think that's good. I would say\u2014just going back to that definition of lobbying\u2014I think anyone who is presenting information with a desire to influence a process is lobbying, and I think that can be really ethical. I'd imagine everyone you're meeting with, everyone you receive submissions from, during the course of this inquiry, they're probably not just meeting with you. I am partly meeting with you because I'm Welsh, and I really care about this process, but I'm also here today because I'm hoping that some of the research and analysis I share, you might consider it, it might have some impact, it might influence your decisions. So, I would say that what I'm doing right now, for example, is lobbying, and I think that can be done ethically and transparently.\" said by Rachel Davies Teka\n\"Okay. Rachel, a final question from me: could you offer the committee a view on what are the essential requirements to enable lobbying to be beneficial, and what would impede that?\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Absolutely. So, I think it's about having all the different pieces of the puzzle in place. So, if you're looking at a register of lobbyists, making sure it includes in-house as well as consultant lobbyists. I think, when you look at registers around the world, the vast majority of people and organisations that are registered are in-house. So, you want to make sure that it captures the full scale of lobbying. I think you want to make sure that it doesn't impede participation\u2014so, we need transparency, but there needs to be that balance, so that it's proportional, it doesn't put any disproportionate burdens on people to participate. And you just need to make sure the information is there, so that lobbying cannot happen via a backdoor. You want to make sure that it's not just those with the most resources who get the most access and get the most influence\u2014that everybody gets a say and that everybody is included. And I can go into more technical detail on what that looks like later on, if that's of interest.\" said by Rachel Davies Teka\n\"Okay, Rachel. Diolch yn fawr.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Diolch.\" said by Rachel Davies Teka\n\"Okay. Thank you, John. I'll bring in Peredur Owen Griffiths now then. Pered.\" said by Vikki Howells AM\n\"Diolch, Vikki, a bore da, Rachel. Before I move on to the flip side of the coin, the disadvantages or disvalue of lobbying, those things that you were mentioning to John, is there somewhere in the world that you operate in, or have colleagues in, who do that well?\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"Yes, absolutely. I would really recommend the Canadian system. So, we have a chapter\u2014Transparency International Canada. So, we've looked a little bit and, in preparation for this this morning, I was a bit of a nerd; I was on their registry this morning, having a little look around at what they do. I mean, in terms of a register, I really love what they do there, and I can share links after this, if you want to have a look yourself. Because they collect a lot of information on who is making representations, without placing too much of a burden on people to be reporting the meetings and the calls that they're having. So, for example, they have a kind of central page for each organisation, and I think they have to update it either every six months or every year, I can't remember which. They have to put everything on there, such as the individuals from the organisation who might come and have meetings, and they have to put a list of all the issues they work on, a list of the particular pieces of legislation they're working on at that point and may try to influence, and then, under each issue, a couple of bullet points on what their objectives are and just say, 'housing' or 'infrastructure', actually why they're lobbying, what they're trying to do. There is so much information on those central pages, so that when they have to report meetings\u2014I think within 28 days of those meetings occurring\u2014there's very little information they need to submit. So, it's really quick, really easy. It's the date, it's the name of the person, it's the department, and I think it's just the name of the issue\u2014they can say, 'housing'\u2014and they submit that; it's really quick, really easy. And then if you as, say, a policy maker, is wanting to assess who is having an impact, or if you're from civil society or a journalist, you just go to those lists of meetings and see, 'Oh, they've mentioned that issue; I wonder what they were talking about.' But then you can just go to that central page, and all the information's there without the lobbyists having to enter all that information every time they do that. So, I think that's a really good, really important system. It includes in-house lobbyists as well, and it also includes face-to-face, written and oral meetings, which is good, and it kind of avoids some of the problems we've seen in Westminster\u2014I don't think the Westminster system is working brilliantly\u2014but also some of the problems we've seen in Scotland too.I think the Irish system is also good; it's a good one to look at. They do require the purpose of the meetings\u2014the detailed purpose, I think\u2014to be submitted with each kind of meeting filing rather than it being collected in a central place. So, it maybe places a little bit more of a burden on people submitting information, but that's pretty good.I'd also say, actually, I think there are improvements that can be made to the Welsh ministerial meetings data, but it's already fairly good, I'd say, compared to other jurisdictions\u2014Westminster, for example. For example, Wales publishes all the different departments in one comma-separated values file, which allows you to track in one document and do a bit of analysis, which is great. I can talk a little bit about areas for improvement, although we did mention that in our submission, so you might not want to go over that again.\" said by Rachel Davies Teka\n\"Thank you. That's great. And I certainly would be interested in seeing some of that stuff from Canada as well. We've looked a little bit at Ireland already, but thanks for that.But, going on to my substantive questions on the disvalue of lobbying, as opposed to what you were talking to John Griffiths about. Does lobbying pose any problems for, or obstruct, the proper conduct of representative democratic politics, and are there any concerns that lobbying may appear to subvert the democratic process?\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"Yes, absolutely, and I think this is why it's so important that we get it right, that it is a positive thing. So, when it happens behind closed doors, it can provide cover for privileged access and undue influence that can, at worst, even corrupt our politics; at a minimum, it can certainly impact public confidence and the integrity of those in public office. Even if the things that may be happening behind closed doors, there's nothing inherently dodgy that's happening there, from a public point of view, that can really impact how much you trust public officials and institutions. I think, at worst, that can lead to policy outcomes that only benefit the interest groups with the most resources. And where it also involves things like procurement contracts, it can risks hundreds, if not millions, of pounds of public money.To demonstrate that, you may have seen in the news\u2014I'm losing track of time, through the pandemic and after the pandemic\u2014I think it was either last year or the year before, the Westferry Printworks development scandal in Westminster: the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government at the time intervened on behalf of a party donor, after being lobbied at a private fundraising event. I think this party donor sat next to him at the event and actually then pressured officials to basically write letters saying that the housing Secretary is insisting that this development is approved before this deadline, and it was approved before a particular deadline when community levies would have come into force. So, it was basically helping the developer avoid paying millions of pounds in levy fees, but then that cost\u2014it was about \u00a340 million that was then going to go on the people of Tower Hamlets, basically, coming out of the public purse to pay for these levies for essential infrastructure. It was then later reviewed because this all came out, and then that decision was squashed and reversed, thankfully, so that didn't come from the public purse. But that could have obviously had financial ramifications, but it certainly had, I would imagine, an impact on public trust, which once you lose, once it starts to decline, is incredibly difficult to claw back.\" said by Rachel Davies Teka\n\"You've talked in your previous answers and in that answer as well, and you've indicated that lobbying can undermine transparency and can create inequality of access. I'm just wondering what your thoughts were on what the\u2014. Talking about the Canadian system, the Irish system, and other systems, how do they try and make it more transparent, and how do you stop people with very deep pockets from getting that access, and that inequality of access? I'm a bit of a data geek; I quite like data. That data that's collected, when you're analysing who we've talked to and who we haven't, is that realistic in real time? In the course of a consultation, could you actually do that data analysis within that time to be able to find the gaps in the data, if you like?\" said by ", "answer": "Peredur Owen Griffiths MS"}
{"content": "\"So, this morning's session, if we move to item 2, is in regard to our Health Service Procurement (Wales) Bill, and an evidence session with health boards. So, the health service procurement Bill has been referred to committee for Stage 1 scrutiny of its general principles. So, I'm very pleased to welcome two witnesses this morning, two of our guests. I'd be grateful if you could, perhaps, just introduce yourselves for the public record. Who shall I start with? Huw, there we go.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Hello there. Bore da. Huw Thomas, director of finance for Hywel Dda University Health Board.&nbsp;\" said by Huw Thomas\n\"Bore da. My name is Jonathan Irvine. I'm director of procurement services for NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership.\" said by Jonathan Irvine\n\"Well, thank you so much for being with us today to hopefully help inform our understanding, but to gain some of your views on the proposed Bill as well. So, I have a very general question, it's not specific at all. What is your understanding of the purpose of the Bill and the new procurement regulations?\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Maybe I'll start on that. The purpose of the Bill is really to seek to align ourselves in terms of the accessibility for healthcare services procurement in a way that doesn't disadvantage Wales in comparison to England. The key issue around that is if the access to healthcare services in England is less burdensome for providers than it would be in Wales, then that has the potential risk of disadvantaging the population of Wales, making it less attractive and more difficult for providers to provide services into Wales. And in terms of capacity within the market, we could find that the capacity is actually consumed by England, simply because it's much more accessible and easier for providers to do business in England. So, the importance of the Bill from a procurement perspective\u2014and I'll let Huw, obviously, talk from the health board perspective\u2014but from the procurement perspective, is that we don't disadvantage our population, and we ensure that we obtain and secure the flexibility that such arrangements would bring.\" said by Jonathan Irvine\n\"Thank you. Huw Thomas.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Thank you. Yes, there is something important here about the alignment between the arrangements we have in Wales and what is being done in England. So, this is an environment where I think we're seeing an increasing consolidation of private providers in England, and the level of competition is becoming increasingly challenged. And the other, I guess, strategic overlay from an English perspective is that the development of integrated care boards in England means that, I think, there is a risk that communities in England or the areas covered by CBs will become more inward looking, consolidate the provision to make sure that the capacity within the system is consumed within the integrated care board. So, if we place an additional regulatory burden, or there's a perceived difference in regulatory burden between doing business in Wales and doing business in England, there is very much a risk that we won't be able to secure supply of provision into Wales. It's very much becoming a sellers' market now; much more difficult to procure services. So, aligning that regulatory position, I think, is important.\" said by Huw Thomas\n\"Thank you. So, Members are going to dig into a bit more detail now. So, on the screen, Jack Sargeant.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"I'm grateful, Chair. Good morning, all. In this Bill, there's been a real sense that these changes are being driven by England rather than necessarily specifically addressing the problems within Wales and the Welsh NHS. I think the Minister herself has said in Senedd committees earlier this week that she believes we're going to have to wait for the detail of what's happening in England to come to fruition in Wales before any detail can be made available to us as a committee and through the Welsh Government. The evidence we've seen as well, and the Minister said this herself, again, it's important to have this Bill because we need to be on a level playing field with England. Now, Jonathan, I think it was in your opening that you referred to doing this so that the market doesn't directly go to England. I just want to try and understand how real is that risk and how important is having that level playing field with England, because this might not be the right option; Wales may wish to do something differently, or is that not the case?\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"So, it is very much a real risk. So, actually picking up on what Huw has said, which is to emphasise the fact that the market is becoming more consolidated, therefore we have fewer providers in the market, and that means that the capacity for those providers to provide services into Wales is challenged as it is. So, that is a risk. We also potentially have a risk in terms of current providers who maybe feel, then, they might want to give notice on services that they're currently providing into Wales to move into England.The other thing I think I would point out is that in parallel with this is the UK Procurement Bill, which is actually currently going through, as you're probably aware, in the Commons, and is expected to be introduced into legislation some time in the middle of the next calendar year. That legislation in itself brings up this issue, because the current provision of healthcare services, as far as procurement goes, under the current procurement regime, requires us to implement a degree of competition. The new Procurement Bill itself, if we don't introduce this Bill, or the aspirations of this Bill, would mean that we in Wales would have to continue to procure those healthcare services in that current format, which, as we said earlier, is restrictive.So, I suppose to get back to answering your question, I think it is a real risk, and I think that I would also add, finally, to this, that it presents opportunities to us. So, it's not about just trying to match what England's doing, to avoid and to mitigate it; it actually gives us an opportunity to develop a deeper, more collaborative arrangement with those providers who provide us with a good value-for-money service that provides good outcomes for patients, so that we won't necessarily\u2014although we will have to justify it, more than likely\u2014we won't have to necessarily go out to the markets for a full competition on periodic timescales, which in itself runs the risk of having to disrupt services for patients, and also the associated costs, and, as I said, the less attractive nature that that brings to our operation. So, I'm not sure if that provides some answers to your question.\" said by Jonathan Irvine\n\"It does. Thanks for that. I just want to prod a little bit into your ending to the contribution. You said this provides opportunity. Would you therefore see\u2014? I appreciate this may be difficult to answer. If there's opportunity, there's obviously risk associated with that, and there might be potential implications about diverging from the English rules. But are you expecting Wales to have a slightly different approach to what the English rules may be?\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Can I also add to that? You also talked, Jonathan, about deeper working with\u2014the Bill offers an opportunity to work more deeply with partners as well, I think you said. I just wonder, perhaps following your answer to Jack's point, if you can perhaps give us an example of how that might pan out, just so I can have help to understand that.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Yes. Maybe Huw might want to pick that one up. Sorry. Could you come back to that question again, sorry?\" said by Jonathan Irvine\n\"Jack, sorry. What was your main question? Sorry, it was my fault. There we are.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"That's fine. We've talked about the potential implications and risk, you've also talked about the opportunity\u2014and again, I appreciate this may be difficult to answer\u2014but would you see room for the Welsh rules to be different and to diverge from the English rules, if necessary?\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Yes, there's that potential. I mean, this, if it goes through, would be subject, obviously, to consultation, and my organisation, I expect, would be part of the work involved in helping to put the regulations into place. So, areas where it might not necessarily be different, but we could almost enhance what we're trying to do in wider programme for government initiatives, such as the lower carbon footprint associated with services provided within Wales and increasing the amount of spend that NHS Wales puts in place with local service providers. We can actually secure that, as long as those services continue to represent value for money and good outcomes for patients. But what that means is that we can actually almost lock down those services, in a way. So, I think that there's potentially opportunity for Wales maybe to be more almost forceful on that than possibly England might be, but, again, that's speculation on my part, but they're just some examples of what could be done.\" said by Jonathan Irvine\n\"I fully understand the speculation\u2014I think we're all in speculation, the committee's speculating what may happen; it's difficult to scrutinise when we don't know the full detail. I perhaps have a question to both Huw and Jonathan, before you answer the Chair's: if the UK Government weren't doing this for NHS England, would you like to see the Welsh Government go ahead with something similar anyway?\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"I may jump in there, Chair. I think there's something about an opportunity coming out of a challenging situation, because we are here, fundamentally, because of a situation that has been, or we're responding to developments in NHS England and in the procurement landscape there. And I would urge against diverging in terms of the regulations that we put in place in Wales from what England will develop, because any perceived complexity or difference in doing business in Wales could make it a lot more challenging for us to be able to secure cross-border activity.But the way in which we work\u2014and I think there's almost something about the way in which we as public sector bodies work\u2014is different in Wales, and that will feed through to the way in which we interpret and utilise, I guess, the enabling framework that we're talking about here. Because we do have a history of partnership working, we do have a history now of outcomes-based measurement, value-based healthcare arrangements. This does give us an opportunity to explore those further, it gives us an opportunity to think about long-term partnership arrangements we would want to put in place, and it gives us an opportunity to really think about our local communities in this.And while we, naturally, are thinking here, primarily I guess, about private sector providers providing activity and support into the NHS, I wouldn't want to forget about the opportunity we've then got with smaller third sector organisations, social enterprises, of which there is an abundance in Wales, and for which procurement has historically been a challenge for them in accessing activity within the NHS, because it has been seen as a transactional relationship, and this provides us an opportunity to change that relationship into one of long-term partnership.Now, what comes from that will be opportunities for better innovation, putting the patient at the heart of decision making, putting our communities at the heart of decision making, and, I would hope, an opportunity for us to really think about stimulating local opportunities and local businesses to enter the market, by reducing the barriers to entry. So, it's less so for me about divergence in the regulations per se from what will be coming through from Westminster, and more so about how we behave and how we respond to that in our public sector bodies.\" said by Huw Thomas\n\"Thank you, Huw. I know that the Chair may want to come back on his bit shortly, but probably just one final question from me on the procurement regulations, the new ones, for NHS England. Are you aware of the new procurement regulations\u2014the provider selection regime\u2014which the NHS in England has been consulting on? Do you know the detail of it?\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Yes. It's a publicly available document from the gov.uk&nbsp;website. And it provides an outline of their approach to this, which is obviously out to consultation there at present, so, yes.\" said by Jonathan Irvine\n\"On the basis of that, and, obviously, you are aware of the document, from that document, would you say now there are any Wales-specific issues that need to be addressed in the Welsh one?\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"I would say the challenge for us will be how we make sure we are open and transparent as public sector bodies in our decision making, because one of the benefits of open tendering and procurement exercises is that that is discharged quite readily and quite easily. This does not make it a little bit more challenging to really understand the offering from people who want to do business with the NHS. So, I think it will be incumbent on us to put in arrangements where we can properly understand how we are getting best value from any arrangements that we do put in place, and how we properly understand the opportunity for collaborating with anyone who does want to do business with us. So, that will be something we have to put some thought into, and governance and reporting arrangements will be quite crucial here so that we don't end up with any perception from the public, or from our stakeholders, that due process is not being followed. So, we do need to make sure we put that process in place.&nbsp;\" said by Huw Thomas\n\"Okay. Thank you for that. Thank you, Chair. I fear I'm maybe stepping into areas other colleagues might want to go into.&nbsp;\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"No, that's fine, and, for me, it was just to look for an example when you talked about procurement and collaboration with providers, just to give an example so that I can follow that through in my own mind, to understand.&nbsp;\" said by Russell George AM\n\"So, if I pick up some challenges, then, that we have within our health board, we know that we have some real challenges in areas like dentistry, actually, and there is an opportunity here for us to work much more collaboratively with potential providers who might want to come in and provide services for us, which are inherently going to be long-term partnership arrangements. Currently, we go through procurement exercises, but that can\u2014. You can end up in a procurement exercise with a process where you reduce the cost, but sometimes not maximise the value that we provide our communities. So, I think this will provide us with an opportunity to balance that cost-versus-value opportunity where we're really focusing on outcomes. That's just one small example.&nbsp;\" said by Huw Thomas\n\"So, in the system that we're currently in, then, what's the negative consequence, effectively? Are you not getting good value for money, or are you not getting as good value for money?&nbsp;\" said by Russell George AM\n\"I think there is a risk that arrangements under the current\u2014. Under current procurement guidelines, it's difficult to enter into very long-term arrangements without quite a high bar to access that from a regulatory perspective. For businesses who want to do business with the NHS, the bar to entry can be higher than you might want it to be because there is quite a regulatory burden from the procurement processes that we have currently.&nbsp;\" said by Huw Thomas\n\"So, regardless of the discussion about the need for the Bill because of what's happening in England, is it that you're saying this is a good thing, or we're making the best out of something in any case? Which is it that's true?&nbsp;\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Based on my reading of the English guidance that's come out, I have no particular antibodies to that. I think it does present us with a really good opportunity.&nbsp;\" said by Huw Thomas\n\"Okay.&nbsp;\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Yes, and from a procurement perspective\u2014obviously I will say this\u2014I do agree that we do provide a value-for-money outcome for health boards, but I think the point is that because, inevitably, organisations have to go through the full competitive process, which may still be a feature and option under any future legislation, what that means is that we can't just say, 'This organisation is providing a fantastic service. Let's do some due diligence on them to ensure that those outcomes are sustainable into the future, and then let's be transparent to say we're going to continue those arrangements into the future'. That's the flexibility that we don't have at this point in time.&nbsp;\" said by Jonathan Irvine\n\"And how does the Bill include procurement within the NHS?&nbsp;\" said by Russell George AM\n\"How does it, sorry\u2014?\" said by Jonathan Irvine\n\"Include procurement with the NHS. I'm particularly thinking of cross border as well. In my constituency, a lot of the services are over the border, so especially with services perhaps in England, and England procuring services from Wales\u2014both ways.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"So, there would be no change to the current position, which is that the vast majority of NHS-to-NHS services are excluded from the normal procurement regulations under regulation 12 of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 that we currently operate. So, those intra-NHS services, we'd continue to be able to operate unaffected and unimpeded.\" said by Jonathan Irvine\n\"So, the Bill has no effect on services within the NHS.&nbsp;\" said by Russell George AM\n\"No.\" said by Jonathan Irvine\n\"Okay. Right, thank you. Do you want to come in, Joyce, and then come on to your questions as well?\" said by ", "answer": "Russell George AM"}

There's a common theme across much of our work when it comes to data, or the lack of data\u2014it's a common theme across nearly every one of our inquiries, I think\u2014but a massive issue is what the chair of the Wales Cancer Alliance said with regard to data gathering, and called on the Welsh Government'to get to grips with our data'.So, perhaps it would be useful, in this opening session, if you could both set out your roles and responsibilities in terms of enabling the collection of data, and the analysis of cancer data, I suppose, in particular in Wales. Dyfed, I'll come to you first.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"I'll go first. I'd like to know the details of the comments from the alliance at another time. It's important that we do understand what their complaints and concerns are, so that is something that I'll look into again.So, my role, and my team's role, primarily, is to collect information about every case of cancer in the Welsh population. We create a new database for that purpose, and its purpose, then, is so that our analysts, every year, create statutory and official figures regarding the incidence of all cancers, survival rates and the death rates from those cancers. There is no other source looking at the whole population, and there is no other source using a range of raw sources of data from here and there, in order to ensure information and that we find each case. So, essentially, that's our main role.We have other roles, such as research, and allowing other researchers to have access to our data in a safe way, of course, so that people's names, for example, aren't revealed, and we also undertake research as required, and we've done quite a lot of that during the pandemic, for example. We do use the data to evaluate, for example, the screening programmes, and we also feed our information back to the cancer network and the health boards, for example, so that they can use our information, as well as their own information regarding their services, to improve the situation for patients.Also, I should add that quite a lot of that research and our data are joined up safely with international research programmes, and those then enable us to see where we stand in terms of the death rates and survival rates in comparison with other countries in the western world that have primary care systems, GP systems that are similar to ours. For example, we would compare with Canada but not the USA, because you can't compare those health systems. So, yes, that's where we are, essentially.\" said by Professor Dyfed Huws\n\"Thank you, Dyfed, that's really helpful. In terms of my opening comments, I think our evidence has been published in terms of the Wales Cancer Alliance, but we'll ask the team to get that from our public website, and send you a link to that, so you can see\u2014\" said by Russell George AM\n\"And I'd be happy to work with them, to understand that and work on that, if they're so willing.\" said by Professor Dyfed Huws\n\"That's helpful. I suppose it would be good to know who sets the priorities for what data you do publish and what data you analyse. Who sets that?\" said by Russell George AM\n\"So, actually, it's one of the statutory functions.\" said by Professor Dyfed Huws\n\"It's one of the statutory roles of Public Health Wales, and therefore, we do collect that information, according to international standards. The reason for that is that we can then compare our information fairly with other nations that have cancer registries. So, we publish every year information on a number of different cancers, including gynaecological cancers. So, we do break it down according to womb cancer, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, and also we have information, if required, regarding rarer cancers, such as cancers of the vagina or of the vulva, for example. Also, perhaps for specific research or some of our international research, we can also break that down further to the specific types, for example, of ovarian cancer, depending on the types of cells, where exactly the cancer has stemmed from in the ovary. So, we have quite a lot of information; we know what standard is the diagnosis of the cancer, what treatment patients have received, and so on.So, that's why I'm interested to understand the points that the alliance have raised, because we have\u2014. Our main problem as a registry, and I'm not sure whether this is a basis to one of the concerns, is that, because of all the work involved in collecting information and the details of data, and ensuring that it is of quality and that it is correct, it takes quite a lot of time. I have staff that have been trained specifically in this, and the information from one source of raw information from the health service doesn't necessarily have every detail that we require, and we have to check it against another source. There are international definitions then. For example, you've probably heard of Cancer Network Information System Cymru, and that there's a record there regarding the date of diagnosis. Now, that could mean the day that the doctor told the patient, or it could mean where they were confident according to different tests conducted. But in order for us to compare with other countries, there is a specific definition of the date of diagnosis that we take on the basis of all the different raw sources of data. So, what that means is that, for example, last week, we published statistics regarding five specific cancers, including ovarian cancer, as it happens, for 2020. And of course, 2022 has finished. We do calendar years every time; that's the standard for epidemiology, calendar years. We have fallen behind in terms of that lag. We were one of the fastest registries in Britain before the pandemic, but for various reasons, the team has shrunk and it's not as large as it was, and there are implications to that. There's quite a lot of data work to get through, training new people, and it has slowed us down.\" said by Professor Dyfed Huws\n\"So, just to help me understand, if you have collected data and you've carried out analysis of that data, it sounds like you don't always publish it\u2014is that right?\" said by Russell George AM\n\"We publish most of the data that we have at a high level, and, as I said, if there are specific requirements, we can delve deeper into the details. Other researchers and organisations within the NHS have a right to have access to that data, in terms of data security, so that individuals aren't identified. We go down to very, very rare cancers\u2014a few cases each year, perhaps none at all sometimes\u2014and statistically it's difficult to make sense of that every time. Perhaps we'd have to take 10 years of data for a very rare cancer to make any sense of the rate, for example. So, yes, we have data for every case, and we can provide details on those cases because staff have been trained in the classification of different types of cancer.&nbsp;Also, in talking about different types of cancer, if I may, there are new data developments all the time. Perhaps I've been guilty in the past of wanting more and more of that without giving enough attention to the fact that that means more and more work for the team. There's a knock-on effect to that, that we slow down in trying to get more. It's a dilemma, isn't it? And the main sources recently\u2014. And I should say that we do work extensively with Helen's team, because a lot of that raw and varying data comes from the floor of the NHS in hospitals, and it is collected at a national level by Helen's teams, and we rely on that then to come in to us for us to be able to work on it. That is available quite soon; the delay is with us.&nbsp;For example, the chemotherapy data, SACT, and other treatments such as immunotherapy that are part of SACT, and also we've had quality radiotherapy data for quite a few years now. And the next step is that we're working with NHS England, where their cancer register was paused during the pandemic, but soon we're going to receive genetic information on the cases of cancer where that has been collected and looked at in the diagnosis. That includes genetic changes or hormonal receptors that are on the walls of the cancer cells. And in the future, I think we won't be classifying cancers as breast cancer, ovarian cancer or bowel cancer; we'll be classifying cancers as the types of changes in the genes that happen to be in the colon or the breast or the ovary, for example. But, at the moment, we're going according to the anatomy.\" said by Professor Dyfed Huws\n\"Thank you, Dyfed. Sarah Murphy.&nbsp;\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Thank you very much, Chair, and thank you both for being here today. I'm going to drill down a little bit more into the access to cancer data. So, my first question is: how do you work with the Wales Cancer Research Centre to ensure academics and clinicians have access to cancer data, and the tools that they need to analyse that data as well? Because we did hear from Sadie Jones, who was representing the Wales Cancer Research Centre, that she has'all of that data available in my hands,'&nbsp;but she doesn\u2019t have the resource and skills to analyse it. So, why isn\u2019t there more joined-up working around this? Who would like to go first? Helen.\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Helen, do you want to come in? There we are.&nbsp;\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Yes, I can come in on that. So, I haven't got specifics I'm afraid, Sarah, on that, but definitely the data would be available and our teams would be happy to help, to be honest. I've been given, as you can imagine, some prep from my team and I can see Sadie's name actually on a list of work that the information team here have been doing on that. So, the data that is available and that can help them in that way, we would be more than happy to help Sadie in terms of limited resourcing in that area.&nbsp;\" said by Helen Thomas\n\"Thank you very much.&nbsp;\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Dyfed.&nbsp;\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Yes, thank you very much. That's a very fair question. I believe it's important that data is available to researchers and also to clinicians in terms of the work to improve cancer outputs. That's possible to an extent. If researchers need to look at our data and it's part of an approved research project, it's possible to request our data, and we need to see the permissions that they have to do that. Again, we have quite a small team, and it takes too much time, and I\u2019m not happy about that, but I have to work within my funding, unfortunately. So we are taking out the information that they want about whatever cancer, such as the genetics we were mentioning earlier. That\u2019s possible if they do have permission.Also, every year we give them the new register into the SAIL databank in Swansea University, and that is where I am an honorary chair. I hear complaints about that from some researchers, and I believe that a lot of that is due to a misunderstanding about the way that it works. That\u2019s a huge pool that can connect the cancer information safely and anonymously with all other NHS data that it includes, and also data about the environment, et cetera. So it may be a matter of awareness in terms of what\u2019s available and what\u2019s possible with that.I\u2019m working on a Wales Cancer Research Centre strategy group\u2014the new strategy. So, with a dotted line, I think I have a connection with the cancer centre, I work with the leader there, Mererid. I\u2019m partially responsible for the sixth theme there on the population-level data that\u2019s then going to work across all other themes, not only public health and cancer avoidance.\" said by Professor Dyfed Huws\n\"Thank you very much. That brings me on nicely to my next question, which is for Digital Health and Care Wales, so, Helen. Cancer survival estimates are the estimation of the proportion of patients surviving their cancer after one, five or 10 years, how comparable and reliable is the data between population groups over time and across all of the UK nations?\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"A big question. Thank you. I actually haven't got all of that information in front of me, but in terms of the sources of the data, survival rate data will use the incidence data to identify the cancer data, and then the detail of it to detail it by cancer tumour site and of course by provider, by residency, and all of those things that we would subdivide the data by. And then the mortality data is sourced from the Office for National Statistics, so I would expect the data itself, actually, the quality of the data, to be comparable. If you're asking about actually the performance and the outcomes, I'm not sure that that's something I can comment on as it stands. I haven't got the data in front of me.\" said by Helen Thomas\n\"Okay, thank you. That might be something that we can follow up in writing afterwards. Are you able to talk about the geographic pattern of cancer survival across Wales, then? Are there differences in cancer survival by health board?\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"I think that's probably a question more for Dyfed than for me, I think.&nbsp;\" said by Helen Thomas\n\"Dyfed, I'll bring you in if you want to comment on either of those questions.&nbsp;\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Yes, that's fair enough, Helen. I'm very happy to take that. So, your question mentions the statutory responsibilities and that's exactly what our role is\u2014what you were asking Helen. Although the incidence of cancer and the death rate is relatively similar between UK countries due to the national registries that I mentioned, the annual information about survival rates isn't exactly possible to compare yet. What's happened is that the method that statisticians use in Scotland, Northern Ireland, England and us has spread slightly, so you can't really compare them, although the underlying data is comparable. So, the United Kingdom and Ireland Association of Cancer Registries\u2014I'm also a chair of that\u2014has tasked researchers and analysts to make that more streamlined so that they can be compared. Having said that, around three international programmes that we're a part of take the data from several countries, as I mentioned earlier, and analyse it in a similar way.&nbsp;Ovarian cancer is part of a group of cancers in the ICBP, the international cancer benchmarking partnership, for example. That's the one that's at the forefront at the moment. The latest information from the last decade on that was that, unfortunately, in terms of survival rates, the UK countries were almost last in terms of ovarian cancer survival rates. Within that, Northern Ireland and Wales were the lowest also, and that was after a lot of improvement from when we started to gather this data\u2014from the beginning of the decade to around the middle of the decade\u2014so, there's a way to go. So, the other gynaecological cancers\u2014the main ones, such as cancer of the uterus and cervical cancer\u2014weren't part of this particular research data.But, what I can say is that over some years now, our statistics have shown that, although survival rates for cancer of the uterus have improved, since then, they have flatlined\u2014there has been no improvement in survival rates since then. To be honest, the survival rates for cancer of the uterus have, unfortunately, been worsening in the past decade, until very recently. Part of the international research has also looked at the reasons for that.\" said by Professor Dyfed Huws\n\"Thank you, Dyfed.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Thank you very much for that, again. That brings me on to my final question: why isn't the data you collate and publish on gynaecological cancers disaggregated by each type\u2014so, cervical, ovarian, endometrial, vulval and vaginal cancers? Can this be done? If so, will you commit to doing it, given how important the information is for service and capacity planning?\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Who's answering? Is that to Helen?\" said by Russell George AM\n\"That is to Helen, yes.\" said by Sarah Murphy MS\n\"Okay, and Dyfed may want to come in on this. The Wales Cancer Network, as I understand it, are actually introducing a sub-site, and we're working with them to issue the data standard for that so that it can break down to the cancers that you said\u2014so, all of those. That will be happening this year; I don't have the date for it, but all of the plans are in place. What we would do then is make sure that all of our systems are updated, reflecting the data standard, so that that can be collected routinely as part of the cancer pathway information.\" said by ", "answer": "Helen Thomas"}
{"content": "\"In that case, I move to item 2. Our predecessor committee, in the fifth Senedd\u2014the Health, Social Care and Sport Committee\u2014held an inquiry into endoscopy services, back in April 2019, which seems a long time ago now, doesn't it? It found that increasing demand for endoscopy and a lack of capacity in hospitals was driving long waiting times for endoscopy appointments, and called for the Welsh Government to develop and implement a national endoscopy plan at pace. So, as a committee, we're always very keen to look back at our predecessor committee and follow up where appropriate. So, this committee is now holding a short inquiry into endoscopy services to consider what further actions are to be implemented, and looking at the national endoscopy action plan. So, I'm very delighted we've got witnesses with us this morning, as our very first panel for this short inquiry. I wonder if the witnesses could perhaps just introduce themselves for the public record\u2014if I come to you first, Katie.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Thank you. I'm Katie Till. I'm public affairs manager for Wales at Cancer Research UK.\" said by Katie Till\n\"I'm Gerard McMahon. I'm the head of policy and influencing in the devolved nations for Bowel Cancer UK.\" said by Gerard McMahon\n\"Lovely. And I think that it's your first time to join us in committee, so a warm welcome as well, and thank you for being with us this morning. Perhaps it would be helpful at the start, just from your perspective, to just give us a summary of the position regarding waiting times for endoscopy.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"I'm happy to go first there. As you were saying, looking back at what the previous inquiry was looking at\u2014the endoscopy action plan\u2014I think, for us, we welcomed that in 2019, as a way of providing a direction of travel to meet some of the demands of that time. What we're seeing now is that the waiting times are still considerably below where they should be. If you look at, say, the last three months that data is available for, I think that it ranges from 33 per cent to 41 per cent who are beginning their treatment within 62 days\u2014from the point of referral to treatment. So, there's still a considerable gap between where the service should be and where it currently is. And part of that has been driven by a massive increase in demand. Some of the data that's starting to be published within the time that the endoscopy action plan came into force and where we are just now was the introduction of data around overall referrals each month. And you can see, from roughly this time last year\u2014the December, January, February time\u2014there was a referral level of between about 2,300 and 2,600 into the lower gastrointestinal pathway. I think, in the last three months, it's between 2,900 and 3,200. I think that what you're seeing now is that, from about May last year, there's been an increase in demand to over 3,000 each month, and that's a substantial increase. What's driven that? I can't say exactly for certain. It could be the outcome of Bowel Cancer Awareness Month and more awareness raising. It could be the Dame Deborah James effect and the fact that her story was so prevalent in the media for a number of months, and perhaps that's had an impact on waiting times.\" said by Gerard McMahon\n\"And can I ask, Gerard, does that vary across Wales, across health boards?\" said by Russell George AM\n\"There is variation across each of the health boards. I suppose, thinking back over a period of time, it's not typically one area that's always at the bottom and one area that's always at the top; there is variation month to month. I think that what that just shows is that there are pinch-points that can occur. That could be because of staffing at any one time, and I think that workforce is one of the key issues that we'll probably talk about today\u2014about that pressure on workforce and how that can manifest itself each month. But we do see that there's a variation. If you look at that figure for November, it's 41 per cent. But you've got a range each month typically from the mid 20s per cent up to about 50 per cent, so there can be quite a bit of disparity. So, there's no area that's doing well, as such, when you compare it to the standard, but there are some that do, perhaps, typically better.&nbsp;\" said by Gerard McMahon\n\"As a result of the longer waits, what is the impact in terms of cancer outcomes?\" said by Russell George AM\n\"There's a danger with longer waits that you see people potentially moving from one stage to another. The stage of diagnosis is really important when it comes to survival. If you look at stage 1 diagnosis, almost everyone\u2014it's 95 per cent or 96 per cent\u2014will survive in five years. If you look at stage 4, it's almost the reverse\u2014it's about 8 per cent or 9 per cent survival. So, the stage of diagnosis is really, really critical. The longer someone waits, the more risks you take with that. But, I think the key thing around that would be the awareness of symptoms, and then the staff and the capacity to deal with that number of referrals that comes through, because we want to see more people aware of symptoms and we want to see them present to their general practitioner, but there then needs to be the service further down the line that has the capacity to deal with that.&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Gerard McMahon\n\"Thank you, Gerard. I suppose, Katie, that you want to add to that, but I suppose it might be helpful, also, to talk to any experience that patients have whilst waiting for endoscopy services, and what support they get or don't get.&nbsp;\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Yes, absolutely. I back up everything that Gerard has mentioned. Not to throw any more stats at you, but the waiting times across the board for cancer are really poor, and it's something that we are continually concerned and worried about. When we're talking about endoscopy, we're obviously not just talking about bowel cancer or lower GI cancers; we're talking about a range of cancers, namely upper GI, but others too. No health board has hit the target of 75 per cent of people being seen within 62 days of suspicion of cancer and starting treatment. That's across the board for all cancers, but if you look at lower GI, and you consider that bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in Wales, 41 per cent of people were seen within that 62-day time.If you think about people, that's not an easy wait for people, as you can imagine; these are people who are experiencing symptoms and who have been referred because there is a suspicion of cancer or because they've gone through screening. That's a hugely anxious wait, and we know that, often, the blocker within that time is the diagnostics period. So, again not to throw more stats at you, but I think that this is a useful one, the analysis that has been done at CRUK shows that on diagnostic waiting times, going back to September 2022, over 16,000 people were waiting over eight weeks for the key endoscopy tests in Wales, compared to pre pandemic\u2014so, in September 2019\u2014when that was only 2,888 people. Our waiting lists have increased hugely and it's a really, really big concern.Just to reiterate, the reason that waiting is such a concern in cancer is because early diagnosis is so crucial and so important. So, endoscopy is a really, really important diagnostic tool. If we're getting blocked there, we are slowing down people's diagnosis and, therefore, we are making, potentially, treatment less effective and more difficult and outcomes less good. It may be technical, but it's a really, really important part of the puzzle.\" said by Katie Till\n\"In terms of waiting times, either Katie or Gerard, how do they compare to the other services across the UK? Are there any comparisons that you're aware of?\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Yes, I was looking at comparable data just the other day, because I think, with the way that data is presented across each of the nations, the real comparison would be July to September last year. I think Wales is sitting third out of four. Northern Ireland is around about 25 per cent, then it's up to about 40 per cent, England's in the low 40s as well, and then I think Scotland is about 59 per cent. So, no area of the UK, again, is meeting their targets, but there's just that variation in just how far away from that target we seem to be.\" said by Gerard McMahon\n\"It's really important to acknowledge the challenge the system is under, and we will come to the workforce pressures, but the commitment from NHS staff and the commitment from everybody working on endoscopy and cancer services to focus on early diagnosis and to support patients is clearly there. So, I don't think it's just a Welsh problem, but yes, we have really clear issues. If the ambition is to increase\u2014sorry, not increase the target of waiting times, but, for example, for health boards to be hitting 70 per cent of people to be seen within 62 days by, I think, April 2023 is the Minister's ambition\u2014we're so far from that, and we're in February.\" said by Katie Till\n\"Is the Minister's ambition a reasonable target to achieve?\" said by Russell George AM\n\"I think we see, if you look at even England, for example, I think they've had in their long-term plan a target for early-stage diagnosis of about 75 per cent. So, we're seeing these targets popping up, and I think they're useful in setting that target, setting that position down the road that we want to get to. And as Katie says, these are challenges that are not unique to Wales.I think, just to touch on something earlier about the staging, we're not seeing a massive shift in the stage. So it is sitting still just under 40 per cent of bowel cancers being diagnosed at stage 1, stage 2, so, although the demand's increased, and although we are seeing lengthier waits, the staging is still roughly where it was. Obviously, we want to see that move upwards. But I think, with the increase in demand, a lot of the changes that have come about through the endoscopy action plan, which are really quite substantial improvements, we're maybe not seeing the positive outcome of that because of other factors.&nbsp;\" said by Gerard McMahon\n\"Okay. I'm just going to bring Jack in for a quick supplementary. Jack.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Thanks, Chair. Gerard, you mentioned that the data is most comparable in July through to September. Does that mean that the nations are using data differently?\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"I think it's more about the collection points and the publication of it. So, if you look at\u2014\" said by Gerard McMahon\n\"Okay. So, I'm being a bit more cynical than what it actually is. Okay.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"No, that's okay. Just to clarify that, in Wales and in England, you get monthly updates that run two months lag. In Northern Ireland and in Scotland, it's a quarterly update that runs a quarter lag. So, it can take a bit of time to see where all the data lines up across all four nations.&nbsp;\" said by Gerard McMahon\n\"Okay, thanks.&nbsp;\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Thank you. Rhun ap Iorwerth.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Thank you very much, and good morning to you both. Now, we know it's quite inevitable that we'll be repeating some things as we go forward, but I wanted to look at capacity, including the physical capacity on the estate, for example, and also the types of interventions that are being made, and the workforce also. Could you talk us through the type of offers you have in order to increase capacity? That's key, and also perhaps things such as introducing community diagnostic hubs\u2014are they part of the solution? But I'll let you expand on what you think is important.\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"Sorry, I missed the first part of that. It wasn't on the translation. I caught the last part about community diagnostic hubs.&nbsp;\" said by Gerard McMahon\n\"Yes, I'll ask the question again, no problem at all.&nbsp;\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"If you'd like to put your headset on, we can maybe try again.\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"I wanted to say at the outset that it's going to be inevitable that we repeat some things as we touch on capacity. But could you take us through the kind of interventions that we need to put in place in order to increase capacity, and I'm thinking of things such as community diagnostic hubs, as you heard? But also, what are the ideas that you're keen to see implemented?\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"Shall I go first? Is that okay? Yes, I think that's obviously a really, really important question. Workforce is the single biggest issue, I think, holding back endoscopy services and cancer services more broadly. We know that workforce shortages, again, are not just a Welsh issue. So, it's reported across the UK that workforce issues within endoscopy are probably the biggest challenge. We don't know, however, what it looks like in terms of capacity in numbers and data in Wales, so I don't have\u2014maybe it is collected, and not publicly\u2014but we don't know how many endoscopists we have, where they are, where shortages are, those sorts of basic bits of data are really, really, challenging to have. There is obviously, of course, anecdotally, regional variation. Again, I don't have the data to back up where that is, but that is a really, really important part of the puzzle to understand how to address workforce shortages. We know that it is capacity in the system that is driving these long waits.&nbsp;In terms of your question on solutions, yes, I'd definitely come back to community diagnostic hubs. In the long term, it is doing really proper data collection, recording that and sharing that publicly. In thinking about what's making people leave the service, what's affecting staff retention and well-being, and all of that, I know we've just had a workforce plan out from Welsh Government yesterday, I believe, so there will be some really positive things in there, but in the shorter term, I think it's about maximising retention. So, it feels basic but it's things like thinking about flexible working and part-time working\u2014how can the NHS support particularly people who are thinking about retirement, but lots of us are thinking about flexible working, particularly post pandemic. And also, skills mix approaches. So, thinking about how we can use non-medical endoscopists to support endoscopy services, and I know that it's something that Health Education and Improvement Wales are really interested in as well.&nbsp;The other part of the picture, as you alluded to, is the innovations piece. So, it's new things, new ways of doing things that will help the burden, I guess, on capacity and demand. So, yes, we absolutely think community diagnostic hubs, which obviously include endoscopy services, are a really fantastic innovation that we think Wales would really benefit from, and I understand that it is going to be part of the cancer improvement plan that, again, was published this week. Whereas the difference between regional diagnostic hubs [<em>Correction</em>: 'rapid diagnostic clinics'] is around endoscopy services being part of that. So, yes, we think that more can come out into the community\u2014that can only be a positive thing.&nbsp;There are other innovations such as colon capsule endoscopy, cytosponge, transnasal endoscopy that, again, can be actually less invasive and better for patients in lots of ways, and also, again, remove some of that burden from more traditional, I guess, endoscopy services.&nbsp;\" said by Katie Till\n\"Thank you very much for that comprehensive answer. You referred to the workforce. Gerard, I don't know if you've had the opportunity yet to look at the workforce plan that was published yesterday or the day before\u2014the day before, Tuesday afternoon. Do you see that as offering the kinds of solutions that you're seeking in terms of the workforce, because it's not clear to me what the plan for the cancer workforce was? It was mentioned, but I didn't see the solution being outlined clearly.&nbsp;\" said by ", "answer": "Rhun ap Iorwerth AM"}

So, as well as the loss of access to EU funds, Welsh universities are being forced to compete for a shrinking pot of UKRI funding against better funded UK institutions. In 2018, Professor Graeme Reid published the findings of his independent review into Welsh Government's RD&amp;I spending. The Welsh Government accepted the review's recommendations, but has, to this day, still not implemented them in full.&nbsp;So, in light of the dire backdrop against which Welsh institutions are facing and surviving, will the Welsh Government implement the recommendations in full, updated for the current economic and research landscape?\" said by Luke Fletcher MS\n\"Well, Llywydd, the most important point the Member made in relation to the Reid review is the very last point he made, because, in many ways, the key recommendations of the Reid review have been overtaken by changes in the research landscape that have happened since the report was published. And those are significant changes, and an updating of the Reid report would be necessary before any implementation plan could be confirmed.&nbsp;Of course, I agree with the points that Luke Fletcher has made. It is for UKRI to demonstrate that the initials 'UK' mean something in its title. The funds that it has at its disposal\u2014and they are significant\u2014need to be spent in all parts of the United Kingdom, matching the very many strengths that are to be found in research institutions in all parts of the UK. Now, UKRI has itself a target of increasing the share of funding spent outside the golden halo of the south-east of England. And we work with our institutions here in Wales to make sure that they are as well placed as possible to compete for that UK level of research funding. We support, of course, universities ourselves\u2014\u00a382 million in QR funding to universities, \u00a315 million above that in the research Wales innovation fund. But, with a UK Government that has recentralised money to the centre, changed the rules of research funding across the United Kingdom, it is for them to demonstrate that they are serious about investing in the research capacity of institutions in all parts of the United Kingdom.&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"I thank Luke Fletcher for tabling this question, and just to build on the point I think he was making, if Wales and Welsh universities are to feel the true benefits that we know research and innovation can bring, our institutions need additional support from the Welsh Government to achieve external investment and win those competitive funding bids. And Wales simply isn't achieving its potential when it comes to medical research in particular. According to the Office for National Statistics, out of the 12 nations and regions of the UK, Wales has proportionately the lowest expenditure on R&amp;D. We spend 2 per cent of the UK total, despite the fact we have 5 per cent of the population. Wales also only wins 3 per cent of competitive funding. Shouldn't we be winning at least 5 per cent of it?&nbsp;Now, the British Heart Foundation recently found that,&nbsp; for every \u00a31 million spent on medical research by charities, it supports \u00a32.3 million in output and \u00a31.47 million in gross value added. So, First Minister, will you commit to working with the higher education sector, and the third sector, and organisations such as the British Heart Foundation, to ensure that Wales wins, at the very least, its population share of medical research funding in the UK?\" said by Tom Giffard MS\n\"Well, Llywydd, the words of the Conservative Member will ring hollow in the ears of higher education institutions and, indeed, third sector organisations in Wales because they will know that, as a result of decisions that his party has made, \u00a3380 million that we were able to invest in research and in higher education in Wales in the last round of European funding now disappears entirely from Wales, placing 1,000 jobs in the research sector at risk. It is rich for Conservative Members to stand up here, demanding that the Welsh Government should spend more of our resources, when his Government denies those resources to Wales, with the results that we see. And that's not my view\u2014that's not my view; those are the warnings of higher education institutions here in Wales. And while we will work with HE institutions in Wales to compete more successfully for those funds available at the UK level, let there be no doubt at all, Llywydd, that Wales itself is being starved of the funding that has supported that sector in the past by the deliberate decision of the Conservative Government in London.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"With permission, Llywydd, can I extend a warm welcome to Broughton Primary School, who are here in the Senedd with us today?First Minister, we are incredibly proud in Alyn and Deeside to lead the way in research and innovation, and be home to the Welsh Government-backed advanced manufacturing research centre in Broughton. Do you agree with me, First Minister, that the next step in Cymru's innovation journey is the establishment of an advanced technology research centre in Sealand?\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Llywydd, it's great to see those young people from Broughton here, having made the journey down to south Wales, and they'll have been pleased to hear their local Member asking a question on the floor of the Senedd this afternoon.I've been very proud, Llywydd, to have visited the advanced manufacturing research centre and to have been there with Jack Sargeant on a number of occasions. And he's right to draw attention to the plans for the advanced technology research centre in Sealand. We are making some progress in our negotiations with the UK Government over that plan. The critical emerging technologies that will be taken forward when that centre is established have now been agreed\u2014three priority areas: cyber-security, software engineering, and radio frequency technologies. I welcome the fact that, in the autumn statement, the UK Government committed \u00a310 million to taking that plan forward. Since then, Llywydd, it has been a bit of a struggle to extract from the UK Government a sense of the terms on which that funding will be drawn down, the timescales against which that funding is to be made available, and even which department is in charge of making those decisions. Is it the Ministry of Defence, which is meant to be the lead department, or is it in fact the Treasury, who are holding the purse strings? So, while the prospect of the Sealand centre is exciting, we are committed to it, I hope the UK Government is as committed as they were in the autumn, and, if they are, then they need to speed up the decision making so that we can get on and make that centre a reality.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"2. What is the Welsh Government doing to support mental health provision in Mid and West Wales? OQ59666\" said by Joyce Watson AM\n\"Llywydd, we continue to provide significant and sustained support for mental health. In addition to the mental health ring-fenced allocation, Powys and Hywel Dda health boards have received \u00a34.5 million in recurrent funding to improve mental health services over the last two years.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Hywel Dda is strong on mental health. It's the first health board in Wales to roll out the 111 press 2 service, where people can speak to a mental health practitioner 24/7, and it's currently piloting a number of forward-thinking alternatives to admissions, like sanctuaries for children and young people. So, there's a lot of great work that is happening. But, last week, I visited Shadows Depression Support Group in Garnant, which is facing funding cuts. They are doing vital work in the community, and it would be a significant blow to lose that support. So, post COVID, can you assure residents of the Amman and Gwendraeth valleys that mental health provision will remain a priority for your Government?\" said by Joyce Watson AM\n\"Llywydd, I thank Joyce Watson for that, and I thank her for what she said about the work that goes on in the Hywel Dda health board. She's absolutely right that the 111 press 2 service has been pioneered in Hywel Dda, and the sanctuary service for young people suffering from mental health conditions\u2014the sanctuary model that we've developed as part of the co-operation agreement\u2014the first practical services opened in Haverfordwest, which will be very well known to Joyce Watson.As far as the Garnant service is concerned, my understanding is that this is a decision of the local primary care health cluster. So, these are GPs who get together to commission services. They are often time limited. It's the job of the cluster to review the service, to decide whether that investment is giving the greatest return for their local populations. Now, the Minister responsible for mental health services will be in Hywel Dda next month, together with the designated Member, and I'm sure there will be opportunities to discuss the progress that is being made in pan-Hywel Dda services, but also to take up some of the specific points that Joyce Watson has raised this afternoon.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"First Minister, residents in my constituency and across Wales are having to leave the country to access specialist eating disorder services. The charity Beat has called on the Welsh Government to ensure there is specialist treatment at the earliest opportunity. A Welsh Government spokesperson said you were working with NHS Wales to scope the feasibility of a specialist eating disorder unit here in Wales. I'd like to associate myself with the comments of your backbench Member Sarah Murphy, who has said that we need timescales of when this is going to be delivered. So, First Minister, can you confirm today what progress you have made on this? And when are we going to have a specialist eating disorder service centre here in Wales to serve those people who need it?&nbsp;\" said by James Evans MS\n\"Well, Llywydd, first of all, let's be clear it's always been the case that, in Wales, we sometimes think it is clinically better for people to access specialist services that are provided across the border. I'm not a nationalist in the way that the Member appears to be. I think it's perfectly possible\u2014. The Member shakes his head. His question to me was that somehow it is preferable for services to be provided in Wales than across the border, and I make the point to him that, sometimes, on a population of 3 million people, a specialist service will be better provided across our border. That has always been the case over 20 years, and, for certain specialisms, it will continue to be the case in the future. And a single eating disorder service for Wales\u2014a single centre\u2014would be far more geographically inconvenient for some parts of Wales than services that can be accessed more readily across the border in England. I have no objection to that because I think that is a better service for patients.Nevertheless, the Welsh Government provided additional targeted service improvement funding of \u00a32.5 million in the last financial year to recognise the priority of eating disorder services, and health boards have been identifying those local needs and seeing whether they aggregate into a case for a national service for some aspects of eating disorder services. So, that case is being assembled, and it will be for the Welsh Health Specialised Services Committee to decide whether or not that service amounts to something that they would regard as to be funded. But the general point I return to it is where you have very particular needs, and the needs of some people with eating disorders are very particular indeed, a population of 3 million people will not support a service of that sort, and we should not feel hesitant about accessing that service elsewhere where that is in the interest of those patients.\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"I am meeting the Shadows Depression Support Group in the Amman valley on Friday, and I have to tell the First Minister that the news that this service is due to close in September has caused great concern for the 1,600 people who use the service at the moment. We must also bear in mind the waiting list in the Hywel Dda area for those that need therapy for mental health issues, where over 50 per cent are waiting over six months. So, what can we offer in terms of providing hope and assurance to them? I understand the point the First Minister made, that this was a decision from the local medical cluster, but is there a national framework in terms of assessing the costs and benefits of these decisions, and is there direct funding available for situations where, because of these decisions, there will be gaps in provision for these people? Shouldn't we ensure that there is continuity of support for people who truly need that support in the Amman and Gwendraeth valleys?\" said by Adam Price AM\n\"I thank Adam Price for that supplementary question. He reflects what Joyce Watson has said already. Of course, I acknowledge the fact that, when services change, that does lead to concerns among some people, particularly those who have accessed the service that is already there.But the purpose of creating a robust cluster with direct funding that goes straight to them is to provide them with the ability to make decisions. That's the purpose of what we have been developing for a number of years now, and for me, it is important to give that flexibility to local people who are close to the communities that they serve, to use the funding and the budgets that they have in a way that they assess will be effective in future.I'm sure that the Minister will be able to speak, when she is down in Hywel Dda, with the health board about what is happening in Garnant. It's important to me to adhere to the principle whereby the decisions are made by the people on the ground, with all of the information that they have about local need, and what the most effective way is to respond to those needs.&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Mark Drakeford AM\n\"Questions now from the party leaders. The leader of the Welsh Conservatives\u2014Andrew RT Davies.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Thank you, Presiding Officer. First Minister, today is the first day of the UK COVID inquiry. I had very much hoped that I would be able to say that today is the first day for the Welsh independent COVID inquiry, but clearly, that's not going to happen on your watch as First Minister.One of the points that has come out that the inquiry will spend some time looking at in the early part of the COVID inquiry is the decision by Governments across the UK to discharge patients from hospitals to care homes without testing. There was a full pandemic preparedness exercise undertaken in 2016, as I understand it. That preparedness exercise highlighted that this was a major risk and major concern. Do you agree that that was a risk too far, and that discharging patients from hospitals to care homes without testing should not have happened?&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Andrew RT Davies AM\n\"First of all, I welcome very much the fact that today is the first day of full hearings at the independent UK inquiry. I hope very much that it will be able to provide answers for those families who lost loved ones and whose lives were affected by the awful experience of COVID. I think that they will be at the forefront of our minds, as well as the minds of the inquiry today.The matters that the leader of the opposition raises are now matters for the inquiry. That is why there is an inquiry, and I'm not going to be able to offer him a running commentary on individual aspects of the inquiry's work that he chooses to raise with me. The issue of care homes and care home discharges, I agree with him, is a very important issue. It is identified by the inquiry as such. It is in the programme of modules that the inquiry will pursue in the autumn. I have no doubt at all that it will require evidence from the Welsh Government and, no doubt, witnesses from the Welsh Government on the decisions that were made here. But the point of an inquiry is for the inquiry to pursue those issues now, and that's where the Welsh Government's efforts will be focused.\" said by ", "answer": "Mark Drakeford AM"}
{"content": "\"Good afternoon and welcome to this Plenary meeting of the Senedd. The first item is questions to the Minister for Climate Change, and the first question is from Sioned Williams.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"1. Will the Minister provide an update on the Government's strategy to improve the urban environment in South Wales West? OQ59611\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"Diolch, Sioned. We are shaping healthier urban environments through our Transforming Towns programme. Green infrastructure is encouraged in placemaking support proposals, improving biodiversity, quality of life, whilst helping tackle climate change. We continue to support the enhancement of community green spaces where people live and work through our Local Places for Nature projects.&nbsp;\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Diolch, Weinidog. Recently published research by Professor Ross Cameron of the University of Sheffield highlights the environmental importance of natural gardens. They play a vital role in cooling urban areas, absorbing rain, thereby reducing the risk of flash flooding, and offering much needed refuge, of course, for wildlife. The report outlines some of the trends of garden design and maintenance that are damaging for the urban environment, and one of these is the use of artificial grass. Artificial grass is made of plastic and other synthetic materials, which, despite the perception of being maintenance free, requires regular cleaning and has a life span of eight to 15 years, after which sustainable disposal can be challenging. Aside from reducing the benefits of natural gardens, using artificial grass carries other environmental implications, such as hindering the habitat of earthworms and insects, while the leaching of microplastics can harm wildlife.&nbsp;I wrote to Swansea Council, in my region, about this issue after being alerted to the fact that artificial grass had been used in the city regeneration work. They answered saying that this would not be used by the council in the public realm, even on a temporary basis, going forward. So, will you commit, today, Minister, to following the good example of Swansea Council by committing to the banning of the use of artificial grass in spaces over which the Government has control, with the exception of sports fields? And will you also consider supporting some of the suggestions by Professor Cameron, such as providing financial incentives to encourage and reward sustainable garden management?\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"Thank you, Sioned. It's a really important question for a number of reasons. Artificial grass really does have a very, very bad effect on the local sustainability of a large number of areas in Wales. As you rightly said, there is a short-term focus on, maybe, it being lower maintenance, but, actually, weeds come up through artificial grass. It can be very difficult to clean, if an animal has been on it, and, actually, there are quite worrying reports from a number of university sources, saying that the toxicity coming off artificial grass, if it's played on by children and so on, is quite alarming. So, actually, I really do think we need to get a public information campaign going about why it isn't the short-term solution it looks like for people. I've also noticed a slightly worrying tendency for artificial hedges and pots and things. You only have to look at those after one autumn of rain to see that they've leached the colour out of them and they've gone into the environment. So, I think it really is an important issue. We will be looking at all of our guidance and working with our local authorities to make sure that it isn't used in any publicly funded space, but I also want to get a piece of evidence going to (a), do a public information campaign about the problems with artificial grass, and (b), explore whether our new single-use plastics Bill, which got the royal seal\u2014. I was at the sealing ceremony on Monday, and I hope it's on its way to you, if it hasn't arrived already, Llywydd. That gave us the ability to add in other plastics for banning, so I really want to explore proactively whether it's possible to do it through that route as well.&nbsp;\" said by Julie James AM\n\"In 2007, the world passed a little noticed but critical landmark, the point at which, for the first time in history, more humans were living in towns and cities than in the countryside. In Wales, two thirds of us live in urban areas. It is therefore vital that we do all we can to improve the urban environment. That means not just tackling air pollution in our towns and cities or tackling the travesty that is the dumping of sewage into rivers like the Towy and the Ogmore, but also improving access to green spaces in our urban areas. Minister, what steps are you taking to protect green spaces in urban areas and ensure that every community has free and ready access to such spaces?\" said by Altaf Hussain MS\n\"Thank you, Altaf. It's a very important point. It's very much front and centre of our Transforming Towns initiative, where we look to create green infrastructure, as it's called. Green infrastructure is where there's a network of natural and semi-natural areas and features that contribute to high-quality environments, particularly important in urban and peri-urban spaces. One of the things I didn't respond to in Sioned's initial question was the issue about financial incentives to get people to have sustainable gardens. We're very keen to ensure that it's easier to do the right thing than it is to do the wrong thing, across Wales. My colleague Joyce Watson has on a number of occasions in the Senedd raised the fact that, actually, strictly speaking, you need planning consent to pave over a front area in an urban environment. It's not very often enforced in Wales, but we have been writing out to local authorities regularly to remind them that they need to consider the run-off point from that, because it's not just about biodiversity; it's actually about sustainable water systems as well, so it's very important for that.We need to find a socially inclusive way of making sure that people have access to green spaces, not if you're just lucky enough to have a garden\u2014you obviously ought to use that in the most sustainable way possible\u2014but, also, we need to make sure that everyone in an urban or peri-urban area has access to that kind of sustained green space. You simply cannot do that by having hard-paved or, indeed, artificial grass areas\u2014that just does not produce the same quality in the environment. So, we need, as I said to Sioned, to look at a range of interventions that we can undertake, and I personally would be looking very seriously to see whether we could actually do an education campaign to make people understand the problems, and then actually look to see if we can include it in a ban.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"2. Will the Minister make a statement on the Government's plans to improve transport links across the Menai Strait? OQ59621\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"Thank you for the&nbsp;question.\" said by Lee Waters AM\n\"I have asked the north Wales transport commission to consider the resilience of access to and from Ynys M\u00f4n in addition to its original remit. The commission's interim report is due to be published this week, with final recommendations to follow in the autumn.\" said by Lee Waters AM\n\"Thank you for that response. I look forward to seeing that report. There are two bridges, of course, at the moment. I would like to ask for an assurance, first of all, that everything will be done to reduce difficulties locally in doing the work on the Menai bridge. There are traffic lights now; I would like an assurance that the restrictions will be in place for as brief a period as possible.But there are two. As regards the second bridge\u2014. I would like to extend my sincerest condolences to the family of a man who died in an accident on 23 May. Safety, of course, is one of the main arguments, along with resilience, in the case for a third crossing. What happened in this case was that the Britannia bridge was closed for nine hours, and people couldn't get to Ysbyty Gwynedd, school pupils couldn't get to their GCSE and A-level examinations. We must resolve this situation in terms of resilience. I've written to the Minister, recommending, as an initial step, although we do need that third crossing, having a zipper system in place, where a barrier is placed to allow two lanes of traffic in one direction in the morning, and then moving that barrier so that traffic can move in the other direction in the evening. Can I have an assurance from the Minister that work is being done to look at that seriously?\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"Thank you. I too would like to pass on my sympathy to the family of the person who died on the bridge.We absolutely are looking at the issues that Rhun ap Iorwerth sets out. As he knows, we've asked the Burns commission specifically to look on this. We have also commissioned a study into resilience and traffic flow issues on the Britannia bridge, and the potential impact this will have on the carriage layout. We specifically looked, as he has suggested, at the examples of the Golden Gate zipper bridge, and the Tamar crossing. And in fact, we've been in touch with the company, Tamar Crossings, and National Highways, who operate the tidal flow of traffic on the Tamar bridge and the Saltash tunnel in Plymouth. And traffic and operational information that we've gathered has been passed on to the north Wales transport commission for them to consider. So, I agree with him\u2014I think the zipper situation looks interesting and, potentially, very useful in the context of Ynys M\u00f4n, and that work is ongoing.\" said by Lee Waters AM\n\"I also extend my condolences, of course, to the family of the bereaved.The Welsh Government carried out a consultation in 2007 over proposals that included eight options for easing traffic congestion&nbsp;to and from Anglesey, including a new bridge. Reports were published in 2008, 2009, 2011, and a strategic business case was submitted in 2016, which found the scheme would meet local and national needs, including journey times, reliability and access for non-vehicle road users. This need has been intensified by the announcement of the Anglesey free port. In 2017, the previous First Minister told me the Welsh Government's aim was to see the third Menai crossing open in 2022. Then, earlier this year, the Welsh Government announced it was scrapping more than 50 road-building projects, including plans for a third Menai bridge. At a press conference last month, however, the First Minister said, 'The Menai crossing remains a project we continue to explore.' Last Friday, I met again with Ynys M\u00f4n's MP, Virginia Crosbie, and businesses in the Menai Bridge area, who raised with us issues including traffic, parking and a need for a third Menai crossing. How will you therefore engage with them regarding this, as the Welsh Government continues to make up its mind about what it is going to do?\" said by Mark Isherwood AM\n\"Well, thank you for taking us through the history of the bridge and the discussion of options to replace it. As Mark Isherwood knows, we published our roads review and our amended roads policy statement, which he welcomed insofar as it applied to the red route in Flintshire. We've consistently applied that same lens across all road schemes, not just ones that he wants to scrap, but all of them, and we've tried to apply that logic consistently. And that, as he said, suggested that a third crossing wasn't justified, but it did set out a series of other alternatives. And that's why I've asked the Burns commission to look seriously at that, in the context of its study of north Wales as a whole, which was indeed part of the recommendations of the Sir Peter Hendy union connectivity review, commissioned by his Government. So, I think it's good that we've worked together to take forward those recommendations. And I would expect, once the interim report is published this week, that all stakeholders across north Wales will engage with the commission to feed in their ideas, and there's an opportunity for all elected Members, and other stakeholders, to do that.&nbsp;\" said by Lee Waters AM\n\"Questions now from party spokespeople. The Conservative spokesperson, Janet Finch-Saunders.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Diolch, Llywydd. Minister, six of the UK's top 20 most polluted rivers are here in Wales\u2014the Rivers Teifi, Usk, Wye, Towy, the Menai strait and the River Taff. Now, according to Natural Resources Wales, sewage pollution is the top pollutant in Welsh bathing waters. Locals and visitors have been taking to the waters during this glorious weather, and I know that you're fully aware of your own responsibility and wish to ensure that it is safe for people. Now, since 2016, there have been around 450,000 storm overflow discharges in Wales. Since 2016, NRW has only sent out\u2014only sent out, and I say that loosely\u2014350 warning letters to Welsh Water, but, as a result of sending out 350 warning letters, Welsh Water have only been prosecuted six times. Now, that strikes me as a massive enforcement failure.&nbsp;What steps will you take to independently assess whether NRW have actually been taking their own responsibilities seriously and that they have been enforcing correctly?\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"Thank you, Janet. I'm afraid there's a very fundamental misunderstanding of the correlation between warning letters and prosecutions in your question. Obviously, NRW will prosecute somebody who isn't doing the right remedial actions. You don't prosecute somebody who's done something and then takes the right remedial actions. Prosecution is the last step where no other remedy is available.&nbsp;But, turning to the substantive point, which is the question of what we are going to do about improving the water quality of the rivers\u2014which prosecution is never going to do, actually; it's just a last stand for somebody who really isn't doing the right thing\u2014what we need to do is to get people to do the right thing. You consistently list the things that are happening in our rivers, but you always leave out land use and agricultural pollution. Land use and agricultural pollution are big contributors to the river pollution that we experience right across Wales. There's no point in shaking your head at me, it just is; it's a matter of data. It is a combination of a whole series of things in every river in Wales. I can produce, and I'm very happy to circulate, Llywydd, for the Senedd the analysis on each river in Wales and what the top polluter is on each river in Wales, and then a sliding scale of what the issues are. But the point is it doesn't matter. We have to fix all of the issues. So, we've been running a series, as you know, of summits and then task and finish groups coming out of the summits, where each sector has looked to put its own house in order and not throw brickbats at the others.So, the First Minister has been very clear\u2014and all of the sectors signed up to this\u2014that what you have to do is look to see what your sector can do to improve its problems in contributing to water pollution. So, that is, of course, the water companies, and we're in the middle of the price review, which the UK Government needs to pay particular attention to because, at the moment, it's still insisting on bill payers picking up the tab for that and that's clearly the wrong way to do it. But of course, we have to make the investment that we need for our water reserves to be right for a whole range of reasons\u2014water quality is one of them. But actually, we're about to face what is probably a very hot summer and a very dry summer, so we've already stood up our drought teams, for example.So, these are very complex things. It's far too simplistic to say that if NRW were to prosecute everyone they sent a warning letter to, the problem would be solved overnight. It quite clearly would not. So, I would say to you: engage with the process, engage with the active participation of each of the sectors to put their own house in order, and that includes land use and agriculture; it includes water; it includes house builders; it includes food producers; it includes absolutely everyone who relies on and contributes to our water quality in Wales, because without everyone doing it, we will not get to where we want to be.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Thank you, but I think you've missed my question: 350 warning letters went to water companies, so, at the end of the day, perhaps the Minister wants to elaborate and tell me how many farmers you've sent warning letters to about pollution.Now, when you hear that almost 0.5 million discharges have resulted in only six prosecutions, there can be little confidence in your own regulatory and enforcement regime. In fact, this is a problem that the Climate Change, Environment and Infrastructure Committee noted last year when we stated:&nbsp;'NRW must be able to respond timely and effectively to pollution incidents, and must be prepared to take enforcement action when permit breaches occur.'You're not telling me that only six permit breaches have occurred in Wales. Even Dr Christian Dunn from Bangor University has said that altering the rules around sewage pollution would create rapid change. He wants water bosses to face criminal investigations if a company is responsible for dumping raw sewage into rivers and seas. I agree with the principle of tougher enforcement action if it saves our rivers. Do you?\" said by ", "answer": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM"}

Llywydd, I'd like to ask if the Minister would join me in welcoming the efforts of the North Wales Economic Ambition Board, Bangor University and others to establish north Wales as a 5G innovation region within the UK. This, in combination with other initiatives, such as the north Wales growth deal, will assist in bringing much-needed improvements in broadband connectivity to households and businesses in the region. Please could you ensure, as Minister, that the Welsh Government will provide all possible support in these efforts? Diolch.\" said by Carolyn Thomas MS\n\"Yes, I'm happy to give the assurance. I'm interested in the work that is already being done. I'm particularly keen to support partners across north Wales, including the ambition board, to make sure that Wales gets a proper share of the \u00a340 million fund announced by the UK Government in April of this year, to ensure that we do support practical 5G innovation and delivery across north Wales. It's part of what we'll be able to do, and, of course, we're in the fortunate position of having it to build on with the work already being undertaken in Bangor University in the digital processing centre, and I think there's more to come for the future.\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"Last summer, I joined National Trust Cymru for a visit to the upper Conwy catchment project and a meeting with Cwm Community Action Group to discuss the lack of mobile coverage in Cwm Penmachno. In a subsequent meeting with Digital Mobile Spectrum Limited\u2014DMSL\u2014and Cwm Community Action Group, we discussed the shared rural network programme. DMSL, I'm sure you're aware, is a joint venture between the four UK mobile network operators, or MNOs, to work for a disruption-free digital life for people across the UK. The shared rural network, with \u00a3532 million from MNOs and \u00a3500 million from the UK Government, aims to extend coverage in north Wales to 83 per cent 4G coverage from all MNOs, and 98 per cent from at least one MNO, and, across Wales, to 80 per cent from all MNOs, and 95 per cent from at least one mobile network operator. As we heard, you can't have connectivity without the infrastructure. What engagement are you having with DMSL accordingly?\" said by Mark Isherwood AM\n\"I met with Julia Lopez, before her maternity leave, in the UK Government, because, of course, the challenge here is this isn't a devolved area, but we recognise that the UK Government's programme to actually improve connectivity should reach 85 per cent of homes. That means there are others where mobile connectivity will be the reality of ensuring that there is proper connectivity within them. I'm more than happy to check again with my officials about their specific engagement with the organisations you refer to, to make sure that it's planned into our activity, because we will still need to make sure that we're filling in some of the gaps that exist in the UK Government programme. But I think it stands, to add to my earlier answer to Carolyn Thomas, about what we are already doing to improve connectivity in north Wales.<a class=\"footnoteLink\" href=\"#C520420\">FootnoteLink</a>\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"I very much welcome the question from Carolyn Thomas. As someone who sat as an unpaid member on the 5G project consortium with Bangor University and those industry partners, it's clear to me, Minister, that we do have a real opportunity in this space in north Wales. I welcome the ongoing support from the Welsh Government in this non-devolved area, but, crucially, we do need collaboration between the Welsh and, importantly, the UK Government. So, I wonder, Minister, what further conversations you can have with UK Government Ministers to ensure that they understand the opportunities in front of us in north Wales.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Funnily enough, I mentioned the meeting I'd had with Julia Lopez before maternity leave, and had a subsequent meeting with John Whittingdale, who's covering her maternity leave, on a range of areas. And one of the areas we do need to get right is the roll-out for broadband connectivity and, like I say, filling in the gap that exists, once the 85 per cent target is reached. So, again, this does build on Carolyn Thomas's question and the work of the digital signal processing centre. We're in discussions with them about the support we may be able to provide, in addition to the support that the north Wales ambition board has provided. But it is crucial there is a constructive and pragmatic conversation with the UK Government, otherwise we won't provide the connectivity that communities and businesses need for them to be able to undertake what are now fairly normal functions of life. But I'm optimistic\u2014cautiously optimistic\u2014that we'll find a way through.&nbsp;\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"2. What action is the Welsh Government taking to reduce unemployment in Wales? OQ59746\" said by Peter Fox MS\n\"We continue to invest in employability programmes that we either run or fund from the Welsh Government. Two good examples are Communities for Work Plus, which is delivered by local authorities, and ReAct+. Together with Jobcentre Plus\u2014a UK Government function\u2014we have in place a wide range of measures to help support unemployed people into work.\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"Thank you, Minister. As you know, the latest data shows that, despite a UK-wide improving picture, Wales continues to fall behind in terms of employment and continues to see a rise in unemployment. According to the latest Open University's business barometer report, 69 per cent of small and medium-sized enterprises are currently facing skills shortages in Wales. This is a dramatic increase on last year's report, where only 32 per cent believed that finding the right skill set was the single biggest challenge facing businesses. The demand for jobs is out there, Minister; we just need the Welsh Government to invest in the workforce. With that in mind, what is the Welsh Government going to do in order to ensure the reversal of this incredibly disappointing trend?\" said by Peter Fox MS\n\"Well, there are a couple of points to make in response. The first is on the employment and unemployment figures. As I and the First Minister have set out, actually, on the figures themselves, it's important not to over-rely on another month's worth of figures, because the Office for National Statistics figures do show a rise in unemployment, whereas, actually, the pay-as-you-earn figures over the last year show an increase in employees of 1.5 per cent in Wales. The last month's figures show a 0.3 per cent increase. Now, it's unusual to then have the ONS figures come out and say something entirely different. So, we do need to understand what's going on in that picture, and, to be fair, ONS are looking to increase the size of the labour force survey they undertake to try to make sure that those figures are more reliable and don't have to wait for the annual population survey.&nbsp;When it comes to skills, this is directly related to our overall budget, which, as you will know, is reducing in value. You'll also know that, in the area of skills, we have unhelpful competition from the UK Government cutting across us. It would be much better, in the way in which we work practically with Jobcentre Plus local management and offices, if we had that sort of relationship with the UK Government. It is about both the direction and the value of shared prosperity funds. It is also about pragmatic policy making. And that, I think, would be a good deal for this place, and respecting devolution. It would also, crucially, be a good deal for businesses and for people who are looking to improve their skills to improve their prospects of work.&nbsp;\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"Minister, I was pleased to see the announcement you made with the education Minister last week about rolling out a scheme whereby young people at risk of leaving education and becoming unemployed are provided with meaningful work experience to ensure that they can reconnect with their learning and are encouraged to develop their aspirations. What role do you believe that this initiative, working alongside, for example, the young person's guarantee, could play in reducing unemployment, and youth unemployment in particular, here in Wales?\" said by Vikki Howells AM\n\"Thank you for the question. I'm very pleased that we've been able to announce a \u00a30.5 million investment in tailored work experience. It follows a successful pilot in the area, undertaken with year 10 learners that Careers Wales undertook. And this is about providing work experience for young people to gain an opportunity to look at their own prospects in the world of the work, and to re-engage in some of their learning as well, to make sure that the learning itself is both interesting and directed to their potential future careers, and to enhance their opportunities to go into the world of work. And this does underpin the work we are trying to do across the country in the young person's guarantee, to ensure that we don't have a lost generation. This again is further evidence of us using budgets that are under pressure, but still investing in the future, and supporting young people to make sure they can plan a successful future here in Wales.&nbsp;\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"Questions now from the party spokespeople. The Conservative spokesperson, Paul Davies.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Diolch, Llywydd. Minister, this morning, I had the pleasure of hosting a breakfast briefing with the Federation of Small Businesses and Economic Intelligence Wales to discuss some of the challenges facing businesses here in Wales. Of course, many of those challenges are macro-economic&nbsp;and fall under the remit of the UK Government. However, it was made very clear that there are several actions the Welsh Government can take to support businesses in Wales at this time too, and one of those actions is improving the skills landscape. I heard your earlier answer, but the reality is that you are responsible for skills. So, can you tell us what steps the Welsh Government is taking to support businesses to ensure they can fill their skills need and can recruit, retain and upskill staff?\" said by Paul Davies AM\n\"We have a range of programmes\u2014for example, I have announced more money, together with the education Minister, for personal learning accounts. We have all the advice that businesses can get can through Business Wales themselves. We continue to invest in our apprenticeship programme as well. I\u2019ve unfortunately had to indicate that the delivery of 125,000 new apprenticeships will take an extra year. That directly comes back to the honesty that it\u2019s important to have with business\u2014I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve told them this yourself\u2014about the reality of the pressure on our budgets, about the reality of the shared prosperity fund being redirected. Previously, money from former European funds funded over 5,000 apprentices a year. That\u2019s money that has been redirected somewhere else. We also have unhelpful competition and a poorly designed Multiply programme. Previously, that money would have come here and we could have made better use of it. So, we do continue to invest in skills and in productivity. They\u2019d be in a much better place for all of us if there was clarity about responsibility, not competition and if we had the budget we were promised we would have, with the full replacement of EU funds, rather than having over \u00a31 billion taken away from us over three years.\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"Well, Minister, as you know, my committee is looking at post-EU funding, and I'm sure you'll welcome our report when we will publish it in due course.Now, Minister, the Welsh Labour manifesto for the 2021 Senedd elections committed to promoting good-quality skills in the areas where we know the economy will grow and to strengthen regional skills partnerships to ensure supply meets the changing economic needs of Wales. Now, prior to the Senedd elections, the then Economy, Infrastructure and Skills Committee undertook two particularly important inquiries in relation to skills, one on regional skills partnerships and one on degree apprenticeships. Now, those reports made a series of very important recommendations to the Welsh Government on ways in which the Government could improve the system, and we should be seeing the benefits of implementing those recommendations now. So, therefore, Minister, can you tell us whether the Welsh Government has now fully implemented the recommendations of both of those committee reports?\" said by Paul Davies AM\n\"No, I don't think we'd say we've fully implemented them. I think it's not a fair test to try to say that they should all have been fully implemented now, given what has happened in the intervening period, and given the reality of the different challenges we now face ahead of us.&nbsp;I look forward to reading the committee report. I'm sure I'll broadly welcome it. I may not welcome every single recommendation on every single page, but I look forward to receiving the report. And, of course, one of your Members, Hefin David, has undertaken a report for the education Minister, which is directly relevant to me, on how we look to improve not just the skills landscape, but the connectivity and the choices for young people. I'm looking forward to a constructive debate on that report. But, in a range of areas where there is growth and growth potential\u2014think about aerospace, think about broader advanced manufacturing, think about the semiconductor world\u2014these are all areas where it's possible to have degree programmes that work with them. We already see degree apprentices, we already see people who gain degree-level qualifications through the world of work. And our challenge is how we work alongside businesses to make sure the opportunities that come from investing in our workforce are real, and the bargain between the Government and public funds, and the clarity we can provide and what businesses themselves are prepared to invest not just in front-line workers, but crucially to invest in the quality and the skills of leaders and managers as well. That's one of the areas of the economy in Wales where we need to see more investment and more appreciation of the value of that for those individuals, for the companies and the businesses they run and, of course, the workers they're responsible to and for.\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"Minister, I think we are at a crucial point in time with the introduction of the new curriculum and with the creation of two free ports having recently been announced. We have therefore reached a critical period in my view, and we need to harness this opportunity and make some significant changes in this area. Now, you referred to the 'Transitions to Employment' report, published recently by the Member for Caerphilly, which considers the experience of professionals supporting learners in the transition from education to employment in Wales, and I hope very much the Welsh Government will respond positively to the recommendations laid out in that report too.Now, Minister, I\u2019ve been meeting with businesses and business organisations, and they\u2019ve made it crystal clear to me that skills is a pressing issue and that they need more of a say on how skills are delivered here in Wales, and, of course, given the latest ONS statistics on Welsh employment rates and economic activity, it's more important than ever that you as a Government get this right. The Welsh Government must listen to businesses and ensure that there are sufficient provision, capacity and indeed resources in place to develop the skills needed for the future. So, Minister, can you tell us what discussions you're having with those delivering degree apprenticeships in Wales, and indeed vocational skills in Wales, and importantly, what discussions are you having with businesses and indeed business organisations too to ensure that all stakeholders are informing the development of skills delivery in Wales for the future?&nbsp;\" said by Paul Davies AM\n\"Well, what the Member sets out is exactly what the Government is doing. My officials have regular conversations with further education providers and higher education as well; we're continuing the roll-out of degree apprenticeships; we're doing exactly what we said we would do in our manifesto, and, of course, at almost every appearance at your committee, with your other hat on, Hefin David takes the opportunity to talk about this, to remind us of our commitments, and I've always given a positive response to that. We continue to engage directly with regional skills partnerships as well in every part of Wales, and not just my officials, but I take an interest directly in this. For example, I met businesses last week on exactly this subject\u2014about the skills that are being provided, what that means for the learner as well, but also to make sure that those skills are directly relevant to the world of work for today. So, it's a conversation that needs to have a direct loop involving the Government, involving businesses themselves, including through our regional skills partnerships and those people providing the training and the skills for learners to make sure that they are directly relevant. I want to make sure we get good value for the public money that we invest in that, and that learners themselves get good value to enhance their career prospects.So, I recognise the points the Member makes, and it's exactly what this Government is committed to doing, and taking advantage of the new curriculum that is broadly welcomed by people in the field of business.\" said by Vaughan Gething AM\n\"Plaid Cymru spokesperson, Luke Fletcher.\" said by ", "answer": "Y Llywydd / The Llywydd"}

Before we go to questions from Members, can I welcome the witnesses? We have Bethan Sayed, Luke Young and Ben Saltmarsh here with us today. Perhaps I could start with you, Bethan, to introduce yourself for the Record of Proceedings.&nbsp;\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Shwmae? My name's Bethan Sayed, and I'm campaigns co-ordinator for the Warm this Winter campaign for Climate Cymru.&nbsp;\" said by Bethan Sayed\n\"Diolch. Luke.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. My name's Luke Young. I'm the assistant director of Citizens Advice Cymru.&nbsp;\" said by Luke Young\n\"My name is Ben Saltmarsh, and I work as head of Wales for National Energy Action.\" said by Ben Saltmarsh\n\"Well, thank you, all, for that, and thank you for taking the time to come to committee today. I think this is a particularly important petition. We will jump into questions from Members. I think I should probably start by noting my interest in this area, and others\u2014I know committee members have been interested in this area. But it is something that has affected many, many people across Wales and the United Kingdom. There's a limit\u2014we'll set it out at the start\u2014to what the committee may be able to do, but, nevertheless, it's important, I think, that we do undertake this piece of work and see where we get with it.&nbsp;I'll move straight into questions, because we've got about 40 minutes of this session. Buffy Williams.&nbsp;\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair, and thanks for joining us this afternoon. My question is to Bethan. Why did you submit this petition, and what are you hoping to achieve?\" said by Buffy Williams MS\n\"Thank you for the question, Buffy, and thank you, also, to the committee for hearing us out and for taking this issue seriously, and for all your hard work on it as individual MSs as well.We wanted to put this petition in because we know that it's a massive injustice, what's happening with the prepayment meters. It's a scandal, basically, that people are being forced onto prepayment meters during this cost-of-living crisis. And, in Wales, as part of Climate Cymru's work, I run the Warm this Winter campaign, which is part of a UK-wide campaign, looking at the cost of living, but looking at how we can come up with solutions, through energy efficiency, through renewable energy, and through ending fossil fuel here in Wales.&nbsp;So, it's a massive injustice, but what I want to say is that we do have the solutions. So, only this morning, me and my team were visiting the hydro scheme at Ynni Ogwen, and they make \u00a3500 a day that can go back into the local community and take money from people's bills, so that they can afford to pay, and that they can, then, afford to live in a way that's comfortable during the most difficult times.So, my question is back to the Welsh Government and to the UK Government: what more investment can we put into renewables in Wales, so that communities can do things for themselves? What can we spearhead in our own communities to make them stronger and bolder during these difficult times? That's a challenge I want to pose to you as Members.And before anybody else comes in, I just want to finish on this. At the end of the day, British Gas has made profits of \u00a33.2 billion. The boss of British Gas has had a bonus of \u00a33.7 million. Don't tell me there's no money for renewables. Don't tell me there's no money to get people out of this cost-of-living crisis. There is, it's just priorities. And unless we force these companies to stop them putting people on forced prepayment meters, they will not change. Therefore, Ofgem and others must come together, with Government, to stop these practices from happening. There's money there, but it needs to go the right places.\" said by Bethan Sayed\n\"Thank you.\" said by Buffy Williams MS\n\"Thank you, Buffy. Thank you, Bethan as well. Before I bring other Members in\u2014and we will go into perhaps some more detailed figures shortly\u2014just before I came to committee, I saw a BBC article that said that 94,000 prepayment meters were fitted in the last year alone. That seems quite a remarkable figure. Bethan, you talked about solutions there. One of the things I'm wondering as well is whether you think Government needs to legislate, and I specifically mean UK Government here. We know that, in the late 1990s, the water industry was similar, and people legislated. I've read many stories on this and, my personal opinion is that if you changed water for energy, you could read the same story now in 2023. Do you think we're at the similar time and a similar need for legislation to protect vulnerable households?\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Yes, definitely, it needs to emulate water, and I've seen that you've raised this in the Chamber, Jack, and Ministers have replied supporting your call for legislation on a UK level to ensure that they are not treated in the same way. This needs to happen so that people are protected and that, if they are in a vulnerable position, they're not put into a position where they are made homeless, or they cannot afford to pay their bills or they're indebted. So, I would like to see one of the suggestions coming from this inquiry to give it the same legs as water and for it to be treated as a public utility in every sense. Nobody should be denied access to energy, and that's why the UK campaign, Energy4All is something that Warm this Winter is endorsing as well.\" said by Bethan Sayed\n\"Diolch, Bethan. Luke Fletcher.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Diolch, Cadeirydd. Some important points I think have been raised already. In terms of energy, just like water, it's essential for people, so there's a question as to why people are struggling as they are. And I was quite interested to read what Citizens Advice published\u2014around 27,000 people, potentially, have been forced on to prepayment meters in 2022. If I could come to Luke in Citizens Advice, I'd be interested if you would be able to talk us through, perhaps, some of those findings from the 'Kept in the dark (Wales)' research and, as well, if there's any update to that figure for 2023 as it stands at the moment.\" said by Luke Fletcher MS\n\"Of course, yes. So, the 'Kept in the dark' report was a mixture of some of our service data, but also some survey work that we did on the basis that we were in the middle of winter and all of our statistics and all of the data and evidence that we had were saying that there was a major problem with prepayment meters\u2014being able to afford them and also our clients being forced on to prepayment meters.So, for more up-to-date figures, actually, the statistics that the Chair mentioned, coming out today from Grant Shapps's department, show that around 97,000 households across the UK were forced on to prepayment meters. Looking at those, broken down by energy company\u2014and we don't have Wales-level data on that yet; I've searched for it before this committee but that hasn't been realised by them as of yet that I've been able to see\u2014it is a really stark difference. At the low end of the table, you've got one energy company with around 30 or so forced installations of prepayment meters last year in 2022. And then, at the top, you've two energy companies that, between them, are responsible for just under 50,000 forced installation of prepayment meters last year. And that is during all of the times and leading into winter when we knew that there was a problem, when everything about it said that there was a problem.What we do know, in addition to 'Kept in the dark' and by looking at our service data, is who has come in to Citizens Advice for advice and support. Each month, we release a dashboard that shows some of the trends. Our latest dashboard is due out in the next week or so, but, actually, the trend has been the same since December and February time. We have seen a drop-off in the number of people coming to us for forced installation of prepayment meters. I mean, that's good, because you would expect that now that action has been taken and firmer rules are currently in place, but they still remain at a record high, which means that there are still some of those issues working through the system. But continually, the ability to pay for prepayment meters remains at record-high levels. So, separately to this stream of work, our work in debt is predicting that this year is going to be a year of a potential debt crisis, and we see prepayment meters as being symbolic of that.\" said by Luke Young\n\"In terms of the figures that Citizens Advice had quoted, those were based on just Citizens Advice service users, so the figures actually could be a lot bigger.\" said by Luke Fletcher MS\n\"Well, in 'Kept in the dark' it was a mixture of survey data that we did, which had an estimate over Wales for how many thousands of people we thought would be on prepayment meters by the end of winter. I think, in committee in January, I quoted 4,000 extra people by the end of winter if no action was taken at that point. With our service data, our service data is those who come directly to us, so that's in the hundreds every month. For example, the number of people who were moved to a prepayment meter to pay off arrears in February was just under 100, and that number has been dropping over the months. So, that report in itself was a response to saying, 'We need a greater understanding of what's happening, because the numbers of people coming to us don't match up with all of the other bits of intel that we've got from around the system in saying that this is a big problem'. Often, what happens with Citizens Advice services is that people come to us when they're in crisis. So, we can fully expect that, had there not been action taken at the beginning of February and energy companies not having been shamed into action, our numbers would have continued rising over the next few months. But for up-to-date data from us, that should be out in the next week or so, and I will happily make sure that that's shared with the full committee.\" said by Luke Young\n\"Great, thank you. If I could just come back to the mention you made of UK Government figures around this, is it that the data they provide isn't aggregated to a Welsh level? And, if that is the case, do you think that there's a role for Welsh Government to collect this data itself?\" said by Luke Fletcher MS\n\"So, the UK Government data is responding to Grant Shapps's edict to energy companies to fess up, pretty much, and that's been released in a press release today by his department. I looked in the Excel tables that have been released so far, and there wasn't a Wales breakdown. But if you have a think about the two worst offenders, as such, there, at the top of that table were British Gas, Centrica and Scottish Power, between them responsible for just under 50,000 forced installations across the UK, you can guarantee a big chunk of those will be in Welsh households as well. So, we're asking for the figures, and certainly, anything that the committee or the Welsh Government could do to get those would be useful.\" said by Luke Young\n\"I think the committee will ask for those figures, actually. It seems to me that it would be easy to get those figures. They've got the figures already in front of them, so a breakdown for Wales shouldn't be much of an issue. Ben, you wanted to come in, and then back to Luke.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Sure. I see no reason why those figures couldn't be made available, and they would be very welcome if the committee and others could push for those.Just a note furthering what Luke just said as well, energy suppliers report on a monthly or quarterly basis under their social obligations reporting to Ofgem, and there's quite a lot of data within that that would be very useful about the levels of prepayment meters, be that traditional or smart, the levels of debt, if you are in arrears whether you're on a repayment arrangement yet or not, which are often disaggregated by nation, but not necessarily published disaggregated by nation. So, any pressure or support for more of that data to be disaggregated by nation and published would be very welcome as well, because that would give us a much clearer picture of exactly what the picture is in Wales and whether that is equivalent and comparative with what's happening in England, Scotland, and across GB, or whether, actually, there are particularly acute issues in one of those nations that are perhaps being masked by the fact that they are less severe in other nations as well. So, hopefully that's helpful.\" said by Ben Saltmarsh\n\"I'd support that, Gadeirydd. Back to you.\" said by Luke Fletcher MS\n\"Thank you for that. I can see Bethan nodding in agreement with that call, as well. Rhys, do you want to come in?\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Yes. A couple of questions following that line of questioning by Luke. To the other Luke, now: why is there this huge disparity between the energy providers?\" said by Rhys ab Owen MS\n\"Oh. In all honesty, I'm not\u2014. So, just for some clarity, you mean in the difference between the lowest and the highest who are forced to be on prepayment meters?\" said by Luke Young\n\"Yes. The level's incredible, isn't it? The level of disparity between the energy providers is incredible, but what reasons are given for that huge level of disparity?\" said by Rhys ab Owen MS\n\"I don't think we have clarity on what even their justification is at this point. I think the figures we have today are released by the UK Government after saying, 'We want to know how many people you've put on to prepayment meters', but those numbers, just looking at them as they've been released, are incredibly different. As I said, the lowest is there in the thirties and the highest two each have just under 25,000.Now, if we take back, as to what we know, we already know that energy companies weren't listening to any of the warning signs that were given off last summer into autumn and into winter. The energy regulator failed customers from the beginning and wasn't listening or taking any action, despite how urgent\u2014and many voices, including ones in this committee, were raised. And so, what we've got is this situation where\u2014. And also, it's worth saying that this was at the same time when PR people for all of these energy companies, including the worst offenders, were having multiple meetings with Ministers of different Governments, saying, 'Oh, well we've done everything that we can, we're doing everything we can to support vulnerable people'. And then, you see the evidence today, which is that two providers are responsible for just under 50,000 forced prepayment meters in that period. So, there's a huge disconnect between the PR, what has been told to Ministers, and what is actually coming out today. So, I think there are some questions there that we would ask, and maybe the committee could as well. Those energy companies have met with Welsh Government Ministers multiple times. Do these stats that have come out today bear out what they were being told in meetings in the autumn and winter?\" said by Luke Young\n\"Yes, well, I think those are certainly questions we could level to those energy providers. When you answered the other Luke\u2014Luke Fletcher\u2014about the numbers you've had in, through Citizens Advice, it just made me worry about\u2014. For people to approach you or to approach Bethan or any other organisation, they need to have some knowledge, don't they, to be able to go to these people, to these organisations. What concerns me are the people falling between the cracks, those people who don't appeal when their benefits are refused, these people who don't know how to challenge decisions. And we all know, from our professional lives, that there are loads of people who fall into these categories. What can be done to try and find these people? Because it's quite a thing for somebody to actually approach Citizens Advice, isn't it? How can we actually find and assist these people, because the energy companies won't signpost these people in the right direction, will they?\" said by ", "answer": "Rhys ab Owen MS"}

OQ58945\" said by Vikki Howells AM\n\"The Welsh Government sees the elimination of fuel poverty as a distinct priority, particularly in the context of the ongoing fuel crisis. To reflect this, in our draft budget, we have allocated more than \u00a3190 million, over the next two financial years, to interventions aimed at reducing fuel poverty across Wales.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Thank you, Minister. Even before the recent increase in the fuel price cap, we know that nearly half of all households are at risk of fuel poverty, and I'm sure that colleagues, like me, will have experienced an increase in constituents contacting them in desperate need of advice and support. Welsh Government interventions have made a real difference in supporting communities such as Cynon Valley, but, in the face of UK Government failure to reform the broken energy market, what reassurances can you give that protecting families and children most at risk of fuel poverty will remain a priority despite wider budgetary pressures?\" said by Vikki Howells AM\n\"We have a wide range of schemes available to support people who are facing fuel poverty. I mentioned, for example, the \u00a390 million that we've allocated to run a second Welsh Government fuel support scheme in 2022-23, and that's supporting people on low incomes with non-repayable \u00a3200 payments towards their energy bills. That scheme launched on 26 September, and now it's been extended to make sure that we encompass more eligible households. We've also provided around \u00a34 million for the Fuel Bank Foundation so that it can introduce a national fuel voucher, and also a heat fund scheme in Wales\u2014again, this is bespoke to us here in Wales\u2014to ensure that households that have to prepay for their fuel, including people on a prepayment meter, who are at risk of self-disconnection, and off-grid households, who have to buy bulk fuel but can't afford to top up their tank, can both benefit from this particular scheme. Since August, the Fuel Bank Foundation has brought on board 69 partners, who can now refer people to vouchers. That includes eight national partners, alongside partners in every single local authority across Wales. And we know that fuel vouchers have already benefited more than 14,000 people living in struggling households. So, it's important that people do find out what support is available to them. And I would also recommend the discretionary assistance fund, which, again, is there to support people with energy bills if they are absolutely, really struggling, and I know that all colleagues will be signposting their vulnerable constituents to that fund.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Good afternoon, Minister. I've looked at the Bevan Foundation's evidence to the Finance Committee. I'm struck by the point, and I quote,'that short-term measures to ease cost-of-living pressures are not a substitute for action to reduce poverty'.And they noted that there had been limits to investment in social housing and energy efficiency. Now, aside from the need to bring forward a new Warm Homes programme, there should be a focus on ensuring new properties are available that are energy efficient and warm. In Swansea, however, just 91 homes were completed by registered social landlords, and 18 by Swansea Council, in 2021-22. And we know already that Swansea Council is a council that's failing to meet its housing targets more generally. So, what immediate efforts are you therefore making, Minister, to close the gap in Swansea's housing, to ensure that more of my constituents are safe and warm this winter?\" said by Tom Giffard MS\n\"Well, I'd first start off, of course, by commending the work that Swansea Council is doing in terms of building council houses. They've really invested significantly in social housing and have a really strong vision for council housing across the city and county of Swansea. So, I would certainly begin by recognising that. And, of course, if the Minister for housing was here this afternoon, answering this question about the housing portfolio, I'm sure that she would be keen to point you in the direction of the optimised retrofit programme, which is there to ensure that existing housing is able to be upgraded to meet the standards required to ensure that the residents therein are not experiencing fuel poverty, and would also point to the ongoing significant funding that we do provide to support the building of social housing here in Wales. And she'd also point, I'm sure, to the commitment that we have to have 20,000 more low-energy social homes across the term of this Senedd also. So, clearly, there's a huge amount of work going on in terms of delivering on those pledges. Those pledges have become more difficult, of course, because of the ongoing cost-of-living crisis, which impacts on contractors, it impacts on the supply chain. So, evidently, there will be some challenges in that regard also.&nbsp;\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"2. What discussions has the Minister had with local government partners on how they can support residents during the cost-of-living crisis? OQ58962\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"I hold regular meetings with local authority leaders and discuss the impacts of the cost-of-living crisis, including in regard to the funding the Welsh Government is providing to enable authorities to continue their crucial support for residents.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Can I thank the Minister for her answer? She will be aware that, over the last two months, I've been raising the issue of the installation of prepayment meters and calling for an immediate ban on their installation. These meters mean the poorest residents in our society pay more for their energy, and, Llywydd, I have spoken to a number of charities who've given me evidence that court orders are being passed hundreds at a time. Now, this means that due diligence isn't being shown, so that the installation of prepayment meters is the suitable option for customers. This isn't happening. What is happening is extremely vulnerable residents in our society are being inappropriately switched. I was pleased, Minister, to see that Ed Miliband this week joined my calls for a ban on the installation of prepayment meters, but the crux of the point is we shouldn't be switching people in the middle of winter and during a cost-of-living crisis.&nbsp;Can I thank you for the support that you're offering to our local government partners, but can I ask you what more the Welsh Government can do to support local government partners when they're advising residents who have already been switched to prepayment meters?\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"I'm very grateful to Jack Sargeant for raising this this afternoon, and I do want to recognise the incredible work that Jack Sargeant is doing in terms of leading the campaign in respect of prepayment meters. Colleagues within Welsh Government are absolutely taking up that campaign on your behalf. So, the Minister for Social Justice is having a further meeting with energy suppliers on 23 January, and, again, she will be raising these concerns over reports of people, including vulnerable customers, being moved onto prepayment meters. And I know that she's made those same points in previous meetings that she's had with energy suppliers.&nbsp;The Minister also wrote to Grant Shapps on 23 December, outlining our concerns around prepayment meters, and we are taking opportunities, when we have them, with the UK Government again to make those cases. And officials are continuing to liaise with Ofgem to understand if customers who are moved onto prepayment meters are able to appeal the decision, because, as yet, we don't have clarity on that.As Jack Sargeant says, this is an issue that particularly affects the most vulnerable households. It's a real concern that almost half of social housing tenants are on prepayment meters at the moment, and, obviously, that means that many of those will be paying above what other customers will be paying for their energy. So, it is quite right for us to focus our efforts in this particular space. And, obviously, I'll take opportunities in my regular discussions with local government to ensure that they're also making the right moves in this space.&nbsp;\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Minister, surely the best way for local government to support their residents is for them to avoid hikes in council taxes. Rising energy costs due to Putin's illegal war and rising food costs as a result of the pandemic and climate change are impacting households hard. The last thing they need are excessive tax hikes. Minister, will you urge restrain&nbsp;among your local authority colleagues, and will you be prepared to cap council tax in the coming financial year?\" said by Altaf Hussain MS\n\"Well, I'd begin by saying that we absolutely don't underestimate the challenge that our colleagues in local government are facing from the inflationary pressures that they're experiencing at the moment. Because, of course, just as the Welsh Government's budget has been eroded in value, so too has local government's budget been eroded in value. But, nonetheless, we've really focused our efforts within our budget for the next financial year on public services, which is why, next year, we'll be providing unhypothecated revenue funding of over \u00a35.5 billion, and over \u00a31 billion of specific grants to support local authorities in their statutory and non-statutory services.&nbsp;That means that core funding for local government for 2023-24 has increased by 7.9 per cent, or \u00a3403 million, on a like-for-like basis compared to this financial year. So, we're doing absolutely everything that we can to put local authorities in the best possible position, but, of course, we know that the additional funding that we're able to provide doesn't meet that gap caused largely by inflation, and, as a result, local authorities will be needing to make some difficult decisions.Now, it is the case, of course, that local authorities set their own council tax levels. I know that many are consulting at the moment. The Welsh Government, as you say, does have the power to cap those, but I don't think that we're at the point yet at which we could make a decision on that, and it's certainly something that we wouldn't do lightly; it's something that we would do only in cases where those rises were palpably excessive. So, just to set out, we really do think it's for local authorities to be setting their council tax levels; it's an important part of local democracy.&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"We know the economic issues we're facing were made in Downing Street\u2014[<em>Interruption</em>.]\u2014and the incompetence of economic management in London, together with Brexit, has led to one of the biggest cost-of-living crises that many of us have ever seen. Now, this makes the Conservative Party laugh, of course, because when people are hungry, when people are cold, they really don't give a damn what's happening to those people, but, on this side of the Chamber, of course, we do. And what I would like you to do, Minister, is to use your power as a catalyst to bring people together. The two crises facing people in Wales of hunger and of heating are crises, as I said, that are not being resolved by the United Kingdom Government, and what we need to do is to step into this vacuum to bring people together, so that we can share best practice and share resources to address the real crisis facing some of the most vulnerable people in Blaenau Gwent, in Gower and across the whole country.&nbsp;\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"I would absolutely agree that one of the most important things the Welsh Government can do is to bring together parties with responsibilities for serving our citizens to ensure that our efforts are combined and that we're all focused on those things that matter most to people, and that's one of the reasons why, over the course of the autumn, we did have fortnightly meetings with our colleagues in local government. One of the standing items on those fortnightly meetings was the cost-of-living crisis, alongside another standing item, which was Ukraine. We've moved those meetings now to monthly, because the situation, at the start, did require us to come up with some new interventions, but those new interventions are now in place. But, of course, it's also a standing item now on the partnership council for Wales, which will be next meeting on 2 March, and, of course, that's a much wider public services forum, to ensure that all public and voluntary sector bodies are working in the same direction, all putting their shoulders to the wheel to support our citizens through the cost-of-living crisis. And, then, I'd also mention the cost-of-living Cabinet sub-committee that the First Minister has set up. Now, to every other meeting of that committee we invite partners from outside of the Cabinet. So, we've had the Federation of Small Businesses, for example, and the Confederation of Business Industry joining us, and we've had representatives from the voluntary sector, to ensure that all of our efforts are there together in terms of supporting our residents through the cost-of-living crisis.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Questions now from party spokespeople. The Conservative Party spokesperson, Sam Rowlands.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Diolch, Llywydd. Before I go into my question, I'm sure, Llywydd, you'd like to join me in welcoming members of the Canadian Parliament who've joined us today through the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, and have the pleasure of observing our proceedings this afternoon. I'm sure they'll enjoy it as much as we do.Good afternoon, Minister. You touched, in response to one of your questions earlier, on the provisional local government settlement, and, indeed, the 7.9 per cent increase to local authorities has been broadly welcomed by those authorities, but there are concerns a number of leaders have expressed. The Labour leader of the Welsh Local Government Association, Andrew Morgan, who, I'm sure, you know well, has said there are some tough decisions ahead for councils. The Plaid Cymru leader of Isle of Anglesey County Council, Llinos Medi, says hard cuts to local services are ahead, as a result of this settlement. Lib Dem-run Powys County Council are looking to close rural schools, and Labour-run Monmouthshire County Council consulted on cuts to leisure centre hours as well. All of this whilst our council tax payers are likely to face a further hike in their taxes. So, in light of this, Minister, like the comments from those council leaders, and as a result of your funding decisions, what further difficult decisions do you think our local councils will have to make? And what services do you think our residents will have to face being cut?&nbsp;\" said by Sam Rowlands MS\n\"I think it is important to recognise that, overall, our settlement for local government, at a 7.9 per cent increase on this financial year, has been broadly welcomed across local government. I do think that we have provided the absolute best possible settlement that we could have. We gave to local government in excess of the funding that we received in consequential funding from measures that the UK Government had outlined in its autumn statement in the fields of social care and education. We were able to do that by undertaking a very painful exercise ourselves across Government in terms of identifying areas where we could reprioritise funding towards local government and towards our health service. You'll see all of those details, of course, in the draft budget that was laid. So, I don't underestimate that local government will have to make a series of difficult decisions locally. Those decisions now should be locally led; I know that they'll be consulting with their residents as to what their residents' priorities are. But, under the circumstances, we have provided the best possible settlement. It is, of course, for the Welsh Conservatives to provide their alternative budget, which I know we were promised last year, but have yet to see materialise.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Thank you, Minister, for your response then. A key issue in regard to that funding for those local authorities is the way in which that funding is dished out. As you'll know, a significant part of funding for those councils comes in the form of grants. I believe around \u00a31.4 billion of the funding that those councils receive comes in grants. Of course, the money itself is welcome, but perhaps the direction from Welsh Government as to where and when those grants should be spent can be both restrictive and cause an administrative burden, which holds back the work of our councils. So, in light of this, Minister, how are you working with those councils to ensure there can be further flexibility on grant allocation? How are you working to see that grants go into an unhypothecated section of their funding so they can spend that money on what is best for them and best for their local residents?\" said by Sam Rowlands MS\n\"I think this is an area probably where we have more common ground, because this is a piece of work that we have been undertaking with local authorities over the past few months, at their request, to explore which areas of grant funding could potentially be moved into the revenue support grant on a short-term or permanent basis. So, that piece of work is ongoing at the moment, but we've absolutely committed to looking at that. Timescales, of course, will be important for that piece of work. But, I just want to reassure you and other colleagues who have an interest in this that our Welsh Government officials are working with officers in the WLGA and talking to treasurers across Wales to explore what might be possible.\" said by ", "answer": "Rebecca Evans AM"}
{"content": "\"So, with that, we're going to go straight into the first substantive item today, which is the scrutiny of the Environment (Air Quality and Soundscapes) (Wales) Bill; the evidence session we have with the Minister for Climate Change, Julie James. Minister, you're very welcome here today and you also have with you Helen Rowley, lawyer, Welsh Government, Rhian Williams, Bill manager, Welsh Government, and Olwen Spiller, deputy head of environmental protection, Welsh Government.Minister, if you're content, we'll dive straight into this, because we've got a lot of questions to get through in an hour, and they're very much of an LJC bent. So, it won't be the normal policy one; it'll be, 'Is this fit and proper, and are you doing the right thing legally and constitutionally as well?' So, first of all, the one we always ask whenever any Bill comes in front of us: are you satisfied that the Bill is within the Senedd's legislative competence, Minister?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Yes. Thank you very much, Chair. We are absolutely satisfied that the Bill is within the Senedd's competence, and, very fortunately, this is also the Llywydd's assessment.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Very good. And the second one again is a standard question we ask of anybody bringing a Bill forward: what discussions have you had with the UK Government in relation to the Bill, and have they made any observations?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"So, a number of things to say there. There are no provisions in the Bill that require the consent of various Secretaries of State under Schedule 7B, I'm very delighted to say; that's not the case with all of my Bills, but it is with this one.In relation to section 19 and Schedule 2 of the Bill, we've written to the Lord Chancellor, Secretary of State for Justice and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, in accordance with paragraph 11(2) of Schedule 7B to the Government of Wales Act 2006, but, unfortunately, we have not had a response to date.And then, just in general, officials\u2014Olwen in particular, actually, has met a lot with counterparts in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to discuss matters relating to air quality. I've been in interministerial working groups on air quality over a number of years now, as has Lesley Griffiths, and we've been open and transparent with all of the four Governments of the United Kingdom as this Bill has gone through about what we intend to do and what the effect of that might have across the UK, and we've got a UK air-quality common framework group, which discusses all of these things as well. So, there's been a great deal of\u2014at official level\u2014to-ing and fro-ing and sharing of information and detail and intention, and then there's been some high-level strategic and policy discussion at the interministerial groups. But in technical legislation terms there are no issues that we're aware of.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"That's really excellent. Well, it's good to hear, and you've touched there on the common frameworks thing, which is really helpful as well. So, as far as you're aware at the moment, there are no niggles, no wrinkles you need to iron out with either UK Government or any other administration?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"No. We've obviously been looking at the EU retained law Bill. I mean, that's a very movable feast, isn't it, at the moment. But, as far as we're aware, there aren't things that we need to look at. I'm reluctant to say more than 'as far as we're aware', because who knows what's going to happen with that Bill.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Yes, and that might evolve over the coming weeks and months as well.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Yes. But, apart from that, we're happy that it doesn't impact on any of the common frameworks and it doesn't appear to be controversial in any way with any of the other Parliaments.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Okay, lovely. Now then, one interesting thing here, if I could turn to the explanatory memorandum; it doesn't discuss human rights, so, can I ask you what account you've taken of human rights in preparing the Bill, what assessments have been undertaken in relation to human rights impacts of the Bill, and what was the outcome of those assessments, and why doesn't the explanatory memorandum mentioned it?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"So, we've carried out the usual suite of impact assessments, including the equality and socioeconomic duty impact assessments. Obviously, the key aim of the Bill is to improve air quality to reduce airborne pollution and its negative impacts. Inasmuch as it might impact on A1, P1\u2014article 1, protocol 1\u2014in terms of individual rights, we think that any impact on that is fair and proportionate\u2014I mean, such that it's kind of a no-brainer, if I can put it in non-legal terms. We don't think it has any conceivable issue with human rights. I'm sure the committee will come on to this, but the only impacts, really, are in changing the penalties for particular parts of the regime, and in making something a civil matter instead of a criminal one. It's very hard to see how that particularly impacts on anyone's individual freedoms.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Okay, good. Thank you. Peredur.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Afternoon, Minister. What does this Bill enable you to do that you can't do with the existing legislative framework we've got?\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"So, you are asking me more or less the same questions you asked me last time, actually. As I said before, this isn't a Bill that's an all-encompassing Bill in its own right. This is part of a suite of things that we're doing around environmental improvement, particularly in the air, and so it needs to be seen as part of a package of measures to improve air in Wales, and that's set out as part of the clean air plan. In fact, oddly enough, I have a Cabinet meeting later on today, and the noise and soundscapes plan is going to the Cabinet. It's part of a whole series of things that we're doing in the air space, I suppose it is. So, we need to make sure that, in and of itself, it sits neatly in there and makes some sense and is not making the law less accessible, for example.So, we want to change some things that we can't change without the Bill. I've already mentioned a couple of them. We want to change the sanctions regime for smoke control from criminal to civil. I've already discussed that in a number of the committees. We want to change the penalties for anti-idling in particular. And we want to change Welsh Ministers' powers in terms of road user charging schemes, which are difficult at the moment, just to make them more understandable and accessible. The Bill is very specifically aimed at doing that. We have some broad powers under the environment Act, but the broad powers are very broad, and we think they're too broad, really, to achieve what I want to achieve, which is to hold this Government's and future Governments' feet to the fire around making sure that we're proactively doing something about our air quality all the time, and, as the data changes, we have the ability to change the targeting and so on. I'm sure we'll come on to some of that later on.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Thank you. The explanatory memorandum states that:'Existing legislative requirements regarding air quality information and awareness are limited and centred around compliance with legal limits and targets.'How does this Bill change that position, and could you tell us a little bit more about how those targets are measured and taken forward?\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"Yes. So, what we're doing is we're going to put an actual duty on Welsh Ministers to promote awareness, because at the moment there's a general power rather than a duty, so there's a proactive duty. That will be one of the main changes in it. The duty will put Welsh Government Ministers under a duty to promote awareness of health and environmental impacts, as well as the actions that need to go with that to reduce or limit air pollution. We've intentionally made that a very broad duty, because we want to be able\u2014. We want to futureproof it, basically. We want to do something about PM2.5 immediately. We all know that's a problem. But there are a whole range of things we don't yet know about, because there's a whole series of data collection things in this Bill that we need to do. It gives us a power and puts us under a duty to collect various data points. And then, as I see it working, the regulations\u2014I'm sure we'll come on to how the regulations get put in place\u2014will be able to be changed on a relatively regular basis, as the data comes in and we understand what is possible and practical to implement.What I desperately don't want to do is to put targets in place that are just not achievable, so that everybody goes, 'Well, that's a great target but nobody's ever going to get there,' so nobody bothers. The legislative landscape over the past many years of all Governments in every part of the world is littered with that kind of stuff. So, what we want is to have stretching but achievable targets that can be moved downwards, or indeed upwards, if you're looking at pure air, commensurate with the data, that allows the Government to be able to hold its own feet to the fire. It puts us under a duty to report what that is, so we can't just ignore the data; we have to report the data. And then it puts\u2014. Well, I'm sure we'll come on to how the regulations get passed, but I would say that you want a rigorous scrutiny process for the regulations to make sure that those targets remain stretching but implementable. So, I think it's quite a decent ambition for the Bill, for what we're trying to do.&nbsp;\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Is the power too broad, though, or are you content that it's broad enough to capture that without being Henry VIII powers and that sort of thing?\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"No, I think it captures a range of issues that might come up that we are aware of\u2014I don't want to have a Donald Rumsfeld conversation with you but\u2014the things we're aware of that might come up, that might want to be captured in the regulations. And we want some futureproofing, don't we? I'm no scientist, Peredur\u2014you know that\u2014so, we take advice, don't we, about it. But, I don't know, say there's a hitherto unknown thing in the air that nobody's ever heard of, well, I wouldn't want to be trying to encompass that. These are things that we know are likely to be problematic and come up, and are likely to need regulations. What we don't have at the moment is any way of setting targets or milestones for them, because we don't have enough data to know what that might look like, and I don't want to set a target only to discover, when we get the data in, that, actually, it's meaningless.So, it's about trying to calibrate futureproofing, near-futureproofing, with data collection, so that we have these stretching targets, because what we all want is for us to get pollutants out of the air as fast as is possible and practicable.&nbsp;\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Okay, thank you. Can you explain why you decided against consulting on the draft Bill, particularly given the comments within the explanatory memorandum that the means of delivering some of your White Paper proposals have changed? So, what discussions\u2014? You've talked about having discussions with officials and with Westminster and other people, but no formal consultation.\" said by Peredur Owen Griffiths MS\n\"So, this is always the difficulty, isn't it, whether you want to wait for a draft Bill to be ready\u2014there's a timescale issue there\u2014or whether you think it's already clear enough. And I think, small 'p' politically, we've waited a long time for this Bill. So, I think if we'd waited until we could get a draft Bill out to consultation before we came anywhere near actually introducing it we'd have been waiting even longer. And I think we were ready, really. The draft Bill doesn't hold any major surprises. Where there is a surprise, which is on the soundscapes issue, that's been consulted on separately anyway. So, we've got a very good consultation response back on that. So, granted, it's not on a draft Bill, but we know what the public thinks about the things contained within the Bill. And the clean air strategy has been subject to consultation\u2014well, more consultation than most things need to be consulted on. I think, of all the criticisms levelled at the Welsh Government, insufficient consultation isn't usually one of them. So, I just think, in the interests of getting the Bill into the Senedd\u2014and it's pretty transparent what it is\u2014we just didn't think it was worth waiting is the real truth.&nbsp;\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Thanks, Peredur. James, before I bring you in, can I just ask\u2014? One of the things\u2014because I sit on the other committee looking at this from a policy context\u2014one of the things on your reluctance, which you've just explained the reasons why, to fix targets on the face of the Bill\u2014because they could change, there could be new air quality aspects to monitor and so on\u2014. But many of the organisations out there have said, 'Well, you could avoid that if you fixed World Health Organization on the face of the Bill.' Is that something that makes sense to you? Because they're regarded as a sort of gold standard. If you have WHO adherence, that will flex over time, in view of the latest science and changes.&nbsp;\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"I'd rather see that in the regulations, myself.&nbsp;\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Yes.&nbsp;\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Only because cherished institutions suddenly go out of favour when things are found out about them, and, all of a sudden, you've got a written-in-stone thing that attaches you to something that either has morphed out of recognition or doesn't exist or whatever. There's nothing to stop the regulations doing that. I also think there are wider issues at play than the World Health Organization. So, there are other factors playing into that. So, we might want to go further in some respects than the WHO guidelines, because, here in Wales, once we've got the data, we may be able to go further. So, I wouldn't want to be slavishly adhered to, what is, after all, a world-wide kind of standard. I have to say, at this point, I wouldn't want to be seen to be not adhering to it, but I kind of feel we might be able to do better.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Okay, interesting.&nbsp;\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"But also, just a very personal thing, I have to say, I do think putting specific organisations into a Bill is an absolute hostage to fortune.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Okay. That's great. James.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Diolch, Cadeirydd. Good afternoon, Minister. I want to talk about accessibility, if that's okay. In addition to a range of delegated powers, the Bill amends a number of older pieces of English-language legislation, such as the Clean Air Act 1993. Did you consider making provision on the face of the Bill consolidating rather than amending other legislation, so as to enable provisions to be fully bilingual, to improve the accessibility of the law for people speak Welsh in Wales?\" said by James Evans MS\n\"I think we might want to get Helen to answer a bit of this, but, as I understand it, James, because this isn't an all-encompassing Bill\u2014it's a Bill that's intended to fit into other legislation\u2014the attempt to do that in this Bill would have caused ripples across the other legislation in a way that was less than helpful and might actually make the Bill less accessible. So, I understand the sentiment of what you're saying entirely, but, as I understand it, you'd then have to look at the interaction between this and various environment Acts and so on, and then the ripples of that would start to go out and you'd start to be looking at a very different Bill. But I think Helen's done the work on it\u2014if you want to add to that.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"As the Minister says, we obviously have considered consolidation. When you're amending primary legislation, it's something that's always considered, particularly when it's English-language legislation. But, in this case, the Bill has got a particular focus, and to carve out parts of the body of environmental law and put them elsewhere\u2014our view is that that results in a partial retelling of the story about air quality, for legislation about air quality. You mentioned the Clean Air Act 1993; taking out Part 3 of that takes it out of its context with other Parts of that Act that are about air quality. So, yes, overall, the view was that it wouldn't improve accessibility of law in this instance to just take those bits out.\" said by ", "answer": "Helen Rowley"}
{"content": "\"Good afternoon, all, and welcome to this Plenary meeting. The first item on the agenda this afternoon is questions to the Minister for Climate Change, and the first question is to be answered by the Deputy Minister, and to be asked by Si\u00e2n Gwenllian.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"1. What plans does the Welsh Government have in place to help the young people of Arfon with the costs of traveling on public transport? OQ59096\" said by Si\u00e2n Gwenllian AM\n\"Diolch. One of the aims of 'Llwybr Newydd', the Wales transport strategy, is to reduce the cost of sustainable travel for everyone in Wales, including young people. We are working towards an accessible transport system across the nation and have a number of initiatives aimed at younger travellers.\" said by Lee Waters AM\n\"It's good to hear that there are plans in the pipeline, and, of course, we need to extend them and to bring new plans forward too. But in rural parts of my constituency, it's not the cost of travelling on buses that's the only problem. There's a lack of bus services in the first instance, with some communities without a way to travel at all at times, because there are no trains, metro, appropriate cycling routes, nor are there bus services at some times of the day. Now, Yr Orsaf in Penygroes is developing a project to support residents, including young people, who face barriers because of a lack of public transport in dyffryn Nantlle, with the support of the dyffryn Nantlle community transport partnership. Is community transport an area that you as a Deputy Minister want to see developing in the future, and, if this is a priority for you, how much funding has been earmarked for encouraging this kind of transport in the Government's draft budget for the next financial year?\" said by Si\u00e2n Gwenllian AM\n\"Thank you. A number of points there. I'm familiar with the work of Partneriaeth Ogwen and have visited some of their schemes\u2014they're an outstanding organisation. I was particularly struck by the scheme we've been funding them for to retrofit bicycles, to add a battery to them, which, particularly in rural areas, particularly hilly areas, is a really practical thing that we can do to help people who don't have easy access to a car or to public transport. We know that, for generations, we've been favouring investment into road schemes, for those people who have cars, and, over time, have been neglecting public transport, and we've seen usage decline, we've seen routes shrink and we've seen fares go up. So, that is one of the reasons why we're bringing forward our bus Bill, to redesign the service, and it's one of the reasons why we'll be publishing the roads review next Tuesday, to, over time, shift resource from car-based schemes to schemes for everyone.In the meantime, we do have some really difficult financial challenges, and we are seeing bus schemes being withdrawn, which illustrates the problem we have with the privatised system, because there is no strategic overview to this\u2014it's being done randomly by bus companies. And then, we have the further problem, particularly in rural Wales, where bus companies are struggling to keep their business model going, and the cost of energy is really stopping them being able to run routes, and they're not tendering for fresh services. So, we have a range of challenges facing us, but the fundamental problem is the lack of investment that we have. Because we have prioritised other things, including as part of the co-operation agreement. We could have chosen to prioritise public transport; we chose other things, and we have to do the best we can with what we've got. But, clearly, as part of our modal shift and the net-zero targets, we need to shift resource far more into public transport.\" said by Lee Waters AM\n\"I just want to echo the comments raised by the Member for Arfon, and recognise that this important focus is required on public transport, especially for rural areas, in areas like Arfon and across north Wales\u2014the region I represent, of course. Deputy Minister, I'm sure you are an avid reader of the Welsh Conservative manifesto, especially the one for the 2021 Senedd elections. In that, we as Conservatives called for free bus travel and discounted rail travel for 16 to 24-year-olds, to help our young people access education, training and employment. This of course could embed that modal shift that you and I are so keen to see, whilst also supporting our environment, so importantly. So, in light of this, Minister, what consideration have you and the Welsh Government given to this type of idea, to see that free access to buses for our young people, so we can see that modal shift whilst also supporting our environment? Thank you very much.\" said by Sam Rowlands MS\n\"Well, there's no doubt that, if we had lower prices, we'd have higher use. There are schemes right across the world, including free bus use in Normandy and elsewhere, and free bus schemes in Wales, in Cardiff and Swansea and Newport, for short periods, which have shown an uptake in usage. So, we know that, when fares drop, people are more likely to use it. There's no shortage of opportunities and ideas to increase usage and to reduce fares, and incentivise people to use public transport. The challenge always is the resource. So, I'm not sure how the Conservatives plan to fund that initiative that they had in their manifesto, but there are no easy options that I'm aware of to do just that.We do have an offer on buses where people aged between 16 and 21 have a third off an adult bus ticket, and we've been doing a lot of work, as part of our commitment to a fairer fares regime, to model what we could achieve if we had much lower bus fares. And the figures are all very encouraging; the resource is the challenge.&nbsp;\" said by Lee Waters AM\n\"2. What support is the Welsh Government providing for coastal communities facing the threat of flooding? OQ59079\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"Thank you, Janet. The Welsh Government is investing \u00a3293 million in reducing flood risk to coastal communities across Wales through our coastal risk management programme. This will reduce flood risk to over 15,000 properties, and includes, for example, more than \u00a319 million of investment in Aberconwy. An interactive map showing our investment is published online.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Thank you, Minister. I'm sure you're aware that, in 2014, our lovely sandy beach, north shore, Llandudno, received, without any notice, the dumping of some 50,000 tonnes of freshly and dirty quarried rock. At the time, it was described as 'shingle'. The town was in uproar, with residents, visitors and business owners still angry to this day. I can recall our sea washing up a white, milky froth for around three weeks, whilst this was described at the time as 'clean and inert shingle.'&nbsp;Now, in 2023\u2014well, sooner than that, actually\u2014we're now aware of the several options that have been brought forward to you to bring forward a new sea water flood defence scheme. One of the options is to implement a scheme that would replace sand, and stage 1 was even supported. I cannot overemphasise my immense disappointment that this scheme now will not be supported, as you feel that the cost outweighs the aesthetic benefits of using sand renourishment. Llandudno is the queen of the Welsh resorts, and the jewel in the crown\u2014&nbsp;\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"I'm going to have to call you to ask your question now, because I'm about to ask you to ask your spokespeople questions, of which there are three. So, can you ask your question?\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Okay. What steps, Minister, can you take? How do we move forward on this? What steps will you take to ensure that we have the right sea defences we need, but that, at some stage, we can see our sandy beach restored in Llandudno? Diolch.&nbsp;\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"Yes, thank you, Janet. So, just to be really specific, the Welsh Government have recently awarded grant funding to Conwy County Borough Council to develop a full business case for Llandudno, based on maintaining and improving the existing cobble defence on the north shore. The alternative sand option provides no additional flood benefit, at a much greater cost to the coastal risk management programme, and that's the problem. So, whilst I completely understand what you're saying about the sandy beach, the coastal risk management programme is for coastal risk management; it's not for tourist attractions and other aesthetic value. I'm not denying the value of that; I'm just saying that's not what the programme is for.&nbsp;So, if Conwy County Borough Council want to get an alternative sand option at Llandudno north shore, they really need to look for alternative sources of funding. There are some other sources of funding available, but, in all conscience, I cannot take a coastal management programme that's specifically designed to protect places from flooding and use it for a completely different purpose. So, whilst I have some sympathy with what you're saying, this is not the right programme for it. And, you can tell from the amount of money that we've invested around the coast of Wales that we are really trying to get as many properties protected from actual flooding as possible. Clearly, we do try to do that in the most environmentally and aesthetically pleasing way possible, but, in the end, it's down to how many properties we protect. So, I'm sure you'll be able to work with the council to get a better option, but not through this funding model.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Questions now from party spokespeople. The Conservative spokesperson, Janet Finch-Saunders.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Diolch, Llywydd, and thank you, Minister, Now, there is no denying that the UK Government is taking decisive action to tackle unsafe buildings. The Rt Hon Michael Gove MP has sent all developers legally binding contracts that will commit them to pay to repair these unsafe buildings. This contract will see developers commit an estimated \u00a32 billion or more for repairs to buildings that they've developed or refurbished over the past 30 years, and protect thousands of leaseholders living in hundreds of buildings across England.&nbsp;In England, the UK Government is looking to prevent developers from operating freely in the housing market if they fail to sign and comply with the remediation contract. Will you do the same for those operating in Wales who either refuse to sign or breach the terms of the Welsh Government's developers pact?\" said by Janet Finch-Saunders AM\n\"Yes, Janet, I'm very well aware of Michael Gove's various pronouncements. I very recently met with the then Minister for housing, who's now the Minister for culture, media and sport, I believe\u2014it's quite difficult to keep up\u2014to talk about this. I have asked for a meeting with Michael Gove as well, but I haven't had one since his reincarnation.&nbsp;The programme here is virtually identical in every aspect that you just outlined. We have worked with the 11 major developers in Wales. They have all agreed to sign up to the pact. The legal documentation is with them at the moment. Clearly, they're looking to see what happens in England with the legal documentation there. Our documentation is different because the legal framework in Wales is different, but, nevertheless, the import is the same. Here in Wales, though, we're going slightly faster than that. We have two of the big developers already starting to remediate. We're very, very well on with our programme of surveys. We've only a few buildings left to go. The ones that are left to go that haven't been completed for the full intrusive survey are all because we needed a complex set of agreements from various freeholders and so on, which I won't go into, but there are complex management issues in some of the buildings. The others are where a whole main road has had to be closed in order to access the building to do it, and we've had to work with the local council to figure out a traffic management scheme to be able to do that. Other than that, they're all done. The reports are all pending. We'll be able to start the remediation works as soon as we can.We're also working on a programme for what are called orphan buildings. There isn't, as far as I'm aware, a programme like this in England. We have 16 to 23 orphan buildings\u2014it does slightly depend on what you call it. An orphan building is one where there is no responsible developer, insurer or managing agent who can be held responsible, and we'll be able to take forward a programme for actually doing the remediation for them.But, I think this is the most important point here: I have always thought that the Government should step up to responsibility in this regard. We don't want to leave it to individual leaseholders to have to take legal action against the developers, which is what the English building Act does. I understand why they did that, but we don't think that's right. So, the contract here will be with us, and, if it isn't fulfilled, it will be down to us to take action against the developers. That's how it should be, in my view. I will also be exploring whether or not we can, for example, prevent builders from taking up planning consents that are existing and continuing on. That's a second phase of the work. But, I'm quite pleased that developers here have come along this journey with us.And then the last thing I'll say on this point, and it's worth bearing this in mind, is some of the buildings, some of the loudest people in the campaign\u2014and who can blame them for having a campaign; it's a horrible thing to live with\u2014some of the loudest people are in buildings where there is extensive litigation under way in which we cannot interfere. So, we are hamstrung ourselves by some of the processes ongoing. But my heart continues to be absolutely with the people living with this. And the last thing I'd say to you, Janet, is if you know anyone who really is in dire straits with this, please recommend to them the buy-out scheme, because we haven't had as much interest in that as we'd have liked, and I'm hoping to get as much publicity to it as possible.\" said by Julie James AM\n\"Thank you for that comprehensive answer, Minister, it's really appreciated. I'm sure you would agree with me that the longer it takes to resolve this crisis, the greater the mental and financial pressure for these vulnerable residents. I'm sure you'd agree with me too that we shouldn't be allowing other people to get on the back of this and actually benefit financially. The reason I'm mentioning this now is that individuals have written to me explaining, in some instances, that the service fee, since all this, for a three-bedroomed apartment has increased from \u00a32,500 to around \u00a35,000 a year. Alongside that, it's been alleged to me that as least one managing agent is charging an in-house brokerage fee for insurance, also serving section 20 notices, not carrying out the works, charging admin fees on top of the management fee, and that some have no corporate policy for proactive maintenance or for the regular checking of singular compartmentalisation of escape routes. That strikes me as an abhorrent management regime. Would you be prepared to look into this further by means of a review or some form of inquiry to establish how exactly each managing agent in Wales has responded to this cladding crisis and if there is any sign that some could actually be profiteering from this situation?\" said by ", "answer": "Janet Finch-Saunders AM"}
{"content": "\"Okay, we'll move on to the second item, and as Members will know, the committee has agreed to undertake a short piece of work on decarbonising the public sector. This work follows the publication of Audit Wales's report, which raises questions about the ability of public bodies to meet the net-zero ambition by 2030. We are starting with that, to all intents and purposes, because we're very pleased to have the Auditor General for Wales with us and representatives from Audit Wales, who will talk us through the main findings of the report, and there will be an opportunity for us as Members to raise any questions at the end of the briefing\u2014I think that will be easier. So, we will hand over to you now, but to introduce you formally: Adrian Crompton, Auditor General for Wales; Stephen Lisle, audit manager; and Sian Davies, senior auditor. So, I'll hand things over to you and your presentation. Thank you very much.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Diolch yn fawr. Bore da. Good morning, everybody. First, I would just like to say how grateful I am for this opportunity to support your work this morning. I spend a lot of my time with the Public Accounts and Public Administration Committee, but I'm always very pleased to try to support the work of other committees as well.I thought I'd start very briefly, if I may, just by explaining why Audit Wales has been active in this area at all, as it's not really traditional territory for an audit institution, but the climate and biodiversity emergencies are the defining challenges of our age, and the scale of the challenges and risks involved are such that action is needed by every part of the public sector in my view, and that's why I want Audit Wales to be active in this space. We are not technical experts, but we are uniquely placed to provide commentary on how the bodies that we audit are managing their response to the emergency, and hopefully to help you and others to hold Government and public bodies to account for their climate commitments and action. That's why I've made responding to the nature and climate emergencies one of four pillars of my work programme for the remaining years of my time as auditor general.Very briefly, as well as the report on decarbonisation that you have seen, we've recently delivered work on decarbonisation in fire and rescue authorities, flood risk management, and Steve and the team are currently looking at decarbonisation plans in each principal council. We're also working with our sister audit agencies around the UK on a piece of work, hopefully out in the summer, that will look to describe and compare net-zero approaches across the nations. Looking forward, we anticipate doing some work on active travel, on biodiversity decline, and on public bodies' responses to the Environment (Wales) Act 2016. So, if any, or all of those, would be of help to you, we'd be delighted to assist.\" said by Adrian Crompton\n\"Turning to the report that you're using as the base for your inquiry, as you know, the Welsh Government has set what it describes as a collective ambition for the public sector to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2030. My report last July looked at how the public sector is preparing to achieve that ambition. I want to stress that it was a baseline review. It looked at 48 public bodies\u2014all of the councils, health bodies, sponsored bodies, et cetera. But I want to stress that it was a high-level piece of work. It relied heavily on public bodies' opinions about their current preparedness, and about the likelihood of success in delivering the collective ambition. Nonetheless, it does, in my view, provide a valuable baseline that we're seeing is already having some positive impact.Alongside the main report, you may have seen that we've published a more detailed evidence report. We held an online event to test our findings, and we published a number of blogs to promote the work.&nbsp;The overall conclusion from our work was a pretty stark one. We found very obvious uncertainty amongst public bodies about their ability to meet the 2030 collective ambition; a very obvious commitment to carbon reduction, underpinned by lots of enthusiasm and clear intent, but we also found some significant and common barriers to progress that need to be addressed. Fundamentally, we found that public bodies need to ramp up their activities significantly, to increase collaboration, and to place decarbonisation right at the heart of their day-to-day operations and decision making.&nbsp;We also made clear that very significant long-term investment is needed, particularly for infrastructure. And while the Welsh Government is providing financial support in several ways to the public sector, the report also made clear that public bodies need to think in different ways, to repurpose existing funds, and consider how they can share costs with others.&nbsp;Because of the high-level nature of the work, I decided not to make specific recommendations, but instead to make the five broad calls for action that you've seen. I've written to public bodies asking them to publicly set out how they intend to respond to those. If I may, I'll just briefly run through those five and put a little flesh on the bones.&nbsp;The first call was for public bodies to strengthen their leadership and demonstrate collective responsibility. That means demonstrating an understanding of the urgency and the scale of the emergency. It means being bold, innovative, and sharing experience. I've made clear that I won't criticise public bodies for taking well-managed risks to address this challenge. It means also those charged with governance in the public sector providing challenge to the bodies they're responsible for, to ensure that all that can be done is being done. And as I said earlier, it means placing decarbonisation right at the heart of day-to-day business. So, in your further sessions today, and looking forward, I think it will be interesting to hear from other organisations about whether they feel that the public sector has taken on board this call for action, and what, if anything, has been done differently over the nine months since we reported.&nbsp;The second call for action was for public bodies to clarify their strategic direction, and to increase their pace of implementation. So, we saw that public bodies were very positive about the strategic direction that had been set by the Welsh Government, but they were at very different stages of implementation, and a clear need for further assistance to help translate that strategy into action. So, while there are huge competing demands on the public sector, this particular call is about ramping up that decarbonisation action across the board.One particular issue that I think it would be helpful to explore further is the fact that, while the public sector as a whole is aiming for net zero by 2030, the NHS has a separate plan that aims for a 34 per cent reduction in that time frame. This feels to me like an area where some further clarity would be helpful, because, clearly, if the NHS is going to deliver a 34 per cent reduction, we need to know what the implications are for other sectors if we're to achieve the collective ambition.The third call is around finances and the need for public bodies to get to grips with the finances they need. We found that most public bodies have not yet fully understood the financial implications of meeting the ambition. Only two bodies that we worked with said that they felt they had that full understanding. There was uncertainty about what funding would be available. The Welsh Government, as I've said, is providing support in several ways, but it's also made clear that it will be unable to fund everything.Since we reported, we know that some organisations have started the work of calculating the cost of decarbonising. So, one example would be Swansea Council, which has said it believes it will cost in the region of \u00a3190 million for it to reach net zero. We know that many other bodies have found it challenging just to get to that stage of calculating what the figure will be, let alone to work out how best to afford it.\" said by Adrian Crompton\n\"Sorry, did you say 'billion' or 'million'?\" said by Jenny Rathbone AM\n\"'Million', for Swansea.The fourth call for action was for public bodies to identify where they have skills gaps and increase their capacity to deal with decarbonisation. Public bodies are all competing with one another and the wider economy for some specialist skills, and they're doing that at a time, of course, when resources are extremely stretched across the board. So, we would suggest the public sector needs to do more to understand the specific skills and capacity that they need to explore how best they can share resources and to train and develop their own staff. Again, I'd suggest it would be helpful if the committee were able to unpick a little what different sectors are doing to address that particular challenge.The fifth and final call for action was for public bodies to improve data quality and monitoring to support their decision making. The quality of data is a theme that we comment on in lots of our work. It's a very common challenge and weakness that we identify, and it was certainly the case in this area. So, we found that data issues are a major barrier to having a shared understanding of the problem and, therefore, to be able to take the strategic decisions necessary. Public bodies have found it challenging to comply with the Welsh Government's requirements for reporting emissions data, though we would acknowledge that the Welsh Government is and has made progress in that area since we reported. In your further sessions, you may want to ask witnesses about their levels of confidence in the new reporting requirements, whether they now feel that we have a solid foundation for using data to prioritise actions and, if not, what more is needed.In terms of response to our work, I've been really pleased with the way the report has been received. The team and I receive frequent requests to speak at events and so forth, which is a positive sign in terms of adding to the impetus in this area. The feedback generally is that it's been helpful to have the baseline position set out, helpful to have five clear calls for action, and helpful for Audit Wales to be adding its weight to the need for general acceleration in activity.It's early days in terms of the responses of the public sector to our report, but it's an area of work that we'll be returning to over the next couple of years to see how things are progressing. One thing we have seen is that the report is being referenced by boards and other senior decision-making forums in public bodies as they decide what further action to take. And in terms of the Welsh Government, the response that I received from the director general for climate change and rural affairs was a positive one, welcoming the report, welcoming and recognising the calls for action, and welcoming our work in creating and supporting that momentum. But as I've said, we'll be continuing to work in this area and monitoring what the Welsh Government itself is doing over the next couple of years.Chair, I think I'll probably stop there. Thank you once again. Between myself and Steve and Sian, we will hopefully be able respond to any questions that you have. Diolch yn fawr.\" said by Adrian Crompton\n\"Excellent, thank you so much for that. I know Members will be keen to pursue particular aspects. I just wanted to ask about&nbsp;your decision not to issue recommendations, as such. I mean, the five calls, I get. Were there not certain recommendations that maybe you could have made to Government particularly, given that they have that central, driving, facilitative role? I'm just wondering whether that was something that maybe you considered.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"It was a piece of work that was wide-ranging in its focus. So, unlike many pieces of our work, it was not focused specifically on the Welsh Government. So, we looked at Welsh Government as part of it\u2014\" said by Adrian Crompton\n\"I understand that, albeit a critical part of it, I'd imagine.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Absolutely. So, the calls for action that we gave in the report apply just as much to the Welsh Government as an organisation\u2014an important organisation in its own right\u2014but, clearly, it has an added weight for the Welsh Government because of its position as system leader for everyone else. And, as I said, several of the calls that we see from the bodies that we worked with look to Welsh Government for greater assistance to support them in fleshing out the costings and so forth.\" said by Adrian Crompton\n\"There we are. Because the evidence we've received in the engagement that we've had with various organisations clearly see Government\u2014. As you say, you look at the Government as part of the public sector in the way that you've approached this, but the stakeholders that come to us say that Government really needs to do this, that and the other to unlock this work.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Absolutely. I think we would recognise that, but we would also stress that the Welsh Government alone cannot address this challenge.&nbsp;\" said by Adrian Crompton\n\"No, and I would agree.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"By definition, it's something that requires effort right across the public sector.\" said by Adrian Crompton\n\"Sure. Okay. Lovely.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"And just to add to that\u2014\" said by Stephen Lisle\n\"Yes, sure.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"\u2014we deliberately went in the calls for action for really broad ways of thinking to tackle this problem rather than specific, drilling down to nitty-gritty issues because these are such big problems that we thought needed to be addressed. So, we didn't want to diminish the big thinking behind these calls for action by having smaller, specific recommendations in this case.\" said by Stephen Lisle\n\"There we are, and with 780 organisations in the public sector, I suppose you need to take that sort of wide focus. Yes, okay. Huw, and then we'll come to Jenny.\" said by Llyr Gruffydd AM\n\"Just the big question, first of all: with all of the challenges that you've identified\u2014so, the lack of a full cost analysis across the public realm of the real cost of doing this decarbonisation, the skills, some of the granular things that you haven't touched on, I suspect, as well\u2014from your perspective as an organisation, seven years away from 2030, I guess it's the big question of can the public realm turn this around rapidly enough in order to deliver it, in your view? I just want to get a flavour of this because, seven years, it's a big mountain, can it be done?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"It is a seriously big ask. So, I think, if you look at the route-map that the Government set out, our view is that we're probably already behind where that route-map suggests that we need to be at this stage.\" said by Adrian Crompton\n\"Yes. And you touched on things like leadership as well, and the genuine leadership beyond\u2014. I suspect, what you're hinting at, is beyond the\u2014. Everybody can agree to the rhetoric around this, but then agreeing to the big changes\u2014\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Absolutely, because, taking the finance issue alone, the numbers will be extremely high; we're struggling even to put a figure on it yet, let alone to work out how that might be affordable. In my view, the sooner we do that, the sooner the political conversations and decisions that need to be taken can be addressed. It is incredibly challenging, I would say, to get to that position within the next seven years.\" said by Adrian Crompton\n\"Is there anything that you can draw on in the experience of yourselves or the UK audit bodies that can say that we've hit similar challenges before and have done it, or have near enough done it? Sorry, I keep on pushing because I'm trying to get a real sense of can we do this.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"No, not at all, and I can feel Sian is desperate to get in, so I'll come to Sian very shortly. Two things I would say. Firstly, I think the stretching nature of the challenge that the Government has set in and of its own right is a good thing to have done, because part of the challenge here is to get our heads into the sheer scale of the challenge, and targets and ambitions of this sort can often serve a valuable purpose by acting as a spur to action, and what we have seen through our report, I would say, is very definitely it has had that positive effect. That's different to whether or not we will get there; it is a positive in its own right.The second thing, to your second question, Huw, around is it possible to get there, I guess one analogy I'd look to is the response of the public sector through the pandemic. When the whole of the public sector was genuinely pulling in the same direction for a shared common goal that we all recognise, it did absolutely incredible things. Unfortunately, I think once that pressure and that clarity of purpose is taken away\u2014in the case of the pandemic, to a degree\u2014we start to splinter a little bit and go back to old ways. One of the things that I think is critical in this whole space is for there to be alignment and consistency between all of the signals that Government sends\u2014and Jenny will have heard me say this before in the public administration committee\u2014around the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) 2015 Act. It's great to have this high-level clarity of purpose, but it needs to be backed up by other policy decisions, other pieces of legislation, other spending priorities that act in a consistent and coherent way rather than acting against. Sian, do you want to\u2014? I know you wanted to come in.\" said by ", "answer": "Adrian Crompton"}

It was very much appreciated, and I know that Members very much enjoyed their visits and really appreciate the evidence that was given, so diolch yn fawr.So, I'd like to welcome the Minister this morning, Jeremy Miles, Minister for Education and the Welsh Language, and your officials with you this morning, Hannah Wharf, who is the deputy director, support for learners division, Welsh Government, and Georgina Haarhoff, deputy director, curriculum, assessment and school improvement, Welsh Government. Thank you very much for joining us this morning.So, we'll move on to questions straight away. Members have a number of questions to put to you, Minister, and I'll make a start, with quite a general one, on the pressure on staff and the system more generally. We have had some written evidence from some teaching unions that presents a picture of an education system under huge pressure and struggling to cope with the demands of implementing the new curriculum and the additional learning needs system. How would you respond to those suggestions and those issues?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Good morning. Thank you for the welcome and the opportunity to provide evidence this morning. May I congratulate the committee on the sources of evidence that it can draw on in conducting this inquiry?\" said by Jeremy Miles AM\n\"I think it's great that the committee's having such a wide range of evidence from a range of different perspectives, which is really important when we're looking at such significant reforms as curriculum reform and additional learning needs reform. It's, in many ways, a system change, isn't it? So, hearing from different parts of the system with a range of different perspectives that participants with their own responsibilities will have, certainly, we find it very useful as a Government. So, I'd just congratulate the committee on that approach.I think there is a wealth of evidence, whether from Estyn, from evidence that we've commissioned by way of the early insights and a range of other sources, that gives us a good picture of how the system is responding, both to curriculum reform and additional learning needs reform. I would say introducing reforms at this scale is a system change. It's also a culture change, isn't it? So, clearly, that is going to be challenging in many respects. If the concerns that you're identifying in the letter from teaching unions relate to pressure on staff, we have an ongoing discussion with partners in the teaching unions and the education unions more broadly on how we can make sure we're constantly looking at the question of workload. We have committed to the reforms that we're undertaking, and those reforms will continue, but there will be workload implications in the aggregate, and we, obviously, have a process for working through those with teaching unions and local authorities as well, and I dare say we'll come on and talk about some of the specifics. We've got a specific piece of work, for example, in relation to the workloads of additional learning needs co-ordinators, so by the end of this year we hope to have a body of work that we can draw on in relation to that. We've also provided more flexibility in relation both to curriculum reforms, so providing secondary schools with the option of starting this academic year or the next academic year, and providing more time for additional learning needs transition and, obviously, significant funding. So, there are many ways in which we've sought to mitigate some of those pressures. But let's also remember that the reforms, particularly in the context of curriculum reform, also mean taking away a lot of other burdens that previously were in place. So, I think it's important to see the whole picture.\" said by Jeremy Miles AM\n\"Thank you, Minister. You talked about the two reforms\u2014ALN reform and the curriculum reform. Do you think that one faces more significant challenges than the other?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"I suppose the common set of challenges that both strands of reform have faced, clearly, is the impact of the pandemic, which obviously has affected preparation for reform, and to the extent that we're still living with the consequences of aspects of it, that is still a feature of school life, isn't it? You will remember the discussion we had when I was making the decision about whether to continue with the pace of curriculum reform or postpone that, and you will also remember the discussion about the experience during COVID reflecting many of the principles of the curriculum. So, that was very much a live set of judgments at the time.I guess, in terms of what the respective challenges are, one set of reforms, I suppose, will touch the experience of every single learner, and one will touch the experience of a large cohort, but not every single learner, and they're working to different time horizons. So, in that sense, the challenges are, I think, slightly different. But it is important that we're doing the two together. I think that brings many, many benefits.\" said by Jeremy Miles AM\n\"So, you think, on balance, doing both of these reforms at the same time has more advantages than disadvantages?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"I do, for the following reason: I think they're both premised on the idea of an inclusive education system where the individual needs of every learner are reflected in teaching and learning. I think that is a common, underlying principle for both strands of reform, and, in designing the curriculum at a school level, a school will understand the needs of its cohort of learners in a way that will better enable that school to identify additional learning needs. So, there are complementarities in the design of the two reforms. From the early insights work that we've done, which we've shared with the committee, there is evidence that school leaders, in particular, feel that there is much more opportunity through the Curriculum for Wales to be able to address some of those questions around identification of particular needs that pupils have.But, on the other side, just to complete the picture, there are clearly challenges that come with doing the two together. There's more reform for the system to respond to. But we hear pretty consistently from committees, from stakeholders and others, of the importance of not taking a siloed approach to what we are doing. I think that it is possible to mitigate the pressures that come from doing the two together. I have outlined some of them already and I'm happy to talk more about those, Chair.\" said by Jeremy Miles AM\n\"Thank you, Minister. I'm sure that we will come on to some more points later on. What consideration have you given to the impact of the curriculum and ALN reforms on disadvantaged groups and those with protected characteristics? For example, how fully are schools complying with their public sector equality duty under the Equality Act 2010 in the way that they are implementing those reforms?&nbsp;\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"So, the design of the reforms has, at its heart, identifying the needs and meeting the needs of each individual learner, and that will encompass learners with particular protected characteristics. But also, I passionately believe that the Curriculum for Wales is a really important tool, if you like, in how we get to grips with meeting the needs, particularly, of disadvantaged learners and closing the attainment gap. Speaking personally\u2014and I am sure that others, I hope, will reflect this from their own experience as constituency MSs\u2014I speak to heads who have high levels of free-school-meals eligibility, for example, in their schools and they are very passionate about the potential of the curriculum to address the needs of disadvantaged learners in particular.That's at the design end, but I think that your question was really about the implementation and how we make sure that the delivery of it meets the needs of the cohorts that you talked about. I suppose that what I would say on that is that we are, as I have mentioned to the committee previously, working on a programme of national monitoring, which will be a sample-based analysis of progress in delivering the curriculum across Wales. That will look at a range of impacts, but that will include the experience of disadvantaged learners and the experiences of learners with particular protected characteristics, as the curriculum is rolled out.At the moment, we are at the stage where we are configuring the specification and developing how that will look. We will want to pilot that. You mentioned the EHRC in your question. We would want to work with them on the specification for that, so that we can capture the points that they have very recently made in relation to the public sector equality duty as well.\" said by Jeremy Miles AM\n\"Brilliant. Thank you. I will just bring in Laura Jones now. Laura.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. Just while we are talking about putting the two things into schools at the same time, it has, in my experience of visiting schools, obviously caused a great deal of pressure for our staff there. Minister, do you believe that there are enough staff in our schools to be able to cope with the added pressures of doing both at the same time, particularly the ALN reforms, which in the round I see as good?With that added pressure on the needs\u2014. There are needs of pupils in classes right now that are not being met because identification is taking too long. The funding isn't following in time for those children to get what they need. The outcome of that, of course, is that schools need more staff, but the money just isn't there on stretched budgets. How would you go about rectifying that?\" said by Laura Anne Jones AM\n\"Well, there are budget pressures in schools as a consequence of inflation and the cost-of-living pressures. We have discussed this in other contexts, and I've made it clear that we have a commitment as a Government to prioritise education spending and school budgets, which we have. But there are pressures on public sector funds right across Wales\u2014in fact, right across the UK\u2014as a consequence of choices being made by the UK Government, principally, about the level of public financing.On school budgets, in particular, what we have been able to do is increase the funding that has gone to local government, which, as you will know, is responsible for allocating that funding at a school level. Where my portfolio, my budget, is able to make a direct contribution in relation to that\u2014so, the two most obvious examples are the pupil development grant and the Recruit, Recover and Raise Standards funding\u2014we have either kept that at a steady level or increased it, where, obviously, in other parts of the UK, that has been reduced.But that is not to underestimate the pressures that schools are under. I know that schools are talking to their authorities about how they can use some of the reserves that they have had for short-term pressures. But I just want to reiterate that I absolutely recognise that that is a short-term solution only. But the basic question that you have is: are there enough staff in the system to deliver the reforms? And the answer to that is, 'Yes, there are.' And the funding that I've made available specifically for additional learning needs has, in fact, led to more recruitment in that space. But as I say, it's a very ambitious programme of reform, and I don't underestimate that that can, of course, be challenging.\" said by Jeremy Miles AM\n\"Okay, thank you, Laura. Questions, then, from Sioned Williams. Sioned.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. Good morning, Minister. I have a few questions about curriculum reform in general. We've heard some concerns in the evidence received that there is variation in pupils' experiences as a result of the approach to the Curriculum for Wales. So, I'd like to ask what kind of validation or monitoring takes place of the curriculum that schools have been responsible for designing and adopting, and particularly given that some schools have not met the requirement to publish a curriculum summary.\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"Well, there is an element of variation, but that is inherent in any education system, and it's good thing that you have that variation. Having variation of standards is not a good thing, but having a variation of experience certainly is. I don't want to see\u2014and I assume that the Member doesn't want to see\u2014some sort of cookie-cutter curriculum where the same thing is enforced everywhere. The whole point of the curriculum is to empower teachers, leaders and schools to design a curriculum that works for the cohort of pupils that they have and reflects the community and the <em>cynefin of </em>that area, so that's a very important element of how we have designed the curriculum.But the curriculum isn't a free-for-all; we do have a national structure\u2014it is a curriculum for Wales. We have one Act, we have one framework, one series of statements of what matters, one code, one inspection body, and the new Estyn guidance in terms of school inspection does demonstrate how important it is to look at how successful schools are at designing a curriculum that is broad, but also balanced. So, all of that work is part of the national approach.We have a national system of national networks; people come from all parts of Wales to participate in those. We have a national system in place in terms of professional learning. We have a new website since the end of last year, which gives a teacher in any part of Wales access to content by consortia in all areas of Wales and that's for the first time. So, that national picture is very important.One of the elements I want to emphasise is how important collaboration between schools is\u2014the clusters. It's hugely important that that works successfully on the ground. I was at a school in Cardiff last week looking at how one of the clusters there was working on an element of the curriculum, and it was quite inspiring, if I'm honest. There was very good strong collaboration and co-operation, and that's an important part of this to ensure consistency whilst also providing that empowerment for the profession.\" said by Jeremy Miles AM\n\"Yes, and clearly, it's that consistency of quality that's important, isn't it, rather than being uniform?&nbsp;\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"Exactly.\" said by Jeremy Miles AM\n\"But, one thing that's arisen in that respect is that, yes, there is really good collaboration working in some areas, but some of the evidence received suggested that perhaps that support wasn't consistent, for example, with co-operation in the cluster, or with the consortia. And one of the things that came from the evidence received was also about professional learning\u2014that was brought up as a point of concern; that there were different pressures and that schools were in different positions in terms of financing, some had fewer teachers, and there were gaps in terms of recruitment, and difficulties in that regard. And we've also seen a survey from the NASUWT membership indicating that teachers receive 11.5 hours of professional learning on average, compared to 14 hours in England, despite this being a stated priority in Wales, and of course, in terms of this level, you mentioned there the importance of professional learning. Do you therefore agree that there are concerns in that area of professional learning at the moment?\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"Well, it doesn't strike me as being an obvious problem. I think you said 11 hours, did you?\" said by Jeremy Miles AM\n\"Eleven point five hours in Wales, according to the NASUWT survey of their members in terms of professional learning per year, as compared to 14 hours in England.\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"I don't know how many individuals have responded to that, so it's difficult to know how much weight to place on that result. You may have those figures, but I don't know how many individuals were involved in that survey. That's important in terms of how much weight you can give it. But we have more INSET days than there are in that 11 hours, so I don't really see how that could work, if I'm entirely honest. We have tried to find ways of adding to the system's capacity in terms of professional learning. So, since 2019, there is an additional day, so there are six INSET days now, and we will continue with that for the next three years, so that is substantially higher than in other parts of the UK.I've already mentioned the investment that we've made in professional learning. I think, last year, we spent \u00a336 million on that, and that was mostly spent at the school level, so the investment is very substantial indeed. The challenge now, if I can be entirely honest, is not so much of how much is available, but how easy it is to access and validate that professional learning. So, there is work ongoing\u2014I've discussed this with the committee in the past\u2014to make sure that it's easy to access what you need as a teacher, and also there's a validation process happening at the moment, some sort of kitemarking, if you like, so it's easy for you to find what you're looking for quickly. But it is certainly a priority that we invest in professional learning.\" said by Jeremy Miles AM\n\"Sorry, Sioned, just to come in on that. Just to say that the survey and the results are published in the NASUWT's written evidence to us. If you want to have a look at that and interrogate that any further, you'll be able to find that there. Sioned.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair.\" said by ", "answer": "Jeremy Miles AM"}
{"content": "\"For item 2 on today's agenda, we move to our first evidence session on P-06-1307, 'The Welsh Government should commit to the adoption of the maintenance of new housing estates by local authorities'. We're very pleased to be able to have Hefin David, the Member of the Senedd for Caerphilly, in front of us today. Hefin, we invited you to come to our committee to talk to this petition; you are a noted campaigner within what's quite a tricky area, and it's certainly on devolution's jagged edge, if you like. We're aware you proposed a Bill to the Senedd back in 2018, so we wanted to use this as a scoping exercise to see what the issues are and how they can be tackled. If I start off with my first question to you, perhaps you could update the committee on how you first became aware of the issues that we face, and also, maybe, cite some examples of the particular work that you've done as the Member of the Senedd for Caerphilly.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair, and thank you to the committee for giving me this unique opportunity to sit on the other side of the fence and answer questions, rather than ask them. I really appreciate the opportunity to do so. I've been campaigning on this issue since 2016, since I was first elected, when residents raised with me the fact that they were paying council tax and estate management charges for the upkeep of their estate. I know Rhys as well has raised it in the Senedd Chamber, and other Members, I'm sure, have these places in their constituencies.It was residents in Cwm Calon in Ystrad Mynach who raised it with me. Funnily enough, we've just had a liaison committee with Redrow and Caerphilly council this afternoon to go through some of the issues that are ongoing there, which have been ongoing for many, many years. So, that was when I first got involved. There are about 600 houses in Cwm Calon that are affected. There are two other estates in my constituency: there's Cefn Mably, which is just on the border with Newport, which is a gated-type community of only 40 to 50 houses, and there is another estate that has just been built in Hendredenny, which we opposed. We didn't want it built, we thought it was in the wrong place, but it's built now. That's a Redrow estate of about 200 plus houses, and they'll have estate management charges on those.The three processes are managed quite differently. In Cwm Calon in Ystrad Mynach, it's an estate management company that was appointed by Redrow when the estate was built 15 or so years ago, perhaps a bit more than that, called Meadfleet. Redrow and Meadfleet's relationship is not good, and Meadfleet are responsible for the upkeep of parts of the green areas of the estate. In Cefn Mably, it's actually the residents themselves who run the management process. It's a lot easier when there are only 40 or 50 houses. A lot of those people are directly engaged in that kind of work as well, so they appoint their own people to do the upkeep. The other one is Hendredenny, which is now going through the process of appointing the management company, or has appointed the management company, but they weren't able to tell me today who the company was, so I do need to look into that. I'm expecting people to be starting to raise concerns with me personally. I wouldn't recommend buying a house on an estate that has estate management charges.Just to go back to the work that I did, we raised it with the Welsh Government in the previous Senedd term, and the Welsh Government did a call for evidence as a result of that, which I think you've probably got in your evidence packs, 'Estate management charges on housing developments: call for evidence'. The summary section, just as a background to this issue, is really instructive. It says, and I didn't know this until the evidence was done:'Collectively, the 4 management companies who responded manage a total of 164 housing estates in Wales incorporating more than 11,000 properties. One management company indicated plans for the future management of 24 new estates incorporating 4,000 properties'.So, it's a growing problem. But the interesting thing from residents who responded was that'72% of respondents indicated their properties were built between 2010 and 2020. Only 1 respondent\u2019s property was built before 2000.'So, this is a new issue that is growing; I think that's what's demonstrated by this. If you want a reason of political motivation for what's happening, I'll draw your attention to Barnet council back in 2009. They started talking about EasyJet councils, where you pay the basic council tax and then any additional services you pay on top. I don't think it's any coincidence that this kind of process began around the time\u2014. Joel, I apologise, I'm not being critical politically, but it was the time of the incoming Conservative Government in 2010 that these things\u2014and Lib Dems\u2014started taking off. I do feel that this was part of the political culture of the time. It's worth noting that Barnet have just decided to end that outsourcing of services this year. So, it is an issue that is about 10 years old and is growing.\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Thank you for that, Hefin. You\u2019ve raised some good points for us to consider as a committee, perhaps away from this meeting. I\u2019ll bring in Joel James now.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"I'm happy to take a political challenge on some of the things I\u2019ve said.\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Oh, yes. Thanks, Chair. Apologies, I\u2019m full up with cold, so I\u2019m speaking quite croakily, I suppose. Like Rhys, I\u2019ve got experience of this within my ward from when I was a counsellor. There\u2019s an estate there, built within the timescales that you said, and that\u2019s caused a few issues there. I note that the petition is asking for the local authorities just to adopt them, straight up adopt them, but in the report that you highlighted, the Minister at the time said it\u2019s just not as simple as that. I was just wondering what your view on that is, and what other solutions there are. Because from my experience, the difficulty is that everyone who lives on that estate has entered into a legal agreement to pay that fee. Everyone would then have to come out of that legal agreement. With the estate in my ward, the council have said, \u2018We will adopt it, but we want in excess of \u00a3100,000 from you to do that, because of the circumstances.\u2019 I just wanted to get your views on that, really.\" said by Joel James MS\n\"I think it\u2019s absolutely right that there are these complications. I think it\u2019s what economists call 'opportunity costs of action', politicians call 'unintended consequences', and people see as unfairness. That\u2019s the whole issue around it. The key problem with taking retrospective action\u2014so that means looking back at what has been taken over by estate management companies and getting local authorities to adopt retrospectively\u2014is that you\u2019re going to be unloading a load of local authorities in Wales with extra cost that they didn\u2019t budget for and hadn\u2019t seen coming. So, if we said\u2014how many did I say\u2014the extra 11,000 properties, 164 housing estates, that\u2019s going to be a lot of money that local authorities will have to find, and that is a challenge. It's probably unfair to expect local authorities to take that burden on retrospectively.The other issue, of course, is that many housing companies, particularly the smaller ones, would not be operating any more. So, the commuted sums that would be required, which the developers would pay the local authorities to take on, might not be available. Because there should be a commuted sum involved. That wouldn\u2019t be around any more. And even where there are larger companies like Redrow, they would have already passed them to estate management companies who are not going to be willing to dispose of an asset that they\u2019re making money from.So, retrospective action is really, really difficult. In fact, there was a petition that was given to the UK Government in 2018, and that was very similar to this petition, except a bit stronger. That petition was to 'Require local authorities to adopt all Public Open Space and roads on estates'. The UK Government responded that they were minded to look into this as an issue, and they have, and they\u2019ve got a Bill coming up that I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll discuss. But this is what the UK Government said:\u2018A requirement on local authorities to adopt public open spaces on private estates would constitute a significant new burden and arrangements already exist to provide for upkeep in a way that can be tailored to the nature of individual developments.'So, the UK Government is not minded to look at that respectively, nor proactively in the future either. There was quite an interesting statement in the letter from the Minister to you, though, about this petition. This petition, the one that came to you, was actually not quite as strong. It said:&nbsp;'with the current cost of living crisis we believe that the Welsh Government should support residents on estates like The Mill by encouraging and facilitating the adoption of maintenance by local authorities and to remove these punitive charges.'It doesn't go as far as that earlier petition. Perhaps they've looked at that and have seen what the response was. There was an interesting response from the Minister in the letter of 1 November to you as a committee, though, in which the Minister said\u2014. I'd better look at the letter to make sure I get the wording right; what did I do with the letter? Here it is. The Minister said that she's going to consider bringing legislation forward, and this will include'consideration of placing a duty on local authorities to adopt communal infrastructure in return for an appropriate payment from the developer.'That's quite an interesting statement, because it goes further than the UK Government are willing to go, but it also has some problems as well, which I'm happy to explore if you want me to.&nbsp;\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Thank you, Hefin. Joel, any further follow-ups?\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"No, that's it.\" said by Joel James MS\n\"I'll come back to that.\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Yes, I'm happy to. Rhys ab Owen.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Diolch yn fawr, Cadeirydd. You'll be aware, Hefin, that the UK Government are proposing to deal with a second phase of legislation later this year. What's your view on that second phase of legislation?\" said by Rhys ab Owen MS\n\"That legislation actually looks pretty interesting. It doesn't do what the petitioners have been asking for. It's not doing that, it's not requiring the adoption of open space. What the legislation is doing is looking at the second-order issue, which is the big issue people are facing, and that's the management of estate companies. At the moment, it's a wild west. If we wanted to, as a committee, we could get together\u2014. We'd probably have to resign from politics first, but we could get together and set up an estate management company and we could run it on an estate, just do that. And I think surely there should be some form of regulation, some form of standard that needs to be met before these companies operate. What's often happening is that people in the know, who used to work for developers, are starting these companies and going and making money from it because they know that's easier money than working for a developer.The UK Government wants to introduce a right for freeholders to apply to a tribunal where they feel the fees are unfair. That doesn't exist currently. The UK Government also intend\u2014and this is the one that really does make a big difference\u2014to repeal section 121 of the Law of Property Act 1925 to ensure homeowners are not subjected to unfair possession orders as a consequence of unpaid estate charges. That is significant, because I'm getting people showing me county court judgments they've received because they've refused to pay their fees. What the UK Government plans to do is remove that right from estate management companies to impose against properties. Because at the moment, you can't sell your property if you haven't paid your fees, and you're likely to have a county court judgment against you if you refuse to pay your fees. That's terrifying for residents. This would remove that, which I think would be really significant and welcome.&nbsp;The other problem, of course, is that there's no cap on fees. Estate management companies can charge you whatever they want. I said to Meadfleet\u2014. I've got to say that Meadfleet are not a good example of an estate management company. They refused to engage with our community group; they took themselves off in a huff when I complained about them on ITV news. They're a very, very poor organisation. They are refusing to\u2014. I was having a go at them now and I've lost my train of thought. The issue is that they can charge whatever they want. When I said in a meeting to Meadfleet, with them at the one community association they attended, that we planned to cap the charges, they said, 'In that case, we'll just raise our fees to whatever the cap is. So, if you cap it at \u00a3300, we'll raise all our fees to \u00a3300; if you cap it at \u00a3500, we'll raise all our fees to \u00a3500. We'll just do that', from the average, which in the petition is between around \u00a3150 and \u00a3200 at the moment. So, that's the attitude of estate management companies if you cap the fees. I think they need controlling, they need greater regulation, and that wild west is a problem.&nbsp;\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Just to come back to you on that point, did the experience you're talking about there with Meadfleet\u2014? The committee may be minded to speak to some of these companies afterwards and ask direct questions to them\u2014\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Yes, if they're willing to speak to you.\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"\u2014and we can make that point.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"The better ones should.\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"The experience you were talking about, did that happen, did your committee cap fees, or not?\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"No, it would be the Government that would be introducing the legislation to cap the fees. At the moment, there is no recognised cap, so the Government would have to introduce the law to do it. But, also, the other thing that the estate management companies can do is, where they're charging fees on estates, they can move the charges from other parts of their portfolio. So, you're paying for your grass to be cut in Cwm Calon, but if they're making a loss elsewhere or they've got overhead charges from another estate, they can charge it across their portfolio. It doesn't have to relate to the work that's being done on your estate. That's a massive issue. So, you could be living on one estate and paying for another, effectively.\" said by Hefin David AM\n\"Sorry, Rhys.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Of course, I agree that greater regulation of management companies is very important, but, really, isn't the real issue the fact that we have management companies in the first place, and we shouldn't? Leasehold was a massive problem in Cardiff in the 1970s, and across the United Kingdom. We thought we'd dealt with it, and now with the figures you're quoting to us\u2014the huge increase since 2010\u2014things are only going to get worse, and things are only going to get worse for residents. So, looking at the letter that you quoted earlier from the Minister about proposed reforms from Welsh Government, the truth is that they don't go far enough.The Minister quotes what Tirion does in the Mill estate\u2014empty bins, flood defences, park\u2014but the truth is, you go a two-minute walk from the Mill estate and there's the Sanatorium park estate, which was built 10 years earlier, but has been adopted by the council. So, the bins there, the park there, the grass there, are all cut by the council. And in the Mill, of course, they pay the same amount of council tax as the Sanatorium gardens residents do. So, do you agree with me that the proposals by Welsh Government don't go far enough? I appreciate that there will be difficulties with doing it retrospectively, but the truth is that, (1) we need to stop it, and (2) we've got to look at it retrospectively.\" said by ", "answer": "Rhys ab Owen MS"}

Will the Minister make a statement on the creation of corporate joint committees? OQ59820\" said by Ken Skates AM\n\"Corporate joint committees are established and have statutory duties to undertake regional transport and land use planning. CJCs also have a broad economic well-being power. Councils can choose how they will use their CJC to work together to drive economic development based on their own regional aspirations and ambitions.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Thank you, Minister. It's well known that local government in Wales has been better protected than elsewhere in the UK over many years and that councils really have risen to the challenges of COVID, austerity, preparing for Brexit and the cost-of-living crisis. Of course, the creation of corporate joint committees gives us an opportunity to strengthen and empower local authorities even more through regional working. So, what responsibilities and budgets is the Welsh Government considering devolving to CJCs?\" said by Ken Skates AM\n\"I'm very grateful for the question and also to Ken Skates for recognising that councils in Wales have been better protected over many years in Wales, as compared to their counterparts in England. And you can really see that I think in the response to, as Ken Skates said, what they were able to deliver during both the pandemic but also now in the cost-of-living crisis, and they do go above and beyond, every day, to serve their communities.But as things stand, it is the case that CJCs are relatively new, so, it\u2019s really important that they really focus on their initial responsibilities, particularly in terms of economic development, transport and land use planning, and to capitalise on the interdependencies between these functions.Outside of those responsibilities, I absolutely think that there is space for local authorities to make the case to the Welsh Government for further powers to be devolved to them. I do think that, at the moment, the focus has to be on making CJCs work\u2014they\u2019re still very new\u2014but we\u2019re obviously open to those conversations. In the first instance, I would suggest that those conversations are opened between the local authorities and the portfolio Ministers, but I see my role very much to support those conversations and to facilitate and enable any further powers to be devolved. But, as I say, in the first instance, it really is about making CJCs work and getting them on a strong footing for the future.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Speaking at Stages 3 and 4 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Bill, I stated that, given their role in terms of regional infrastructure and economic development, the ability to allow Welsh Ministers to mandate the creation of corporate joint committees undermines the internal devolution and local partnership working established in areas by bodies such as the North Wales Economic Ambition Board\u2014a coalition involving both Governments, all six north Wales councils, business and academia.However, whilst acknowledging that principal councils have a wealth of experience in delivering economic functions, including at a regional level through, for example, the city and growth deals, the Minister stated that she was hoping that regions will transition their current regional arrangements into the corporate joint committees once established. How, therefore, would you respond to the concern expressed in north Wales that the corporate joint committees are instead replicating and disempowering the work of the North Wales Economic Ambition Board, now named Ambition North Wales, when, instead, the former Minister for economy and transport here has now joined his voice with theirs and mine in calling for internal devolution to a transport body in north Wales\u2014[<em>Interruption</em>.] Hello? [<em>Laughter</em>.]\" said by Mark Isherwood AM\n\"Sorry, I must stop laughing. I'm not laughing at either you, Mark Isherwood, nor you, Rebecca, but at\u2014. Yes. [<em>Laughter</em>.] Minister, to respond.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"So, rather than undermining joint working and regional working, I do think the CJCs rather facilitate it and they are a tool for local authorities to be using. But in respect of the specific point about aligning with city and growth deals, at the moment, South Wales East CJC is commencing its lift and shift exercise to formally move their city and growth deal arrangements into the CJC by the end of this financial year. And the other CJCs have indicated that they will bring their city and growth deal governance arrangements alongside other strategic planning for the region. The timescales for that do remain unclear at the moment, but they are discussions there that we continue to have. But I do recognise the underlying point, really, about the importance of coherence across the structures.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"2. What discussions has the Minister had with the Minister for Climate Change regarding funding public transport grants for local authorities in South Wales West? OQ59845\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"I hold regular discussions with the Minister, which include discussions on transport. Bus support this year has already included over \u00a34.2 million for Swansea Council on behalf of the south-west Wales region. In 2023-24, we have also provided local authorities with \u00a35.5 billion to spend on delivering key services.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Thank you for that response, Minister.\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"Every day, local authorities work hard to deliver high-quality services to residents throughout all of our communities. Aside from financial support they receive through the revenue support grant, local authorities rely heavily on a wide number of specific grants that help fund a wide range of projects or services. The bus services support grant, for example, is one of these regular packages of support that local authorities receive, which help them ensure the delivery of commercially unattractive bus routes. A few weeks ago, I received a copy of a letter from the leader of Neath Port Talbot Council to your colleague the Deputy Minister for Climate Change stating that quarter one allocation had not been received and that the council is having to pay out despite not receiving the required funding. I'm sure you'd agree with me that delays in funding allocations are unwelcome at the best of times, let alone during a difficult time for the bus industry and with all the existing challenges facing local authorities. So, can I ask, Minister, what work is being done across Government departments to simplify the grant system and ensure that there are no unnecessary delays to stop money getting to where it's needed most? Diolch.\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"I'm very grateful for the question, and I will make sure that I get a copy also of the letter that you describe and have the opportunity to discuss it with my colleague. But I think the overall point is very important, and it's really about reducing the administrative burden to local authorities. That's one of our programme for government commitments, and we've been undertaking a quite significant piece of work in partnership with local authorities, exploring how we can go about reducing that administrative burden.When our officials talked to treasurers and others in local government, they were really clear that the No. 1 big thing that they thought was causing administrative burdens was the administration of grants. We have thousands of grants going out from the Welsh Government, so we've undertaken a piece of work looking to see, really, how much we can move into the RSG. Now, it won't be appropriate for every particular and single grant, but every Minister now is working through the grants that they provide to local government and exploring to what extent they can be moved into the RSG, making sure that, whilst doing that piece of work, they also undertake impact assessments to ensure that we're not inadvertently creating problems for the people who are most vulnerable and who need that support the most. So, I absolutely recognise the points made, but I just want to reassure colleagues that reducing the administrative burden is a major piece of work and we are making really good process progress on it.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Minister,&nbsp;the announcement of the bus transition fund is welcome, but as the Welsh Local Government Association&nbsp;points out, it won't save all bus routes. Many of the routes facing cancellation cover the more rural parts of Wales and are a vital lifeline for the most disadvantaged, particularly the elderly. Our constituents without access to a car now risk isolation and further financial hardships as they have to depend upon taxis to conduct essential travels. Minister, what steps can the Welsh Government take to ensure that where bus routes and unviable, public funding will be made available to fund and perhaps incentivise alternatives to buses?\" said by Altaf Hussain MS\n\"The bus transition fund is due to commence on the twenty-fifth of this month as we move away from the bus emergency scheme, which was developed during the pandemic and which comes to an end on the twenty-fourth. The new fund, developed collaboratively with local authorities, Welsh Government, Transport for Wales and the bus industry will replace the previous scheme and will provide that immediate support to bus operators in Wales. But I think that the thing that will really make the difference for the longer term is our approach to addressing the issues in the bus industry that were caused by the deregulation of the industry back in the 1980s that made the driver, really, of the work in the bus industry to be looking for those profitable routes rather than the routes that are most needed and serving the people who most rely on bus services. So, I think that piece of work will be really important, but what we really need to be doing also is supporting the bus industry so that we get from where we are now to where we need to be in the future without damaging the services that are available to people.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Questions now from the party spokespeople. Conservative spokesperson, Peter Fox.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Diolch, Llywydd. Minister, we all know that families are being hit by the rising costs of living, but many small and medium-sized enterprises are also faced with the rising cost of doing business. As we all know, the&nbsp; tourism and hospitality industry faced two years' worth of restrictions as a result of the COVID pandemic. While many of those restrictions were necessary to protect the people of Wales, it's important now that we help restore the damage done to the sector, and it is clear that Wales is not doing enough to appeal to an international market, with only roughly 2.5 per cent of international holidaymakers visiting Wales in 2019. With that in mind, can the Minister clarify what assessment the Welsh Government has made of the impact of their tourism tax on SMEs in Wales, because surely we should be making sure that Wales's tourism industry is competitive with other parts of the United Kingdom as well as the rest of the world?\" said by Peter Fox MS\n\"Well, I want to begin, really, by recognising that point about the impact that the pandemic had on small and medium-sized enterprises, and particularly, in places, on the tourism industry, and that's why, because of the way in which we managed our budget during the pandemic, we were able to support businesses across Wales with a more generous package of support than that which was available elsewhere in the UK. I think that that is important for us to continue recognising.We've also put in place a generous package of non-domestic rate support for this financial year, and indeed, as part of the draft budget, I confirm that we will be providing a rate support package for the next two financial years, costing over \u00a3460 million, and that is, in fact, in addition to our permanent rate relief schemes that provide around \u00a3240 million of support each year. So, the support that we do provide the business sector is very significant in relation to non-domestic rates.In terms of the visitor levy, of course, we are still working through the detail, because some of the things are currently unknown\u2014for example, we haven't yet decided at what point we would pitch the visitor levy, so until we do that, there are certain things that we can't calculate as a result of it. But the visitor levy really is there to be a tool for local authorities to decide whether or not it's something that they want to use, and the aim is that it will support sustainable tourism in those local areas. So, this really is about supporting the local tourism industry and providing those conditions that give tourists a great experience when they come to Wales, so that they want to keep on returning.\" said by ", "answer": "Rebecca Evans AM"}
{"content": "\"Item 2 on today's agenda, new petitions. Item 2.1, P-06-1309, 'The Welsh Government should hold a referendum before expanding the size of the Senedd':'Welsh Labour in a cooperation agreement with Plaid Cymru are proposing to increase the numbers of Members of the Senedd from 60 to 96. Neither party laid out this number in their manifestos in recent elections. The people of Wales should be asked via a referendum if they want to expand the Senedd, as this proposal will lead to a lack of proportionality in representation. Public services and the NHS in Wales are suffering badly and this should not be the Welsh Government\u2019s priority costing Welsh tax payers millions.'This petition was submitted by Richard Taylor, with 1,633 signatures. I ask Members to discuss this petition and any actions they may wish to take on this petition. Joel James.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. I'm conscious we have discussed similar petitions like this in the past. As you know, I fully agree with this. I think that we should be having a referendum on whether or not we expand the size of the Senedd, because it's not just about the expansion of Members, it's the proposed changing of the electoral system as well, which I think is key. That is another reason why I would support a referendum on this. I'm conscious that the First Minister has already responded to the initial petition, and I think we should go back to him again and outline the case that we need a referendum on this.\" said by Joel James MS\n\"Thank you for that, Joel. Luke Fletcher.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Diolch, Gadeirydd. I take on board that the number and the electoral system weren't in the manifesto, but the expansion of the Senedd was. The majority of parties elected to this Senedd had it in their manifesto. We've had a number of committee reports as well into this particular issue that have all recommended an expansion of the Senedd. I'm conscious as well, of course, that further down the line, the Welsh Government's going to be putting a Senedd reform Bill on the floor of the Siambr, which will give another opportunity again to scrutinise the proposals by Members. Of course, it gives Joel the opportunity to vote against if he wishes, and those of us who are in favour to vote in favour. I'm also conscious\u2014as Joel's already mentioned\u2014that we've had petitions like this already and that we have closed them on the basis that the further scrutiny will be coming down the line in the Siambr. So, I'd like to give a different proposal to Joel and ask that we do the same here, and thank the petitioner and close it.\" said by Luke Fletcher MS\n\"Thanks, Luke and Joel, for those two proposals. We have had a number of petitions into this committee, and of course, Members have had the opportunity as Members of the Senedd to discuss various proposals for Senedd reform. Clearly, there are political differences here. I'm looking to the screen in the Rhondda as well. I think I agree with Luke's proposal to close this. We do have an opportunity to scrutinise further as Members of this Senedd, and I think parties will make their voices clear in that. I don't think that the committee perhaps can do much more than that. But certainly, views have been noted, as they have been before by Members. So, Buffy is an agreement, I can see, nodding on the screen there. So, on that point, the majority view of the committee is to thank the petitioner and close this petition. I'm sure Joel James, although not agreeing with the action of the majority of the committee, still wishes to thank the petitioner for submitting. Of course he does.Item 2.2, P-06-1310, 'Protect Mynydd Eglwysilan and Cefn Eglwysilan':'We call on the Welsh Government to formally recognise the archaeological, historic and prehistoric environment of Eglwysilan.'There is a wealth of important sites that date back at least to the bronze age including \"prehistoric\" burial cysts and ancient rock art. There's also a major settlement and large zodiac map marked out with major stones.'The concern is that the proposed wind farm will cause irreparable damage.'There is additional information available to Members and members of the public regarding this petition. It was submitted by Kelvyn Ross Broadstock, with 719 signatures. I will bring Members in to discuss this petition now. Luke Fletcher.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Diolch, Gadeirydd. I'm conscious that we are unclear at this moment in time whether a development of national significance application has been submitted. Of course, that gives an opportunity for stakeholders and members of the public to be consulted on any proposal that might go forward. It does muddy the water a bit for us, not knowing whether it's been submitted, but, even if it has been submitted or if it hasn't been submitted, I don't see that there is much we can do as a Petitions Committee in taking this forward. But I do thank the petitioner for bringing it forward. It's good in terms of raising awareness around this particular proposal. But because I don't think there's much more we can do as a committee, I think we should close it.\" said by Luke Fletcher MS\n\"Thank you for that, Luke. I can see Members are in agreement with that. It is the appropriate way forward for those who seek to make their views clear if a development of national significance application has gone in or if it does go in\u2014that is the appropriate mechanism. But, nevertheless, this has, of course, again, raised the importance and the awareness of this particular issue through the committee.Item 2.3, P-06-1311, 'Exert Welsh interests and defend international law against EdF-Hinkley fish-kill in Severn Estuary':'We call on the Welsh Government to urgently approach Westminster\u2019s George Eustice over England\u2019s regulators blatantly disregarding the \"no harm principle\" in relation to the Marine Protected Area (MPA) status of the Severn Estuary. This relates to permitting the dumping of Hinkley sediments and solid materials into the Severn and continuing the licence for Hinkley\u2019s seawater cooling system which kills fish and juveniles on a massive scale with significant ecological damage.'Again, there is further information available to committee members and members of the public regarding the petition. It was submitted by Cian Ciaran, with 565 signatures. I'll invite Members to discuss this particular petition and any actions they may wish to take. We will go across to the Rhondda. Buffy Williams.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. After having a look at this petition, I can see that there have been two other petitions in the fifth Senedd that were submitted on similar areas. I'm not quite sure where we can go now with this petition, given that the Minister has already shared the findings of her group with UK counterparts and that the public inquiry was upheld. So, as a committee, I'm not quite sure where we can go with this petition. I think that, given the Minister has already shared her findings, we should close this petition and thank the petitioner.\" said by Buffy Williams MS\n\"Diolch yn fawr,&nbsp;Buffy, for that suggestion. I remember the previous petitions from the last Senedd coming to committee and the outcomes of that, and I think Members agree with your suggestion there. So, we'll go ahead and thank the petitioner and close the petition. I think it's reached that point on this occasion.Item 2.4, P-06-1312, 'To help improve water quality in the River Usk by upgrading sewage systems in the Usk valley':'The River Usk is a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Area of Conservation. Yet water quality in the River Usk is such that 88% of its water bodies are failing to meet their targets. Improvement targets could be set. (For example: 50% by the end of 2023, 25% by 2024 &amp; so on). Salmon, sea trout and eels are all seriously on the decline. Ranunculus weed growth in the river has virtually disappeared. People who wild swim in the river are at risk of picking up infections.'This was submitted by Michael George Cowburn with 1,612 signatures. I bring committee members in now to discuss the petition and any potential actions. Joel James.&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. Interestingly enough, I led a short debate on this subject in the Chamber just before Christmas. I'm conscious that Welsh Water have now issued plans to upgrade the sewage system around Brecon, Usk and Llanfoist. Obviously, I know the petitioner has raised concerns that this doesn't necessarily address issues around Newport. I know that the petitioner has, in his correspondence with us, asked that we share this with the incoming future generations commissioner for his views on that. So, I was thinking that, if the rest of the committee were mindful, we'd do that and then we'd keep it open to see if there is a response, and continue on, depending what that response is, really.&nbsp;\" said by Joel James MS\n\"Thank you, Joel. I can see Members nodding with agreement. It's also worth congratulating you on your short debate and the movement you made there. We'll certainly forward that on to the incoming future generations commissioner and await his response.&nbsp;Item 2.5, P-06-1313, 'Allow exemptions to the 182-day occupancy rule to reduce harm to real Welsh self-catering businesses':'The Trade Associations that represent genuine self-catering businesses in Wales (Wales Tourism Alliance, UK Hospitality Cymru and PASC UK Wales Branch) will meet Welsh Government with a view to agreeing mitigation measures to reduce the harm that the introduction of the 182-day occupancy rule will cause real Welsh-owned self-catering businesses. These are not second homes or casual lets. Over 30 per cent of these businesses have said that they will have to close or sell without these exemptions.'There is further information, including some key asks from this petition. It was submitted by our former colleague Suzy Davies, with 1,750 signatures. I will bring Members in to discuss this petition and any actions they may wish to take. Luke Fletcher.&nbsp;\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Diolch, Gadeirydd. I think we considered a similar petition in December\u2014I think that was more relating to reducing the number of days to 108, I believe. At the time we closed that petition due to the fact that Welsh Government were aware of issues relating to this particular policy and were monitoring its impact. We've also had a recent consultation on the exemptions as well, which has closed. I think given that that's in the pipeline now, and the Welsh Government is monitoring it, I don't see that there's much we can do as a Petitions Committee, so I would like to propose that we thank the petitioner and close the petition.&nbsp;\" said by Luke Fletcher MS\n\"Thank you, Luke. Joel.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. I know Suzy quite well and I know she's extremely passionate about this issue. I'm conscious that the consultation has just closed. Would it not be mindful or wise for us to hold to see what comes of that consultation before closing this? Because I'm conscious we've had petitions on this matter in the past, but I think this is the only one that's come from such bodies as the ones that have been recognised, like the Wales Tourism Alliance, UKHospitality Cymru and so on. I wonder whether it might be worth while just holding back to see what the outcome of that consultation is.\" said by Joel James MS\n\"Thank you for that suggestion, Joel. Do any Members have any issues regarding that? No? Happy to keep it open and see? Okay, so we will keep this petition open and perhaps schedule it back for when it comes\u2014. I'm not sure when the outcome of that consultation will be.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"The consultation's closed, but when it gets published and the results get published, we'll keep an eye on that and bring it back in two or three months.&nbsp;\" said by Gareth Price\n\"So we'll postpone this coming back to at least three months for the time being. And of course, on that note, I thank Suzy Davies for using the Senedd Petitions Committee. I think it's a real positive outcome of our work as a committee that such an esteemed figure as the former shadow frontbencher, Suzy Davies, notes that our committee is making good progress.Okay, 2.6, P-06-1314, 'Insulate all Welsh homes against both the heat and the cold...introduce grants that are open to all!''With energy prices sky rocketing and millions of Welsh families facing extreme fuel poverty, its time to introduce grants, open to all, which would allow all the people of Wales to properly insulate their homes against both the heat and the cold.'It is shocking that Wales has some of the worst insulated homes in the whole of Europe. A grant of 25 to 50% towards the cost of insulating properties would encourage people to invest in making their homes more energy efficient and reduce their emissions.'There is further additional information available to members of the committee. This was submitted by Robert Curtis with 279 signatures.It is worth noting that the committee has taken a positive look into this particular petition, and after our public session, in the next five minutes or so, we will be hosting a round-table discussion with those on the side of consumers to gauge their views on this particular petition and fuel poverty as a whole. We will then meet again as a committee on the back of that to discuss any further actions we may wish to take, whether we will produce a short report with findings, or we'll do some more investigation work, or, of course, find that this is all we can do with this particular petition. But it's a first for the committee, I think, in the entirety of the Welsh Parliament where we'll host a round-table discussion. So, again, a new initiative from our committee, and I think it's right that we leave that particular petition open for now and come back to it in the future. I see Members agree. Okay.&nbsp;\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Moving on then to item 3 on today's agenda, updates to previous petitions. Item 3.1, P-06-1302, 'Protect Mid-Wales\u2019 unique Cambrian Mountains: designate them an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty'. This was submitted by Lorna Celia Brazell with 20,856 signatures. We do remember just before we broke for Christmas that we actually had a debate on this issue. I was very grateful and committee members were very grateful to the Senedd Business Committee for tabling it in such a way where we could celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the initial calls to make that area a national park. It's worth noting as well the response from the lead petitioner, and I quote,&nbsp;'Overall, the Petition process has been extremely valuable in moving our proposal forward and we are very grateful to the Committee and staff for your assistance in getting it to this point.'I think that draws us to a close, and a very good way of ending this petition, thanking the petitioner, noting the correspondence we've had further, and closing this particular petition now. Do Members agree? They do.Item 3.2, P-06-1291, 'Hold an enquiry into the corporate takeover of the veterinary profession in Wales'. This was submitted by Dr Linda Evelyn Joyce-Jones with 308 signatures. This afternoon, Dr Linda Evelyn Joyce-Jones is here in the committee with us, watching proceedings. As agreed the last time we considered this petition, I met with Linda this morning to have a discussion about the petition and where further the committee may wish to take things.As committee members know, there is an event planned by Linda for the middle of this year. I think it's worth asking the clerking team and the support staff around them whether we, as a committee, can in some way support that particular event in the Senedd in terms of awareness raising and anything else that we may be able to do, and on that point, bring the petition back to discuss further actions, if there are any. But, certainly, we want to make it clear that an event will be taking place later on this year, and Members will of course be invited to that, as well as the rest of the Senedd Cymru Members. But there may be opportunities for the committee to be able to get involved in some further way with this petition. Are Members agreed that it's a good idea to ask for a scoping paper on that?

{"content": "\"Good afternoon and welcome, all, to this Plenary meeting. The first item this afternoon is questions to the Minister for Finance and Local Government, and the first question this afternoon is from Natasha Asghar.\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"1. What discussions has the Minister had with Newport City Council regarding its ability to deliver its statutory services? OQ59467\" said by Natasha Asghar MS\n\"I meet regularly with council leaders, collectively and individually, to discuss a wide range of matters, including the impact of the current economic challenges on service delivery.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Thank you for that answer, Minister. Waste collection is a statutory service and, at the moment, it's a very big talking point for everyone in Newport. I'm sure that you're well aware of the city council's plan to introduce three-weekly black bin collections. This decision has caused a huge uproar within residents across the city, and, I must admit, I'm even one of them as well. There are concerns that this move will lead to more fly-tipping, especially as the bins we've all got are, indeed, far too small, having had the smaller bins given to us only a few years ago. It's shameful that the people of Newport are being forced to go along with this drastic cut in services whilst at the same time seeing their council tax bills rocket. Torfaen council has been considering a similar move but have thankfully seen the light, and dropped the plans. Minister, do you agree with me that Newport City Council should scrap these plans, and will you call on them to just do that, because pushing ahead with this will be a very bitter pill for the residents to swallow?\" said by Natasha Asghar MS\n\"I would say that waste collection in Newport is a matter for Newport council. But I think that the difficult choices that are being presented to local government have to be seen very much in the context of the current situation whereby, obviously, local authorities are being hit by the impacts of inflation, but also seeing the impact, of course, of the ongoing tale of austerity, which is having an impact on the budgets available to local authorities. That said, we have done our very, very best here in the Welsh Government to provide local government with the best possible settlement. Local authorities across Wales together will receive \u00a35.5 billion from the Welsh Government in core revenue funding and non-domestic rates to deliver on their key services. In Newport, they'll receive \u00a3289.5 million through the local government settlement to deliver their statutory and non-statutory services. That's an 8.9 per cent increase on last year. But, that said, I do understand that it still presents leaders with very difficult choices.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Minister, education is a vital statutory responsibility of local authorities\u2014vital for the future of our children, communities and countries. Newport City Council is the only local authority in south-east Wales without a single school in special measures. So, will you join me in congratulating the city council, the teachers, teaching assistants, headteachers and entire school support staff in working so hard for our children, young people and communities?\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Llywydd, I'm always delighted to recognise good work, so I would definitely join John Griffiths in extending our congratulations and our appreciation to the council, and also to the schools, the teachers, and the wider schools family, and also of course to those pupils themselves, who are striving every day to achieve the best they can.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"2. What actions has the Welsh Government taken to ensure the fair distribution of funding for local authorities? OQ59483\" said by Peter Fox MS\n\"I ensure fair funding for all local authorities in Wales by prioritising health and local government services in budget decisions, and through a transparent, equitable and jointly produced distribution formula with our local government partners.\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Thank you for that response, Minister. Over the last budget period, there has been plenty of debate surrounding the issue of funding for local authorities, with many of us arguing that something needs to be done to create a fairer and more sustainable system. Many feel the current system is no longer fit for purpose. As I'm sure you would agree, currently, the system has led to a situation where it rewards some councils so much more than others, enabling huge reserves to build whilst other councils struggle to meet their statutory functions. There is clearly something wrong when we see usable reserves build to \u00a32.75 billion. Something needs to be done to fix this problem. Minister, can you give assurances that the distribution sub-group is looking into things, and have you spoken with the Welsh Local Government Association leaders to consider an independent analysis of the funding formula ahead of next year's budget round? Has the Welsh Government listened to the concerns made in this Chamber, or are we being ignored?\" said by Peter Fox MS\n\"I'm grateful to the Member for the question, but I would take issue with the suggestion that the funding formula in any way rewards some councils, because it's definitely the case that there's no evidence that any authority or particular geographical or social area in Wales is being disadvantaged through the formula. In fact, the formula takes account of both sparsity and dispersion, as well as deprivation. So, it's very much a\u2014[<em>Interruption</em>.] Llywydd, I've got a Member talking in my ear constantly; it's very difficult to concentrate.&nbsp;\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Yes, if you can try and ignore her, I'd advise that.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"I do my best most of the time. It's more difficult today. [<em>Laughter.</em>]\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Nothing personal to the Member. [<em>Laughter</em>.]\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"All right. So, the point I'm trying to make about the distribution sub-group is that the formula is not set in stone. It's constantly evolving and, even in this year's updates, there have been several changes. For example, officials are looking at the implications of updating the sparsity and dispersion measures. They are currently based on the previous census. We have new census information now, which will be incorporated into that. And, actually, routinely, on an annual basis, the distribution sub-group factors in a wide range of data\u201472 per cent of it is updated annually. That includes things such as population data, but also things such as road lengths, street lighting, council tax reduction scheme case loads, planning applications, trading premises, and even the number of ships arriving in ports. So, a wide, wide range of data is looked at, and the distribution sub-group is constantly updating that.&nbsp;What I would say is that we do take a different approach here to that across the border in England. The approach in England has been to cut the value of the revenue support grant, and that forces councils, then, of course, to rely on business rates and council tax income without reviewing the relative needs and resources of authorities in England. And the Institute for Fiscal Studies has noted that where needs assessments are used in England, they actually rely on data that is at least 10 years and, in most cases, 20 years old. And, as I say, the vast majority of our data is updated on an annual basis.&nbsp;\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"There will be always concerns that Welsh Government support for local authorities is not fairly provided. There is a belief that some local authorities do not get a fair share. Although, I must admit, no-one has actually complained that they receive too much. [<em>Laughter</em>.] Can I ask the Minister to publish the standard spending assessments and the aggregated external finance calculations\u2014not just the final total, but the calculations, which you must have? Can you publish them, so that everybody can see how they get to that final total, or we'll keep on having Members, including Peter Fox, I would imagine, saying, 'We've been unfairly treated in Monmouth'?\" said by Mike Hedges AM\n\"So, of course, Monmouth had the highest increase of all local authorities in this financial year, and, again, that is a factor of the formula that is set in place to ensure that there is funding that is fair across Wales. But, absolutely, I'm committed to improving the clarity and the transparency of the information that we publish. So, in addition to the local government finance report, which is laid before the Senedd, and sets out the basis of the calculations, we also publish the Green Book, and, from this current settlement forward, the Green Book is being presented in a more accessible format to make the information clearer to readers. It provides information on the calculation of the SSA, as well as providing the indicator values and the weightings used to calculate each of the 55 service indicator-based assessments. So, we're certainly moving forward on this agenda. I've written recently to the Finance Committee on that, and I know the Finance Committee is taking a strong interest in it. Officials routinely do a session ahead of the local government settlement for the local government committee, but I've suggested that, in future, it might be something that the Finance Committee might be interested in engaging in as well. But, as I say, I'm committed to constantly improving the transparency and volume of data that we provide.&nbsp;\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Bridgend and Rhondda Cynon Taf continue to be home to some of the most deprived areas in Wales, based on the Welsh index of multiple deprivation. There are significant differences in life expectancy between the most and the least deprived areas. There's been an increase in the amount of under-18s in persistent poverty over recent years. Access to public transport is as much a problem in the upper Valleys as it is in mid and rural west Wales. There's an increasing demand for social housing, and an increase in applications of homelessness. And some still face challenges of being long-term out of work, and others of a lack of basic employment skills.&nbsp;Now, both RCT and Bridgend have actions in place tackling these pernicious and deep-seated problems, which were entrenched in the period of Conservative de-industrialisation and pit closures of the Thatcher years, and they've been exacerbated by this long tale of austerity since 2010. We need to keep the focus on these communities. So, Minister, in respect of the fair distribution of funding for local authorities, would you ensure that levels of deprivation, and the challenges of turning around generational embedded challenges that affect so many, reflect these realities for these communities and individuals, and for the local authorities and voluntary organisations on which they depend?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"I'm absolutely committed to ensuring that the formula continues to recognise those indicators that recognise the difficulties that certain communities face, and that will continue to be the case, moving forward.&nbsp;\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Questions now from party spokespeople. The Conservative spokesperson, Peter Fox.&nbsp;\" said by Y Llywydd / The Llywydd\n\"Diolch, Llywydd. As you know, Minister, the incredibly high cost in childcare is forcing many people in Wales, particularly women, out of the jobs market. I know many in Wales are incredibly disappointed that the Labour administration here is not following in the footsteps of the UK Conservative Government and expanding childcare to include all children aged nine months and older. Your co-operation agreement with Plaid Cymru does offer a much less generous scheme, but even that seems to have stalled. Concerningly, last month, a Welsh Government Minister said that your flagship childcare policy would not happen if more nursery workers could not be recruited, and responsibility lies directly at the feet of Welsh Government. Minister, what financial commitments is the Welsh Government making in order to attract more staff to the childcare sector? And when can parents of children under the age of three expect to be listened to?&nbsp;\" said by Peter Fox MS\n\"Well, I would suggest that this is a question that should be directed to the Minister with responsibility for childcare, but I'm very happy to provide some further information, particularly in the context of the spring statement. The Welsh Government is already spending over \u00a3100 million a year delivering on our very ambitious childcare commitment, which we have as part of our co-operation agreement with Plaid Cymru, and, as a result of that, people across Wales do not need to be disappointed, because, today, they have access to a better and more generous offer here in Wales than is available to people across the border in England.&nbsp;What the UK Government has set out is an end goal that they want to get to after the next general election. I think the UK Government is setting out plans that it has absolutely no intention in reality of delivering. And let's look at how slowly the UK Government intends to make progress. So, as I say, we're already spending \u00a3100 million a year on our childcare pledge, which is already more generous, but the UK Government in this financial year has only provided us with \u00a312 million of consequential funding. So, that does suggest that the UK Government is in no rush to make any progress at all on its particular pledge, and I think that that has to be considered as well. We're already streets ahead. The UK Government is playing catch-up and we're already spending much, much more than we have in consequential funding. The UK Government clearly doesn't intend to move very quickly on this.The point, I think, that the Member raises about recruitment into the sector is a really important one. And one of the reasons why the UK Government will be so slow in rolling out its pledge is because it takes a long time to recruit people into the sector, to make sure that premises are appropriate for childcare settings and so on. So, I think that we are, as I say, already streets ahead, and I would be very, very surprised to see any rapid progress from the UK Government across the border.&nbsp;\" said by Rebecca Evans AM\n\"Minister, I think there are many parents of very young children who disagree or can't see or have no hope that these things might happen, and it clearly is a finance brief, because we need to identify moneys to be able to put the staff in place to roll this out, and I hope there's a coherent strategy to do that.Minister, time and time again we have seen the effects that years of Labour underfunding has had on our NHS. As we all know, Welsh Government receives \u00a31.20 for every \u00a31 spent on health in England, but, according to the Auditor General for Wales, only \u00a31.05 of it goes to the Welsh NHS. This failure to fund this vital public service has left almost a quarter of our Welsh people on an NHS waiting list and created huge concern and worry. We all know there is a long list of struggling specialisms, such as lung disease and specialist cancer treatment, in our NHS that urgently require Welsh Government funding to provide the essential services they offer, and we, as elected representatives, hear calls from different organisations regularly, as you will know. So, Minister, what I want to know is how you are allocating funds towards these different specialist services. How do you use the wealth of health data in Wales, some of which is amongst the best in Wales? Is there a thoughtful strategy or is it a case of who shouts loudest?&nbsp;\" said by Peter Fox MS\n\"Well, Llywydd, again, we have a question that is probably better directed at the health Minister, whose responsibility it is to direct her budget at those services that are going to have the most beneficial impact on the health of people in Wales. But to this point about Wales receiving more money per head than is the case across the border, well, of course, that's not the case across all of England, because, of course, there will be areas in England that require greater levels of funding because they have similar characteristics to those that we have in Wales. And some of the reasons why we have that additional funding are because we have a dispersed settlement pattern here in Wales and our demographics are different, and both of those things, as we've talked about in the context of the local government settlement, increase the cost of delivering public services.So, there are 6.7 miles of road for every 1,000 people in Wales and 3.4 miles in England. So, there are almost twice as many roads for us just to maintain per head of population here in Wales than across the border. Obviously, that costs us more, and a dispersed population means that we have a greater number of smaller schools. Obviously, there is a higher cost to providing education in Wales. And, as colleagues will know, we have an older population here in Wales with higher levels of sickness and disability and, inevitably, of course, the cost of providing care to those people is higher here than it is across the border. So, there are very good, genuine reasons why Wales is funded in the way it is and I'm very glad that the First Minister was able to negotiate that as part of our settlement when he was in the finance role.\" said by ", "answer": "Rebecca Evans AM"}
{"content": "\"And with that, we're going to move to the first substantive item on the agenda this afternoon, and it's the first of our witness evidence sessions on UK-EU governance. We'll also be carrying on with this next week as well, with two sessions. But this is our first, and we're delighted to welcome Professor Catherine Barnard of Cambridge University\u2014lovely to see you here again on screen with us\u2014and Professor Simon Usherwood of Open University.And if you're happy, both of you, we'll go straight into a range of questions on this area that is of interest to us as a committee. If I could just open up with a very broad question on why we should be concerned about this. What's the importance now, in this post-Brexit landscape, of UK-EU governance? Catherine, perhaps I could start with you.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Thank you very much indeed. Thank you so much for the kind invitation. It's an honour and a privilege to be with you. On your first question about the importance of all of this, I would like to say, first of all, people voted for Brexit for a number of reasons, but in respect of Wales's influence in the wider European debate, it has been a loss, and it's been a loss because I think Wales managed to punch above its weight in respect of its membership of the various EU institutional bodies like the Committee of the Regions, and it was also able to form really quite close alliances with other small devolved administrations, states, nations, across the EU, in particular Catalunya and the Basque Country. Now, Brexit meant that membership of those bodies and all of the other working groups has gone, and so, therefore, Wales, in order to get its voice heard in Europe, let alone in Westminster, really does need to work quite hard to participate in what bodies there are. These bodies are nowhere near the robust institutions that came with EU membership, but, nevertheless, it's extremely important that Wales is there.\" said by Professor Catherine Barnard\n\"Thank you very much, and we'll get into some real detail of this in moment, but, Simon, is there anything you'd like to add to that?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Yes. First of all, thank you again for the invitation to speak with you. I think, just to pick up on Catherine's points, this matters now, I think, even more than it has in the last couple of years, because we're now at a point where it looks like the governance and institutional architecture of the relationship is starting to be accepted and settle down, and so we're now in a phase where there needs to be really active thought about how best to input Welsh priorities and preferences into that process. So, at a point where the London Government has maybe turned the page, or a page, I think there are lots of opportunities for the Senedd and for Wales more generally to be doing that. Particularly at this point, I think we do have some opportunities that I'm looking forward to discussing with you.\" said by Professor Simon Usherwood\n\"Excellent. Thank you, both, for those opening remarks, and that's a good place now to bring in Alun.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Thank you, and thank you for your time today. We've debated the overall institutional architecture on a number of occasions during the painful process of Brexit, and the trade and co-operation agreement and the structure that it's created have probably not had the attention, in many ways, in terms of the institutional structures, that a lot of the trade issues and some of the political issues around Northern Ireland have had, so we haven't really debated how they're working, and I think this is an opportunity to do so. The last time, Professor Barnard, you gave evidence to the committee, I think, was just after a lot of these matters had been agreed. So, can I ask both of you how you see these things evolving? Have the structures, the institutional structures, delivered in the way that you anticipated they would, and do you see the evolution of them in a way that is providing a greater opportunity for institutional interaction? Or do you think they're not working in a way that maximises potential?\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Who would like to begin? Catherine. Go ahead.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Would you like me to start? Thank you very much indeed for that rather astute question. I think the starting point is to say that the institutional mechanism, particularly under the TCA, is very much of a kind that you find in other EU agreements with third countries\u2014so, a range of political bodies, in the case of the TCA the partnership council, and then a number of much more specialised bodies. So, from that point of view, it really is business as usual, but business as usual in the context of a free trade agreement, which is essentially what we've got with the EU, not in terms of EU membership, which of course we've left.The next thing I would say is that, during the period when relations between the UK Government and the EU were so difficult, particularly over Northern Ireland, the institutions did not function at all. Some of them virtually never met, and when they did meet it was brief and the agenda was pretty minimal. Clearly, the agreement over the Windsor framework has changed things significantly, and now there are much better levels of co-operation, and, dare I say it, it's extremely boring, and that is actually good news. It's good news because it's become technocratic not political, and that's what the EU is good at. Indeed, I think we should bask in gratitude that it has become boring and not political, because it does mean that things are more likely to get done without a lot of grandstanding\u2014with deep respect to the Members here\u2014of politicians who would like to get their voices heard, rather than necessarily getting things done at an operational level.Then, the question is: what about Wales's voice in those institutions? The answer is that it's pretty much a mixed bag. In respect of the withdrawal agreement, as you know better than I, the Welsh Government doesn't attend the joint committee, which is the top-level political organisation, nor does it attend any of the specialised committees. I think this is a real problem for Wales, not least because the Windsor framework does have an impact on Welsh ports, on border measures, and so that is quite a significant omission. In respect of the TCA, things are a bit better because Wales does attend, but only as observers, and so this again is a way of reducing the Welsh voice. And particularly over the Windsor framework, there are going to be a lot of operational matters that need to get sorted out over the next few months\u2014things that will directly affect Wales. And if Wales is not having a voice\u2014and I don't think Wales had much of a voice over even the negotiations of the Windsor framework\u2014I think this is going to cause you trouble down the line.\" said by Professor Catherine Barnard\n\"Simon, is there anything you'd like to add to that?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Yes, I'm not sure it's boring enough yet. I think the TCA, as much as we have got to this place post Windsor, where I think the mood music is more positive and you're seeing a proliferation of informal connections, I think the formal institutions still haven't actually picked up, notably, in their rhythm of meetings. So, typically, the sub-committees are meeting once a year, with a very few number of exceptions, and I've not seen any immediate signs that that pace has picked up. So, I think most of those institutions in the TCA still are very much in the perfunctory, 'Let's report on what's happened in the past year' kind of mode, rather than being big, substantive arenas for engaging in the boring, technocratic, governance kind of issues.But I think Catherine again is right that this is a trade agreement and the institutions, with a number of possible exceptions, are not really purposed for more general kinds of interactions of the kind that might capture the breadth of interest that the UK as a whole, or Wales in particular, might have. So, I think we have to be a bit careful about assuming that Windsor\u2014I'm sure we'll talk about this further\u2014has transformed everything, because, again, the architecture is a particular kind of architecture, and the scope for representing Welsh or other sub-national interests from the UK, I think, are rather limited. So, for me, that's the key thing as we go along, that we shouldn't think about the TCA in isolation from the broad range of activities that are possible and that I think are necessary.\" said by Professor Simon Usherwood\n\"Thank you. I think we're all agreed on the importance of boredom and moving away from the circus that we've seen for too many years. I certainly agree with both of you on that. But there seems to be, sometimes, a vacuum, and that's less boring, if you like, and there seems to be, sometimes, that without a crisis driving the relationship, there's not much left, and that there isn't a balance between the legislator and the executive, because all the conversations we've had so far this afternoon have been about executive speaking to executive, without the legislators being involved. And it feels, sometimes, that you've got, at one level, some very specialist technical officials having conversations with other specialist technical officials about things that they've just got to get sorted, because they've just got to get it sorted, but without any real political intervention required on either side. But there's no policy work taking place. You would anticipate, at the beginning of a new relationship, if you like, a new structure, that there would be a debate and discussion about policy issues between the two institutions, or the two structures. And that seems to be missing at the moment, unless I've missed it. There doesn't seem to be that sort of ongoing agenda-driven activity, which seems to be\u2014. It's all very much minutiae\u2014there's a crisis, everybody turns up to the crisis, the crisis is resolved or not, and then we go back to minutiae; there's nothing in the middle. Is that a reasonable analysis?\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Simon.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"It's difficult, because it's at once a new relationship and an old relationship. So, typically, when we think about these kinds of instruments, it's about bringing two partners together that perhaps have been quite distant and there's a process of getting to know you, whereas, in this case, everyone knows each other very well, thanks to the UK's membership of the EU. So, the discovery side of things is not there in terms of underlying preferences. I think the problem has been, as much as anything else, that the Government in London has not been clear about what it wants from the relationship, which makes it very hard for the EU to start having that discussion. I think the view from Commission officials and from the Parliament has been, 'Once the UK can decide what it's trying to do here, then we can have some discussions about doing that.' And I think it's only really been recently that we've started to come out of that very hot phase of article 50, the withdrawal process in the narrow sense, to get to a point now where we're not arguing about basic structures, and then start thinking about where policy comes.On those crises that you mentioned, I think we still do have some crises, but they're coming in more manageable and conventional sizes. Things like car batteries and rules of origin are crises of a kind, certainly if you are working in the sector, but it's not nearly of the structural and systemic nature that we had over the Northern Ireland protocol. So, I think you're right to say that there isn't that strategising. We're not having head-to-head meetings of the British Prime Minister and the Presidents of the Commission in a way that would provide a structural and substantial space. They have contacts on the side of other multilateral meetings, but that's not quite the same. So, you're right to say that we lack a direction, which makes it then hard to engage in that aspect of the relationship.\" said by Professor Simon Usherwood\n\"And Catherine, I just wonder, extending Alun's point, whether you see that this is something that could evolve, whether it's simply that we're coming out of some white-water times of getting through that, and this could evolve into something that is more proactive, is more policy focused, is more setting agendas together.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"On the point about being boring, generally boring is good as far as the EU is concerned. Even when we were a member state of the EU, there was an awful lot of boring, if you remember all the discussions about comitology&nbsp;committees and so forth. Boring was good, and we're probably boring academics, which is why we probably like it.On the policy work, I agree, it's probably too early, but I also think ambition should be set pretty low, because this is only a free trade agreement, and it's a pretty narrow free trade agreement at that. If you're talking about policy issues over, for example, trade facilitation, well, it's certainly envisaged in the TCA that there is greater scope for discussion about how to facilitate goods crossing a frontier. If you're talking about policy work over, for example, recognition of professional qualifications, again, there's scope for that in the TCA. But we're not talking really big, high-level policy. I think we're going to come to this a bit later on, but in terms of the TCA review, again, I think it's quite important to set ambitions pretty low there. It's not going to be a rewriting of the treaty.If I could just say one other thing about legislature to legislature, in answer to your question. The only legislature-to-legislature format, if you can call it that, is, of course, the PPA\u2014the parliamentary partnership assembly\u2014and the earliest meetings of that were characterised by a fair degree of grandstanding, if I may be so blunt. But the most recent PPA was, I think, a bit better. I think what's been helpful there is that, while you in Wales have observer status on the PPA, the working groups, at least, do give you a more effective role. Again, this has got to be kept in context. If you're using the Committee of the Regions or the European Parliament as a yardstick, clearly what's happening in the PPA falls well short. But if you look at it through the other end of the telescope to see what goes on in other equivalents\u2014between EU and Canada and the like\u2014then this is better than nothing.\" said by Professor Catherine Barnard\n\"That's really interesting. Are you okay, Alun?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"'Better than nothing' sounds like a euphemism for a lot around Brexit. In terms of that legislature-to-legislature role, as parliamentarians you expect to have a grip on certain things. Sitting in the legislature you understand you're not in the executive and there are certain things that you just can't do and won't do and shouldn't do and the rest of it. But you do expect to have an overview, an oversight of where we are and where policy is going and where Government is going. Certainly, my experience is there's far less transparency since Brexit. The UK Government operates in secret. It doesn't even tell its own people what it's seeking to do. It has legislated, of course, to remove parliamentary oversight from some of its trade work, which is an extraordinary thing for any Government to do. But it means that there's less parliamentary scrutiny, less parliamentary oversight than we would anticipate in other areas of policy, and certainly far less democratic oversight than there was when we were members of the EU, when the Council of Ministers was broadcast and we turned up and the rest of it. I don't know if either of you have any sort of view on this. How do we extend and develop and deepen the legislature-to-legislature relationship that can provide for greater oversight and greater scrutiny? Because at the moment as a parliamentarian I feel completely disenfranchised from all the discussion and debate that's taking place. We were having a conversation just before you joined us about the Committee of the Regions. I sit on the contact group there, and we read papers at each other but we don't actually do anything, and I think that's a really, really important missing link here: there's nothing that's happening between meetings.\" said by Alun Davies AM\n\"Who would like to come in on that?

Now, these regulations amend the 2021 regulations by deferring the implementation date of the annual nitrogen holding limit on the spreading of livestock manures for holdings, or part of holdings, not previously situated within a nitrate vulnerable zone from 1 January 2023 until 30 April 2023. Our lawyers have no reporting points on this. Colleagues, have you any comments, or are you happy just to note that report? Okay. Thank you very much.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"We'll proceed, then, to item No. 3, which is instruments that do raise issues to be reported to the Senedd under Standing Orders 21.2 or 21.3. The first of these, item 3.1, is SL(6)299, the Seed (Equivalence) (Amendment) (Wales) Regulations 2022. We have a draft report in your papers there. These regulations amend a European Council decision of December 2022, which now forms part of retained direct minor EU legislation on the equivalence of field inspections carried out in third countries on seed-producing crops and on the equivalence of seed-producing third countries. The regulations extend the expiry date of this decision from 31 December 2022 to 31 December 2029. This proposal to extend the council decision was subject to a six-week period of informal stakeholder engagement, and it was jointly undertaken by the Welsh, Scottish and UK Governments. Now, our lawyers have identified one technical and two merits reporting points, but I don't believe that we've had a Welsh Government response yet. Kate, what do you want to tell us about this resolution instrument?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Thank you. The technical point seeks clarification from Welsh Government as to whether all the powers cited in the preamble are in fact being exercised in the making of this instrument. And then, there are the two merits points. The first notes that there's some missing text in the explanatory note, which should be pointing out to readers where the regulatory impact assessment is and how they can obtain a copy of it. And then the second merits point identifies that there are some Welsh language terms used that do not appear to follow the Welsh Government's translation guidance, and so we've requested a Welsh Government response on all three of those points, and we're waiting to receive it.\" said by Kate Rabaiotti\n\"That's great, thank you very much. So, noting those action points, do we have any other comments, colleagues, or are we happy to agree those? Happy to agree those. Thank you very much, Kate.&nbsp;We go on to item 3.2, SL(6)304, the Processed Cereal-based Foods and Baby Foods for Infants and Young Children (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2022. These regulations\u2014and I refer you to the draft report in our pack\u2014amend the 2004 regulations to permit the addition of calcium-L-methylfolate in the manufacture of processed cereal-based foods and baby foods. They correct also a previous missed amendment to\u2014I hope I can say this right\u2014add ferrous bisglycinate and zinc chloride as permitted sources of vitamins and minerals to be added to processed cereal-based foods and baby foods, and additionally, where a processed cereal-based food or baby food is labelled with the average quantity of those substances, the effect of these regulations is that this must be done in a manner that complies with certain labelling requirements set out in regulations 8(2) and (3) of the 2004 regulations.&nbsp;Now, our lawyers have identified one merits reporting point. Kate, over to you.&nbsp;\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Thank you. So, the merits point asks Welsh Government why the explanatory memorandum has been provided in English only, and in response, the Welsh Government refers to standard 47 of the Welsh language standards, and the narrow and specific nature of the regulations and the small target audience, as its basis for not providing a Welsh language version of the explanatory memorandum.&nbsp;\" said by Kate Rabaiotti\n\"Okay. James, this is something that we've taken up repeatedly, and colleagues here on the committee have taken up repeatedly, so we note those, I think, and agree those action points. And I suspect that this is something that we'll take up again as we go forward on every occasion with gentle reminders to Government. Any other comments from colleagues, or are we happy to agree those points that our legal analysis has thrown up? Okay.We go on to item 3.3, SL(6)305, the Official Controls (Extension of Transitional Periods) (Amendment) (Wales) Regulations 2022. We have a draft report, a letter from the Minister for Economy to the Llywydd and a written statement by the Minister for Economy in your pack. These regulations extend the post-EU exit transitional staging period\u2014the TSP\u2014from 31 December 2022 to 31 January 2024 to enable additional time to develop and finalise proposals for the future borders regime. Just to note for Members that, in the letter, the Minister states that,'Previously Regulations relating to the Transitional Staging Period (TSP) for goods entering Great Britain from the EU and certain other countries, have been introduced by the UK Government on behalf of Wales with the consent of Welsh Ministers. However, we took the decision that it would be preferable to legislate in Wales on this matter with coordination as far as possible on GB basis.'Now, in part, the Minister notes that this was because upheaval in Westminster had'delayed ministerial meetings at which border policy, including the TSP extension, would be discussed.'So, that's a point of interest for Members to note there from the Minister's response. But Kate, you've identified one merits point.&nbsp;\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Yes, the merits point notes the breach of the 21-day convention and the explanation provided by the Minister for Economy that this was necessary to avoid the transitional staging period expiring on 30 December 2022.\" said by Kate Rabaiotti\n\"Thank you, Kate. With that point, are we happy to agree that report? We are.So we go on, then, under the same section to item 3.4, SL(6)306, the Marketing of Seeds and Plant Propagating Material (Wales) (Amendment) (EU Exit) (No. 2)&nbsp; Regulations 2022, and we have a draft report and a letter from the Minister for Rural Affairs and North Wales, and Trefnydd. So, the regulations here correct errors identified by this committee in our report on the original regulations of 2022. The regulations revoke the original regulations, and they remake the relevant amendments to the Seed Marketing (Wales) Regulations 2012 and the Marketing of Fruit Plant and Propagating Material (Wales) Regulations 2017. Our lawyers have identified three merits points, so over to you, Kate.&nbsp;\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Thank you. The three merits points are simply matters to note. So, the first of these is the breach of the 21-day convention, and Welsh Government's explanation that this was necessary because of the expiry of the enabling powers under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, and those powers expired on 31 December 2022. The second merits point notes that the regulations were considered by this committee as part of the sifting process. And then, finally, the third merits point notes that there was no formal consultation.&nbsp;\" said by Kate Rabaiotti\n\"Thank you very much. Colleagues, are we happy to agree those reporting points? We are. Thank you, Kate.So, we go on now to, item 3.5, an affirmative resolution instrument, SL(6)297, the Council Tax Reduction Schemes (Prescribed Requirements and Default Scheme) (Wales) (Amendment) Regulations 2023. We have a draft report and a written statement by the Minister for Finance and Local Government in our packs. So, these regulations amend the Council Tax Reduction Schemes and Prescribed Requirements (Wales) Regulations 2013 to uprate certain figures used to calculate an applicant's entitlement to a reduction under a CTRS, a council tax reduction scheme.&nbsp;In addition, the regulations make provision to ensure that any Ukrainian national\u2014[<em>Interruption</em>.] Pardon me, the legacy of a cold over Christmas, that is. The regulations make provision to ensure that any Ukrainian national who has been granted leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom will be eligible to be included in a local authority\u2019s council tax reduction scheme, and will be eligible for a discount if they meet the other requirements of the council tax reduction scheme. Now, our lawyers have identified two technical points here. Kate, over to you.&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Thank you. So, the technical points, the first identifies defective drafting and the second notes an inconsistency between the Welsh and English texts. We've received the Welsh Government response, which states that both errors will be corrected prior to the regulations being made.&nbsp;\" said by Kate Rabaiotti\n\"That's brilliant. Thank you very much. That's a welcome response there.&nbsp;\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"If we're happy to agree that, colleagues, we'll move, then, onto item No. 4, which is instruments that raise issues to be reported to the Senedd under Standing Order 21.2 or 21.3, which we have previously considered. And we start here with item 4.1, SL(6)279, the Animal Health (Poultry Compartments and Animal Gatherings) (Fees) (Wales) (Amendment) Order 2022, and we have a report and a Welsh Government response. We considered this in our committee at our meeting on 28 November 2022, and we laid our report the following day. So, I just invite Members to note the Welsh Government response to the report, which has since been received. Is there anything we need to raise on this, Kate?&nbsp;\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Yes. If I could just draw your attention to one point in the Welsh Government's response on the technical reporting point. Welsh Government says that it notes the committee's preferred drafting approach, but considers that the amendment is clear and legally accurate in both English and Welsh. But it's important to note that it's not the committee's preferred drafting approach that was set out in the draft report\u2014it's Welsh Government's preferred approach, as set out in their own guidance in 'Writing laws for Wales'. And so, it's just important that we note that.&nbsp;\" said by Kate Rabaiotti\n\"That's great, thank you. It's good that we've got it on record here. We're trying to be helpful, as ever, in drawing the Government's attention to its own approach here, or what it should be. Item 4.2\u2014. Colleagues, are you happy with that? In which case, we move on to item 4.2, SL(6)292, the Trade in Animals and Related Products (Amendment and Legislative Functions) and Animal Health (Miscellaneous Amendments) (Wales) (EU Exit) Regulations 2022. We have several papers here. We have a report, the Welsh Government response, a letter to the Minister for Rural Affairs and North Wales, and Trefnydd, and the Deputy Minister for Mental Health and Well-being, and a letter from the Minister for Rural Affairs and North Wales, and Trefnydd, and the Deputy Minister for Mental Health and Well-being. We looked at this instrument, on our committee, in our meeting of 12 December 2022, and we laid our report that same afternoon. And Members will also recall that we wrote, with some urgency, to the Minister ahead of the Plenary debate, which was taking place the very following day. So, I draw your attention to the Welsh Government response to the report and to our letter, and just to ask again, Kate, is there anything particular to note here?\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Just to note that Welsh Government agreed with some of the reporting points. So, they said that they would correct 12 errors on making the instrument, and they also said that they would correct two errors by way of an amending instrument early in 2023. They also provided further explanation in response to the other reporting points. And then, Members will also recall that, during the debate, the Minister committed to addressing one of the further reporting points by amending the procedure that applies to the Henry VIII power, so that it will be subject to the affirmative procedure rather than the negative.\" said by Kate Rabaiotti\n\"That's great; really good. I think we're happy to note those points there. Thank you very much for that, Kate.That brings us our last item in this section, item 4.3, SL(6)291, the Food and Feed (Miscellaneous Amendments) (Wales) (EU Exit) Regulations 2022. And again, we have several papers here, including the report, Welsh Government response, a letter from the Minister for Rural Affairs and North Wales, and Trefnydd, and the Deputy Minister for Mental Health and Well-being, and the letter to the Minister for Rural Affairs and North Wales, and Trefnydd and Deputy Minister for Mental Health and Well-being as well. So we considered, on the committee, this instrument, at our meeting of 5 December 2022, and our report was laid the following day. And if you recall as well, for Members, we wrote as well to the Deputy Minister about these regulations ahead of the Plenary debate that took place on 12 December. So, I just invite you to note the Welsh Government response to the report and to our letter. Anything in particular here or is this simply to note? Yes, I think it is. Kate. Sorry, Kate, we can't hear you.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"Sorry. Welsh Government agreed with all five reporting points and agreed to correct them either via correction slip or through an amending instrument.\" said by Kate Rabaiotti\n\"That's great. Thank you very much for that. Good.\" said by Huw Irranca-Davies AM\n\"In which case, then, we'll move on now to item No. 5, our regular look at common frameworks. So, under 5.1, we have the Economy, Trade and Rural Affairs Committee report on common frameworks. There are 46 recommendations made in total. Some of them call on the Welsh Government to take specific actions in the delivery of the framework programme in Wales, and others call for changes to the content of the frameworks themselves. So, we might want to return to this in private session, colleagues, but it's good to note that the Economy, Trade and Rural Affairs Committee are taking a real diligent interest in this and making those observations in the way we would expect, but it's good to see. In which case, we note that for now.\" said by ", "answer": "Huw Irranca-Davies AM"}
{"content": "\"So, we'll got straight to item 2 on our agenda, the Agriculture (Wales) Bill Stage 2 consideration. We're undertaking Stage 2 proceedings today for the Agriculture (Wales) Bill. We have the Minister with us today, Lesley Griffiths, and her officials. Would you like to just introduce your officials for the record?\" said by Darren Millar AM\n\"Yes, certainly. Thank you, Chair. So, over on my left, I have Emma Davies, who is the agricultural Bill manager and Dorian Brunt, who is the senior lawyer for the rural affairs team. And on my right, Hannah Fernandez, head of policy instructions for the Bill, and Mark Alexander, deputy director for land management reform.\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"Thank you for that, Minister, and welcome to you all.So, the marshalled list of amendments is the list of all the amendments that have been tabled, marshalled into the order that has been agreed by the committee on 16 February. The groupings list shows how amendments have been grouped in order to facilitate the debates today, and the order in which the amendments are called and moved for a vote is dictated by the marshalled list.&nbsp;So, I want to\u2014. For the record, in accordance with the convention agreed by the Business Committee, as Chair, I will move the amendments in the name of the Minister, and for expediency, I will assume that the Minister wants to move all of the amendments that have been tabled in her name at the appropriate time, in accordance with the marshalled list. Minister, if you don't&nbsp;want me to do that, then please indicate at the relevant point in the proceedings.So, in line with our usual practice, we've got legal advisers to the committee who are present today and that means that we can suspend proceedings should Members wish to take advantage of that at any time\u2014that legal advice. And in addition, Minister, you can also receive advice, of course, from your officials, hopefully by passing a note, of if you wish to do so, we can suspend proceedings as well, should you need us to do that.\" said by Darren Millar AM\n\"So, we'll start with group 1 of the 16 groups that we have to discuss today: the sustainable land management objectives and the first group of amendments that we're going to be discussing. The lead amendment in this group is amendment 57. I therefore call on Luke Fletcher to move and speak to the lead amendment and the other amendments in this group. I call on Luke Fletcher.\" said by Darren Millar AM\n\"Diolch, Cadeirydd, and I move the amendments. And right off the bat, I'd just like to thank the clerks and legal team for their patience with myself as a new Member in going through this process.I'll speak to amendments 57, 1A, 3 and 4. On amendment 57, this amendment seeks to include a requirement relating to protecting food security in SLM objectives. Food security is a critical issue. It directly impacts the health and well-being of people, the environment and economy. Wales has a high level of poverty and food insecurity, particularly among low-income households, which can have a negative impact on health and well-being. Sustainable land management can help to address this issue by promoting the production of nutritious, affordable and locally grown food.&nbsp;Although clause 1 within the Bill includes the production of food as part of the first SLM objective, what we are seeking to do is to provide a clear target for meeting this objective, which must be around ensuring the food security of citizens and access to food to promote good health and well-being.On amendment 1A, which is an amendment, actually, to amendment 1, we're seeking to change 'farmer' to 'active farmer' to ensure that we are clear as to who receives support.On amendment 3, economic resilience is just as important to Welsh farmers as environmental resilience because it is essential for their long-term sustainability and ability to adapt to changing economic and environmental conditions. By investing in both economic and environmental resilience, farmers can build a sustainable and profitable farming operation that can withstand the challenges of the future.And finally, Chair, on amendment 4,&nbsp;'The fifth objective is to seek to safeguard rural livelihoods and communities, recognising the importance of sustainable and viable agricultural businesses and agricultural production to the rural economy, and in doing so\u2014'(a) to meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, and'(b) to contribute to achieving the well-being goals in section 4 of the Well-being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015.'\" said by Luke Fletcher MS\n\"Thank you, Luke. I call on Sam Kurtz.\" said by Darren Millar AM\n\"Thank you very much, Chair. I'd like to echo Luke Fletcher's thanks and praise to the legal team and the clerking team for their hand-holding through this process. I am most grateful for that. Speaking to amendment 1, it has been tabled in order to remove any ambiguity in relation to the sustainable land management objective 4. By precisely linking the fourth objective to the role of the farmer, we seek to recognise their integral role in supporting and delivering the objectives of the sustainable land management objective 4. This sits in line with recommendation 10 of the Economy, Trade and Rural Affairs Committee report into the Agriculture (Wales) Bill, which seeks to provide explicit policy intent for the support of strong and vibrant rural communities, as was sought by key industry stakeholders.&nbsp;Touching on amendment 1A, I would like to welcome this from Luke Fletcher, and therefore will be supporting it. In relation to amendment 43, the inclusion of the phrase 'landscape' has been made in order to remove any ambiguity about the land we seek to conserve, enhance and promote, as outlined within the fourth objective of this legislation, making it more explicit than 'countryside' alone\u2014indeed, looking at every form of land, be that mountains, uplands, moorlands, seascapes, semi-urban areas, et cetera. So, through recognising this, we also seek to acknowledge that each category possesses its own unique, distinctive character and, with that, separate necessities that require tailored support and assistance.Speaking to amendment 2, the use of the phrase 'existing' has been chosen to, once again, remove any ambiguity as to what farmers should be seeking to promote\u2014in this instance, public access within land designated for agricultural purposes. I'm sure that the Minister will be familiar with the reservations that some have made with regard to public access, especially should that be land that is home to farm animals. What this amendment seeks to do is secure existing public access and provide landowners with a key objective through which they can seek to enhance existing access. By permitting this, we can seek to alleviate significant barriers to increasing the public's connection with and understanding of the natural environment.&nbsp;Speaking to amendment 3, this has been tabled to strengthen the fourth objective in order to recognise the significance of rural economic viability through the means of protecting farm businesses. By protecting, enhancing and promoting the countryside and landscape, cultural resources and public access, we encompass the wider role of the rural economy, sustaining its viability. This amendment seeks to formally recognise that arrangement and enshrine it on the statute book, in line with the aspiration set out within recommendation 10 of the committee report.&nbsp;And finally, Chair, amendment 4 has been tabled with the purpose of introducing a fifth sustainable land management objective, one that seeks to safeguard rural livelihoods and communities through recognising the importance of sustainable and viable agricultural businesses and the practice of agricultural production to the rural economy. Land management decisions to achieve the biodiversity, climate and sustainable food objectives cannot be divorced from the economic and social needs or influences that farming families and food supply chain businesses experience. Therefore, we are highly unlikely to achieve our aims at the scale and pace required unless we protect and enhance the economic viability of families and communities delivering the outcomes within the sustainable land management objectives. Thank you, Chair.\" said by Samuel Kurtz MS\n\"Thank you. Are there any other members of the committee who wish to speak? If there aren't, then I call on the Minister.&nbsp;\" said by Darren Millar AM\n\"Thank you very much, Chair. I'd just like to begin by thanking Members for their remarks, for their amendments to the Bill and for this opportunity to set out the Government's position regarding them all. I just want to assure Members that both I and my officials have really considered the amendments in detail. Obviously, I'll respond to each amendment in turn and then also introduce amendment 29, which is tabled in my name.Amendment 57: the first amendment in this group alters the first objective so that contributing to the sustainable production of food and other goods is'to protect or improve the food security of citizens and access to food that promotes good health and wellbeing.\u2019Welsh agriculture has a key role to play as the producer of high-quality food, helping to feed our nation and other nations. Food security and access to food that promotes good health and well-being is, however, much, much wider than that, relating to supply-chain considerations, wages, transport, the availability of shops, benefits, healthcare, housing, et cetera. And of course, most of these lie outside the scope of this agricultural Bill, which is why this amendment cannot be accepted.Amendment 1 and amendment 1A, which is an amendment to the fourth SLM objective: the purpose of amendment 1 and amendment 1A appears to seek to limit the fourth SLM objective to farmers, or active farmers only. The concepts of 'farmer' or 'active farmer' do not appear in the Bill, and none of the SLM objectives refer to these terms. So, it's not the policy intention to limit the fourth SLM objective in this way. Introducing this concept now could have unknown consequences for other parts of the Bill. So, for example, a reference in one place of the Bill to a 'farmer' or an 'active farmer' may imply that other parts of the Bill do not apply to the farmer or active farmer. And this is a possible consequence that I'm sure all Members would wish to avoid.&nbsp;Amendment 43: this is an amendment to the fourth SLM objective to refer specifically to landscapes in the countryside, and I don't think this amendment is necessary, as non-urban landscapes are considered to be captured within the term 'countryside', which is already referenced in the fourth objective.&nbsp;Amendment 2 to the fourth SLM objective would limit scope of public access under that provision to what is existing only. Public access is not static, it changes through the actions of farmers and landowners, and others updating access rights. So, restricting action to existing public access is therefore contrary to the policy intention to promote public access to the countryside and our cultural resources.&nbsp;Amendment 3: as I've just mentioned, none of the SLM objectives refer to farmer or any other beneficiary or actor. So, it's therefore not appropriate to include a reference to protecting their economic viability.Amendment 4: this amendment introduces a new SLM objective that is not required. Having resilient agriculture businesses that contribute to our thriving rural communities and help sustain current and future generations of farmers is important. And the intention of this amendment appears to seek to ensure that the Government, potentially, underwrites rural livelihoods, which is outside of the scope of the Bill, and not appropriate. It would also exclude non-rural communities, where agriculture and ancillary activities may take place. And the proposed Government amendment 29 recognises the importance of agricultural businesses in the communities in which they operate.Amendment 29, I'm very pleased to bring this forward, it is the result of productive discussions with Plaid Cymru, as part of the co-operation agreement. The amendment makes provision about factors relevant to determining whether food and other goods are produced in a sustainable manner for the purposes of the first SLM objective. The amendment is intended to highlight the link between the production of food and other goods in a sustainable way, and the resilience of agricultural businesses within the communities in which they operate. Resilient agricultural businesses are vitally important to Wales, contributing to our thriving rural communities, and sustaining Welsh agricultural land for our future generations. Businesses that are resilient and adaptive are more likely to thrive and survive shocks to the sector, such as those we've seen caused by pandemics, conflicts, supply chain issues and climate change. So, I therefore ask that Members agree my amendment 29, and do not agree amendments 57 and 1A in the name of Luke Fletcher, and amendments 1, 43, 2, 3 and 4 in the name of Sam Kurtz. Diolch.&nbsp;\" said by Lesley Griffiths AM\n\"Thank you, Minister. I call on Luke Fletcher to reply to the debate.&nbsp;\" said by Darren Millar AM\n\"Diolch, Cadeirydd. It's naturally disappointing that the Government won't be supporting our amendments. On amendment 57, I think it's important to note that, with the other sustainable land management objectives having much more of an environmental and social focus, it is vital that the sustainable land management objective has clarity around the food production and food security goals. Chair, I propose that we move to a vote.&nbsp;\" said by Luke Fletcher MS\n\"Thank you. So, the question is that amendment 57 be agreed to. Does any Member object?

{"content": "\"We will move on, then, to item 2, which is our first evidence session on the right to adequate housing, and I'd very much like to welcome our witnesses here this morning: Matthew Dicks, director of the Chartered Institute of Housing Cymru, Ruth Power, who's chief executive officer of Shelter Cymru, and Alicja Zalesinska, chief executive of Tai Pawb. Welcome to you all. Perhaps I might begin with a general question: why does Wales need a right to adequate housing?\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"First of all, thank you very much for having us here today. We very much welcome this inquiry. Our three organisations are all part of a campaign, a partnership, called 'Back the Bill', and we have been working together on campaigning and trying to introduce a right to housing in Wales for the past four years.We started four years ago with a feasibility study by Dr Simon Hoffman of Swansea University, followed by a draft Bill, which I'm sure you'll be familiar with, and, most recently, comprehensive research on the cost-and-benefit analysis of the right to housing.Perhaps I can start by introducing the concept of a right to adequate housing. The right to adequate housing is an internationally recognised human right, and, most recently, that has been enshrined in the UN covenant on social, economic and cultural rights. It basically enshrines the right to access adequate sustainable housing, a home for everyone that is safe, secure and suitable for their needs. The right to housing frameworks and guidance provided by the UN, as well as the legislation, defines elements of what 'adequate housing' means. It defines 'adequate housing' as housing that is affordable, accessible, habitable, secure, with good access to infrastructure and local resources. And we think that it's a potentially transformative legal framework that we could adopt here in Wales. It not only provides a transformative vision of what housing means; that vision is underpinned by a legal framework, which would help us shift the paradigm of how we view housing and hardwire that into our legislation and policy developments in the future.At its core, housing as a human right recognises home as central to human dignity, and that is a very important concept. It is a right for everyone to live in security, peace and dignity. And importantly, a right to housing would help us transform the relationship here between rights holders and the Government, so people who are housed are no longer recipients based on their needs, or charity recipients, as the UN rapporteur put it, but rights holders. We think that that new relationship is potentially transformative to our housing system here in Wales. The right to housing asks Governments to make that housing, good housing, a reality in the shortest possible time, with the Government using the maximum of its available resources. It also enshrines into law meaningful involvement of rights holders, recipients of housing. It asks Government to identify and prioritise those who are most vulnerable. It requires appropriate budgeting and resource allocation that is human rights based, co-operation between different parts of government and, importantly, access to justice, redress and accountability for the delivery of the right to housing. Last, but not least, it's recognised across the world by over 60 countries, so, it's part of legislation or constitutions in those countries, where it has been incorporated into domestic legislation, and it is supported by the Welsh public. A poll conducted by our colleagues in the Chartered Institute of Housing Cymru through YouGov found that 77 per cent of the Welsh public support the legal right to housing. So, that's by way of a short introduction, and perhaps I'll hand over to my colleagues.&nbsp;\" said by Alicja Zalesinska\n\"Thank you very much, Alicja. Ruth.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Yes. So, Alicja has set out, the right to adequate housing is about providing a vision and a legal framework that reflects our moral sense that access to a home is a human right. And I suppose the imperative to act, really, comes from the fact that the status quo is not tolerable. Housing inequalities in Wales are blighting people's lives, they are impacting people's life chances. We know that housing is a really key determinant in terms of people's health, well-being and their life chances and even the length of their life in terms of access to housing.So, we're in a deepening housing emergency in Wales, so the imperative to act is clearly there. Even prior to the cost-of-living crisis, we undertook a YouGov poll at Shelter Cymru and that identified that one in three people in Wales had issues in terms of their housing\u2014facing significant issues, whether that was around the safety of their housing, the affordability of their housing, the fear of loss of their home, and facing discrimination in accessing a home. And that has an impact as well on people's well-being. Our casework speaks of people who are living in very poor and unsafe conditions. We support over 10,000 households each year across Wales. It also speaks of people who are in bed and breakfast, trying to live their lives while sofa surfing and people who are sleeping in cars and people who are sleeping on pavements. So, the imperative to act is very clearly demonstrated in terms of the people who seek our help.&nbsp;The most extreme denial of a right to adequate housing is homelessness. So, there's a continuum, and rough-sleeping is at the furthest extreme, really, of the absence of realisation of that right. The latest Welsh Government figures showed 100-plus people rough-sleeping and over 9,000 people in temporary accommodation. And within that 9,000, we know that 2,700, approximately, of those people were children. So, the impact on people's lives of this continuing bottleneck that is building up in temporary accommodation at the moment, with more people becoming homeless than can be moved on to settled accommodation, is at a significant scale. And our casework would suggest that those figures underestimate the true extent of homelessness, and that not everybody who is in need of help is able to access the help that they require.Beyond that end of the continuum in terms of homelessness, what we also know is that we've got 89,000 people on housing waiting lists, waiting for social housing in Wales, and that really reflects the legacy of long-term underinvestment in social housing and a lack of social housing stock. And that rebalancing of tenure from social housing to having a greater proportion of people now accommodated in the private rented sector, where rents are typically twice as high as they are in the social housing sector\u2014we know that has contributed to increased housing inequalities.&nbsp;So then, looking particularly in the pandemic period onwards at really significant rises in the levels of rents in Wales, outpaced, really, only by the levels of rent rise in London, what we know now about what's happening to both rents and mortgage rates outpacing pay and outpacing benefit rises\u2014what that means is that there are very, very few options for people. So, that stress of homelessness, the impact of overcrowding and people who are having to put their lives on hold, whether that's their family life, their working life, the impact on their education et cetera, that impact is spreading because of the lack of affordable housing options for people in Wales at the moment.So, what we know is that all of these challenges play out in very different ways in different parts of Wales and in different communities. But what they have in common is that they're symptoms of a wider housing emergency, and there simply aren't enough homes for people that are of decent quality that are suitable for their needs and which people can afford.&nbsp;So, beyond that, there are issues around quality as well as access to housing. So, there have been various high-profile tragedies that you'll be aware of in relation to Grenfell, in relation to the case of Awaab Ishak, for example. And they highlight as well that imperative to act in relation to poor housing. The most recent TPAS tenant pulse survey done here in Wales showed that damp and mould are huge issues for social and private rented sector tenants in Wales. Only 40 per cent of tenants who responded to that survey said their home was free from damp and mould, and our case load is showing a rising case load of damp and disrepair cases at present.&nbsp;The Welsh housing conditions survey, last done in 2017-18, showed that 18 per cent of the stock had category 1 housing health and safety rating system hazards. That's really significant. That's defined as poor housing in a report that was jointly produced by the BRE Trust, Welsh Government and Public Health Wales. And that same report identified that investing in addressing those issues of poor housing would result in savings to the NHS of \u00a395 million annually, and therefore would pay for itself within six years.&nbsp;So, in summary, in terms of why we need a right to adequate housing, it's because we can't afford to leave access to such a fundamental human right as housing to people's ability to compete for scarce resources. Legislating for a right to adequate housing would develop the pace that we need and it would overturn the long legacy that we've had of underinvestment that has left people in the position that they find themselves now, unable to afford a good home. And it will develop that long term, system-wide driver and develop and deliver a road map for how we get from where we are now, which is a position where I think it would be hard to find anybody who wouldn't agree that the system is broken, to where we all aspire to be, which is in a Wales where everybody has access to a good home. This is about providing that road map; it's about driving the delivery of that road map.So, it's not just the right thing to do morally as well\u2014that moral case is strong and is widely supported\u2014the cost-benefit analysis that we commissioned, an independent cost-benefit analysis, which I understand you'll hear more about today, shows that it's also good for the public purse, and it helps to deliver on a wide range of priorities that we have here in Wales that really go to the heart of who we are as a nation in terms of social justice, in terms of equalities. There is no social justice without housing justice. So, it's very fundamental, I think, to who we are and what we seek to achieve, but it provides us with the road map and the driver and the long-term thinking, critically, that we need to get us there.&nbsp;\" said by Ruth Power\n\"Thank you very much, Ruth. And Matt.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Only quickly to add, Chair, that it can't be a more pertinent morning to be discussing this, when we consider what the hundreds and thousands of souls across the country who were sleeping in doorways and under railway sidings last night had to put up with in terms of the weather that they're experiencing and the conditions they're experiencing. And at the moment, there is no fundamental legal route for them to challenge that specific environment they find themselves in and why the state isn't providing them with that fundamental human right. So, just to say that, really.\" said by Matt Dicks\n\"Okay. Well, thank you all very much. It's very useful, I think, to have that general introduction, and you've covered quite a lot of ground and we'll be coming back to much of that in questions through this session. Could I just ask\u2014? I guess people will think very much of the private rented sector and registered social landlords when they're thinking about the impact and the applicability of a right, but obviously it would have impacts on private ownership as well. Do you want to say a little bit about that, just to give us a rounded picture?\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Do you want me to start on that? 'Yes' is the simple answer to that, but the whole point is you use the rights-based approach as an umbrella\u2014the rucksack analogy we're using\u2014that you pull all of these bits in together to get to the promised land of a&nbsp;right to adequate housing. And it's not just about housing policy. It's about other policies drawing in from other portfolios, because, at the end of the day, a decent place to call home has an effect on your health, your economic opportunities, your educational attainment. So, it's about providing an adequate housing option in all tenures, but what it will do is rebalance, refocus and push housing up the priority list, pulling all those policy levers in, because we do have a track record of a progressive and ambitious policy around housing: the Renting Homes (Wales) Act 2016, the Housing (Wales) Act 2014. But what this does is make everything look through the prism of a right to adequate housing, so it will invest money and longer, medium term, into where different tenures, we think, need to be developed, in order to balance that housing system.The problem at the moment is we have a lot of imbalance in the housing system in terms of tenure. Fundamentally, there's a lack of supply of social and affordable housing, which means we're having to rely on the PRS more in order to discharge the business of homelessness, but that said, we need the PRS to play a role in addressing the housing crisis and in addressing housing need. But what it fundamentally does is balance the system so that we get to a place where everyone has that test of adequacy in their housing options. Now, for some, that may be social housing; for some, that may be private rented sector; and options around home ownership, et cetera. So, it's about balancing that system, and ultimately that right to an adequate home should apply no matter what tenure you're living in. But in order to get there, it's going to need the will of the polity in order to invest. Legislation alone is not going to develop that, and we'll come onto that in terms of the international evidence. It needs political will as well as the right to adequate housing. But what the right to adequate housing does is it focuses minds, it focuses the policy objectives across all policy areas, cementing housing at the centre of addressing all those social issues that we face.\" said by Matt Dicks\n\"One aspect, of course, of adequate housing is safety, isn't it? You mentioned Grenfell Tower, and there are various blocks of flats and people living there, some of them owning rights to their properties, others not. So, that would be one aspect of its applicability, I guess, wouldn't it? That situation that many find themselves in of just not having safe housing at the moment and not being able to be comfortable in their homes as a result.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"One of the comments that was made by a lawyer at the Grenfell inquiry was that only an enforceable right to adequate housing would have guaranteed the residents the ability to take their concerns to court, have their questions answered and have the dangerous cladding removed. So, it is very specifically identified in that inquiry.\" said by Ruth Power\n\"Tragically, Grenfell is an illustration, I think, of how the housing crisis, the housing emergency, is connected to inequality and social injustice. About 85 per cent of tenants in that building were from ethnic minorities. About 41 per cent of tenants were disabled. I think any inequality in housing drives wider inequalities and vice versa, and here, I think, we could see the most tragic, tragic symptom and illustration of that.\" said by Alicja Zalesinska\n\"Yes, okay. Thank you very much. Could you also tell committee how you would see the right interacting with existing housing legislation in Wales, how it would complement and strengthen the existing legislation?\" said by ", "answer": "John Griffiths AM"}
{"content": "\"So, we'll move on to our first item on the agenda this morning, and that's scrutiny of the Welsh Government's draft budget 2023-24. This is our second evidence session and we're very pleased to be joined this morning by the Minister for Health and Social Care, the Deputy Minister for Social Services, and the Deputy Minister for Mental Health and Well-being. So, as I said, we have Ministers with us\u2014you're very welcome\u2014and we have some officials as well with us who are joining us, who are Albert Heaney, director, social services and chief social care officer for Wales in the Welsh Government; Tracey Breheny, deputy director, mental health and vulnerable groups, Welsh Government; Irfon Rees, director of health and well-being, Welsh Government; Steve Elliot, director of finance, Welsh Government; and Claire Bennett, director, communities and tackling poverty, Welsh Government.So, thank you very much again and I'm sure you'll understand that Members have lots of questions and we've got a lot to get through this morning. So, I'll make a start with some general points. You'll be aware that our predecessor committee consistently called on Welsh Government to present more clearly the draft budget documentation, and how resources for children and young people are being allocated. And we also made that point last year, in our budget scrutiny with you. You'll know that we asked for the written evidence to present clearly the resources relating to children and young people, so that it was clear what was being spent and to understand that value for money is being delivered. To what extent are you confident that we have been given the full picture in the document that's been provided, and is it clear that children are getting their fair share of health and social care funding?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thanks very much for the invitation to come and join you this morning. Before I answer that, if you don't mind, I'll just set a little bit of context for how the health budget works. So, we get about \u00a310 billion\u2014that's about half the Welsh budget\u2014but the majority of that money just goes directly out to health boards. So, about \u00a38 billion of that \u00a310 billion just goes straight out. And what we've done\u2014. Obviously, you'll all be aware that this has been a really tough year financially, that the inflationary pressures are affecting everybody, including organisations like the NHS and social services. So, the real-term increases are very tough this year, so we've had to really, really focus on prioritising. For example, I've made sure that we've got about \u00a3170 million additional for waiting times; well, there are children on those waiting lists, so, obviously, some of that money would go towards them. We've also continued to prioritise mental health; so that's a further \u00a325 million spent on that. And you'll all be aware of the issues surrounding children and mental health, so it's important, I think, to recognise that that's also increased. We've invested a further \u00a310 million in the social care reform fund, and one of the key priorities for us was to make sure that all social care workers are paid the real living wage. So, those are real priorities for us, so that's where they went.Now, just in terms of how it organises, because the majority of the funding goes to the NHS, the way we work in Wales is that we ask the health boards to make decisions on the basis of the needs of their population. So, they have the information that is relevant to them on the ground. You may have a situation where some health boards have different challenges compared to others, so it's important that they do that on a localised basis. And so, I set some priorities and some guidelines for them to follow, and of course they then have to make sure that they deliver for all people, but that includes children and young people. We don't differentiate for children within that; we don't differentiate for disabled people within that either. So, if you start going down that route, the point is that we could go on for a long, long time, and it's complicated enough as it is. So, there are, however, a number of budget areas within our main expenditure group that are specifically targeted at children and young people.As I say, this is a really tough budget year, and that inflation impact is significant. And that's why one of the things I've done this year is to be much, much clearer with the health boards about what they should focus on. So, I've set out six priority areas where they should focus. One is delayed transfers of care\u2014you'll all be aware of what's going on more broadly. Access to primary care: of course, that is absolutely key\u2014that's where most people have contact with the health service. And the intensity of that, and children, let's not forget\u2014. Think about group A streptococcus just before Christmas\u2014the number of contacts, for example, with primary care; in December, there was a week where there were 400,000 contacts in primary care. Think about the scale of that in one week, and of course, a lot of those were children, a lot of those were parents concerned about strep A. So, I think it's really important to get an understanding of that. Urgent care\u2014you've all seen the pressure on hospitals; cancer; mental health; and waiting lists. So, those are the six priorities I've set them.I think the other thing is that we've prioritised, we've protected all the key areas in relation to children. We've prioritised \u00a310 million of new funding to roll out Flying Start and, of course, that's part of the co-operation agreement, which is to try and include a phased expansion of two-year-olds in terms of childcare. And we do monitor everything in terms of our programmes, so I can go into a bit more detail on that. 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales', we all know about the real challenges in relation to childhood obesity. We have a programme for government commitment. All of these are monitored very carefully. So, there are a range of specific children's programmes: Flying Start, the childcare offer, Families First, 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales', children's mental health\u2014that of course includes eating disorders\u2014and then we have this joint approach with education on the whole-school approach. And then, there's a whole range of social care support programmes on top of that. Sorry if I went on a bit long.\" said by Eluned Morgan AM\n\"No, thank you. And I'm sure Members have many questions on some of the topics that you've just touched on as well. Just before we move on, I'd like to welcome Joyce Watson here this morning, who very kindly has come to substitute for a time for Buffy Williams. So, thank you, Joyce, for joining us.We did ask, in our information request before today's session, about the changes between this draft budget 2023-24 with both the draft budget 2022-23 and the first supplementary budget in June 2022. We did ask for indicative 2024-25 allocations. Perhaps you could explain why that wasn't clear in the briefing that we had from you.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"So, I think it's really useful to be able to compare one year with the next. So, there are situations where obviously you make in-year adjustments, and sometimes it's good just to get a picture of what's happening at the end of the year. Because we're getting into technical areas, if you don't mind, I'm going to ask Steve Elliot to explain this to you.\" said by Eluned Morgan AM\n\"Yes. Thank you, Minister. So, I think in the evidence paper, we have shown, for each of the key BELs, the budget expenditure lines, relevant, the movement between last year's budget and the draft budget in terms of the final budget. We haven't shown the movements specifically in-year in terms of supplementary budgets, but by definition, they're part of that movement, and I think there's a degree of explanation there. Also in the annex, we have shown the 2024-25 budget movements as well. So, we've aimed to try and cover it in total, so hopefully it is all in there.\" said by Steve Elliot\n\"Just for us to be able to scrutinise, it's good for us to be able to see that as clearly as possible. Your paper says that none of the budget areas reduced in the health and social services MEG relate to children and early-years policy. Can you explain the evidence for that, and are you comparing allocations with the final budget 2022-23, or the indicative allocations for 2024-25, or other figures?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"So, I think it's really important to\u2014. What we tend to do in these sessions is to focus on where the new money's coming from, but actually, when you're under massive pressure, like we are at the moment, where you're seeing real-term cuts as a result of inflation, I think it's really important to look at where we've managed to maintain the budget. Because, actually, we have had to make really tough decisions across Government this year in terms of maintaining what we already had in place. So, what we haven't done is to reduce funding in relation to children and young people's budgets, and it's really important to remember that we were all asked, across Government, to reprioritise funding across the whole group. So, we have had to do that within health as well, but we have maintained that expenditure in relation to children and young people. And you've seen that we've prioritised \u00a310 million to increase funding for Flying Start, as well as that increase in funding for mental health. So, I don't know if there's anything else, Steve, you'd like to come in on again on the more technical side.\" said by Eluned Morgan AM\n\"No. I mean, just to reiterate that the Minister's chosen to protect the children's budget areas when we had to go through this reprioritisation exercise and, as the Minister says, we've invested another \u00a310 million in Flying Start. So, there have been no cuts to the budget areas in that sense.\" said by Steve Elliot\n\"Is it possible to provide some further specific written information on that, just detailing that in terms of the specific areas that you\u2019ve just mentioned about none of the budget areas being reduced?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"That was set out in the budget documentation, the areas where we have reduced budgets. It's in the Welsh Government\u2019s draft budget narrative, not the evidence paper.\" said by Steve Elliot\n\"In other words, everything is kept, unless we\u2019ve said that it\u2019s been cut. It\u2019s easier to see where the cuts are rather than\u2014. It\u2019s the same thing as\u2014\" said by Eluned Morgan AM\n\"Just to clarify, are you comparing the allocation of the final budget for 2022-23 or the indicative allocation for 2024-25, or different figures?\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"We\u2019re focused here on 2023-24 rather than 2024-25.\" said by Eluned Morgan AM\n\"Right. Thank you. Thanks for that, Minister. We\u2019ll move on, then, to some questions from Sioned Williams.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thank you, Chair. Given inflationary pressures\u2014and we know today that it is coming down, but it hasn't come down by much, and things like food prices are still high\u2014and that there's no increase in allocations for children, how can you assure us that you can deliver your planned outcomes for children, given that you have assessed that families with children are more likely to be affected than those without as a result of this cost-of-living crisis?\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"Thank you. We have had to make difficult decisions, and we've had to do that across Government. Just to give you an example, we've had a bill this year for \u00a3207 million just for energy costs in our hospitals and so on in the health service, and we weren't expecting that. So, just to give you the context of that: \u00a3207 million, and we only had \u00a3170 million to clear the backlog in terms of waiting lists. So, we've had to find more money within the current budget that we had this year. We've had some funding from the UK Government, but next year, we're not sure whether additional funding will come forward. So, that inflationary pressure is going to have an impact on everyone.&nbsp;What we've tried to do is to maintain the focus on the front-line services to ensure that we do safeguard health services, mental health services and so on. What we are trying to do is also to provide a greater focus on things such as Flying Start. So, there's additional funding there, where we know that the pressures will be felt most by the poorest families. What you've seen is that Flying Start has increased. We've seen an increase in the childcare offer. We've seen an increase in the offer to parents in terms of those who can access childcare\u2014those who are in education and training. And, we have also increased how much we are paying in terms of the childcare offer. So, that is happening, but, clearly, it is a difficult time. We've seen a cut in terms of capital, for example, and that was a problem for us.&nbsp;But I do think it is important\u2014. The funding to help children doesn't only come from this funding pot. So, if you look at free school meals, for example, that comes from another budgetary pot that is clearly a help to children. The discretionary assistance fund, that's seen an increase too, and that targets specific people, those poorest people, and 50 per cent of those people have children too. Nine million pounds in addition has come from the education department for the pupil development grant too. So, there has been an increase not just in our budget, but in other parts of Government.\" said by Eluned Morgan AM\n\"Of course, we are talking here about your budget and the emphasis that has been put across the departments on these priorities to deal with the cost-of-living crisis. Of course, we know, as I mentioned, that children and families with children are amongst those worst affected. It comes back to the issue around having a children's rights impact assessment. The Observatory on Human Rights of Children and the children's legal centre have historically said that Ministers have failed to implement their own policy and the duty that is on the Government, as is set out in the children's rights scheme, and apply a comprehensive children's rights impact assessment to the draft budget. Both of these organisations and this committee have consistently called for the Welsh Government to publish a detailed children's rights impact assessment on the draft budget. So, what's your reason for the fact there's such a big difference of opinion on the importance of this? You did say in your previous answer that the health budget does not consider the needs of children specifically, but there are so many bodies, and the duty, I would say, that say that you do have to do that, especially in the context of this cost-of-living crisis.\" said by Sioned Williams MS\n\"I'll ask Julie to come in in a moment, but just a few points in terms of where we have directly looked to help. There's the Healthy Start scheme within our budget\u2014\u00a36.9 million there\u2014which helps those younger children who come from poorer families, to buy fruit and so on. We have the NHS low-income scheme, and that helps with, for example, the cost of dentistry and so on, glasses, contact lenses, travelling to and from hospital. And then there's Designed to Smile\u2014that's a direct programme to help children with regard to health. But if I can ask Julie Morgan to focus on the children's rights side of things.&nbsp;\" said by Eluned Morgan AM\n\"Thank you very much, Sioned, for that question. I'm aware that this committee has consistently put this question forward. We continue to believe that we need an integrated approach to impact assessments that enables us to better understand the impact of spending decisions\u2014the intersectional and the unintended impacts of spending\u2014to maximise the impact of available funding. This has been a view that has been taken for some time, and I know that the successive committees have challenged this. But what we think is that it's very important that a decision is not made in isolation about children, that we need to look at all the intersectionalities. We do think that an integrated approach to impact assessments is the best way of going forward, but we have worked with the budget improvement impact advisory group to explore how we undertake our strategic integrated impact assessment, and a sub-group was established, and a shared plan of work is being developed with some changes implemented that were published in December 2022. We are committed to continually reviewing our approach on this issue, and I think we'd be very happy to explore how we can better reflect children's rights as part of this work. So, we are open to discussion, but the belief is that an integrated approach is more effective. Recently, we've been able to give a briefing to the children's commissioner, which is very important, and we did wonder if the committee would like a technical briefing as well on the integrated impact assessment.\" said by Julie Morgan AM\n\"That would be very welcome. Thank you, Deputy Minister. Sioned.\" said by Jayne Bryant AM\n\"Thanks, Chair. One more specific question regarding allocations. Your paper refers to an allocation of \u00a3171 million for the children and communities grant. Could you clarify exactly what this comprises, since it appears that not all of the \u00a3174.3 million transferred from the local government and finance main expenditure group has been included in the budget line for the children and communities grant in the health and social services main expenditure group? And I'd just like to ask a question specifically about Flying Start and that \u00a310 million\u2014it isn't clear from the answers that we've had so far. There has been a reference to additional funding, but it's not clear whether this is new funding. It has come, it appears, within the health budget.&nbsp;\" said by ", "answer": "Sioned Williams MS"}
{"content": "\"So, I move to item 2. Item 2 is in regards to our\u2014this is our fifth evidence session\u2014inquiry on gynaecological cancers, and this morning we're hearing from representatives from Public Health Wales. So, I'd be very grateful if you could, first of all, just introduce yourselves for the public record.&nbsp;\" said by Russell George AM\n\"My name is Fu-Meng Khaw. I'm the national director for health protection and screening services at Public Health Wales.&nbsp;\" said by Professor Fu-Meng Khaw\n\"Thank you.&nbsp;\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Bore da. My name is Sharon Hillier. I'm the director of the screening division. I'm responsible for Cervical Screening Wales.&nbsp;\" said by Dr Sharon Hillier\n\"Lovely. Well, thank you ever so much, both, for being with us this morning. I know that, previously, Public Health Wales has supported NHS-led awareness campaigns for cancer symptoms. I just want to gauge from you how successful you think those campaigns have been, and any evidence that cancer has been diagnosed earlier as a result of some of those public campaigns.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"So, if I make a start, and then I'll bring Sharon in as well. We recognise that, clearly, raising awareness about symptoms of cancer is an important part of our prevention of cancer, because we know that early presentation improves the prognosis and outcomes. So, we support where we have the expertise, and our key expertise is around cervical cancer screening programmes, and Sharon will talk through some of that detail. In terms of raising awareness campaigns, sometimes we target both public and professionals. The sustainability of the public messaging can sometimes be limited in terms of the short-term impacts on raising presentation of cancer symptoms to healthcare. For a more sustainable impact, we need continued awareness-raising campaigns. So, I think this is something about reiterating the importance of persistent messaging for the public. And we do that by general public awareness-raising campaigns, and also working with third sector and other public sector organisations to support that messaging.In terms of professionals, clearly, there's also a role there, because some of the symptoms that people present with are quite non-specific to a particular cancer. So, it's really important that it's seen as part of a suite of diagnostic tools to raise awareness amongst professionals, so that they can make the right diagnoses, or at least think and consider cancer as a potential differential diagnosis when a patient presents with those symptoms. So, I think raising awareness amongst professionals is something that's also important and we would support where we can. So, I'm going to ask Sharon maybe to talk in a little bit more detail about cervical cancer.\" said by Professor Fu-Meng Khaw\n\"Public Health Wales is responsible for delivering Cervical Screening Wales. So, that's about reducing the incidence of cervical cancer in our population in Wales. And the campaign work that we've done around that is, probably, the two campaigns that we've run. So, back in 2019, we led a campaign about #LoveYourCervix, and this was really to address barriers around embarrassment, or empowering women to consider taking up the offer of cervical screening, because we know that some of the barriers were embarrassment or lack of awareness. So, that was a campaign that we ran through social media, and we used really open language and inclusive language, in quite innovative ways. And also, as well as the health professionals and us raising awareness with women, we also used the third sector, but real sector\u2014health professionals and also beauty professionals. They were very helpful in talking with women and raising the issues around cervical cancer. So, we could really empower women to love their cervix and really value their bodies, and then turn up and take up that offer. So, that was one aspect of the campaigns, but also it's about that consistency of messaging as well, with clarity.And then, back in 2022, actually as a result of communicating with women about a change in Cervical Screening Wales, we ran a campaign around that messaging, around HPV primary screening, to build the trust, but also to explain the messaging around the cervical screening programme, so people were aware\u2014very clear, consistent messaging, again, through social media, using work with a media campaign to get that message across around the cervical screening and the method and the testing that was undertaken. It's very difficult to put a causal link from a campaign to an early diagnosis, but, actually, it's about that understanding and that consistency of messaging so we're all saying the same thing. And we work very closely with our third sector colleagues around that too.\" said by Dr Sharon Hillier\n\"Thank you. And I should thank you also, both, for your substantial written evidence, which is very helpful to us also. I notice in your evidence you said,'It is very unlikely, based on the current available evidence',that a specific awareness raising campaign focused on gynaecological cancers would help or be effective. So, I suppose, it's just to expand a little bit further on that, and just to ask what you recommend is the most appropriate action, I suppose, to encourage women to be aware of changes in their body.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"I think we recognise this as a complex intervention, that multiple interventions work together to achieve the impact that we want, which is for early detection of cancer to improve outcomes. We must remind ourselves of the reason why we're doing this. I think this is about acknowledging that a single campaign is not going to be as effective as multiple ongoing, recurrent campaigns. Obviously, the cohort of people who are approaching the high-risk areas, and we know that cancer risk increases with age\u2014. As the cohorts come through, there will be a cohort effect about who listens to the messages that we're putting out there. So, without a recurrent awareness-raising campaign, then we're only impacting on a selected cohort, so I think a continued campaign to both public and professionals is what we need.&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Professor Fu-Meng Khaw\n\"And just to ask about any campaigning that you might think of running, in terms of ovarian cancer symptoms as well\u2014.&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Russell George AM\n\"In terms of ovarian cancer, we don't currently have a screening programme for ovarian cancer, so that doesn't fall within the remit of our screening programmes. Now, we work closely with NHS Wales as a whole to improve awareness of symptoms, but we rely on clinicians, and we don't have the expertise within our organisation to do it on our own, so we would work in collaboration with our partners.&nbsp;\" said by Professor Fu-Meng Khaw\n\"Thank you. Rhun, you wanted to come in.&nbsp; &nbsp;\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Yes. With your permission, Chair, I think it might be an idea to bring the couple of questions that I wanted to ask forward to here, because they follow on directly from what we've heard already. On consistency of messaging, first of all, if you're looking at questions that people might ask, or the knowledge or lack of knowledge that people might have around the impact of HRT on the likelihood of developing cancers, the impact of the contraceptive pill and lengthy use of the contraceptive pill on the likelihood of developing cancer, what work is being done on ensuring that there's real consistency and understanding on those kinds of messages?&nbsp;\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"I think consistency of messaging is clearly important, and there are websites that will be trusted websites, and NHS Wales will have some information that is checked with professionals to ensure that they are accurate and consistent. Now, Public Health Wales doesn't have a key role in some of the public messaging around cancer symptoms, and, again, we would be happy to advise where we can. Our key focus around gynaecological cancers is on cervical cancer because we do provide a cervical cancer screening programme.\" said by Professor Fu-Meng Khaw\n\"Your question is about drug treatment, basically, isn't it\u2014your individual choice. I think individuals need to consider that for themselves, because there's always a risk and benefit of any HRT or the oral contraceptive. It is a balance of risk and benefit for the person. So, I think that's an individual aspect of a\u2014&nbsp;\" said by Dr Sharon Hillier\n\"But the individual can't make the choice unless the messaging, the information that they're given, is clear enough, is laid out clearly enough in front of them, and my question is is that messaging clear enough. There might be something with some small print that's handed to somebody with some treatment or with contraception, but unless that's discussed, unless the risks are weighed up, then that's not going to be effective. What's being done to make sure that that messaging is clear?&nbsp;\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"Again, it's that information and that informed choice, isn't it, because the person\u2014. So, for example, with HRT, they'll be balancing\u2014it's not just gynaecological cancers; it will be breast cancer as well\u2014and they're balancing the risk of that for them, which actually the information is at population level, compared to actually what their symptoms are like, and it is, actually, difficult to\u2014. It is an informed discussion with their GP around that.\" said by Dr Sharon Hillier\n\"I'll ask the question in a different way. Do we need to be messaging better so that people can make that informed choice in a more informed way?&nbsp;\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"Of course. This is the general issue isn't it,&nbsp;about how people make individual choices, so that they know the risks of undertaking a procedure or whatever, and sometimes, it's subject to a consent, and the consent requires people to be given the necessary information, and that, particularly, is around surgical procedures, but for other things, like taking tablets, often, there is no informed consent, but the consent is taken as read when someone takes that tablet. How we then improve the clinical consultation is something we're not directly involved with, but I agree the system needs to recognise the importance of the consultations that lead to that choice being taken. So, in terms of HRT, its impact, its prevention or its risks, those need to be included in the clinical consultation with a healthcare professional.\" said by Professor Fu-Meng Khaw\n\"Okay, thank you.\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"Thank you. Gareth, you want to come in briefly, then I'll come to Jack for his questions. Gareth.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Thanks, Chair. I just wanted to pick up again on the messaging and how far you believe that that resonates through all facets of society, because, obviously, we've got areas of\u2014I look at my own constituency, and we've got areas of deprivation. Do we think that message comes across all of society, and is that message then embedded within local authorities, third sectors, in order to encourage women of those backgrounds to have an equal footing with everybody else, if you like?\" said by Gareth Davies MS\n\"We know there are many populations that are not served well, and they're not served well because we don't make enough efforts to reach out to them in the ways that they are more receptive to. So, it may be that digital methods might be better for certain parts of the population. And I think, if I answer it generically, rather than specifically, our first point of action is to understand how people might receive messages best, and also understand their appetite for change as well, because there's a whole change theory about it. I think working with people who know communities the best, either the community representative, third sector representatives, local authorities, to then come up with a solution about specific populations, but \u2014\" said by Professor Fu-Meng Khaw\n\"So, is that to suggest then that socioeconomic factors can be a barrier to getting diagnosis and early treatment, then?\" said by Gareth Davies MS\n\"Yes.\" said by Professor Fu-Meng Khaw\n\"Yes.\" said by Gareth Davies MS\n\"You're absolutely right.\" said by Professor Fu-Meng Khaw\n\"Okay.\" said by Gareth Davies MS\n\"Thank you. Jack Sargeant.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Diolch, Cadeirydd. Good morning, both. My hay fever's terrible, so I apologise in advance if that causes any difficulties this morning. Professor Meng Khaw, you said in response to one of the opening questions from the Chair that the risk increases when we age in terms of cancer. Public Health Wales were involved in a study that has also reported this in terms of gynaecological cancers. How do we reduce that risk?\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"So, risk factors are either modifiable, or unmodifiable. Age, unfortunately, is not a modifiable risk. But there are things that we can do during that journey to reduce the risk, so the three key risks leading to some gynaecological cancers are HPV infection, that's a human papillomavirus infection, smoking and obesity. So, by taking action against the three, and we know for cervical cancer screening, 99.8 per cent of cervical cancers are attributable to HPV infection, so taking action by detecting the presence of HPV infection then allows us to be more confident to take preventive measures to reduce the progression of cancer in those women.\" said by Professor Fu-Meng Khaw\n\"Okay, thank you for that. I'll pick up the two other points, perhaps\u2014smoking and obesity. Firstly, smoking, I think it's approximately 21 per cent of cases of cervical cancer every year in Wales. Can you enlighten the committee about how robust that evidence base is?\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"So, our Welsh cancer intelligence surveillance unit collects data on cancer and collects data on risk factors as well, and from their statistics, we are able to ascertain what the contributory factors are to cancers, and that's how that was derived.\" said by Professor Fu-Meng Khaw\n\"Thank you. And just one final question from me, Chair, and as I alluded to, it will be on obesity and overweight. I think the figures I have are that 7 per cent of cases of ovarian cancer could come from being obese or overweight and around 34 per cent of endometrial cancers in Wales. However, there is no reference to the increased risk of endometrial cancer from being overweight or obese in the 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' delivery plan. Would you like to see that in that plan?\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"I think the 'Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales' plan has been around for a few years now with targets to achieve improvements in the obesogenic environment strategic leadership by 2030, and I think with any of these long-term plans, the evidence changes and I think we need to move with that evidence and perhaps a refresh of our thinking might be helpful.\" said by Professor Fu-Meng Khaw\n\"So, a refreshed plan with a specific link to endometrial cancer.&nbsp;\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"I think the specificity depends on the nature of the plan. If you made a specific case for endometrial cancer, it might look a bit out of proportion with all the other things that we know obesity is a risk factor for.\" said by Professor Fu-Meng Khaw\n\"Okay.\" said by Jack Sargeant AM\n\"Rhun, you wanted to come in.\" said by Russell George AM\n\"Yes, with a question, if I could, which sort of ties up the earlier points we were talking about about the role of primary care and the preventative agenda and lifestyle factors that Jack was referring to. What work are you doing to help primary care do that vital work with women to promote healthier lifestyles, so that different choices can be made earlier in life, hopefully, and the chances of detecting cancer early is improved and avoiding it at all is improved?\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"Yes. So, working with our professionals is an important part of our daily work, and we work as part of a wider healthcare system, recognising that no one organisation, no one profession, can do everything that\u2019s necessary. So, around the healthy weight agenda, the work stream around leadership and enabling change brings us into that space of engaging with our stakeholders. And we clearly have directors of public health in health board areas who will be the local leaders and champions, and health boards deliver primary care. So, I think there will be local work ongoing as well, and we will advise and contribute where we are going to be adding value.&nbsp;\" said by Professor Fu-Meng Khaw\n\"What are the key work streams that you have to try to ensure that cancer prevention is improved and the work that primary care does in cancer prevention is improved?\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"So, I think our key work stream is in the cervical cancer screening programme, because we do deliver it, and Sharon will have some of the details about what we do with primary care.\" said by Professor Fu-Meng Khaw\n\"Yes. So, the aim of cervical screening is actually to prevent cervical cancer; it\u2019s a primary prevention, and primary care deliver that. So, we are responsible for sending the invitations out, and women will attend to have their cervical screening\u2014at primary care, mostly, some in sexual health\u2014and then, we analyse it in the laboratory, and then we refer to colposcopy, with the aim of\u2014\" said by Dr Sharon Hillier\n\"Can I just stop you there for a second, because I know the next block of questions are going to be around screening?\" said by Rhun ap Iorwerth AM\n\"Yes, that\u2019s fine.\" said by Dr Sharon Hillier\n\"If we can just come back to the messaging and the prevention, how do you try to make sure that the conversations take place in primary care between an advanced nurse practitioner, or a general practitioner and their patients, to try to make sure that the chance of developing cervical cancer is limited?\" said by ", "answer": "Rhun ap Iorwerth AM"}
{"content": "\"Let's move swiftly on to item 2 on our agenda today, which is our first evidence session with regard to the committee's work on diversity in local government. I'm very pleased to welcome our witnesses today. Joining us here at the Senedd are Councillor Lis Burnett, leader of Vale of Glamorgan Council; Councillor Nia Wyn Jeffreys, deputy leader of Gwynedd Council; and Joseph Lewis, improvement officer with the Welsh Local Government Association. And joining us virtually is Paul Egan, deputy chief officer of One Voice Wales. Welcome to you all. Thank you for coming to give evidence to committee today.Let me begin by just asking one or two questions to get us under way in terms of an overview, and firstly, whether you think there is sufficient progress in improving diversity of candidates and elected councillors in Wales. Who would like to begin?\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"If I start, I think it's fair to say it's still a mixed bag. I speak as one of only four women leaders in Wales\u2014that's gone backwards\u2014and as the leader of one of only two gender-balanced councils in Wales. I have to tip my hat to Monmouthshire, because they are gender balanced right across all their groups. We're gender balanced because some groups have overachieved, so to speak, and we've still got a way to go in terms of all groups within the council, and having a gender-balanced cabinet as well, and representation on scrutiny chairs. But I think that, at the moment, there is still a balance. It's not accepted that there is an expectation of diversity in representation, and I think there's still a way to go.\" said by Lis Burnett\n\"Thank you, Lis. Does anybody else want to add anything to that? Paul.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"We had a team meeting recently\u2014our offices cover the whole of Wales\u2014and generally, it was felt that there'd been very little impact on diversity in our sector. Anecdotally, though, we do a lot of training courses, and the number attending our training courses since the elections last year has rocketed upwards, and what the trainers have noticed is far for more females attending the training. It may be that they weren't elected; they may well have been co-opted. So, I think, anecdotally, we have seen more women in councils throughout Wales. But on the impact on numbers from ethnic minority backgrounds, I think there's been little, if any, impact whatsoever. I do know of three ethnic minority councillors who've held leading positions of chairs over the past few years. Probably, you wouldn't have seen that 10 years ago. So, there has been some impact, but generally speaking, our team felt that there was little impact.&nbsp;\" said by Paul Egan\n\"Thank you, Paul. Nia&nbsp;or Joseph, anything to add?\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"I think, for us, there's something\u2014and I think we may come on to this a bit later\u2014around the evidence base of where we are, and how we understand what the current diversity of councillors is, just generally across the board. We conducted a desk-based review to have a sense of what the picture looked like across the piece, and I think, while you possibly could argue that some progress is being made in greater diversity across gender, it's much harder to make an assessment of what that picture of diversity looks like across other protected characteristics, because the evidence base is quite low, and we are reliant on a lot of anecdotal evidence and experiences, which could be improved.&nbsp;\" said by Joseph Lewis\n\"When did you do that exercise, Joseph?\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"I wasn't a part of the exercise myself, but that would have been just after the elections\u2014so, having a look at what the gender make-up of each council was, and what the cabinet looks like, and the leadership. Lis already referred to a decrease in the number of leaders, for example.&nbsp;\" said by Joseph Lewis\n\"Do we know about that survey, Osian, do you know?\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"I'm not sure.&nbsp;\" said by Osian Bowyer\n\"Perhaps you could provide us with more details of that, if you would, Joseph.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Yes, absolutely.&nbsp;\" said by Joseph Lewis\n\"That would be good. Joseph, also, ahead of the last elections in 2022, there was an exercise, wasn't there, of bringing councillors together and looking at these issues, and it was decided that councils could make diversity declarations. The WLGA<u>&nbsp;</u>established a new Be a Councillor website, and a new councillors guide website, 'Be a Councillor. Be the Change.' Have you yet made any assessment or evaluation of the impact and the effect of those initiatives?\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Not a formal assessment of how impactful those changes have been. I think that the work that we do around how we encourage and how we engage with potential councillors, the stall that we set out for potential councillors, is an ongoing process. We haven't conducted a full review of what that looks like yet, but it's something that we'll look to do at some point over the next cycle.&nbsp;\" said by Joseph Lewis\n\"Right. There's nothing more you can tell us at this stage.&nbsp;\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"There's nothing specific, no. Again, it's more the feedback and engagement that we have with local authorities that would support that feedback that we get.&nbsp;\" said by Joseph Lewis\n\"Okay. In terms of the current electoral system, do any of you have any views as to whether that's helpful, or whether it hinders in terms of diversity, and whether a different electoral system would be better in achieving or helping to achieve greater diversity?\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Do you want me to start off? It's a tricky one, in that, where selections are already more representative of their own communities, you actually find\u2014. I did a bit of work on the percentage of candidates by gender, and then the percentage of members by gender for each political group within the Vale. And, actually, what that shows is that, percentage wise, there are more women being elected than are selected as candidates. So, you can have a situation with one party where there were only 17 per cent of candidates but 23 per cent of the councillors that were then elected in that party are women. So, in all parties, women held their ground. So, it's not an issue with people being elected, it's an issue with people being available to be elected beforehand. When you've got parties that are 83 per cent male candidates, then you're not going to get gender balance, are you?In terms of proportional representation, I'm fairly relaxed about that. The last three occasions we've led the council, we've been in coalition. It's nothing new. Working collaboratively is constructive and it also is something that works well in terms of supporting a diverse representation within local government. Whether PR is going to be a stepping stone to that, I don't know, but I think that there are benefits, and certainly creating that expectation of a wider range of representation, because at the moment we tend to talk an awful about gender, but, actually, it goes right across the piste. Our youngest councillor at the election was 18 years and four months, and he's now a scrutiny vice-chair. There is no reason why we cannot have diverse councils, but the structures would be helpful.\" said by Lis Burnett\n\"Would anybody like to add anything to that? Nia.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"I would agree with Lis's comments, really. Things, obviously, can be improved, but we have seen change, for example, with the balance of men and women in Gwynedd. We had 20 per cent of councillors who were women in the previous session and, now, we've moved to about 36 per cent. Of course, we want to aim to 50 percent, don't we? But I think, as Lis was saying, that didn't happen by accident or because of goodwill. It took a lot of effort, working with the WLGA, working with Gwynedd Council, and across parties, and going out and nurturing women and bringing them forward. Because people in these groups that are underrepresented aren't just going to see a tweet and then decide to be a councillor. It's a long process of bringing them forward and showing them what could be done. So, it takes a lot of work, I think, and I think we're seeing success in this area with women, but I am concerned about diversity regarding LGBTQ people, ethnic groups, and other groups.&nbsp;But as you were saying too, John\u2014. I've been involved in politics now for so long\u2014I've been on mentoring sessions, I've had training, I've been on this, that and the other. What's really going to create this change that we all want, and I think\u2014. Perhaps it's time to have structural change, for example changing the voting system. There's been talk about quotas and so forth, but I think we've been\u2014. Certainly, I have, and I know others around the table have, been talking around these issues for so long, if we really want to see a shift, then perhaps we need to be braver and introduce these most structural changes.\" said by Nia Wyn Jeffreys\n\"Nia, just in terms of the current electoral system and now that local authorities in Wales have the ability to introduce a different system, if they wish to, do you see any prospect of that? Is that a possibility in your authority, or any others around you, do you know?\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"I think, as I've just said, that you would have to be very brave to be the only council in Wales to take this step forward to STV. I have to say that I am supportive of that system, but I would much prefer it that every council in the country move to that system. It is a problem that councils have to choose, and I think it would be confusing for the electorate. The conversation is a live one across local government currently, and certainly in Gwynedd, so the discussion is definitely going ahead.\" said by Nia Wyn Jeffreys\n\"Diolch yn fawr. Sam.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Can I just question that? Thank you for those comments. I'm just wondering where the evidence is that shows that there'd be more women, or maybe more diversity in democracy, if STV was in place. Because we know in Scotland, they've had STV since 2001, and they have 35 per cent of their councillors as women; in Wales, it's 34 per cent. So, there's a 1 per cent difference, even though Scotland have had STV for over 20 years now. I was wondering where the evidence shows that having STV in place might improve that diversity.\" said by Sam Rowlands MS\n\"There was a good example from you, Lis, wasn't there, that, if there are wards that are multimember, we could ensure that there's one man and one woman being selected as candidates. So, I do think that the multimember ward issue makes that easier than just having a system that's first-past-the-post, where you have one winner and then a group of people as runners-up. I think those things are more possible, if I've understood it correctly.\" said by Nia Wyn Jeffreys\n\"Diolch yn fawr, Nia. Lis, yes.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"I don't know if you wanted me to clarify on that: this is more of a political thing, where\u2014. As Nia said, I think we started working on achieving balance in about 2006 or 2007, in a run-up to the 2008 elections, so these things don't happen quickly, if you're trying to do it without structural change. And we took the discussion that our target was 50 per cent; we were at 19 per cent at the time, and in that, it became that, in any two-member ward, it had to be at least one woman and, in any ward above that, if it was an odd number, if it was a three-member ward, then, actually, there was an expectation that it would be two women and a man, to get some degree of balance there. And that's what's worked since 2012; we have been balanced as a Labour group.The expectation within the group is that we will be diverse, and I think that, through proportional representation, there is a potential to put those sorts of mechanisms into place, which then would cover all representation, not just the political groups that are currently operating along those sorts of systems. So, I think that's what we've been talking about previously, to say, 'Well, what are the structural mechanisms that should be in place to achieve that?' And it could be that, if, for PR, you create a larger ward, it's multimember&nbsp;and you are able, then, to look at how diversity would work in that respect.\" said by Lis Burnett\n\"Yes. And it could be a structural requirement\u2014a requirement for all those parties putting forward candidates.\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Yes. Because I think, going back to your earlier comment about signing up to a diversity declaration, that's all very well and good, because then we went, 'Yes, that's a good idea, we'll sign this', but not everybody necessarily worked to those. So, it's a good show of commitment, but that wasn't a structural change, was it?&nbsp;&nbsp;\" said by Lis Burnett\n\"No. Mabon.&nbsp;\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"Thank you for coming here this morning and for your answers. Could I just ask on the back of what you have said, Nia and Lis more than the other two, in your personal view rather than professional view, why is there under-representation in terms of women, people from ethnic minorities, people with disabilities? Why does that exist, in your opinion?&nbsp;\" said by Mabon ap Gwynfor MS\n\"Well, that's a good one. I don't think\u2014and I don't want to draw on this, but you cannot walk away from the impact that the abuse received by political representatives has on people who are looking to get involved. In reality for most backbench councillors, it wouldn't be a huge problem, but as soon as you put your head above the parapet, it will be. Yesterday, actually, I just ran a quick Twitter poll to ask 'why would you not\u2014' you know, 'what would stop you being a councillor?' Sixty per cent said the abuse, and whether it is or whether it's a perception, it is real, and it takes a lot of getting used to. It is really quite hard at times. I've got a whole catalogue of screen grabs. One day, I'll be able to take action\u2014maybe when laws change. But it is really difficult, particularly when it's targeted.&nbsp;We've had instances this year where a Member of the Senedd has used clips of our scrutiny committees to attack two female councillors. That's not acceptable, is it? Other local authority leaders actually said to me that there ought to be something that can be done, and again, from asking in a Twitter poll what should be done and giving the whole range of it, it's that the abuse should be tackled. I can go into details of what we've been doing, which seems to be having an effect, but that, for most people\u2014. If you're from an under-represented group, you are already being very brave to step forward to want to represent your community. Most people go into politics, as we all know, to make a difference, not just to be in a position. And so, it comes very, very hard the first time that they suffer abuse. Of course, people within their political groups get to hear about that; they see it on social media. It's an insidious impact on politics as a whole and on people who are trying to make a difference to their community at grass-roots levels.&nbsp;So, I don't think that we can walk away from that, and I don't think that we can talk about structures and what things we're going to do and what boxes we're going to tick until we actually tackle that issue. Sorry\u2014I got on my soapbox on that.&nbsp; &nbsp;\" said by Lis Burnett\n\"Okay, and Paul. Oh, sorry\u2014Nia.&nbsp;\" said by John Griffiths AM\n\"That's true, every word\u2014I agree. Perhaps you know that one councillor in Gwynedd has had to have alarms placed in the house, because the police had assessed that there was a real danger to her life. It's a very wide spectrum, but it's something that happens on a daily basis and something that councillors have to face, similar to your experience.&nbsp;On the back of that as well, it's difficult\u2014. There is a saying in English, 'You can't be what you can't see', and I think if we don't see people with disabilities on our local councils, if we don't see people from ethnic groups, it's difficult for young people to think that it's something for them, or perhaps something that they could do. So, to be positive, I hope that it will be like a snowball\u2014the more we see people succeeding, it will inspire and encourage others to follow that path. There is value, I think, in highlighting where people have been successful from groups that aren't adequately represented.&nbsp;\" said by Nia Wyn Jeffreys\n\"Diolch, Nia.
